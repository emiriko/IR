We present nucleosynthesis studies based on hydrodynamical simulations of
core-collapse supernovae and their subsequent neutrino-driven winds. Although
the conditions found in these simulations are not suitable for the rapid
neutron capture (r-process) to produce elements heavier than A$\sim$130, this
can be solved by artificially increasing the wind entropy. In this way one can
mimic the general behavior of an ejecta where the r-process occurs. We study
the impact of the long-time dynamical evolution and of the nuclear physics
input on the final abundances and show that different nuclear mass models lead
to significant variations in the abundances. These differences can be linked to
the behavior of nuclear masses far from stability. In addition, we have
analyzed in detail the effect of neutron capture and beta-delayed neutron
emission when matter decays back to stability. In all our studied cases, freeze
out effects are larger than previously estimated and produce substantial
changes in the post freeze out abundances.
