Imaging ultracold atomic gases close to surfaces is an important tool for the
detailed analysis of experiments carried out using atom chips. We describe the
critical factors that need be considered, especially when the imaging beam is
purposely reflected from the surface. In particular we present methods to
measure the atom-surface distance, which is a prerequisite for magnetic field
imaging and studies of atom surface-interactions.
