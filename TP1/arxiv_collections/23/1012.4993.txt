The COMPASS fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS is dedicated to the study
of hadron structure and dynamics. One goal of the physics programme using
hadron beams is the search for new states, in particular the search for
$J^{PC}$ exotic states and glueballs. After a short pilot run in 2004 (190
GeV/c $\pi^{-}$ beam, lead target), we started our hadron spectroscopy
programme in 2008 by collecting unprecedented statistics using 190 GeV/c
negative hadron beams on a liquid hydrogen target. A similar amount of data
with 190 GeV/c positive hadron beams has been taken in 2009, as well as some
data (negative beam) on nuclear targets. As a first result the observation of a
significant $J^{PC}$ spin-exotic signal in the 2004 data -- consistent with the
disputed $\pi_1(1600)$ -- was recently published. Our spectrometer features
good coverage by electromagnetic calorimetry, crucial for the detection of
final states involving $\pi^0$, $\eta$ or $\eta'$, and the 2008/09 data provide
an excellent opportunity for the simultaneous observation of new states in
different decay modes. The diffractively produced $(3\pi)^{-}$ system for
example can be studied in $\pi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ and $\pi^{-}\pi^{0}\pi^{0}$
final states, respectively. Observation of new states in both modes provides
important consistency checks within the same experiment as the reconstruction
of charged and neutral modes rely on completely different parts of the
apparatus. We present the first results and give an overview of the status on
various ongoing analyses of the 2008/09 data.
