The class of omega-regular languages provides a robust specification language
in verification. Every omega-regular condition can be decomposed into a safety
part and a liveness part. The liveness part ensures that something good happens
"eventually". Finitary liveness was proposed by Alur and Henzinger as a
stronger formulation of liveness. It requires that there exists an unknown,
fixed bound b such that something good happens within b transitions. In this
work we consider automata with finitary acceptance conditions defined by
finitary Buchi, parity and Streett languages. We study languages expressible by
such automata: we give their topological complexity and present a
regular-expression characterization. We compare the expressive power of
finitary automata and give optimal algorithms for classical decisions
questions. We show that the finitary languages are Sigma 2-complete; we present
a complete picture of the expressive power of various classes of automata with
finitary and infinitary acceptance conditions; we show that the languages
defined by finitary parity automata exactly characterize the star-free fragment
of omega B-regular languages; and we show that emptiness is NLOGSPACE-complete
and universality as well as language inclusion are PSPACE-complete for finitary
parity and Streett automata.
