Topological invariants in terms of the Green's function in momentum and real
space determine properties of smooth textures within topological media. In
space dimension D=1 the topological invariant N_3 in terms of the Green's
function G(\omega,k_x,x) determines the fermion number of the 1D soliton, while
in space dimension D=3 the topological invariant N_5 in terms of the Green's
function G(\omega,k_x,k_y,k_z,z) determines quantization of Hall conductivity
in the soliton plane within the topological insulators.
