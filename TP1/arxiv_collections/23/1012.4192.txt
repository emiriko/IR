Supernovae are the most energetic stellar events and influence the
interstellar medium by their gasdynamics and energetics. By this, both also
affect the star formation positively and negatively. In this paper, we review
the development of the complexity of investigations aiming at understanding the
interchange between supernovae and their released hot gas with the star-forming
molecular clouds. Commencing from analytical studies the paper advances to
numerical models of supernova feedback from superbubble scales to galaxy
structure. We also discuss parametrizations of star-formation and
supernova-energy transfer efficiencies. Since evolutionary models from the
interstellar medium to galaxies are numerous and apply multiple recipes of
these parameters, only a representative selection of studies can be discussed
here.
