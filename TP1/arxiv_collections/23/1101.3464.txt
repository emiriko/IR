This paper studies how solute segregation and its relationship to grain
boundary energy in binary alloys is captured in the phase field crystal (PFC)
formalism, a continuum method that incorporates atomic scale elasto-plastic
effects on diffusional time scales. Grain boundaries are simulated using two
binary alloy PFC models --- the original binary model by Elder et al (2007) and
the XPFC model by Greenwood et al (2011). In both cases, grain boundary energy
versus misorientation data is shown to be well described by Read-Shockley
theory. The Gibbs Adsorption Theorem is then used to derive a semi-analytic
function describing solute segregation to grain boundaries. This is used to
characterize grain boundary energy versus average alloy concentration and
undercooling below the solidus. We also investigate how size mismatch between
different species and their interaction strength affects segregation to the
grain boundary. Finally, we interpret the implications of our simulations on
material properties related to interface segregation.
