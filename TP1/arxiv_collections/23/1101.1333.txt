We present the results of Suzaku X-ray follow-up observation of
weak-lensing-detected halos in the field around galaxy cluster ZwCl0823.2+0425.
We clearly detected X-ray emission associated with most of these halos and
determined their detailed physical parameters such as X-ray luminosity,
temperature, and metal abundance, for the first time. We find that the X-ray
luminosity - temperature relation for these halos agrees with former typical
results. With mass determined from the weak gravitational lensing data, the
mass-temperature relation for them is also investigated and found to be
consistent with the prediction from a simple self-similar model and results of
the previous studies with both lensing and X-ray data. We would like to
emphasize that the self-similar scaling relation of mass and temperature is
shown here for the first time using a weak-lensing selected sample, whereas
previous studies of the mass scaling relation used X-ray-selected samples of
clusters. Therefore, our study demonstrates importance of X-ray follow-up
observations of shear-selected clusters, and shows that a joint X-ray and
lensing analysis will be crucial for clusters discovered by the forthcoming
weak-lensing surveys, such as the one planned with Subaru/Hyper-Suprime-Cam.
