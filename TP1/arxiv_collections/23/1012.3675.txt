The muon detection system of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider is based on different technologies for muon tracking and
triggering. In particular, the muon system in the endcap disks of the detector
consists of Resistive Plate Chambers for triggering and Cathode Strip Chambers
for tracking. At present, the endcap muon system is only partially instrumented
with the very forward detector region remaining uncovered. In view of a
possible future extension of the muon endcap system, we report on a feasibility
study on the use of Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors, in particular Gas Electron
Multipliers, for both muon triggering and tracking. Results on the construction
and characterization of small tripleGas Electron Multiplier prototype detectors
are presented.
