In this paper we define intersection and union type assignment for Parigot's
calculus lambda-mu. We show that this notion is complete (i.e. closed under
subject-expansion), and show also that it is sound (i.e. closed under
subject-reduction). This implies that this notion of intersection-union type
assignment is suitable to define a semantics.
