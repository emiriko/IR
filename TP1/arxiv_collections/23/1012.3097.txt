Zero-range effective interactions are commonly used in nuclear physics and in
other domains to describe many-body systems within the mean-field model. If
they are used within a beyond-mean-field framework, contributions to the total
energy that display an ultraviolet divergence are found. We propose a general
strategy to regularize this divergence and we illustrate it in the case of the
second-order corrections to the equation of state (EOF) of uniform symmetric
matter. By setting a momentum cutoff $\Lambda$, we show that for every
(physically meaningful) value of $\Lambda$ it is possible to determine a new
interaction such that the EOS with the second-order corrections reproduces the
empirical EOS, with a fit of the same quality as that obtained at the
mean-field level.
