A search for supersymmetry with R-parity conservation in proton-proton
collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is presented. The data
correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35 inverse picobarns collected by the
CMS experiment at the LHC. The search is performed in events with jets and
significant missing transverse energy, characteristic of the decays of heavy,
pair-produced squarks and gluinos. The primary background, from standard model
multijet production, is reduced by several orders of magnitude to a negligible
level by the application of a set of robust kinematic requirements. With this
selection, the data are consistent with the standard model backgrounds, namely
t t-bar, W + jet and Z + jet production, which are estimated from data control
samples. Limits are set on the parameters of the constrained minimal
supersymmetric extension of the standard model. These limits extend those set
previously by experiments at the Tevatron and LEP colliders.
