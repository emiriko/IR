We study the effect of rho^0-gamma mixing in e^+e^- to pi^+pi^- and its
relevance for the comparison of the square modulus of the pion from-factor
|F^(e)_pi|^2, as measured in e^+e^- annihilation experiments, and
|F^(tau)_pi|^2 the corresponding quantity obtained after accounting for known
isospin breaking effects by an isospin rotation from the tau-decay spectra.
After correcting the tau data for the missing rho-gamma mixing contribution,
besides the other known isospin symmetry violating corrections, the pi pi I=1
part of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon g-2 are fully
compatible between tau based and e^+e^- based evaluations. tau data thus
confirm result obtained with e^+e^- data. Our evaluation based on all e^+e^-
data including more recent BaBar and KLOE data yields a_mu^(had)=690.75(4.72) x
10^{-10} (e^+e^- based), while including tau data we find
a_mu^(had)=690.96(4.65) X 10^{-10} (e^+e^-+tau based). This backs the ~3 sigma
deviation between theory and experiment. For the tau di-pion branching fraction
we find B^{CVC}_{pi pi^0}=25.20 \pm0.0.17\pm0.28 from e^+e^-+CVC, while B_{pi
pi^0}=25.34\pm0.0.06\pm0.08 is evaluated directly from the tau spectra.
