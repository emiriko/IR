Given a double quiver, we study homological algebra of twisted quiver sheaves
with the moment map relation using the short exact sequence of Crawley-Boevey,
Holland, Gothen, and King. Then in a certain one-parameter space of the
stability conditions, we obtain a wall-crossing formula for the generalized
Donaldson-Thomas invariants of the abelian category of framed twisted quiver
sheaves on a smooth projective curve. To do so, we closely follow the approach
of Chuang, Diaconescu, and Pan in the ADHM quiver case, which makes use of the
theory of Joyce and Song. The invariants virtually count framed twisted quiver
sheaves with the moment map relation and directly generalize the ADHM
invariants of Diaconescu.
