In this work we present the development of a workflow based on Taverna which
is going to be implemented for calculations in Phylogeny by means of the
MrBayes tool. It has a friendly interface developed with the Gridsphere
framework. The user is able to define the parameters for doing the Bayesian
calculation, determine the model of evolution, check the accuracy of the
results in the intermediate stages as well as do a multiple alignment of the
sequences previously to the final result. To do this, no knowledge from his/her
side about the computational procedure is required.
