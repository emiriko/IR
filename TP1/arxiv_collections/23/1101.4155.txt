Underlying event was originally defined by the CDF collaboration decades ago.
Here we improve the original definition to extend our analysis for events with
multiple-jets. We introduce a definition for surrounding rings/belts and based
on this definition the jet- and surrounding-belt-excluded areas will provide a
good underlying event definition. We inverstigate our definition via the
multiplicity in the defined geometry. In parallel, mean transverse momenta of
these areas also studied in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV LHC
energy.
