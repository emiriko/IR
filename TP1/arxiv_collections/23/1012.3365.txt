We report the results of the first transit timing variation (TTV) analysis of
the very hot Jupiter OGLE-TR-132b, using ten transits collected over a
seven-year period. Our analysis combines three previously published transit
light curves with seven new transits, which were observed between February 2008
and May 2009 with the new MagIC-e2V instrument on the Magellan Telescopes in
Chile. We provide a revised planetary radius of R_p = 1.23+/-0.07 R_J, which is
slightly larger than, but consistent within the errors, of the previously
published results. Analysis of the planet-to-star radius ratio, orbital
separation, inclination and transit duration reveals no apparent variation in
any of those parameters during the time span observed. We also find no sign of
transit timing variations larger than -108+/-49 s, with most residuals very
close to zero. This allows us to place an upper limit of 5-10 M_Earth for a
coplanar, low-eccentricity perturber in either the 2:1 or 3:2 mean-motion
resonance with OGLE-TR-132b. We similarly find that the data are entirely
consistent with a constant orbital period and there is no evidence for orbital
decay within the limits of precision of our data.
