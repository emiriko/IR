The magnetic and entanglement thermal (equilibrium) properties in spin-1/2
Ising-Heisenberg model on a triangulated Kagome lattice are analyzed by means
of variational mean-field like treatment based on Gibbs-Bogoliubov inequality.
Because of the separable character of Ising-type exchange interactions between
the Heisenberg trimers the calculation of quantum entanglement in a
self-consistent field can be performed for each of the trimers individually.
The concurrence in terms of three qubit isotropic Heisenberg model in effective
Ising field is non-zero even in the absence of a magnetic field. The magnetic
and entanglement properties exhibit common (plateau and peak) features
observable via (antferromagnetic) coupling constant and external magnetic
field. The critical temperature for the phase transition and threshold
temperature for concurrence coincide in the case of antiferromagnetic coupling
between qubits. The existence of entangled and disentangled phases in saturated
and frustrated phases is established.
