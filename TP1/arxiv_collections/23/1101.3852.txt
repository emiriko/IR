By exploiting the correlation properties of ultracold atoms in a multi-mode
interferometer, we show how quantum enhanced measurement precision can be
achieved with strong robustness to particle loss. While the potential for
enhanced measurement precision is limited for even moderate loss in two-mode
schemes, multi-mode schemes can be more robust. A ring interferometer for
sensing rotational motion with non-interacting fermionic atoms can realize an
uncertainty scaling of $1/(N\sqrt{\eta})$ for $N$ particles with a fraction
$\eta$ remaining after loss, which undercuts the shot noise limit of two mode
interferometers. A second scheme with strongly-interacting bosons achieves a
comparable measurement precision and improved readout.
