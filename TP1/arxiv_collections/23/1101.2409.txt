We study the properties of error correcting codes for noise models in the
presence of asymmetries and/or correlations by means of the entanglement
fidelity and the code entropy. First, we consider a dephasing Markovian memory
channel and characterize the performance of both a repetition code and an error
avoiding code in terms of the entanglement fidelity. We also consider the
concatenation of such codes and show that it is especially advantageous in the
regime of partial correlations. Finally, we characterize the effectiveness of
the codes and their concatenation by means of the code entropy and find, in
particular, that the effort required for recovering such codes decreases when
the error probability decreases and the memory parameter increases. Second, we
consider both symmetric and asymmetric depolarizing noisy quantum memory
channels and perform quantum error correction via the five qubit stabilizer
code. We characterize this code by means of the entanglement fidelity and the
code entropy as function of the asymmetric error probabilities and the degree
of memory. Specifically, we uncover that while the asymmetry in the
depolarizing errors does not affect the entanglement fidelity of the five qubit
code, it becomes a relevant feature when the code entropy is used as a
performance quantifier.
