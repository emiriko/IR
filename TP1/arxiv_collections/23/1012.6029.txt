We consider an ultracold dipolar Bose gas in a one-dimensional lattice. For a
sufficiently large lattice recoil energy, such a system becomes a series of
non-overlapping Bose-Einstein condensates that interact via the long-range
dipole-dipole interaction (ddi). We model this system via a coupled set of
non-local Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs) for lattices of both infinite and
finite extent. We find significantly modified stability properties in the
lattice due to the softening of a discrete roton-like mode, as well as
"islands" in parameter space where biconcave densities are predicted to exist
that only exist in the presence of the other condensates on the lattice. We
solve for the elementary excitations of the system to check the dynamical
stability of these solutions and to uncover the nature of their collapse. By
solving a coupled set of GPEs exactly on a full numeric grid, we show that this
emergent biconcave structure can be realized in a finite lattice with atomic
$^{52}$Cr.
