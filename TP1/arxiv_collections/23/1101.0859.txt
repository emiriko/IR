Parton energy loss in the hot QCD medium will manifest itself not only in
leading hadron spectra but also in reconstructed jet productions in high-energy
nucleus-nucleus collisions. In this paper we report on recent theoretical
efforts in studying full jet observables in relativistic heavy-ion collisions
by discussing the modifications of jet shapes, inclusive jet cross section and
the vector boson accompanied jet production in the presence of the QGP-induced
jet quenching.
