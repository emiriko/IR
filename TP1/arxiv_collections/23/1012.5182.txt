First-order quantum correction to the Larmor radiation is investigated on the
basis of the scalar QED on a homogeneous background of time-dependent electric
field, which is a generalization of a recent work by Higuchi and Walker so as
to be extended for an accelerated charged particle in a relativistic motion. We
obtain a simple approximate formula for the quantum correction in the limit of
the relativistic motion when the direction of the particle motion is parallel
to that of the electric field.
