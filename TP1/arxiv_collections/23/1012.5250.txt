Solar sails can play a critical role in enabling solar and heliophysics
missions. Solar sail technology within NASA is currently at 80% of TRL-6,
suitable for an in-flight technology demonstration. It is conceivable that an
initial demonstration could carry scientific payloads that, depending on the
type of mission, are commensurate with the goals of the three study panels of
the 2010 Heliophysics Survey. Follow-on solar sail missions, leveraging
advances in solar sail technology to support Heliophysics Survey goals, would
then be feasible. This white paper reports on a sampling of missions enabled by
solar sails, the current state of the technology, and what funding is required
to advance the current state of technology such that solar sails can enable
these missions.
