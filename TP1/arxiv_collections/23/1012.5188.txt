We observed bulk superconductivity in the FeTe1-xSex crystals with a low Se
concentration after the excess Fe atoms existing unavoidably in crystals
as-grown are partially removed by means of annealing in the air. A revised
magnetism and superconductivity phase diagram is obtained via resistivity and
magnetic susceptibility measurements for FeTe1-xSex system. It is found that
bulk superconductivity coexists with antiferromagnetic order in the crystals
with 0.05<x<0.20. The phase diagram is very similar to the case of the K-doping
or Co-doping BaFe2As2, as well as of SmFeAsO1-xFx iron-pnictide system, perhaps
indicating that all iron-based systems have a generic phase diagram, although
antiferromagnetic wave vector in the parent compounds of these systems is
remarkable different.
