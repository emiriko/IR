The weak-coupling expansion of the QCD free energy is known to order
g_s^6log{g_s}, however, the resulting series is poorly convergent at
phenomenologically relevant temperatures. In this proceedings, I discuss
hard-thermal-loop perturbation theory (HTLpt) which is a gauge-invariant
reorganization of the perturbative expansion for gauge theories. I review a
recent NNLO HTLpt calculation of QCD thermodynamic functions. I show that the
NNLO HTLpt results are consistent with lattice data down to temperatures
T~2T_c.
