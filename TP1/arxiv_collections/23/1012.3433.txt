Realizing the theoretical promise of quantum computers will require
overcoming decoherence. Here we demonstrate numerically that high fidelity
quantum gates are possible within a framework of quantum dynamical decoupling.
Orders of magnitude improvement in the fidelities of a universal set of quantum
gates, relative to unprotected evolution, is achieved over a broad range of
system-environment coupling strengths, using recursively constructed
(concatenated) dynamical decoupling pulse sequences.
