The main goal of the article is to study the Pontryagin duality for Abelian
$s$- and $sb$-groups. Let $G$ be an infinite Abelian group and $X$ be the dual
group of the discrete group $G_d$. We show that a dense subgroup $H$ of $X$ is
$\mathfrak{g}$-closed iff $H$ algebraically is the dual group of $G$ endowed
with some maximally almost periodic $s$-topology. Every reflexive Polish
Abelian group is $\mathfrak{g}$-closed in its Bohr compactification. If a
$s$-topology $\tau$ on a countably infinite Abelian group $G$ is generated by a
countable set of convergent sequences, then the dual group of $(G,\tau)$ is
Polish. A non-trivial Hausdorff Abelian topological group is a $s$-group iff it
is a quotient group of the $s$-sum of a family of copies of
$(\mathbb{Z}^\mathbb{N}_0, \mathbf{e})$.
