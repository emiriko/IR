In a dynamic heterogeneous environment, such as pervasive and ubiquitous
computing, context-aware adaptation is a key concept to meet the varying
requirements of different users. Connectivity is an important context source
that can be utilized for optimal management of diverse networking resources.
Application QoS (Quality of service) is another important issue that should be
taken into consideration for design of a context-aware system. This paper
presents connectivity from the view point of context awareness, identifies
various relevant raw connectivity contexts, and discusses how high-level
context information can be abstracted from the raw context information.
Further, rich context information is utilized in various policy representation
with respect to user profile and preference, application characteristics,
device capability, and network QoS conditions. Finally, a context-aware
end-to-end evaluation algorithm is presented for adaptive connectivity
management in a multi-access wireless network. Unlike the currently existing
algorithms, the proposed algorithm takes into account user QoS parameters, and
therefore, it is more practical.
