Reconnection of alternating magnetic fields is an important energy
transformation mechanism in Poynting dominated outflows. We show that the
reconnection is facilitated by the Kruskal-Schwarzschild instability of current
sheets separating the oppositely directed fields. This instability, which is a
magnetic counterpart of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, develops if the flow
is accelerated. Then the plasma drips out of the current sheet providing
conditions for rapid reconnection. Since the magnetic dissipation leads to the
flow acceleration, the process is self-sustaining. In pulsar winds, this
process could barely compete with the earlier proposed dissipation mechanisms.
However, the novel mechanism turns out to be very efficient at AGN and GRB
conditions.
