The latest observation of a Shapiro delay of the binary millisecond pulsar
J1614-2230 by Demorest et al. Nature 467 1081 (2010) yielded the pulsar
gravitational mass to be 1.97 +/- 0.04 solar mass, the heaviest observed pulsar
to-date. This result produces a stringent constraint on Equation(s) of State
(EoS) of high density neutron star matter. One of the main conclusions of
Demorest et al. was that their result makes the presence of non-nucleonic
components in the neutron star matter unlikely. We compare the result with our
recent work and conclude that hyperons in high-density matter are fully
consistent with the observation and that their presence is a necessary
consequence of general physical laws.
