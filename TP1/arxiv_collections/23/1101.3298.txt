We consider the possibility of observing supernova (SN) - gamma-ray burst
(GRB) pairs separated by several years. These energetic events correspond to
the second SN explosion in a double star system followed by the formation of
the very short-lived pair of compact objects and finally by the GRB generation
after their merge. Possible connection of SN 1997ds and GRB 990425 is
discussed.
