The dynamical responses of Ising metamagnet (layered antiferromagnet) in the
presence of a sinusoidally oscillating magnetic field are studied by Monte
Carlo simulation. The time average staggered magnetisation plays the role of
dynamic order parameter. A dynamical phase transition was observed and a phase
diagram was plotted in the plane formed by field amplitude and temperature. The
dynamical phase boundary is observed to shrink inward as the relative
antiferromagnetic strength decreases. The results are compared with that
obtained from pure ferromagnetic system. The shape of dynamic phase boundary
observed to be qualitatively similar to that obtained from previous meanfield
calculations.
