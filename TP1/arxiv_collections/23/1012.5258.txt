The STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider at Brookhaven
National Laboratory is providing fundamental measurements in high-energy
polarized $\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200-500\,$GeV to deepen our
understanding on the spin structure and dynamics of the proton. This program
has completed the first data taking period in 2009 of polarized
$\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=500\,$GeV. This opens a new era in
the study of the spin-flavor structure of the proton based on the production of
$W^{-(+)}$ bosons. The measurement of the cross section and single-spin
asymmetries for midrapidity decay positrons and electrons from $W^{+}$ and
$W^{-}$ boson production in longitudinally polarized $\vec{p}+p$ collisions at
$\sqrt{s}=500\,$GeV is presented.
