We considered a spin chain with nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor
exchange interactions, anisotropic exchange interaction and
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The conditions of the spiral spin state as
the ground state were analyzed. Our method was to build the connection between
the spiral state and the fully polarized state with a unitary transformation.
Under this transformation, anisotropic exchange interaction and
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can be transformed to each other. Then we
used positive semi-definite matrix theorem to identify the region of fully
polarized state as the ground state for the transformed Hamiltonian, and it is
the region of spiral spin state as the ground state of the original
Hamiltonian. We also found that the effect of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
is important. Its strength is related to the pitch angle of spiral spins. Our
method can be applied to coupled spin chains and two dimensional triangular
lattice systems. The result can be compared with experiment data.
