We present the goals and preliminary results of an unbiased, near-infrared,
narrow-band imaging survey of the First Galactic Quadrant (10deg<l<65deg ;
-1.3deg<b<+1.3deg). This area includes most of the Giant Molecular Clouds and
massive star forming regions in the northern hemisphere. The survey is centred
on the 1-0S(1) ro-vibrational line of H2, a proven tracer of hot, dense
molecular gas in star-forming regions, around evolved stars, and in supernova
remnants. The observations complement existing and upcoming photometric surveys
(Spitzer-GLIMPSE, UKIDSS-GPS, JCMT-JPS, AKARI, Herschel Hi-GAL, etc.), though
we probe a dynamically active component of star formation not covered by these
broad-band surveys. Our narrow-band survey is currently more than 60% complete.
The median seeing in our images is 0.73arcsec. The images have a 5sigma
detection limit of point sources of K=18mag and the surface brightness limit is
10^-19Wm^-2arcsec^-2 when averaged over our typical seeing. Jets and outflows
from both low and high mass Young Stellar Objects are revealed, as are new
Planetary Nebulae and - via a comparison with earlier K-band observations
acquired as part of the UKIDSS GPS - numerous variable stars. With their
superior spatial resolution, the UWISH2 data also have the potential to reveal
the true nature of many of the Extended Green Objects found in the GLIMPSE
survey.
