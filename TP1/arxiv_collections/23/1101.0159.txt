We study thermal fluctuations and capacitive effects on small Josephson
Junction Rings (JJR) that mimics the rectification phenomena recently observed
in triangle shaped mesoscopic superconductors, due to the superposition of the
field induced persistent current with the bias current. At finite temperature
we predicted that the amplitude of the rectified signal depends strongly on the
current contacts configuration on the JJR, in coincidence with experiments. In
addition we analize the range of parameters where a closed loop of capacitive
junctions is an appropriate model to explain the experimental observations. We
conclude that the closed loop of weak links, a JJR, is a simple, robust and
good enough model to explain the observed voltage rectification effects on
mesoscopic superconducting samples for a wide range of temperature.
