Resonance production and decay into pion pairs is simulated in a
non-extensive quark matter with multi-particle interactions. Final state pion
spectra are found to take the form of the Tsallis distribution, in accordance
with measurements. It has also been shown that, if a large number of particles
with these multi-particle interactions are constrained to a constant energy
hyper-surface in phase space, the one-particle distribution is the Tsallis
distribution.
