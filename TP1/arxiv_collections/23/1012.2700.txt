We prepared a buoyancy matched binary mixture of polydisperse polystyrene
microgel spheres of size ratio 0.785 and at a volume fraction of 0.567 just
below the kinetic glass transition. In line with theoretical expectations, a
eutectic phase behavior was observed, but only a minor fraction of the samples
crystallized at all. By adding a short non-adsorbing polymer we enforce
inter-species fractionation into coexisting pure component crystals, which in
turn also shows signs of intra-species fractionation. We show that in formerly
inaccessible regions of the phase diagram binary hard sphere physics is made
observable using attractive hard spheres.
