We studied the static and dynamic domain wall solutions of spinor
Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in an optical lattice. The single and double
domain wall solutions are constructed analytically. Our results show that the
magnetic field and light-induced dipolar interactions play an important role
for both the formation of different domain walls and the adjusting of domain
wall width and velocity. Moreover, these interactions can drive the motion of
domain wall of Bose ferromagnet systems similar to that driven by the external
magnetic field or the spin-polarized current in fermion ferromagnet.
