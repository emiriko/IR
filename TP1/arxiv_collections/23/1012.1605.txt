Measurements of hadron production in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 0.9, 2.36 and
7 TeV recorded with the CMS detector are reported. Transverse momentum,
pseudorapidity and multiplicity distributions of charged hadrons are presented.
For non-single-diffractive collisions, the average charged-hadron transverse
momentum and pseudorapidity density reveal an increase in production rate not
well matched by theory and models. Measured spectra of identified strange
particles, K0S, Lambda, anti-Lambda, Xi- and Xi+, reconstructed based on their
decay topology, are also presented. The production rates for strange particles
are observed to be in excess of those predicted by Monte Carlo models by up to
a factor of three.
