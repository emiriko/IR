The Lorenz electromagnetic theory of light, published two years after the
Maxwell theory, starts by postulating that both scalar and vector potentials
are retarded. We show that in spite of this postulate, Lorenz's theory gives a
longitudinal electric field in vacuum that remains the instantaneous action at
a distance it is in the Maxwell theory. There is in fact no difference between
the two theories for electromagnetic phenomena in vacuum.
