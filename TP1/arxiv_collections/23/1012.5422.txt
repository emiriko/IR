The fundamental issues associated with the magnetoplasmon excitations are
investigated in a quantum wire characterized by a confining harmonic potential
and subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field. We embark on the
charge-density excitations in a two-subband model within the framework of
Bohm-Pines' random-phase approximation. Essentially, the focus of our study is
the intersubband (magnetoroton) collective excitation which changes the sign of
its group velocity twice before merging with the respective single-particle
continuum. The computation of the gain coefficient suggests an interesting and
important application: the electronic device based on such magnetoroton modes
can act as an {\it active} laser medium.
