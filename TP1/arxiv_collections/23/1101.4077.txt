Estimation of the black hole mass in bright X-ray sources of nearby galaxies
is crucial to the understanding of these systems and their formation. However,
the present allowed black hole mass range spans five order of magnitude (10Msun
< M < 10^5 Msun) with the upper limit obtained from dynamical friction
arguments. We show that the absence of a detectable optical counterpart for
some of these sources, can provide a much more stringent upper limit. The
argument is based only on the assumption that the outer regions of their
accretion disks is a standard one. Moreover, such optically dark X-ray sources
cannot be foreground stars or background active galactic nuclei, and hence must
be accreting systems residing within their host galaxies. As a demonstration we
search for candidates among the point-like X-ray sources detected with Chandra
in thirteen nearby elliptical galaxies. We use a novel technique to search for
faint optical counterparts in the HST images whereby we subtract the bright
galaxy light based on isophotal modeling of the surface brightness. We show
that for six sources with no detectable optical emission at the 3$-$sigma
level, their black hole masses M_{BH} < 5000Msun. In particular, an
ultra-luminous X-ray source (ULX) in NGC 4486 has M_{BH} < 1244 Msun. We
discuss the potential of this method to provide stringent constraints on the
black hole masses, and the implications on the physical nature of these
sources.
