We propose a novel method of reconstructing the topology and interaction
functions for a general oscillator network. An ensemble of initial phases and
the corresponding instantaneous frequencies is constructed by repeating random
phase-resets of the system dynamics. The desired details of network structure
are then revealed by appropriately averaging over the ensemble. The method is
applicable for a wide class of networks with arbitrary emergent dynamics,
including full synchrony.
