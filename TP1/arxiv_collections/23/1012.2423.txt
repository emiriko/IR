Without a doubt many problems in physics arise as a consequence of our
philosophical conception of the world. In this contribution however we endeavor
to alleviate this scenario by putting forward a philosophical approach under
which some of the most fundamental problems in modern physics might turn out to
be fictitious. To accomplish such task we propound that everything that exists
must be made up of \emph{matter} which not only makes up space and the universe
but also is in constant change. For such reason the existence of total
emptiness and material discontinuity are rejected. Here physical fields are
assumed as a particular state of matter. And time is understood as the result
of the intrinsic dynamics of the universe. Furthermore, the infiniteness of the
universe is also discussed and its implications are briefly mentioned, e.g.,
the laws of conservation. Finally, the regularity of the physical laws is
questioned. In summary four great problems (from the perspective of physics)
are suggested to be deeply studied: (1) What is matter?, (2) Why does the
universe change? (3) is the universe infinite in extension? and (4) are there
really regular (invariant) laws of physics?
