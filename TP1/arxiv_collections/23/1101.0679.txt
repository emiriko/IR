GNU Data Language (GDL) is an open-source interpreted language aimed at
numerical data analysis and visualisation. It is a free implementation of the
Interactive Data Language (IDL) widely used in Astronomy. GDL has a full syntax
compatibility with IDL, and includes a large set of library routines targeting
advanced matrix manipulation, plotting, time-series and image analysis,
mapping, and data input/output including numerous scientific data formats. We
will present the current status of the project, the key accomplishments, and
the weaknesses - areas where contributions are welcome !
