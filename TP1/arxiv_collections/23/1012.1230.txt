We compute the neutral bosonic excitation spectra of the holographic quantum
Hall fluid described by the D3-D7' system. We find that the system is stable,
gapped, and, in a range of parameters, exhibits a spectrum of low-lying
excitations very similar to that of a quantum Hall fluid, including a
magneto-roton excitation.
