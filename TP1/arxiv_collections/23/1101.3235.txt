We consider the one dimensional asymmetric exclusion process with particle
injection and extraction at two boundaries. The model is known to exhibit four
distinct phases in its stationary state. We analyze the current statistics at
the first site in the low and high density phases. In the limit of infinite
system size, we conjecture an exact expression for the current large deviation
function.
