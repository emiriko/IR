Hypercontractive inequalities are a useful tool in dealing with extremal
questions in the geometry of high-dimensional discrete and continuous spaces.
In this survey we trace a few connections between different manifestations of
hypercontractivity, and also present some relatively recent applications of
these techniques in computer science.
