We investigate the stationary end-state obtained by evolving a collapsing
spherical star with the gauges routinely adopted to study puncture black holes.
We compare the end-state of the collapse with the trumpet solution found in the
evolution of a single wormhole slice and show that the two solutions closely
agree. We demonstrate that the agreement is caused by the use of the
Gamma-driver shift condition, which allows the matter to fall inwards into a
region of spacetime that is not resolved by the numerical grid, and which
simultaneously finds the stationary coordinates of the trumpet outside the
matter.
