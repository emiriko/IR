We calculated the size and sign of interference (I) in elastic
{\nu}_{e}e-scattering process in the presence of nonstandard neutrino
interactions (NSI). The size of interference predicted by standard model (SM)
is -1.09, while that measured in the LSND experiment is -1.01\pm0.18. Using the
current bounds on NSI from the literature,we get I= -1.02, which is compatible
with experiment . The result indicates that nonstandard current interferes
constructively with the charge and neutral currents (CC and NC) of the SM,
while the over all -ev sign (distructive) indicates that the dominant
contribution is still from the SM, yet we can not ignore the contribution of
NSI, as it enhances our knowledge in terms of known physical phenomena. As an
offshoot of this analysis, the best bounds on NSI coupling parameters could be
chosen.
