Causes of the unsatisfactory condition of the gravitational-wave experiments
are discussed and a new outlook at the detection of gravitational waves of
astrophysical origin is proposed. It is shown that there are strong grounds for
identifying the so-called giant pulses in the pulsar NP 0532 radiation with
gravimagnetic shock waves (GMSW) excited in the neutron star magnetosphere by
sporadic gravitational radiation of this pulsar.
