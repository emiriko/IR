Molecular dynamics simulations of 50 Fe grain boundaries were used to
understand their interaction with vacancies and self-interstitial atoms at all
atomic positions within 20 Angstroms of the boundary, which is important for
designing radiation-resistant polycrystalline materials. Site-to-site variation
within the boundary of both vacancy and self-interstitial formation energies is
substantial, with the majority of sites having lower formation energies than in
the bulk. Comparing the vacancy and self-interstitial atom binding energies for
each site shows that there is an energetic driving force for interstitials to
preferentially bind to grain boundary sites over vacancies. Furthermore, these
results provide a valuable dataset for quantifying uncertainty bounds for
various grain boundary types at the nanoscale, which can be propagated to
higher scale simulations of microstructure evolution.
