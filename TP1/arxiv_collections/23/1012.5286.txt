Quantum solitons are discovered with the help of generalized quantum
hydrodynamics. The solitons have the character of the stable quantum objects in
the self consistent electric field. The delivered theory demonstrates the great
possibilities of the generalized quantum hydrodynamics in investigation of the
quantum solitons. The theory leads to solitons as typical formations in the
generalized quantum hydrodynamics. The principle of universal antigravitation
is considered from positions of the Newtonian theory of gravitation and
non-local kinetic theory. It is found that explanation of Hubble effect in the
Universe and peculiar features of the rotational speeds of galaxies need not in
introduction of new essence like dark matter and dark energy. Problems of
antimatter after Big Bang are considered from positions of non-local physics.
The origin of difficulties consists in total Oversimplification following from
principles of local physics and reflects the general shortenings of the local
kinetic transport theory.
