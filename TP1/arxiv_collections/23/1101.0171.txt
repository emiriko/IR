Young solar-type stars rotate rapidly and are very magnetically active. The
magnetic fields at their surfaces likely originate in their convective
envelopes where convection and rotation can drive strong dynamo action. Here we
explore simulations of global-scale stellar convection in rapidly rotating suns
using the 3-D MHD anelastic spherical harmonic (ASH) code. The magnetic fields
built in these dynamos are organized on global-scales into wreath-like
structures that span the convection zone. We explore one case rotates five
times faster than the Sun in detail. This dynamo simulation, called case D5,
has repeated quasi-cyclic reversals of global-scale polarity. We compare this
case D5 to the broader family of simulations we have been able to explore and
discuss how future simulations and observations can advance our understanding
of stellar dynamos and magnetism.
