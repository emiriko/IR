We describe an implementation of Hedin's GW approximation for molecules and
clusters, the complexity of which scales as O(N^3) with the number of atoms.
Our method is guided by two strategies: i) to respect the locality of the
underlying electronic interactions and ii) to avoid the singularities of
Green's functions by manipulating, instead, their spectral functions using FFT
methods. To take into account the locality of the electronic interactions, we
use a local basis of atomic orbitals and, also, a local basis in the space of
their products. We further compress the screened Coulomb interaction into a
space of lower dimensions for speed and to reduce memory requirements. The
improved scaling of our method with respect to most of the published
methodologies should facilitate GW calculations for large systems. Our
implementation is intended as a step forward towards the goal of predicting,
prior to their synthesis, the ionization energies and electron affinities of
the large molecules that serve as constituents of organic semiconductors.
