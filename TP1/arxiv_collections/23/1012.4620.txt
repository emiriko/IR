In this paper, a new pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) based on chaotic
iterations is proposed. This method also combines the digits of two XORshifts
PRNGs. The statistical properties of this new generator are improved: the
generated sequences can pass all the DieHARD statistical test suite. In
addition, this generator behaves chaotically, as defined by Devaney. This makes
our generator suitable for cryptographic applications. An illustration in the
field of data hiding is presented and the robustness of the obtained data
hiding algorithm against attacks is evaluated.
