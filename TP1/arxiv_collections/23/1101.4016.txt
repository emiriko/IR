We have conducted a high-resolution imaging study of the Taurus-Auriga
star-forming region in order to characterize the primordial outcome of multiple
star formation and the extent of the brown dwarf desert. Our survey identified
16 new binary companions to primary stars with masses of 0.25-2.5 Msun, raising
the total number of binary pairs (including components of high-order multiples)
with separations of 3--5000 AU to 90. We find that ~2/3--3/4 of all Taurus
members are multiple systems of two or more stars, while the other ~1/4--1/3
appear to have formed as single stars; the distribution of high-order
multiplicity suggests that fragmentation into a wide binary has no impact on
the subsequent probability that either component will fragment again. The
separation distribution for solar-type stars (0.7--2.5 Msun) is nearly log-flat
over separations of 3--5000 AU, but lower-mass stars (0.25--0.7 Msun) show a
paucity of binary companions with separations of >200 AU. Across this full mass
range, companion masses are well described with a linear-flat function; all
system mass ratios (q=M_B/M_A) are equally probable, apparently including
substellar companions. Our results are broadly consistent with the two expected
modes of binary formation (freefall fragmentation on large scales and disk
fragmentation on small scales), but the distributions provide some clues as to
the epochs at which the companions are likely to form.
