A recent paper by Gislason published in Am. J. Phys. deals with the
celebrated example of the so-called "adiabatic piston", a system involving two
ideal gases contained in a horizontal cylinder and separated by an insulating
piston that moves without friction. While the analysis presented in that paper
is rather comprehensive, very interesting and useful as a teaching tool, it can
be somewhat misleading if not taken within its appropriate context. As a matter
of fact, the evolution to equilibrium involves two phases, a faster one leading
to the equalization of pressures, and a slower one bringing the system to
identical temperatures. Although Gislason addresses only the first process, we
note that the final state after the second phase, the evolution to equal
temperatures once the pressures are the same, is described by thermodynamics.
Therefore, the discussion of the adiabatic piston given by Gislason can and
should be enriched, in order to promote a proper and general view of
thermodynamics.
