We show that cellular bases of generalized $q$-Schur algebras can be
constructed by gluing arbitrary bases of the cell modules and their dual basis
(with respect to the anti-involution giving the cell structure) along defining
idempotents. For the rational form, over the field $\mathbb{Q}(v)$ of rational
functions in an indeterminate $v$, our proof of this fact is self-contained and
independent of the theory of quantum groups. In the general case, over a
commutative ring $\Bbbk$ regarded as a $\mathbb{Z}[v,v^{-1}]$-algebra via
specialization $v \mapsto q$ for some chosen invertible $q \in \Bbbk$, our
argument depends on the existence of the canonical basis.
