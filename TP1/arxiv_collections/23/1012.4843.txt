Much attention has been drawn to quantum computing and the exponential
speed-up in computation the technology would be able to provide. Various claims
have been made about what aspect of quantum mechanics causes this speed-up.
Formulations of quantum computing have traditionally been made in orthodox
(Copenhagen) and sometimes many-worlds quantum mechanics. We will aim to
understand quantum computing in terms of de Broglie-Bohm Pilot-Wave Theory by
considering different simple systems that may function as a basic quantum
computer. We will provide a careful discussion of Pilot-Wave Theory and
evaluate criticisms of the theory. We will assess claims regarding what causes
the exponential speed-up in the light of our analysis and the fact that
Pilot-Wave Theory is perfectly able to account for the phenomena involved in
quantum computing.
