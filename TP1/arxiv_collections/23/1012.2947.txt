Since 1992, a new Chinese innovation system has been emerging in terms of
university-industry-government relations. In recent years, science parks,
incubators, and high-tech development zones have been provided with strong
incentives. The commitment of the Chinese government to the further
introduction of a market economy has been elaborated with a focus on the
knowledge-base. The model of institutional adjustments has been replaced with
systemic and evolutionary thinking about niche development and human resource
management. Government interventions remain important for interfacing
knowledge-based developments with those on the market. For example, new
legislation on issues of "intellectual property rights" is crucial to the
absorption of venture capital into these developments.
