Dijet angular distributions from the first proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV
have been measured with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The dataset used
corresponds to a total integrated luminosity of 61 $\pm$ 7 nb$^{-1}$. Comparing
the distributions with Monte Carlo based QCD predictions shows good agreement
between data and QCD. The distributions are used to set limits on the existence
of quark compositeness.
