Recently, we put forwarded a redox molecular hypothesis involving the natural
biophysical substrate of visual perception and imagery. Here, we explicitly
propose that the feedback and feedforward iterative operation processes can be
interpreted in terms of a homunculus looking at the biophysical picture in our
brain during visual imagery. We further propose that the brain can use both
picture-like and language-like representation processes. In our interpretation,
visualization (imagery) is a special kind of representation i.e., visual
imagery requires a peculiar inherent biophysical (picture-like) mechanism. We
also conjecture that the evolution of higher levels of complexity made the
biophysical picture representation of the external visual world possible by
controlled redox and bioluminescent nonlinear (iterative) biochemical reactions
in the V1 and V2 areas during visual imagery. Our proposal deals only with the
primary level of visual representation (i.e. perceived "scene").
