We discuss the role of collisional energy loss on high $p_T$ photon data
measured by PHENIX collaboration by calculating photon yield in jet-plasma
interaction. The phase space distribution of the participating jet is
dynamically evolved by solving Fokker-Planck equation. We treat the strong
coupling constant ($\alpha_s$) as function of momentum and temperature while
calculating the drag and diffusion coefficients. It is observed that the
quenching factor is substantially modified as compared to the case when
$\alpha_s$ is taken as constant. It is shown that the data is reasonably well
reproduced when contributions from all the relevant sources are taken into
account. Predictions at higher beam energies relevant for LHC experiment have
been made.
