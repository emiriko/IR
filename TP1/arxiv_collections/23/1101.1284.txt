The Herschel Common Science System (HCSS) (Ott et al. 2006) (Ott & Science
Ground Segment Consortium 2010) is a substantial Java software package,
accompanying the development of the Herschel Mission (Pilbratt et al. 2010),
supporting all of its phases. In particular the reduction of data from the
scientific instruments for instrument checkout, calibration, and astronomical
analysis is one of its major applications. The data reduction software is split
up in modules, called "tasks". Agreed-upon sequences of tasks form pipelines
that deliver well defined standard products for storage in a web-accessible
Herschel Science Archive (HSA) (Leon et al. 2009). However, as astronomers and
instrument scientists continue to characterize instrumental effects,
astronomers already need to publish scientific results and may not have the
time to acquire a sufficiently deep understanding of the system to apply
necessary fixes. There is a need for intermediate level analysis tools that
offer more flexibility than rigid pipelines. The task framework within the HCSS
and the highly versatile Herschel Interactive Processing Environment (HIPE),
together with the rich set of libraries provide the necessary tools to develop
GUI-based interactive analysis packages for the Herschel instruments. The SPIRE
Photometer Interactive Analysis (SPIA) package, that was demonstrated in this
session, proves the validity of the concept for the SPIRE instrument (Griffin
et al. 2010), breaking up the pipeline reduction into logical components,
making all relevant processing parameters available in GUIs, and providing a
more controlled and user-friendly access to the complexities of the system.
