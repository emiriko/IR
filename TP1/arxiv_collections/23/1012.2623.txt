We report here the designing of optically-nonactive metamaterial by
assembling metallic helices with different chirality. With linearly polarized
incident light, pure electric or magnetic resonance can be selectively
realized, which leads to negative permittivity or negative permeability
accordingly. Further, we show that pure electric or magnetic resonance can be
interchanged at the same frequency band by merely changing the polarization of
incident light for 90 degrees. This design demonstrates a unique approach to
construct metamaterial.
