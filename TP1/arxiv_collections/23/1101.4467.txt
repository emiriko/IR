We theoretically study the Anderson localization of a matter wave packet in a
one-dimensional disordered potential. We develop an analytical model which
includes the initial phase-space density of the matter wave and the spectral
broadening induced by the disorder. Our approach predicts a behavior of the
localized density profile significantly more complex than a simple exponential
decay. These results are confirmed by large-scale and long-time numerical
calculations. They shed new light on recent experiments with ultracold atoms
and may impact their analysis.
