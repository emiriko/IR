Given a continuous function from Euclidean space to the real line, we analyze
(under some natural assumption on the function), the set of values it takes on
translates of lattices. Our results are of the flavor: For almost any
translate, the set of values is dense in the set of possible values. The
results are then applied to a variety of concrete examples, obtaining new
information in classical discussions in different areas in mathematics; in
particular, Minkowski's conjecture regarding products of inhomogeneous forms
and inhomogeneous Diophantine approximations.
