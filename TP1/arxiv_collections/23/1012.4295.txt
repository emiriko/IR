In an experiment with a 65 MeV/nucleon polarized deuteron beam on a
liquid-deuterium target at KVI, several multi-body final states in
deuteron-deuteron scattering were identified. For these measurements, a unique
and advanced detection system, called BINA, was utilized. We demonstrate the
feasibility of measuring vector and tensor polarization observables of the
deuteron break-up reaction leading to a three-body final-state. The
polarization observables were determined with high precision in a nearly
background-free experiment. The analysis procedure and some results are
presented.
