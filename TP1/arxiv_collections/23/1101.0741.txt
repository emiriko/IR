We present here results from our search for X-ray pulsations of the neutron
star in the low mass X-ray binary EXO 0748-676 at a frequency near a
burst-oscillation frequency of 44.7 Hz. Using the observations made with the
Proportional Counter Array on board the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer we did not
find any pulsations in the frequency band of 44.4 Hz to 45.0 Hz and obtained a
3\sigma upper limit of 0.47 % on the pulsed fraction for any possible
underlying pulsation in this frequency band.
