This expository essay discusses a finite dimensional approach to dilation
theory. How much of dilation theory can be worked out within the realm of
linear algebra? It turns out that some interesting and simple results can be
obtained. These results can be used to give very elementary proofs of sharpened
versions of some von Neumann type inequalities, as well as some other striking
consequences about polynomials and matrices. Exploring the limits of the finite
dimensional approach sheds light on the difference between those techniques and
phenomena in operator theory that are inherently infinite dimensional, and
those that are not.
