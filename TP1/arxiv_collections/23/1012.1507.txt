Kawakubo and Uchida showed that, if a closed oriented $4k$-dimensional
manifold $M$ admits a semi-free circle action such that the dimension of the
fixed point set is less than $2k$, then the signature of $M$ vanishes. In this
note, by using $G$-signature theorem and the rigidity of the signature
operator, we generalize this result to more general circle actions. Combining
the same idea with the remarkable Witten-Taubes-Bott rigidity theorem, we
explore more vanishing results on spin manifolds admitting such circle actions.
Our results are closely related to some earlier results of Conner-Floyd,
Landweber-Stong and Hirzebruch-Slodowy.
