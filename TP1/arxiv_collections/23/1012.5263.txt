We have studied the reflectivity of CMOS-compatible three-dimensional silicon
inverse woodpile photonic crystals at near-infrared frequencies.
Polarization-resolved reflectivity spectra were obtained from two orthogonal
crystal surfaces corresponding to 1.88 pi sr solid angle. The spectra reveal
broad peaks with high reflectivity up to 67 % that are independent of the
spatial position on the crystals. The spectrally overlapping reflectivity peaks
for all directions and polarizations form the signature of a broad photonic
band gap with a relative bandwidth up to 16 %. This signature is supported with
stopgaps in plane wave bandstructure calculations and with the frequency region
of the expected band gap.
