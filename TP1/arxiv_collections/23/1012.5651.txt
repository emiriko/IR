A spin model which exhibits glassy dynamics has been proposed by Newman and
Moore. This model possesses no randomness for exchange interactions. We propose
partial trace methods for obtaining static exact solutions of this model under
free boundary conditions, and show some static exact solutions. We obtain that,
from the exact solutions of the specific heat and the correlation functions,
the transition temperature is zero, although the thermal average of a spin is
zero when the temperature is zero. We investigate the ground states. In the
ground states, a part of the present results especially disagrees with the part
of the previous results. We discuss the disagreements.
