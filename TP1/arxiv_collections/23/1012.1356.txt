We have investigated the time-resolved vibrational properties of terahertz
quantum cascade lasers by means of ultra-fast laser spectroscopy. By the
observation of the acoustic folded branches, and by analyzing the involved
phonon modes it is possible to extract accurate structural information of these
devices, which are essential for their design and performance.
