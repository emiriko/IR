Twenty years ago, in October 1990, I found myself attending a workshop on
Theoretical Physics in Chernomorka (Ukraine) intended only for Soviet
physicists. That trip to the USSR/CCCP as well as the preceding months at CERN
were highly surrealistic with plenty of adventures, crucial events and
anecdotes, the most amazing one involving Niels Bohr. A few months later the
Soviet Union collapsed. In this article I make a personal account on the
happenings of 1990, with emphasis on my incursions into the European communist
world during, and also before, that year.
