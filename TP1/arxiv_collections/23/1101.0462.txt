Single crystals of Tl0.58Rb0.42Fe1.72Se2 are successfully grown with the
superconducting transition temperatures Tconset=32K and Tczero=31.4K. The Hall
coefficient exhibits a multi-band behavior, which is very similar to that of
all other Fe-based superconductors. We found that the susceptibility at the
normal state decreases with decreasing the temperature, indicating a strong
antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuation at the normal state, which might be
related to the superconductivity (SC). We also determined the upper critical
fields in ab-plane and along c-axis. The anisotropy of the superconductivity
determined by the ratio of Hc2ab and Hc2c is estimated to 5.0, which is larger
than that in (Ba,K)Fe2As2 and BaFe2-xCoxAs2, but smaller than that in cuprate
superconductors.
