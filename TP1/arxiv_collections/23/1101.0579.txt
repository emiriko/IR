Empirical evidence is presented which contradicts the established
interpretation of the intraspecific genetic variability as the adaptive
potential of the species: the uniform evolutionary tempo across the life
kingdom, species discreteness, and absence of correlation between genetic
variability and prosperity of extant species testify against the ruling
paradigm. Consistent interpretation of the nature of intraspecific genetic
variability is based on recognizing the limited sensitivity of stabilising
selection, which allows for accumulation and persistence in the population of a
considerable amount of mutational substitutions, which, to some degree, erase
the meaningful genetic information of the species. The proposed interpretation
also provides solution to the inbreeding paradox in the invasive species.
