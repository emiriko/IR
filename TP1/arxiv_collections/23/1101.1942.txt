A geometric approach to differential game theory is illustrated. The parallel
pursuit is considered as a two-player zero-sum differential game. The optimal
strategies of each player is designed based on Riemann-Finsler geometry. Our
approach incorporates a closed loop optimal control and the presentation is
familiar with a Brachistochrone type problem.
