We show that the information contained in the associated graded vector space
to Gornik's version of Khovanov-Rozansky knot homology is equivalent to a
single even integer s_n(K). Furthermore we show that s_n is a homomorphism from
the smooth knot concordance group to the integers. This is in analogy with
Rasmussen's invariant coming from a perturbation of Khovanov homology.
