TIn the first chapter, the current ideas about crystalline disordered system
are surveyed and exemplified by the results allowing for the most
straightforward interpretation. Exclusive consideration is intended for
broadband dielectric spectroscopy results. Several critical remarks are
presented about various predefined forms of the distribution of relaxation
times and it physical meaning.
  The second chapter is devoted to the experimental and theoretical methods of
the broadband dielectric spectroscopy, which have been applied by the author to
collect the original data personally.
  The third chapter contains results of investigations of the mixed
hydrogen-bond betaine phosphite betaine phosphate phase transitions dynamics.
Here distribution of the relaxation times, double well potential parameters,
local polarization distributions of the investigated crystals are presented. In
the fourth chapter the dielectric spectroscopy results of mixed
CuInP2(SxSe1-x)6 crystals are presented, phase diagram of these crystals is
discussed. The fifth chapter contains the dielectric spectra of PMN-PSN-PZN
relaxor ferroelectrics in a very wide frequency range. Formation of the polar
nanoregions below the Burns temperature (700-800 K) is manifested by the
appearance of the dielectric relaxation in the THz range and by splitting of
polar modes in the infrared spectra. Dielectric spectra are analyzed in terms
of distribution of relaxation times using the Tichonov regularization method.
The distributions splits in two components near room temperature and the origin
of both components are discussed. In the infrared spectra interesting phonon
anomalies are observed.
