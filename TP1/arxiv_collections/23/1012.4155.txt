The name "K3 surfaces" was coined by A. Weil in 1957 when he formulated a
research programme for these surfaces and their moduli. Since then, irreducible
holomorphic symplectic manifolds have been introduced as a higher dimensional
analogue of K3 surfaces. In this paper we present a review of this theory
starting from the definition of K3 surfaces and going as far as the global
Torelli theorem for irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds as recently
proved by M. Verbitsky. For many years the last open question of Weil's
programme was that of the geometric type of the moduli spaces of polarised K3
surfaces. We explain how this problem has been solved. Our method uses
algebraic geometry, modular forms and Borcherds automorphic products. We
collect and discuss the relevant facts from the theory of modular forms with
respect to the orthogonal group O(2,n). We also give a detailed description of
quasi pull-back of automorphic Borcherds products. This part contains
previously unpublished results. We apply our geometric-automorphic method to
study moduli spaces of both polarised K3 surfaces and irreducible symplectic
varieties.
