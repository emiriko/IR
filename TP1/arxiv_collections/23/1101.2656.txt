This talk discusses basic aspects of forward production of jets in pp
collisions at high energy, including i) issues on QCD factorization for hard
processes at large rapidities, and ii) the role of forward jet measurements at
the LHC to investigate contributions to parton showers from large-angle gluon
radiation and from multiple parton interactions.
