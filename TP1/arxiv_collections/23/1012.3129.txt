The study of hyperon resonances has entered a new era of precision with
advent of high-statistics photoproduction data from the CLAS detector at
Jefferson Lab. These data have multi-particle final states, allowing clean
identification of exclusive reactions associated with strange mesons and
baryons. Examples of physics results are: evidence for isospin interference in
the decay of the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance; a strong suggestion of meson cloud
effects in the structure of the $\Sigma(1385)$ resonance; data from $K^*$
photoproduction that will test the existence of the purported $K_0(800)$ meson.
Properties of other hyperon resonances will also be studied in the near future.
