We examine the ground-state phase diagram of the t-J model in one dimension
by means of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group. This model is
characterized by a rich phase diagram as a function of the exchange interaction
J and the density n, displaying Luttinger-liquid (LL) behavior both of
repulsive and attractive (i.e. superconducting) nature, a spin-gap phase, and
phase-separation. The phase boundaries separating the repulsive from the
attractive LL phase as J is increased, and also the boundaries of the spin-gap
region at low densities, and phase-separation at even larger J, are determined
on the basis of correlation functions and energy-gaps. In particular, we shed
light on a contradiction between variational and renormalization-group (RG)
results about the extent of the spin-gap phase, that results larger than the
variational but smaller than the RG one. Furthermore, we show that the spin gap
can reach a sizable value (~ 0.1 t) at low enough filling, such that preformed
pairs should be observable at temperatures below these energy scales. No
evidence for a phase with clustering of more than two particles is found on
approaching phase separation.
