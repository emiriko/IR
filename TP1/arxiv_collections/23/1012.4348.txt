After close to 20 years of preparation, the dedicated heavy ion experiment
ALICE took first data with proton collisions at the LHC at the end of 2009.
This article recalls the main design choices made for the detector and
summarizes initial operation and performance of ALICE at the LHC; first physics
results are covered elsewhere in these proceedings.
