"Epigenetic Tracking" is a model of systems of biological cells, able to
generate arbitrary 2 or 3-dimensional cellular shapes of any kind and
complexity (in terms of number of cells, number of colours, etc.) starting from
a single cell. If the complexity of such structures is interpreted as a
metaphor for the complexity of biological structures, we can conclude that this
model has the potential to generate the complexity typical of living beings. It
can be shown how the model is able to reproduce a simplified version of key
biological phenomena such as development, the presence of "junk DNA", the
phenomenon of ageing and the process of carcinogenesis. The model links
properties and behaviour of genes and cells to properties and behaviour of the
organism, describing and interpreting the said phenomena with a unified
framework: for this reason, we think it can be proposed as a model for all
biology. The material contained in this work is not new: the model and its
implications have all been described in previous works from a computer-science
point of view. This work has two objectives: 1) To present the whole theory in
an organic and structured way and 2) To introduce Epigenetic Tracking from a
biological perspective. The work is divided into six parts: the first part is
the introduction; the second part describes the cellular model; the third part
is dedicated to the evo-devo method and transposable-elements; the fourth part
deals with junk DNA and ageing; the fifth part explores the topic of cancer;
the sixth part draws the conclusions.
