Let Q be a Dynkin quiver. The bounded derived category of the path algebra of
Q has an autoequivalence given by the composition of the Auslander-Reiten
translate and the square of the shift functor. We study maximal Hom-free sets
in the corresponding orbit category C(Q). We prove that these sets are in
bijection with periodic combinatorial configurations, as introduced by
Riedtmann, certain Hom<=0-configurations, studied by Buan, Reiten and Thomas,
and noncrossing partitions of the Coxeter group associated to Q which are not
contained in any proper standard parabolic subgroup. Note that Reading has
proved that these noncrossing partitions are in bijection with positive
clusters in the associated cluster algebra. Finally, we give a definition of
mutations of maximal Hom-free sets in C(Q) and prove that the graph of these
mutations is connected.
