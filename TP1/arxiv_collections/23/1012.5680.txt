Directed transport of overdamped Brownian particles in an asymmetrically
periodic tube is investigated in the presence of the tube wall vibration. From
the Brownian dynamics simulations we can find that the perpendicular wall
vibration can induce a net current in the longitudinal direction when the tube
is asymmetric. The direction of the current at low frequency is opposite to
that at high frequency. One can change the direction of the current by suitably
tailoring the frequency of the wall vibration.
