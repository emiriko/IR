Collective response of DNA to THz electric fields is studied in a simple pair
bond model. We confirm, with some caveats, a previous observation of
destabilising DNA breather modes and explore the parameter-dependence of these
modes. It is shown that breather modes are eliminated under reasonable physical
conditions and that thermal effects are significant.
