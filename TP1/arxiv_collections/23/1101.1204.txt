In {\em Phys.\ Lett.} {\bf B 660}, 583 (2008), it was proposed that the
D-brane geometry could be produced by open string quantum effects. In an effort
to verify the proposal, we consider scattering amplitudes involving {\em
massive} open superstrings. The main goal of this paper is to set the ground
for two-loop "renormalization" of an oriented open superstring on a D-brane and
to strengthen our skill in the pure spinor formulation of a superstring, an
effective tool for multi-loop string diagrams. We start by reviewing scattering
amplitudes of massless states in the 2D component method of the NSR
formulation. A few examples of massive string scattering are worked out. The
NSR results are then reproduced in the pure spinor formulation. We compute the
amplitudes using the massive vertex operator constructed by Berkovits and
Chandia in {\em JHEP} {\bf 0208}, 040 (2002). We point out that it may be
possible to discover new Riemann type identities involving Jacobi
$\vartheta$-functions by comparing a NSR computation and the corresponding pure
spinor computation.
