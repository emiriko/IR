Community structure is one of the main structural features of networks,
revealing both their internal organization and the similarity of their
elementary units. Despite the large variety of methods proposed to detect
communities in graphs, there is a big need for multi-purpose techniques, able
to handle different types of datasets and the subtleties of community
structure. In this paper we present OSLOM (Order Statistics Local Optimization
Method), the first method capable to detect clusters in networks accounting for
edge directions, edge weights, overlapping communities, hierarchies and
community dynamics. It is based on the local optimization of a fitness function
expressing the statistical significance of clusters with respect to random
fluctuations, which is estimated with tools of Extreme and Order Statistics.
OSLOM can be used alone or as a refinement procedure of partitions/covers
delivered by other techniques. We have also implemented sequential algorithms
combining OSLOM with other fast techniques, so that the community structure of
very large networks can be uncovered. Our method has a comparable performance
as the best existing algorithms on artificial benchmark graphs. Several
applications on real networks are shown as well. OSLOM is implemented in a
freely available software (http://www.oslom.org), and we believe it will be a
valuable tool in the analysis of networks.
