The possibility of making precise predictions for the Casimir force is
essential for the theoretical interpretation of current precision experiments
on the thermal Casimir effect with metallic plates, especially for sub-micron
separations. For this purpose it is necessary to estimate very accurately the
dielectric function of a conductor along the imaginary frequency axis. This
task is complicated in the case of ohmic conductors, because optical data do
not usually extend to sufficiently low frequencies to permit an accurate
evaluation of the standard Kramers-Kronig integral used to compute $\epsilon(i
\xi)$. By making important improvements in the results of a previous paper by
the author, it is shown that this difficulty can be resolved by considering
suitable weighted dispersions relations, which strongly suppress the
contribution of low frequencies. The weighted dispersion formulae presented in
this paper permit to estimate accurately the dielectric function of ohmic
conductors for imaginary frequencies, on the basis of optical data extending
from the IR to the UV, with no need of uncontrolled data extrapolations towards
zero frequency that are instead necessary with standard Kramers-Kronig
relations. Applications to several sets of data for gold films are presented to
demonstrate viability of the new dispersion formulae.
