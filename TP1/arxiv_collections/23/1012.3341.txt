A major obstacle for the experimental realization of a supersolid phase with
cold atomic gases in an optical lattice is the weakness of the nearest-neighbor
interactions achievable via magnetic dipole-dipole interactions. In this
letter, we show that using a large filling of atoms within each well the
characteristic energy scales are strongly enhanced. Within this regime, the
system is well described by the rotor model, and the qualitative behavior of
the phase diagram derives from mean-field theory. We find a stable supersolid
phase for realistic parameters with chromium atoms.
