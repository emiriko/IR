The broad band spectra of two Swift/BAT AGNs obtained from Suzaku follow-up
observations are studied: NGC 612 and NGC 3081. Fitting with standard models,
we find that both sources show similar spectra characterized by a heavy
absorption with $N_{\rm{H}} \simeq 10^{24} \ \rm{cm}^{-2}$, the fraction of
scattered light is $f_{\rm{scat}} = 0.5-0.8%$, and the solid angle of the
reflection component is $\Omega/2\pi = 0.4-1.1$. To investigate the geometry of
the torus, we apply numerical spectral models utilizing Monte Carlo simulations
by Ikeda et al. (2009) to the Suzaku spectra. We find our data are well
explained by this torus model, which has four geometrical parameters. The fit
results suggest that NGC 612 has the torus half opening-angle of $\simeq
60^{\circ}-70^{\circ}$ and is observed from a nearly edge-on angle with a small
amount of scattering gas, while NGC 3081 has a very small opening angle $\simeq
15^\circ$ and is observed on a face-on geometry, more like the deeply buried
"new type" AGNs found by Ueda et al. (2007). We demonstrate the potential power
of direct application of such numerical simulations to the high quality broad
band spectra to unveil the inner structure of AGNs.
