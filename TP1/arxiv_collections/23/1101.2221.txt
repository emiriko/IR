It is known that the so-called problem of solar power pacemaker related to
possible existence of some hidden but key mechanism of energy influence of the
Sun on fundamental geophysical processes is one of the principal and puzzling
problems of modern climatology. The "tracks" of this mechanism have been shown
up in different problems of solar-terrestrial physics for a long time and, in
particular, in climatology, where the solar-climate variability is stably
observed. However, the mechanisms by which small changes in the Sun's energy
(solar irradiance or insolation) output during the solar cycle can cause change
in the weather and climate are still unknown. We analyze possible causes of the
solar-climate variability concentrating one's attention on the physical
substantiation of strong correlation between the temporal variations of
magnetic flux of the solar tachocline zone and the Earth magnetic field
(Y-component). We propose an effective mechanism of solar dynamo-geodynamo
connection which plays the role of the solar power pacemaker of the Earth
global climate.
