We discuss progress in understanding the light and heavy quark excited hadron
spectrum from Coulomb gauge QCD. For light quark systems we highlight the
insensitivity to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, which predicts Wigner
parity-degeneracy in the highly excited hadron spectrum and allows the quark
mass momentum dependence to be experimentally probed. For heavy quark meson
decays we invoke the Franck-Condon principle, a consequence of small velocity
changes for heavy quarks, to extract qualitative, but model independent,
structure insight from the momentum distribution of the decay products.
