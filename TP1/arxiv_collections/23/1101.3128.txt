The coupled in-plane diffusion dynamics between point-particles embedded in
stacked fluid membranes are investigated. We calculate the contributions to the
coupling longitudinal and transverse diffusion coefficients due to particle
motion within the different as well as the same membranes. The stacked geometry
leads to a hydrodynamic coupling between the two membranes.
