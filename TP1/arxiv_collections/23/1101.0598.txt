The first measurements of the W and Z cross sections in proton-proton
collisions at sqrt{s} = 7 TeV using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) have been completed. Cross sections in the electron and muon
channels, as well as the combined cross section, are presented for both the W
and the Z boson. The charge asymmetry of W production as a function of the
psuedorapidity of the lepton has also been measured.
