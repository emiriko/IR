We use molecular dynamics simulations to study the dynamics of an ensemble of
interacting self-propelled semi-flexible polymers in contact with a thermal
bath. Our intention is to model complex systems of biological interest. We find
that an effective temperature allows one to rationalize the out of equilibrium
dynamics of the system. This parameter is measured in several independent ways
-- from fluctuation-dissipation relations and by using tracer particles -- and
they all yield equivalent results. The effective temperature takes a higher
value than the temperature of the bath when the effect of the motors is not
correlated with the structural rearrangements they induce. We show how to use
this concept to interpret experimental results and suggest possible innovative
research directions.
