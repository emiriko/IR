Based on a study of real traffic data measured on American, UK and German
freeways common features of traffic congestion relevant for many transportation
engineering applications are revealed by the application of Kerner's
three-phase traffic theory. General features of traffic congestion, i.e.,
features of traffic breakdown and of the further development of congested
regions, are shown on freeways in the USA and UK beyond the previously known
German examples. A general proof of the theory's statements and its parameters
for international freeways is of high relevance for all applications related to
traffic congestion. The application ASDA/FOTO based on Kerner's three-phase
traffic theory demonstrates its capability to properly process raw traffic data
in different countries and environments. For the testing of Kerner's "line J",
representing the wide moving jam's downstream front, four different methods are
studied and compared for each congested traffic situation occurring in the
three countries.
