We simulate streamers in air at standard temperature and pressure in a short
overvolted gap. The simulation is performed with a 3D hybrid model that traces
the single electrons and photons in the low density region, while modeling the
streamer interior as a fluid. The photons are followed by a Monte-Carlo
procedure, just like the electrons. The first simulation result is present
here.
