Results of processing of data of a VLBI experiment titled RAPL01 are
presented. These VLBI observations were made on 4th February, 2010 at 6.28 cm
between the 100-m antenna of the Max Planck Institute (Effelsberg, Germany),
Puschino 22-m antenna (Astro Space Center (ASC), Russia), and two 32-m antennas
of the Istituto di Radioastronomia di Bologna (Bologna, Italy) in Noto and
Medicina. 2 well-known sources, 3C84 (0316+413), and BL Lac (2200+420) were
included in the schedule of observations. Each of them was observed during 1
hour at all the stations. The Mark-5A registration system was used at 3
European antennae. The alternative registration system known as RDR
(RADIOASTRON Data Recorder) was used in Puschino. The Puschino data were
recorded in format RDF (RADIOASTRON Data Format). Two standard recording modes
designed as 128-4-1 (one bit), and 256-4-2 (two bit) were used in the
experiment. All the Mark-5A data from European antennae were successfully
converted into the RDF format. Then, the correlation function was estimated at
the ASC software correlator. A similar correlation function also was estimated
at the Bonn correlator. The Bonn correlator reads Mark5A data, the RDF format
was converted into Mark5B format before correlation. The goal of the experiment
was to check the functioning and data analysis of the ground based radio
telescopes for the RADIOASTRON SVLBI mission
