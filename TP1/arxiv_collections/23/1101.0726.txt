We perform Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations of hypernuclear matter at
finite temperature and provide convenient analytical parametrizations of the
results. We study then the properties of (proto)neutron stars containing
hyperons. We find important effects of trapping and finite temperature on the
structure of hyperonic stars.
