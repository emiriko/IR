A case for the teaching of classical thermodynamics with an explicit time
variable, with phenomena involving changes in time, is made by presenting and
solving a exercise in textbook style, and pointing out that a solution accords
with experiment. The exercise requires an explicit treatment of the time
variable. Further arguments are given for the advantages of an explicit time
variable in classical thermodynamics, and against some standard terminology in
this theory.
