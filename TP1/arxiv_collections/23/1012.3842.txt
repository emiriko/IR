We investigate the prospects for non-standard interactions (NSI) in solar
neutrino propagation and detection and find that these may solve the tension
between the observed flatness of the SuperKamiokande electron spectrum and its
LMA prediction which has a clear negative slope. Also the Cl rate prediction
from NSI comes within 1$\sigma$ of its experimental value instead of the LMA
one which lies more than 2$\sigma$ above. A remarkable consequence of NSI for
solar neutrinos is the possibility of neutrino decay into majorons and
antineutrinos whose appearance probability is calculated but found to be rather
small.
