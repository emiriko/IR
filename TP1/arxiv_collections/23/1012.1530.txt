The processes of exclusive diffractive scattering $p+p\to p+p$, $\bar
p+p\to\bar p+p$, and $\gamma^*+p\to V+p$ at high energies are considered in the
framework of a unified Regge-eikonal model with a very simple reggeon structure
of the eikonal. It is demonstrated that the pomeron trajectory is universal in
all reactions and having intercept about 1.31 which could be exctracted
explicitly from the data on the proton structure function $F_2(x,Q^2)$. The
predictions for the proton-proton cross-sections at LHC energies are given.
