The radiative neutron capture on lithium-7 is calculated model independently
using a low energy halo effective field theory. The cross section is expressed
in terms of scattering parameters directly related to the S-matrix element. The
cross section depends on the poorly known p-wave effective range parameter r.
This constitutes the leading order uncertainty in traditional model
calculations. It is explicitly demonstrated by comparing with potential model
calculations. A single parameter fit describes the low energy data extremely
well and yields r = -1.47 fm^{-1}.
