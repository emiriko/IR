In this Chapter we introduce the aspects in which torsion can influence the
formalism of braneworld scenarios in general, and also how it is possible to
measure such kind of effects, namely, for instance, the blackstring transverse
area corrections and variation of quasar luminosity due to those corrections.
We analyze the projected effective Einstein equation in a 4-dimensional
arbitrary manifold embedded in a 5-dimensional Riemann-Cartan manifold. The
Israel-Darmois matching conditions are investigated, in the context where the
torsion discontinuity is orthogonal to the brane. Unexpectedly, the presence of
torsion terms in the connection does not modify such conditions whatsoever,
despite of the modification in the extrinsic curvature and in the connection.
Then, by imposing the Z2-symmetry, the Einstein equation obtained via
Gauss-Codazzi formalism is extended, in order to now encompass the torsion
terms. We also show that the factors involving contorsion change drastically
the effective Einstein equation on the brane, as well as the effective
cosmological constant. Also, we present gravitational aspects of braneworld
models endowed with torsion terms both in the bulk and on the brane. In order
to investigate a conceivable and measurable gravitational effect, arising
genuinely from bulk torsion terms, we analyze the variation in the black hole
area by the presence of torsion. Furthermore, we extend the well known results
about consistency conditions in a framework that incorporates brane torsion
terms. It is shown, in a rough estimate, that the resulting effects are
generally suppressed by the internal space volume.
