Expanding our previous work on turbulent whirls [1] we have uncovered a
similarity within the similarity shared by intense vortices. Using the new
information we compress the tangential velocity profiles of a diverse set of
vortices into one and thus identify those that belong to the same genus.
Examining the Laser Doppler Anemometer (LDA) results of mechanically produced
vortices and radar data of several tropical cyclones, we find that the uplift
and flattening effect of tangential velocity is a consequence of turbulence.
Reasoning by analogy we conclude that turbulence in the interstellar medium
could indeed introduce a flattening effect in the galactic rotation curves.
