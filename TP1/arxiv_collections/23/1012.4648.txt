A Lorentz and gauge symmetry preserving regularization method has been
proposed recently in 4 dimension based on Euclidean momentum cutoff. It is
shown that the triangle anomaly can be calculated unambiguously with this new
improved cutoff. The anticommutator of \gamma^{5} and \gamma^{\mu} multiplied
by five gamma is proportional to terms that do not vanish under a divergent
loop-momentum integral, but cancel otherwise.
