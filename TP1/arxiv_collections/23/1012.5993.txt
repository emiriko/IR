We study the singular set of a singular Levi-flat real-analytic hypersurface.
We prove that the singular set of such a hypersurface is Levi-flat in the
appropriate sense. We also show that if the singular set is small enough, then
the Levi-foliation extends to a singular codimension one holomorphic foliation
of a neighborhood of the hypersurface.
