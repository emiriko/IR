An update is presented to the software package SeBa for simulating single
star and binary evolution in which new stellar evolution tracks have been
implemented. SeBa is applied to study the population of close double white
dwarf and the delay time distribution of double white dwarf mergers that may
lead to Supernovae Type Ia.
