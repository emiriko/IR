Nucleosynthesis in the s process takes place in the He burning layers of low
mass AGB stars and during the He and C burning phases of massive stars. The s
process contributes about half of the element abundances between Cu and Bi in
solar system material. Depending on stellar mass and metallicity the resulting
s-abundance patterns exhibit characteristic features, which provide
comprehensive information for our understanding of the stellar life cycle and
for the chemical evolution of galaxies. The rapidly growing body of detailed
abundance observations, in particular for AGB and post-AGB stars, for objects
in binary systems, and for the very faint metal-poor population represents
exciting challenges and constraints for stellar model calculations. Based on
updated and improved nuclear physics data for the s-process reaction network,
current models are aiming at ab initio solution for the stellar physics related
to convection and mixing processes. Progress in the intimately related areas of
observations, nuclear and atomic physics, and stellar modeling is reviewed and
the corresponding interplay is illustrated by the general abundance patterns of
the elements beyond iron and by the effect of sensitive branching points along
the s-process path. The strong variations of the s-process efficiency with
metallicity bear also interesting consequences for Galactic chemical evolution.
