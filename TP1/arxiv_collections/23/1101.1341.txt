Quasiparticle tunneling across a Josephson junction sets a limit for the
lifetime of a superconducting qubit state. We develop a general theory of the
corresponding decay rate in a qubit controlled by a magnetic flux. The flux
affects quasiparticles tunneling amplitudes, thus making the decay rate
flux-dependent. The theory is applicable for an arbitrary quasiparticle
distribution. It provides estimates for the rates in practically important
quantum circuits and also offers a new way of measuring the phase-dependent
admittance of a Josephson junction.
