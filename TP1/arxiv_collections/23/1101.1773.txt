As a star evolves off the Main Sequence, it endures major structural changes
that are capable of determining the fate of the planets orbiting it. Throughout
its evolution along the Red Giant Branch, the star increases its radius by two
orders of magnitude. Later, during the Asymptotic Giant Branch, it loses most
of its initial mass. Finally, during the Planetary Nebulae phase, it emits
intense radiation before ultimately beginning its fade as a white dwarf. We
show how the several competing processes (stellar mass-loss, gravitational and
frictional drag, tidal forces, planet accretion and evaporation) affect the
survival of planets around evolved stars.
