The Article demonstrates the spontaneous symmetry breaking of isotropic
homogeneous elastic medium in form of transition from Euclidean to
Riemann-Cartan internal geometry of medium. The deformation of elastic medium
without defects is based on Euclidean geometry in three dimensional space. The
deformation of elastic medium with defects is based on Riemann-Cartan geometry
and is interpreted in this Article, as different phase state. In this article,
the expression for the free energy leading is equal to a volume integral of the
scalar function (the Lagrangian) that depends on metric and Ricci tensors only.
In the linear elastic isotropic case the elastic potential is a quadratic
function of the first and second invariants of strain and warp tensors with two
Lame, two mixed and two bending constants. The conditions of stability of media
are derived using expressions of free energy in two alternative phases.
Initially the defect-free phase is stable and remains stable, when the strain
is considerably small. With the increasing strain the stability conditions
could be violated. If the strain in material attains the critical value, the
pure geometric instability occurs. In other words, the medium undergoes the
spontaneous symmetry breaking in form of emerging topological defects and
transition to plastic flow.
