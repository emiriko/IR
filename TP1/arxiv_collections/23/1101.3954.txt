The development of techniques for manipulation of quantum information has
opened the door to a variety of protocols for accomplishing unprecedented
tasks. In particular, a new protocol of quantum teleportation was proposed in
2008 to achieve effective energy transportation simply via local operations and
classical communication without breaking any known physical laws. This is
achieved by extracting zero-point energy of entangled many-body systems by
local operations dependent on information obtained by a distant measurement.
The concept is reviewed from an introductory viewpoint herein.
