In the spin-1/2 frustrated chain with nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic exchange
J1 and next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange J2 under magnetic
field, magnetic multipolar-liquid (quadrupolar, octupolar, and hexadecapolar)
phases are widely expanded from the saturation down to a low-field regime.
Recently, we have clarified characteristic temperature and field dependence of
the NMR relaxation rate 1/T_1 in the quadrupolar phase. In this paper, we
examine those of 1/T_1 in the octupolar phase combining field theoretical
method with numerical data. The relevance of the results to quasi
one-dimensional J1-J2 magnets such as PbCuSO4(OH)2, Rb2Cu2Mo3O12 and Li2ZrCuO4
is shortly discussed.
