DAEdALUS is an experiment to measure the CP-violation angle in the neutrino
sector by producing multiple, intense beams of neutrinos from pion- and
muon-decays-at-rest near an ultra-large water Cerenkov detector. In this talk,
a design for the proposed Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory
in the U.S. was presented. DAEdALUS will be statistics-limited and have
different systematic errors than long baseline CP-violation searches. When the
data from both searches are combined, the sensitivity exceeds proton-driver
designs. In this proceeding, we briefly describe one of several alternative
cyclotron designs under consideration for DAEdALUS, as an example.
