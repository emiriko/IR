Context. The properties of the X-ray emission lines are a fundamental tool
for studying the nature of the matter surrounding the neutron star and the
phenomena that produce these lines. Aims. The aim of this work is to analyze
the X-ray spectrum of 4U 1538-52 obtained by the XMM-Newton observatory and to
look for the presence of diagnostic lines in the energy range 0.3-11.5 keV.
Methods. We used a 54 ks PN & MOS/XMM-Newton observation of the high mass X-ray
binary 4U 1538-52 covering the orbital phase between 0.75 to 1.00 (the
eclipse-ingress). We have modelled the 0.3-11.5 keV continuum emission with
three absorbed power laws and looked for the emission lines. Results. We found
previously unreported recombination lines, in this system, at 2.4 keV, 1.9 keV
and 1.3 keV, consistent with the presence of highly ionized states of S XV He?,
Si XIII He? and Mg K? or Mg XI He?. On the other hand, both out of eclipse and
in eclipse we detect a fluorescence iron emission line at 6.4 keV which is
resolved into two components: a narrow ($\sigma \leq$ 10 eV) fluorescence Fe K?
line plus one hot line from highly photoionized Fe XXV. Conclusions. The
detection of new recombination lines during eclipse-ingress in 4U 1538-52
indicates that there is an extended ionized region surrounding the neutron
star.
