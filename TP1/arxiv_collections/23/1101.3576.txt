We discuss an extended standard model electroweak sector which contains a
stable scalar dark matter particle, the D boson. To search for the D boson at
the LHC we exploit the flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) top quark decay,
t->c D D, mediated by the lightest standard model-like Higgs h^0 in a two Higgs
doublet model framework. The branching ratio for t->c D D in this case can be
as high as 10^{-3}, after taking into account constraints arising from the D
boson relic abundance. With an integrated luminosity of 10 (100) fb^{-1}, the
14 TeV LHC can explore values of this branching ratio that are one (two) order
of magnitude smaller in t\bar{t} production with t\bar{t}\to c \bar{b}
\ell^-(\bar{c}b\ell^+)+missing E_T. For a D boson mass <60 GeV, m_{h^0}< 2 M_Z,
10 fb^{-1} luminosity and a branching ratio BR(t->cDD)~10^{-4}, the estimated
number of signal events at the 14 TeV LHC is of order 80.
