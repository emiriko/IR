Ultra-relativistic gold-gold and proton-proton collisions are investigated in
the experiments of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). In the last
several years large amount of results were revealed about the matter created in
these collisions. The latest PHENIX results for femtoscopy and correlations are
reviewed in this paper. Bose-Einstein correlations of charged kaons in 200 GeV
Au+Au collisions and of charged pions in 200 GeV p+p collisions are shown. They
are both compatible with previous measurements of charged pions in gold-gold
collisions, with respect to transverse mass or number of participants scaling.
