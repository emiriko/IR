Since the external regions of the envelopes of rapidly rotating early-type
stars are unstable to convection, a coupling may exist between the convection
and the internal rotation. We explore what can be learned from spectroscopic
and interferometric observations about the properties of the rotation law in
the external layers of these objects. Using simple relations between the
entropy and specific rotational quantities, some of which are found to be
efficient at accounting for the solar differential rotation in the convective
region, we derived analytical solutions that represent possible differential
rotations in the envelope of early-type stars. A surface latitudinal
differential rotation may not only be an external imprint of the inner
rotation, but induces changes in the stellar geometry, the gravitational
darkening, the aspect of spectral line profiles, and the emitted spectral
energy distribution. By studying the equation of the surface of stars with
non-conservative rotation laws, we conclude that objects undergo geometrical
deformations that are a function of the latitudinal differential rotation able
to be scrutinized both spectroscopically and by interferometry. The combination
of Fourier analysis of spectral lines with model atmospheres provides
independent estimates of the surface latitudinal differential rotation and the
inclination angle. Models of stars at different evolutionary stages rotating
with internal conservative rotation laws were calculated to show that the Roche
approximation can be safely used to account for the gravitational potential.
The surface temperature gradient in rapid rotators induce an acceleration to
the surface angular velocity. A non-zero differential rotation parameter may
indicate that the rotation is neither rigid nor shellular underneath the
stellar surface.
