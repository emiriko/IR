Swimming organisms in their natural habitat navigate through a wide array of
geometries and chemical environments. Interaction with the boundaries is
ubiquitous and can significantly modify the swimming characteristics of the
organism as observed under ideal conditions. We study the dynamics of ciliary
locomotion in Paramecium multimicronucleatum and observe the effect of the
solid boundaries on the velocities in the near field of the organism.
Experimental observations show that Paramecium executes helical trajectories
that slowly transition to straight line motion as the diameter of the capillary
tubes decrease. Theoretically this system is modeled as an undulating cylinder
with pressure gradient and compared with experiments; showing that such
considerations are necessary for modeling finite sized organisms in the
restrictive geometries.
