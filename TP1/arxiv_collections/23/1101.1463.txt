We derive an energy-independent and non-local potential for the baryon-baryon
interaction from the Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter amplitude on the lattice. The method
is applied to the nucleon-nucleon interactions with the (2+1)-flavor lattice
QCD simulations. The central and tensor potentials are obtained as leading
order terms of the velocity expansion of the non-local potential: The central
potential has a repulsive core surrounded by an attractive well, while the
tensor potential has intermediate and long range attractions. Validity of the
velocity expansions tested by the nucleon-nucleon interaction with finite
relative momentum. Interactions among octet-baryons in the flavor SU(3) limit
are also studied in full QCD simulations to unravel the origin of the repulsive
core and the possible existence of $H$-dibaryon.
