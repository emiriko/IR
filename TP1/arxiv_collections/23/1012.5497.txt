We investigate the possibility of electron pairing in small metallic
nanoparticles at zero temperature. In these particles both electrons and
phonons are mesoscopic, i.e. modified by the nanoparticle's finite size. The
electrons, the phonons, and their interaction are described within the
framework of a simplified model. The effective electron-electron interaction is
derived from the underlying electron-phonon interaction. The effect of both
effective interaction and Coulomb interaction on the electronic spectrum is
evaluated. Results are presented for aluminum, zinc and potassium nanoparticles
containing a few hundred atoms. We find that a large portion of the aluminum
and zinc particles exhibit modifications in their electronic spectrum due to
pairing correlations, while pairing correlations are not present in the
potassium particles.
