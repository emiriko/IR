Practical applications of graphene require a reliable high-throughput method
of graphene identification and quality control, which can be used for
large-scale substrates and wafers. We have proposed and experimentally tested a
fast and fully automated approach for determining the number of atomic planes
in graphene samples. The procedure allows for in situ identification of the
borders of the regions with the same number of atomic planes. It is based on an
original image processing algorithm, which utilizes micro-Raman calibration,
light background subtraction, lighting non-uniformity correction, and the color
and grayscale image processing for each pixel. The outcome of the developed
procedure is a pseudo-color map, which marks the single-layer and few-layer
graphene regions on the substrate of any size that can be captured by an
optical microscope. Our approach works for various substrates, and can be
applied to the mechanically exfoliated, chemically derived, deposited or
epitaxial graphene on an industrial scale.
