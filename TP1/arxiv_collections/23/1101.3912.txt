We aim to study excitation of the observed 5-min oscillations in the solar
corona by localized pulses that are launched in the photosphere. We solve the
full set of nonlinear one-dimensional Euler equations numerically for the
velocity pulse propagating in the solar atmosphere that is determined by the
realistic temperature profile. Numerical simulations show that an initial
velocity pulse quickly steepens into a leading shock, while the nonlinear wake
in the chromosphere leads to the formation of consecutive pulses. The time
interval between arrivals of two neighboring pulses to a detection point in the
corona is approximately 5 min. Therefore, the consecutive pulses may result in
the 5-min oscillations that are observed in the solar corona. The 5-min
oscillations observed in the solar corona can be explained in terms of
consecutive shocks that result from impulsive triggers launched within the
solar photosphere by granulation and/or reconnection.
