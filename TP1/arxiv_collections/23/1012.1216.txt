It is commonly believed that most of the stars born in associations decaying
with characteristic velocities of stars ~10 km/s. For dwarf galaxies the decay
can lead to ejection of stars from the galaxy. The effect is studied for
spheroidal and disk dwarf galaxies, and is shown to have substantional
observational consequences for disk galaxies with escape velocities up to 20
km/s, or dynamical masses up to 10^8 M_sol. The ejection of stars can (i)
reduce the abundances of the products of Type Ia supernovae and, to a lesser
degree, Type II supernovae, in disk stars, (ii) chemically enrich the galactic
halo and intergalactic medium, (iii) lead to the loss of 50% of the stellar
mass in galaxies with masses ~10^7 M_sol and the loss of all stars in system
with masses 10^5 M_sol, (iv) increase the mass-to-luminosity ratio of the
galaxies.
