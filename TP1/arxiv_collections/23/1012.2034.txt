We define and study a new notion of "robust simulations" between complexity
classes which is intermediate between the traditional notions of
infinitely-often and almost-everywhere, as well as a corresponding notion of
"significant separations". A language L has a robust simulation in a complexity
class C if there is a language in C which agrees with L on arbitrarily large
polynomial stretches of input lengths. There is a significant separation of L
from C if there is no robust simulation of L in C. The new notion of simulation
is a cleaner and more natural notion of simulation than the infinitely-often
notion. We show that various implications in complexity theory such as the
collapse of PH if NP = P and the Karp-Lipton theorem have analogues for robust
simulations. We then use these results to prove that most known separations in
complexity theory, such as hierarchy theorems, fixed polynomial circuit lower
bounds, time-space tradeoffs, and the theorems of Allender and Williams, can be
strengthened to significant separations, though in each case, an almost
everywhere separation is unknown.
  Proving our results requires several new ideas, including a completely
different proof of the hierarchy theorem for non-deterministic polynomial time
than the ones previously known.
