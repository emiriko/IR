We present new observations of the CB130 region, composed of three separate
cores. Using the \textit{Spitzer Space Telescope} we detected a Class 0 and a
Class II object in one of these, CB130-1. The observed photometric data from
\textit{Spitzer} and ground-based telescopes are used to establish the physical
parameters of the Class 0 object. SED fitting with a radiative transfer model
shows that the luminosity of the Class 0 object is 0.14 $-$ 0.16 L$_{\odot}$,
which is a low luminosity for a protostellar object. In order to constrain the
chemical characteristics of the core having the low luminosity object, we
compare our molecular line observations to models of lines including abundance
variations. We tested both ad hoc step function abundance models and a series
of self-consistent chemical evolution models. In the chemical evolution models,
we consider a continuous accretion model and an episodic accretion model to
explore how variable luminosity affects the chemistry. The step function
abundance models can match observed lines reasonably well. The best fitting
chemical evolution model requires episodic accretion and the formation of
CO$_2$ ice from CO ice during the low luminosity periods. This process removes
C from the gas phase, providing a much improved fit to the observed gas-phase
molecular lines and the CO$_2$ ice absorption feature. Based on the chemical
model result, the low luminosity of CB130-1 is explained better as a quiescent
stage between episodic accretion bursts rather than being at the first
hydrostatic core stage.
