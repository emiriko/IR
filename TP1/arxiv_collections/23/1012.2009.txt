Interplay between changes of energy levels and tunneling amplitudes caused by
localized electrons on-site Coulomb interaction depending on non-equilibrium
electron filling numbers is analyzed. Specific features of local tunneling
conductivity spectra for different positions of localized states energy
relative to the Fermi level have been investigated by means of self-consistent
mean field approximation in the presence of non-equilibrium effects. The
conditions when modifications of tunneling transfer amplitude due to changes of
electron filling numbers in the presence of on-site Coulomb interaction should
be taken into account in tunneling conductivity spectra have been revealed.
