We extend the well-known Borromean and Brunnian rings to new higher order
versions. Then we suggest an extension of the connection between Efimov states
in cold gases and Borromean and Brunnian rings to these new higher order links.
This gives rise to a whole new hierarchy of possible states with Efimov states
at the bottom.
