We theoretically study the optical properties of an InAs/GaAs quantum dot
(QD) near the area of the second-order resonance between an electron confined
in the QD and two longitudinal optical phonons. We present the absorption
spectra of an inhomogeneously broadened QD ensemble and show that the minimal
model needed for an accurate description of such a system needs to account for
3-phonon states. We study also the influence of the QD height to width ratio on
the optical properties of the polaron system. The dependence of the width of
the resonance and the position of the second-order resonant feature on the
height to width ratio is presented.
