Experiments at high luminosity electron-positron colliders allow to study the
kaon and the pion form factors in the time-like region up to high energies.
Also the kaon and the pion pair production at and around the narrow resonances
J/psi and psi(2S) can be investigated, with the interference between
electromagnetic and hadronic amplitudes as one of the most interesting
phenomenas. Parameterisations of charged and neutral kaon as well as pion form
factors, which lead to an improved description of the data in the region of
large invariant masses of the meson pair, are presented. They are implemented
into the Monte Carlo generator PHOKHARA, together with the hadronic couplings
of charged and neutral kaons to J/psi and psi(2S). The physics case as well as
details of the implementation are discussed.
