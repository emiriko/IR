Our Chemical e-Science Information Cloud (ChemCloud) - a Semantic Web based
eScience infrastructure - integrates and automates a multitude of databases,
tools and services in the domain of chemistry, pharmacy and bio-chemistry
available at the Fachinformationszentrum Chemie (FIZ Chemie), at the Freie
Universitaet Berlin (FUB), and on the public Web. Based on the approach of the
W3C Linked Open Data initiative and the W3C Semantic Web technologies for
ontologies and rules it semantically links and integrates knowledge from our
W3C HCLS knowledge base hosted at the FUB, our multi-domain knowledge base
DBpedia (Deutschland) implemented at FUB, which is extracted from Wikipedia
(De) providing a public semantic resource for chemistry, and our
well-established databases at FIZ Chemie such as ChemInform for organic
reaction data, InfoTherm the leading source for thermophysical data, Chemisches
Zentralblatt, the complete chemistry knowledge from 1830 to 1969, and
ChemgaPedia the largest and most frequented e-Learning platform for Chemistry
and related sciences in German language.
