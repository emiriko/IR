We show that a suitable combination of geometric frustration, ferromagnetism
and spin-orbit interactions can give rise to nearly flat bands with a large
bandgap and non-zero Chern number. Partial filling of the flat band can give
rise to fractional quantum Hall states at high temperatures (maybe even room
temperature). While the identification of material candidates with suitable
parameters remains open, our work indicates intriguing directions for
exploration and synthesis.
