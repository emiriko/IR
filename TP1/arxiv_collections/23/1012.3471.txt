We present mock DensePak Integral Field Unit (IFU) velocity fields, rotation
curves, and halo fits for disc galaxies formed in spherical and triaxial cuspy
dark matter haloes, and spherical cored dark matter haloes. The simulated
galaxies are "observed" under a variety of realistic conditions to determine
how well the underlying dark matter halo can be recovered and to test the
hypothesis that cuspy haloes can be mistaken for cored haloes. We find that the
appearance of the velocity field is distinctly different depending on the
underlying halo type. We also find that we can successfully recover the
parameters of the underlying dark matter halo. Cuspy haloes appear cuspy in the
data and cored haloes appear cored. Our results suggest that the cores observed
using high-resolution velocity fields in real dark matter-dominated galaxies
are genuine and cannot be ascribed to systematic errors, halo triaxiality, or
non-circular motions.
