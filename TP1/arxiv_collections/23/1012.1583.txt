Transient radio phenomena and pulsars are one of six LOFAR Key Science
Projects (KSPs). As part of the Transients KSP, the Pulsar Working Group (PWG)
has been developing the LOFAR Pulsar Data Pipelines to both study known pulsars
as well as search for new ones. The pipelines are being developed for the Blue
Gene/P (BG/P) supercomputer and a large Linux cluster in order to utilize
enormous amounts of computational capabilities (50Tflops) to process data
streams of up to 23TB/hour. The LOFAR pipeline output will be using the
Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) to efficiently store large amounts of
numerical data, and to manage complex data encompassing a variety of data
types, across distributed storage and processing architectures. We present the
LOFAR Known Pulsar Data Pipeline overview, the pulsar beam-formed data format,
the status of the pipeline processing as well as our future plans for
developing the LOFAR Pulsar Search Pipeline. These LOFAR pipelines and software
tools are being developed as the next generation toolset for pulsar processing
in Radio Astronomy.
