The post-processing of passively advected Lagrangian tracer particles is
still the most common way for obtaining detailed nucleosynthetic yield
predictions of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) hydrodynamical simulations.
Historically, tracer particles of constant mass are employed. However,
intermediate mass elements, such as e.g. Ne, Mg, Al, or Si, are typically
synthesized in the outer layers of SNe Ia, where due to the lower initial
density a constant mass tracer distribution results in poor resolution of the
spatial morphology of the abundance distribution. We show how to alleviate this
problem with a suitably chosen distribution of variable tracer particle masses.
We also present results of the convergence of integrated nucleosynthetic yields
with increasing tracer particle number. We find that the yields of the most
abundant species (mass fraction > 10E-5) are reasonably well predicted for a
tracer number as small as 32 per axis and direction. Convergence for isotopes
produced in regions where a constant tracer mass implementation results in poor
spatial resolution can be improved by suitably choosing tracers of variable
mass.
