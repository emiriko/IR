In high energy heavy ion collisions a hot and dense medium is formed, where
the hadronic masses may be shifted from their asymptotic values. If this mass
modification occurs, squeezed back-to-back correlations (BBC) of
particle-antiparticle pairs are predicted to appear, both in the femionic
(fBBC) and in the bosonic (bBBC) sectors. Although they have unlimited
intensity even for finite-size expanding systems, these hadronic squeezed
correlations are very sensitive to their time emission distribution. Here we
discuss results in case this time emission is parameterized by a Levy-type
distribution, showing that it reduces the signal even more dramatically than a
Lorentzian distribution, which already reduces the intensity of the effect by
orders of magnitude, as compared to the sudden emission. However, we show that
the signal could still survive if the duration of the process is short, and if
the effect is searched for lighter mesons, such as kaons. We compare some of
our results to recent PHENIX preliminary data on squeezed correlations of
K^+K^- pairs.
