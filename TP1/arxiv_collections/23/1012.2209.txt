We show that in the quantum case any work distribution can be related to an
equilibrium correlation function in an extended Hilbert space. As a consequence
of this identification the Crooks relation is a restatement of the detailed
balance principle for equilibrium correlation functions. The presented
derivation serves as an alternative proof of the Crooks relation residing only
on the detailed balance principle.
