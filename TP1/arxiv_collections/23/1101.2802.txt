The ALICE experiment is equipped with electromagnetic calorimeters of two
different types: PHOS, the lead-tungstate photon spectrometer, and EMCAL, the
sampling lead-scintillator calorimeter. These two detectors measure photon
spectra in a wide kinematic range and allow the reconstruction of neutral
mesons decaying into photons. The measurement of the inclusive spectra of
neutral meson production in pp collisions will not only provide a test of
perturbative QCD but also important reference data for future heavy-ion
measurements. The status of the analysis of the data accumulated during the LHC
proton-proton runs at collision energies of 7 TeV and 900 GeV is shown, and the
feasibility to measure the pi0 and eta meson spectra in proton-proton
collisions is demonstrated.
