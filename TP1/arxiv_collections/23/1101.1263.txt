The behavior of a Bose--Einstein condensate in a homogeneous gravitational
field is analyzed. We consider two different trapping potentials. Firstly, the
gas is inside a finite container. The effects of the finiteness of the height
of the container in connection with the presence of a homogeneous gravitational
field are mathematically analyzed and the resulting energy eigenvalues are
deduced and used to obtain the corresponding partition function and the ensuing
thermodynamical properties. Secondly, the trapping potential is an anisotropic
harmonic oscillator and the effects of the gravitational field and of the
zero--point energy on the condensation temperature are also considered. These
results are employed in order to put forward an experiment which could test the
so called Einstein Equivalence Principle.
