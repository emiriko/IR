We review recent progress in understanding the arrival time problem in
quantum mechanics, from the point of view of the decoherent histories approach
to quantum theory. We begin by discussing the arrival time problem, focussing
in particular on the role of the probability current in the expected classical
solution. After a brief introduction to decoherent histories we review the use
of complex potentials in the construction of appropriate class operators. We
then discuss the arrival time problem for a particle coupled to an environment,
and review how the arrival time probability can be expressed in terms of a POVM
in this case. We turn finally to the question of decoherence of the
corresponding histories, and we show that this can be achieved for simple
states in the case of a free particle, and for general states for a particle
coupled to an environment.
