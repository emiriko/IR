We use ultrafast laser pulses to experimentally demonstrate that the
second-order optical response of bulk single crystals of the topological
insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ is sensitive to its surface electrons. By performing
surface doping dependence measurements as a function of photon polarization and
sample orientation we show that second harmonic generation can simultaneously
probe both the surface crystalline structure and the surface charge of
Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Furthermore, we find that second harmonic generation using
circularly polarized photons reveals the time-reversal symmetry properties of
the system and is surprisingly robust against surface charging, which makes it
a promising tool for spectroscopic studies of topological surfaces and buried
interfaces.
