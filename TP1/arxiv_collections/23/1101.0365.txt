We extend the Standard Model by adding two gauge-singlet $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$%
-symmetric scalar fields that interact with visible matter only through the
Higgs particle. One is a stable dark matter WIMP, and the other one undergoes a
spontaneous breaking of the symmetry that opens new channels for the dark
matter annihilation, hence lowering the mass of the WIMP. We study the effects
of the observed dark matter relic abundance on the annihilation cross section
and find that in most regions of the parameters space, light dark matter is
viable. We also compare the elastic scattering cross-section of our dark matter
candidate off nucleus with existing (CDMSII and XENON100) and projected
(SuperCDMS and XENON1T) experimental exclusion bounds. We find that most of the
allowed mass range for light dark matter will be probed by the projected
sensitivity of XENON1T experiment.
