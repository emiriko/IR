In order to assess the role of ghosts in cosmology, we study the evolution of
linear cosmological perturbations during inflation when a Weyl term is added to
the action. Our main result is that vector perturbations can no longer be
ignored and that scalar modes diverge in the newtonian gauge but remain bounded
in the comoving slicing.
