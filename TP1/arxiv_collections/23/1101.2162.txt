Based on a new coinductive characterization of continuous functions we
extract certified programs for exact real number computation from constructive
proofs. The extracted programs construct and combine exact real number
algorithms with respect to the binary signed digit representation of real
numbers. The data type corresponding to the coinductive definition of
continuous functions consists of finitely branching non-wellfounded trees
describing when the algorithm writes and reads digits. We discuss several
examples including the extraction of programs for polynomials up to degree two
and the definite integral of continuous maps.
