Engineered systems are designed to deftly operate under predetermined
conditions yet are notoriously fragile when unexpected perturbations arise. In
contrast, biological systems operate in a highly flexible manner; learn quickly
adequate responses to novel conditions, and evolve new routines/traits to
remain competitive under persistent environmental change. A recent theory on
the origins of biological flexibility has proposed that degeneracy - the
existence of multi-functional components with partially overlapping functions -
is a primary determinant of the robustness and adaptability found in evolved
systems. While degeneracy's contribution to biological flexibility is well
documented, there has been little investigation of degeneracy design principles
for achieving flexibility in systems engineering. Actually, the conditions that
can lead to degeneracy are routinely eliminated in engineering design.
  With the planning of transportation vehicle fleets taken as a case study,
this paper reports evidence that degeneracy improves robustness and
adaptability of a simulated fleet without incurring costs to efficiency. We
find degeneracy dramatically increases robustness of a fleet to unpredicted
changes in the environment while it also facilitates robustness to anticipated
variations. When we allow a fleet's architecture to be adapted in response to
environmental change, we find degeneracy can be selectively acquired, leading
to faster rates of design adaptation and ultimately to better designs. Given
the range of conditions where favorable short-term and long-term performance
outcomes are observed, we propose that degeneracy design principles
fundamentally alter the propensity for adaptation and may be useful within
several engineering and planning contexts.
