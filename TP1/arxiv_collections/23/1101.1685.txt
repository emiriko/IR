Using public HIRISE images of MARS, I derive the wind directions at high
Northern lattitudes, where many interesting eolian features are observed.
BArchan dunes show prominent wind direction from the North indicating that they
formed during the southern summer. But a few record consistent SE winds near
the UTOPIA PLANITIA basin. The wind reversal is consistent with a local
perturbation of the solsticial Hadley cell caused by geological depression.
