We investigate thermodynamics and quantum criticality of strongly attractive
Fermi gases confined in a one-dimensional (1D) harmonic trap. Finite
temperature density profiles, entropy, compressibility and susceptibility of
the trapped gas are studied using analytic results for the thermodynamics
within the local density approximation. We demonstrate that current experiments
are capable of measuring universal Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid physics and
quantum criticality of 1D strongly interacting Fermi gases. The results provide
insights on recent measurements of key features of the phase diagram of a
spin-imbalanced atomic Fermi gas [Liao et al., Nature 467, 567 (2010)] and
point to further study of quantum critical phenomena in ultracold atomic Fermi
gases.
