The visualization of any graph plays important role in various aspects, such
as graph drawing software. Complex systems (like large databases or networks)
that have a graph structure should be properly visualized in order to avoid
obfuscation. One way to provide an aesthetic improvement to a graph
visualization is to apply a force-directed drawing algorithm to it. This
method, that emerged in the 60's views graphs as spring systems that exert
forces (repulsive or attractive) to the nodes.
  A Lombardi drawing of a graph is a drawing where the edges are drawn as
circular arcs (straight edges are considered circular arcs of infinite radius)
with perfect angular resolution. This means, that consecutive edges around a
vertex are equally spaced around it. In other words, each angle between the
tangents of two consecutive edges is equal to $2\pi/d$ where d is the degree of
that specific vertex. The requirement of using circular edges in graphs when we
want to provide perfect angular resolution is necessary, since even cycle
graphs cannot be drawn with straight edges when perfect angular resolution is
needed.
  In this survey, we provide an algorithm that takes as input a random drawing
of a graph and provides its Lombardi drawing, giving a proper visualization of
the graph.
