We investigate the dynamics of domain wall in ferromagnetic nanowire with
spin-transfer torque. The critical current condition is obtained analytically.
Below the critical current, we get the static domain wall solution which shows
that the spin-polarized current can't drive domain wall moving continuously. In
this case, the spin-transfer torque plays both the anti-precession and
anti-damping roles, which counteracts not only the spin-precession driven by
the effective field but also Gilbert damping to the moment. Above the critical
value, the dynamics of domain wall exhibits the novel screw-pitch effect
characterized by the temporal oscillation of domain wall velocity and width,
respectively. Both the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation
demonstrate that this novel phenomenon arise from the conjunctive action of
Gilbert-damping and spin-transfer torque. We also find that the roles of
spin-transfer torque are entirely contrary for the cases of below and above the
critical current.
