The associated production of direct photons and heavy quarks at the LHC is
presented. Predictions for the nuclear modification factor to the cross-section
at ALICE are shown. It is demonstrated that this process is a great probe of
the gluon and heavy quark nuclear PDFs, as over 80 % of its nPDF dependence at
NLO comes from those nPDFs. Therefore measurements of this process will provide
an excellent constraint on the gluon nPDF, and will distinguish between
different nPDF sets currently out on the market.
