Pulsars are powerful sources of radiation across the electromagnetic
spectrum. This paper highlights some theoretical insights into non-thermal,
magnetospheric pulsar gamma-ray radiation. These advances have been driven by
NASA's Fermi mission, launched in mid-2008. The Large Area Telescope (LAT)
instrument on Fermi has afforded the discrimination between polar cap and slot
gap/outer gap acceleration zones in young and middle-aged pulsars. Altitude
discernment using the highest energy pulsar photons will be addressed, as will
spectroscopic interpretation of the primary radiation mechanism in the LAT
band, connecting to both polar cap/slot gap and outer gap scenarios. Focuses
will mostly be on curvature radiation and magnetic pair creation, including
population trends that may afford probes of the magnetospheric accelerating
potential.
