Using a combination of ultraviolet-vacuum ultraviolet reflectivity and
spectroscopic ellipsometry, we observe a resonant exciton at an unusually high
energy of 6.3eV in epitaxial graphene. Surprisingly, the resonant exciton
occurs at room temperature and for a very large number of graphene layers
$N$$\approx$75, thus suggesting a poor screening in graphene. The optical
conductivity ($\sigma_1$) of resonant exciton scales linearly with number of
graphene layer (up to \emph{at least} 8 layers) implying quantum character of
electrons in graphene. Furthermore, a prominent excitation at 5.4eV, which is a
mixture of interband transitions from $\pi$ to $\pi^{*}$ at the M point and a
$\pi$ plasmonic excitation, is observed. In contrast, for graphite the resonant
exciton is not observable but strong interband transitions are seen instead.
Supported by theoretical calculations, for $N \leq$ 28 the $\sigma_1$ is
dominated by the resonant exciton, while for $N >$ 28 it is a mixture between
exitonic and interband transitions. The latter is characteristic for graphite,
indicating a crossover in the electronic structure. Our study shows that
important elementary excitations in graphene occur at high binding energies and
elucidate the differences in the way electrons interact in graphene and
graphite.
