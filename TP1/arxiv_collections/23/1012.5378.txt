Global and local Weyl modules for the untwisted multiloop Lie algebras were
defined by Chari, the first and the second author via homological properties.
In this paper we extended the ideas to give a categorical definition of the
Weyl modules for twisted multiloop algebras. Our methods led us to describe an
identification of the finite--dimensional highest weight modules for twisted
multiloop algebras with suitably chosen finite--dimensional highest weight
modules for untwisted multiloop algebras.
