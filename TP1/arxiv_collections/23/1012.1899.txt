In this work, we develop an intelligent user interface that allows users to
enter biomedical queries in a natural language, and that presents the answers
(possibly with explanations if requested) in a natural language. We develop a
rule layer over biomedical ontologies and databases, and use automated
reasoners to answer queries considering relevant parts of the rule layer.
