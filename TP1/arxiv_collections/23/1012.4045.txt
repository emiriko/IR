This paper describes a study of comparison of global and one-dimensional
local optimization methods to operating system scheduler tuning. The operating
system scheduler we use is the Linux 2.6.23 Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)
running in simulator (LinSched). We have ported the Hackbench scheduler
benchmark to this simulator and use this as the workload. The global
optimization approach we use is Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We make use
of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to specify optimal parameters for our PSO
implementation. The one-dimensional local optimization approach we use is the
Golden Section method. In order to use this approach, we convert the scheduler
tuning problem from one involving setting of three parameters to one involving
the manipulation of one parameter. Our results show that the global
optimization approach yields better response but the one- dimensional
optimization approach converges to a solution faster than the global
optimization approach.
