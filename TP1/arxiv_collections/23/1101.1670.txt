In this paper, we proceed to develop a new approach which was formulated
first in Ershkov (2017) for solving Poisson equations: a new type of the
solving procedure for Euler-Poisson equations (rigid body rotation over the
fixed point) is suggested in the current research. Meanwhile, the Euler-Poisson
system of equations has been successfully explored for the existence of
analytical way for presentation of the solution. As the main result, the new
ansatz is suggested for solving Euler-Poisson equations: the Euler-Poisson
equations are reduced to the system of 3 nonlinear ordinary differential
equations of 1-st order in regard to 3 functions; the elegant approximate
solution has been obtained via re-inversion of the proper analytical integral
as a set of quasi-periodic cycles. So, the system of Euler-Poisson equations is
proved to have the analytical solutions (in quadratures) only in classical
simplifying cases: 1) Lagrange case, or 2) Kovalevskaya case or 3) Euler case
or other well-known but particular cases.
