We provide a Lagrangian formulation of \Nf supersymmetric mechanics
describing the motion of an isospin carrying particle on conformal to
hyper-K\"{a}hler spaces in a non-Abelian background gauge field. In two
examples we discuss in details, this background field is identified with the
field of BPST instantons in the flat and Taub-NUT spaces.
