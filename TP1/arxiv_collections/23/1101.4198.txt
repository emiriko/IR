We present an experimental and theoretical study of a magnetic
single-molecule transistor based on N@C60 connected to gold electrodes.
Particular attention is paid to the regime of intermediate molecule-lead
coupling, where cotunneling effects manifest themselves in the Coulomb-blockade
regime. The experimental results for the differential conductance as a function
of bias, gate voltage, and external magnetic field are in agreement with our
analysis of the tunneling rates and provide evidence of magnetic signatures in
single-N@C60 devices arising from an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction
between the C60 spin and the nitrogen spin.
