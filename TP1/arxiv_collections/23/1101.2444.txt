The effective coupling `constants' of physics, especially the cosmological
constant, are observed to have highly biophilic values. If this is not a hugely
improbable accident, or a consequence of some mysterious logical necessity or
of some simple principle of physics, it might be explained as a consequence
either of an observership selection principle within a multiverse of many sets
of effective coupling constants, or else of some biophilic principle that fine
tunes the constants of physics to optimize life. Here a very preliminary
inconclusive hint of evidence is presented against the hypothesis of optimal
fine tuning of the cosmological constant by a biophilic principle that would
maximize the fraction of baryons that form living organisms or observers.
