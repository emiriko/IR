We perform a systematic study of incoherent transport in the high temperature
crossover region of the half-filled one-band Hubbard model. We demonstrate that
the family of resistivity curves displays characteristic quantum critical
scaling of the form $\rho(\delta U,T)=\rho_{c}(T)f(T/T_{o}(\delta U))$, with
$T_{o}(\delta U)\sim\delta U^{z\nu}$, and $\rho_{c}(T)\sim T$. The
corresponding $\beta$-function displays a "strong coupling" form
$\beta\sim\ln(\rho_{c}/\rho)$, reflecting the peculiar mirror symmetry of the
scaling curves. This behavior, which is surprisingly similar to some
experimental findings, indicates that Mott quantum criticality may be acting as
the fundamental mechanism behind the unusual transport phenomena in many
systems near the metal-insulator transition.
