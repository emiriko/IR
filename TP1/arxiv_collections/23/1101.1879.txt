We present the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Feed Array HI (GALFA-HI) survey, and
its first full data release (DR1). GALFA-HI is a high resolution (~ 4'), large
area (13000 deg^2), high spectral resolution (0.18 km/s), wide band (-700 <
v_LSR < +700 km/s) survey of the Galactic interstellar medium in the 21-cm line
hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen conducted at Arecibo Observatory.
Typical noise levels are 80 mK RMS in an integrated 1 km/s channel. GALFA-HI is
a dramatic step forward in high-resolution, large-area Galactic HI surveys, and
we compare GALFA-HI to past, present, and future Galactic HI surveys. We
describe in detail new techniques we have developed to reduce these data in the
presence of fixed pattern noise, gain variation, and inconsistent beam shapes,
and we show how we have largely mitigated these effects. We present our first
full data release, covering 7520 square degrees of sky and representing 3046
hours of integration time, and discuss the details of these data.
