We present an IRAC 3.6+4.5 microns selected catalog in the Extended Groth
Strip (EGS) containing photometry from the ultraviolet to the far-infrared and
stellar parameters derived from the analysis of the multi-wavelength data. In
this paper, we describe the method used to build coherent spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) for all the sources. In a companion paper, we analyze
those SEDs to obtain robust estimations of stellar parameters such as
photometric redshifts, stellar masses, and star formation rates. The catalog
comprises 76,936 sources with [3.6]<23.75 mag (85% completeness level of the
IRAC survey in the EGS) over 0.48 square degrees. For approximately 16% of this
sample, we are able to deconvolve the IRAC data to obtain robust fluxes for the
multiple counterparts found in ground-based optical images. Typically, the SEDs
of the IRAC sources in our catalog count with more than 15 photometric data
points, spanning from the UV to the FIR. Approximately 95% and 90% of all IRAC
sources are detected in the deepest optical and near-infrared bands. Only 10%
of the sources have optical spectroscopy and redshift estimations. Almost 20%
and 2% of the sources are detected by MIPS at 24 and 70 microns, respectively.
We also cross-correlate our catalog with public X-ray and radio catalogs.
Finally, we present the Rainbow Navigator public web-interface utility designed
to browse all the data products resulting from this work, including images,
spectra, photometry, and stellar parameters.
