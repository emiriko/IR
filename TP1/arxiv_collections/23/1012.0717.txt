Several lunar missions are planned ahead and there is an increasing demand
for efficient photovoltaic power generation in the moon. The knowledge of solar
cell operation in the lunar surface obtained during early seventies need to be
updated considering current views on solar variability and emerging space solar
cell technologies. In this paper some aspects of the solar cell performance
expected under variable lunar radiation environment during future space
missions to moon are addressed. We have calculated relative power expected from
different types of solar cells under extreme solar proton irradiation
conditions and high lunar daytime temperature. It is also estimated that 2-3 %
of annual solar cell degradation is most probable during the future lunar
missions. We have also discussed photovoltaic power generation in long term
lunar bases emphasizing technological needs such as sunlight concentration,
solar cell cooling and magnetic shielding of radiation for improving the
efficiency of solar cells in the lunar environment.
