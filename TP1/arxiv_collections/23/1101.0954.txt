The detection of small mass planets with the radial-velocity technique is now
confronted with the interference of stellar noise. HARPS can now reach a
precision below the meter-per-second, which corresponds to the amplitudes of
different stellar perturbations, such as oscillation, granulation, and
activity. Solar spot groups induced by activity produce a radial-velocity noise
of a few meter-per-second. The aim of this paper is to simulate this activity
and calculate detection limits according to different observational strategies.
Based on Sun observations, we reproduce the evolution of spot groups on the
surface of a rotating star. We then calculate the radial-velocity effect
induced by these spot groups as a function of time. Taking into account
oscillation, granulation, activity, and a HARPS instrumental error of 80 cm/s,
we simulate the effect of different observational strategies in order to
efficiently reduce all sources of noise. Applying three measurements per night
of 10 minutes every three days, 10 nights a month seems the best tested
strategy. Depending on the level of activity considered, from log(R'_HK)= -5 to
-4.75, this strategy would allow us to find planets of 2.5 to 3.5 Earth masses
in the habitable zone of a K1V dwarf. Using Bern's model of planetary
formation, we estimate that for the same range of activity level, 15 to 35 % of
the planets between 1 and 5 Earth masses and with a period between 100 and 200
days should be found with HARPS. A comparison between the performance of HARPS
and ESPRESSO is also emphasized by our simulations. Using the same optimized
strategy, ESPRESSO could find 1.3 Earth mass planets in the habitable zone of
early-K dwarfs. In addition, 80 % of planets with mass between 1 and 5 Earth
masses and with a period between 100 and 200 days could be detected.
