In this paper, we calculated the dielectric function, the loss function, the
magnetoplasmon dispersion relation and the temperature-induced transitions for
graphene in a uniform perpendicular magnetic field B. The calculations were
performed using the Peierls tight-binding model to obtain the energy band
structure and the random-phase approximation to determine the collective plasma
excitation spectrum. The single-particle and collective excitations have been
precisely identified based on the resonant peaks in the loss function. The
critical wave vector at which plasmon damping takes place is clearly
established. This critical wave vector depends on the magnetic field strength
as well as the levels between which the transition takes place. The temperature
effects were also investigated. At finite temperature, there are plasma
resonances induced by the Fermi distribution function. Whether such plasmons
exist is mainly determined by the field strength, temperature, and momentum.
The inelastic light scattering spectroscopies could be used to verify the
magnetic field and temperature induced plasmons.
