We construct a (1,2) heterotic sigma model whose target space geometry
consists of a transitive Lie algebroid with complex structure on a Kaehler
manifold. We show that, under certain geometrical and topological conditions,
there are two distinguished topological half--twists of the heterotic sigma
model leading to A and B type half--topological models. Each of these models is
characterized by the usual topological BRST operator, stemming from the
heterotic (0,2) supersymmetry, and a second BRST operator anticommuting with
the former, originating from the (1,0) supersymmetry. These BRST operators
combined in a certain way provide each half--topological model with two
inequivalent BRST structures and, correspondingly, two distinct perturbative
chiral algebras and chiral rings. The latter are studied in detail and
characterized geometrically in terms of Lie algebroid cohomology in the
quasiclassical limit.
