A comprehensive statistical model for vertical profiles of the horizontal
wind and temperature throughout the troposphere is presented. The model is
based on radiosonde measurements of wind and temperature during several years.
The profiles measured under quite different atmospheric conditions exhibit
qualitative similarity, and a proper choice of the reference scales for the
wind, temperature and altitude levels allows to consider the measurement data
as realizations of a random process with universal characteristics: means, the
basic functions and parameters of standard distributions for transform
coefficients of the Principal Component Analysis. The features of the
atmospheric conditions are described by statistical characteristics of the
wind-temperature ensemble of dimensional reference scales. The high
effectiveness of the proposed approach is provided by a similarity of wind -
temperature vertical profiles, which allow to carry out the statistical
modeling in the low-dimension space of the dimensional reference scales for the
wind, temperature and altitude levels. The knowledge of the joint
wind-temperature distributions in altitude open wide perspectives for modeling
of various physical processes in real atmospheric conditions like the transfer
of passive scalars or impurities, the electromagnetic wave penetration, the
instability of internal waves, transition to turbulence etc.
