We show how to modify the linear-time construction algorithm for suffix
arrays based on induced sorting (Nong et al., DCC'09) such that it computes the
array of longest common prefixes (LCP-array) as well. Practical tests show that
this outperforms recent LCP-array construction algorithms (Gog and Ohlebusch,
ALENEX'11).
