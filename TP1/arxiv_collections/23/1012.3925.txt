The ignition of two-quantum collective emission of inverted sub-ensemble of
radiators due to mutual interaction of this sub-ensemble with other two dipole
active atomic subsystems in process of two-photon exchanges between the atoms
through the vacuum field is proposed. The three particle resonances between
two-photon and single quantum transitions of inverted radiators from the
ensemble are proposed for acceleration of collective decay rate of bi-photons,
obtained relatively dipole-forbidden transitions of excited atomic
sub-ensemble. This mutual interaction between three super-fluorescent processes
in subatomic ensembles take place relatively dipole-forbidden transitions in
one of radiator subsystem. The collective resonance emission and absorption of
two-quanta have nontraditional behavior, accompanied with acceleration and
inhibition of collective emission processes of photons.
