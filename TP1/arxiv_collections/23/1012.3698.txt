Soon the NA62 experiment will start looking for the rare K+ ---> pi+ nu nu
bar decay. In this talk, its theoretical interests, together with those of the
neutral rare decays KL ---> pi0 nu nu bar, KL ---> pi0 e+ e-, and KL ---> pi0
mu+ mu-, are briefly reviewed. Then, other possible targets for NA62 are
discussed, among which the dominant semileptonic decays, the radiative decays,
as well as the lepton-flavor violating decays.
