This paper deals with the dead-water phenomenon, which occurs when a ship
sails in a stratified fluid, and experiences an important drag due to waves
below the surface. More generally, we study the generation of internal waves by
a disturbance moving at constant speed on top of two layers of fluids of
different densities. Starting from the full Euler equations, we present several
nonlinear asymptotic models, in the long wave regime. These models are
rigorously justified by consistency or convergence results. A careful
theoretical and numerical analysis is then provided, in order to predict the
behavior of the flow and in which situations the dead-water effect appears.
