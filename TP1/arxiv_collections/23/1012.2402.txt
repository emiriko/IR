For the A=32 T=2 quintet we provide a unified theoretical description for
three related aspects of isospin mixing: the necessity of more than three terms
in the isobaric mass multiplet equation, isospin-forbidden proton decay, and a
correction to the allowed Fermi beta decay. We demonstrate for the first time
that all three effects observed in experiment can be traced to a common origin
related to isospin mixing of the T=2 states with T=1 states.
