Let $g$ be an analytic function on the unit disc and consider the integration
operator of the form $T_g f(z) = \int_0^z fg'\,d\zeta$. We show that on the
spaces $H^1$ and $BMOA$ the operator $T_g$ is weakly compact if and only if it
is compact. In the case of $BMOA$ this answers a question of Siskakis and Zhao.
More generally, we estimate the essential and weak essential norms of $T_g$ on
$H^p$ and $BMOA$.
