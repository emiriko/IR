In order to take advantage of the enormous potential of graphene for future
electronic micro-circuits and other applications it is necessary to develop
reliable, rapid and widely applicable methods to visualize graphene based
structures. We report here on a micro-droplet condensation technique, which
allows for quick visual identification of graphene on a variety of substrates,
including some which were previously considered unsuitable for the
visualization of carbon layers. The technique should also be applicable to
visualize artificially patterned graphene structures which are expected to be
key technologically enabling components in electronic micro-circuits and other
applications.
