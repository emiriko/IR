The phenomenology of iron-pnictides superconductors can be explained in the
framework of a three bands s\pm wave Eliashberg theory with only two free
parameters plus a feedback effect i.e. the effect of the condensate on the
antiferromagnetic spin fluctuactions responsible of the superconductivity in
these compounds. I have examined the experimental data of four materials:
LaFeAsO1-xFx, SmFeAsO1-xFx, Ba1-xKxFe2As2, and Ba(FexCo1-x)2As2 and I have
found that it is possible to reproduce the experimental critical temperature
and gap values in a moderate strong-coupling regime: ltot about 1.7-2.0.
