Weak boson fusion is expected to be an important Higgs production channel at
the LHC. Complete one-loop results for weak boson fusion in the Standard Model
have been obtained by calculating the full virtual electroweak corrections and
photon radiation and implementing these results into the public Monte Carlo
program VBFNLO which includes the NLO QCD corrections. Furthermore the dominant
supersymmetric one-loop corrections to neutral Higgs production, in the general
case where the MSSM includes complex phases, have been calculated. These
results have been combined with all one-loop corrections of Standard Model type
and with the propagator-type corrections from the Higgs sector of the MSSM up
to the two-loop level. Within the Standard Model the electroweak corrections
are found to be as important as the QCD corrections after the application of
appropriate cuts. The corrections yield a shift in the cross section of order
5% for a Higgs of mass 100-200 GeV, confirming the result obtained previously
in the literature. For the production of a light Higgs boson in the MSSM the
Standard Model result is recovered in the decoupling limit, while the loop
contributions from superpartners to the production of neutral MSSM Higgs bosons
can give rise to corrections in excess of 10% away from the decoupling region.
