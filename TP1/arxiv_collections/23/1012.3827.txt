We calculate the spin-drag relaxation rate for a two-component ultracold
atomic Fermi gas with positive scattering length between the two spin
components. In one dimension we find that it vanishes linearly with
temperature. In three dimensions the spin-drag relaxation rate vanishes
quadratically with temperature for sufficiently weak interactions. This
quadratic temperature dependence is present, up to logarithmic corrections, in
the two-dimensional case as well. For stronger interaction the system exhibits
a Stoner ferromagnetic phase transition in two and three dimensions. We show
that the spin-drag relaxation rate is enhanced by spin fluctuations as the
temperature approaches the critical temperature of this transition from above.
