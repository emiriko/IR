In this article, we study the vector meson transitions among the charmonium
and bottomonium states with the heavy quark effective theory in an systematic
way, and make predictions for the ratios among the vector meson decay widths of
a special multiplet to another multiplet. The predictions can be confronted
with the experimental data in the future.
