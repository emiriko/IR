One of the main proposed tools to transfer information in a quantum
computational context are spin chains. While spin chains have shown to be
convenient and reliable, it has to be expected that, as with any implementation
of a physical system, they will be subject to various errors and perturbative
factors. In this work we consider the transfer of entangled as well as
unentangled states to investigate the effects of various errors, paying
particular attention to unwanted long-range interactions.
