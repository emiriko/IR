The analysis of the earthquakes catalog of Greece for the period 1964 to 2010
indicates a continuously increasing no. of seismic events. A detailed
determination of the cumulative seismic energy release, for specific earthquake
magnitudes, revealed that for magnitudes up to Ms = 5.0R the Greek territory,
considered as a unified seismogenic area, is at a state of accelerating
deformation for almost the last 10 years. The background seismicity rate,
considering constant cumulative seismic energy release for the entire study
period, corresponds to a magnitude of Ms = 5.5R, while for earthquakes of
larger magnitudes the Greek seismogenic area behaves irregularly. The results
are compared to the different phases (Mjachkin et al, 1975) a seismogenic area
undergoes before a large seismic event. From this comparison it is concluded
that the Greek territory is probably in the course for a large seismic event in
the years to come.
