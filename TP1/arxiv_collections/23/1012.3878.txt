In this thesis, we study two approaches to achieve device-independent quantum
key distribution: in the first approach, the adversary can distribute any
system to the honest parties that cannot be used to communicate between the
three of them, i.e., it must be non-signalling. In the second approach, we
limit the adversary to strategies which can be implemented using quantum
physics. For both approaches, we show how device-independent quantum key
distribution can be achieved when imposing an additional condition. In the
non-signalling case this additional requirement is that communication is
impossible between all pairwise subsystems of the honest parties, while, in the
quantum case, we demand that measurements on different subsystems must commute.
We give a generic security proof for device-independent quantum key
distribution in these cases and apply it to an existing quantum key
distribution protocol, thus proving its security even in this setting. We also
show that, without any additional such restriction there always exists a
successful joint attack by a non-signalling adversary.
