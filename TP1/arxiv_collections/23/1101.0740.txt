The ProAm effort in modern astronomy and astrophysics is now a reality. The
achievements of amateur astronomers throughout the early history of astronomy
are well known. However, during the 20th century, the high specialisation and
the technology required for dealing with the astronomical issues of that epoch,
forced a natural separation of the professional activities from the amateur
ones. Nowadays, technology has become much cheaper. Amateur astronomers have
equipment capable of producing scientific results within their reach. Good
equipment pushes some amateur astronomers to learn more, recovering their
dialog with professionals. ProAm activities may be fruitful in data mining, in
database feeding, in long-term campaigns and even in casual observations.
