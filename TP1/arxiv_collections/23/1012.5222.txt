We present new ultraviolet spectra of the peculiar white dwarf (WD) H1504+65,
obtained with COS on HST. H1504+65 is the hottest known WD (Teff= 200,000 K)
and has an atmosphere mainly composed of C and O, augmented with high amounts
of Ne and Mg. This object is unique and the origin of its surface chemistry is
completely unclear. We probably see the naked core of either a C--O WD or even
a O--Ne--Mg WD. In the latter case, this would be the first direct proof that
such WDs can be the outcome of single-star evolution. The new observations were
performed to shed light on the origin of this mysterious object.
