We develop the concept of scattering matrix and we use it to perform stable
numerical calculations of resonant tunneling of electrons through a multiple
potential barrier in a semiconductor heterostructure. Electrons move in two
external nonperturbative electric fields: constant and oscillating in time. We
apply our algorithm for different strengths and spatial configurations of the
fields.
