X-ray observations of solar flares routinely reveal an impulsive high-energy
and a gradual low-energy emission component, whose relationship is one of the
key issues of solar flare study. The gradual and impulsive emission components
are believed to be associated with, respectively, the thermal and nonthermal
components identified in spectral fitting. In this paper, a prominent about 50
second hard X-ray (HXR) pulse of a simple GOES class C7.5 flare on 20 February
2002 is used to study the association between high energy, non-thermal and
impulsive evolution, and low energy, thermal and gradual evolution. We use
regularized methods to obtain time derivatives of photon fluxes to quantify the
time evolution as a function of photon energy, obtaining a break energy between
impulsive and gradual behavior. These break energies are consistent with a
constant value of about 11 keV in agreement with those found spectroscopically
between thermal and non-thermal components, but the relative errors of the
former are greater than 15% and much greater than the a few percent errors
found from the spectral fitting. These errors only weakly depend on assuming an
underlying spectral model for the photons, pointing to the current data being
inadequate to reduce the uncertainties rather than there being a problem
associated with an assumed model. The time derivative method is used to test
for the presence of a 'pivot energy' in this flare. Although these pivot
energies are marginally consistent with a constant value of about 9 keV, its
values in the HXR rise phase appear to be lower than those in the decay phase.
