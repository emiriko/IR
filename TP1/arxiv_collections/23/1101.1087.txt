Improved photometric sensitivity from space-based telescopes have enabled the
detection of phase variations for a small sample of hot Jupiters. However,
exoplanets in highly eccentric orbits present unique opportunities to study the
effects of drastically changing incident flux on the upper atmospheres of giant
planets. Here we expand upon previous studies of phase functions for these
planets at optical wavelengths by investigating the effects of orbital
inclination on the flux ratio as it interacts with the other effects induced by
orbital eccentricity. We determine optimal orbital inclinations for maximum
flux ratios and combine these calculations with those of projected separation
for application to coronagraphic observations. These are applied to several of
the known exoplanets which may serve as potential targets in current and future
coronagraph experiments.
