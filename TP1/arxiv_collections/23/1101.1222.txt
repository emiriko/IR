We present the results of photometric surveys for stellar rotation in the
Hyades and in Praesepe, using data obtained as part of the SuperWASP
exoplanetary transit-search programme.We determined accurate rotation periods
for more than 120 sources whose cluster membership was confirmed by common
proper motion and colour-magnitude fits to the clusters' isochrones. This
allowed us to determine the effect of magnetic braking on a wide range of
spectral types for expected ages of ~600Myr for the Hyades and Praesepe. Both
clusters show a tight and nearly linear relation between J - Ks colour and
rotation period in the F,G and K spectral range. This confirms that loss of
angular momentum was significant enough that stars with strongly different
initial rotation rates have converged to the same rotation period for a given
mass, by the age of Hyades and Praesepe. In the case of the Hyades our
colour-period sequence extends well into the M dwarf regime and shows a steep
increase in the scatter of the colour- period relation, with identification of
numerous rapid rotators from 0.5SM down to the lowest masses probed by our
survey (0.25SM). This provides crucial constraints on the rotational braking
timescales and further clears the way to use gyrochronology as an accurate age
measurement tool for main-sequence stars.
