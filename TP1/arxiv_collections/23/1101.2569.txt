In this paper we analyze different biometric authentication protocols
considering an internal adversary. Our contribution takes place at two levels.
On the one hand, we introduce a new comprehensive framework that encompasses
the various schemes we want to look at. On the other hand, we exhibit actual
attacks on recent schemes such as those introduced at ACISP 2007, ACISP 2008,
and SPIE 2010, and some others. We follow a blackbox approach in which we
consider components that perform operations on the biometric data they contain
and where only the input/output behavior of these components is analyzed.
