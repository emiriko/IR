We investigate a first-order phase transition from hadronic matter to
antikaon condensed matter during the cooling stage of protoneutron stars. The
phase transition proceeds through the thermal nucleation of antikaon condensed
matter. In this connection we study the effect of shear viscosity on the
thermal nucleation rate of droplets of antikaon condensed matter. Here we adopt
the same equation of state for the calculation of shear viscosity and thermal
nucleation time. We compute the shear viscosity of neutron star matter composed
of neutrons, protons, electrons and muons using the relativistic mean field
model. The prefactor in the nucleation rate which includes the shear viscosity,
is enhanced by several orders of magnitude compared with the $T^4$
approximation of earlier calculations. Consequently the thermal nucleation time
in the $T^4$ approximation overestimates our result. Further the thermal
nucleation of an antikaon droplet might be possible in our case for surface
tension smaller than 20 MeV fm$^{-2}$.
