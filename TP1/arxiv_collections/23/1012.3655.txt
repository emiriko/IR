Chemical functionalization of graphene modifies the local electron density of
the carbon atoms and hence electron transport. Measuring these changes allows
for a closer understanding of the chemical interaction and the influence of
functionalization on the graphene lattice. However, not only chemistry, in this
case diazonium chemistry, has an effect on the electron transport. Latter is
also influenced by defects and dopants resulting from different processing
steps. Here, we show that solvents used in the chemical reaction process change
the transport properties. In more detail, the investigated combination of
isopropanol and heating treatment reduces the doping concentration and
significantly increases the mobility of graphene. Furthermore, the isopropanol
treatment alone increases the concentration of dopants and introduces an
asymmetry between electron and hole transport which might be difficult to
distinguish from the effect of functionalization. The results shown in this
work demand a closer look on the influence of solvents used for chemical
modification in order to understand their influence.
