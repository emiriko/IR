We develop a model to describe the force generated by the polymerization of
an array of parallel biofilaments. The filaments are assumed to be coupled only
through mechanical contact with a movable barrier. We calculate the filament
density distribution and the force-velocity relation with a mean-field approach
combined with simulations. We identify two regimes: a non-condensed regime at
low force in which filaments are spread out spatially, and a condensed regime
at high force in which filaments accumulate near the barrier. We confirm a
result previously known from other related studies, namely that the stall force
is equal to N times the stall force of a single filament. In the model studied
here, the approach to stalling is very slow, and the velocity is practically
zero at forces significantly lower than the stall force.
