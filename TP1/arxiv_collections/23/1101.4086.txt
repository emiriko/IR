The availability of vector magnetogram sequences with sufficient accuracy and
cadence to estimate the time derivative of the magnetic field allows us to use
Faraday's law to find an approximate solution for the electric field in the
photosphere, using a Poloidal-Toroidal Decomposition (PTD) of the magnetic
field and its partial time derivative. Without additional information, however,
the electric field found from this technique is under-determined -- Faraday's
law provides no information about the electric field that can be derived the
gradient of a scalar potential. Here, we show how additional information in the
form of line-of-sight Doppler flow measurements, and motions transverse to the
line-of-sight determined with ad-hoc methods such as local correlation
tracking, can be combined with the PTD solutions to provide much more accurate
solutions for the solar electric field, and therefore the Poynting flux of
electromagnetic energy in the solar photosphere. Reliable, accurate maps of the
Poynting flux are essential for quantitative studies of the buildup of magnetic
energy before flares and coronal mass ejections.
