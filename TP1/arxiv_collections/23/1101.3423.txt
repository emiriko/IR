The development of methods of quantum statistical mechanics is considered in
light of their applications to quantum solid-state theory. We discuss
fundamental problems of the physics of magnetic materials and the methods of
the quantum theory of magnetism, including the method of two-time temperature
Green's functions, which is widely used in various physical problems of
many-particle systems with interaction. Quantum cooperative effects and
quasiparticle dynamics in the basic microscopic models of quantum theory of
magnetism: the Heisenberg model, the Hubbard model, the Anderson Model, and the
spin-fermion model are considered in the framework of novel
self-consistent-field approximation. We present a comparative analysis of these
models; in particular, we compare their applicability for description of
complex magnetic materials. The concepts of broken symmetry, quantum
protectorate, and quasiaverages are analyzed in the context of quantum theory
of magnetism and theory of superconductivity. The notion of broken symmetry is
presented within the nonequilibrium statistical operator approach developed by
D.N. Zubarev. In the framework of the latter approach we discuss the derivation
of kinetic equations for a system in a thermal bath. Finally, the results of
investigation of the dynamic behavior of a particle in an environment, taking
into account dissipative effects, are presented.
