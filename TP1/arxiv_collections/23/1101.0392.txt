Seeger's semi-empirical mass formula is revisited for two of its constants
(bulk constant {\alpha}(0) and neutron-proton asymmetry constant a_{a})
readjusted to obtain the ground-state (g.s.) binding energies of nuclei within
a precision of <1.5 MeV and for nuclei up to Z=118. The aim is to include the
temperature T-dependence on experimental binding energies, and not to obtain
the new parameter set of Seeger's liquid drop energy VLDM . Our proceedure is
to define the g.s. binding energy B = V_{LDM} + {\delta}U, as per Strutinsky
renormalization procedure, and using the empirical shell corrections {\delta}U
of Myers and Swiatecki, fit the constants of V_{LDM} to obtain the experimental
binding energy Bexpt or theoretically calculated Btheo if data were not
available. The T-dependence of the constants of V_{LDM}, is introduced as per
the work of Davidson et al., where the pairing energy {\delta}(T) is modified
as per new calculations on compound nucleus decays. The newly fitted constants
of V_{LDM} at T=0 are made available here for use of other workers interested
in nuclear dynamics of hot and rotating nuclei.
