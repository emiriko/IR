We study the light-front zero-mode contribution to the tensor form factors
$T_i(i=1,2,3)$ for the exclusive rare $P\to V\ell^+\ell^-$ decays using a
covariant fermion field theory model in $(3+1)$ dimensions. While the zero-mode
contribution in principle depends on the form of the vector meson vertex
$\Gamma^\mu=\gamma^\mu - (2k-P_V)^\mu/D$, the three tensor form factors
$T_i(i=1,2,3)$ are found to be free from the zero mode if the denominator $D$
contains the term proportional to the light-front energy or the longitudinal
momentum fraction factor $(1/x)^n$ of the struck quark with the power $n>0$.
Since the denominator $D$ used in the light-front quark model (LFQM) has the
power $n=1/2$, the three tensor form factors $T_i(i=1,2,3)$ can be computed in
LFQM safely without involving any complicate zero-mode contribution. The lack
of zero-mode contribution benefits the phenomenology with LFQM.
