Resistivity r(T), Hall coefficient RH(T), superconducting temperature Tc, and
the slope of the upper critical field -dHc2/dT were studied in poly- and
single-crystalline samples of the Fe-based superconductor Lu2Fe3Si5 irradiated
by fast neutrons. Atomic disordering induced by the neutron irradiation leads
to a fast suppression of Tc similarly to the case of doping of Lu2Fe3Si5 with
magnetic (Dy) and non-magnetic (Sc, Y) impurities. The same effect was observed
in a novel FeAs-based superconductor La(O-F)FeAs after irradiation. Such
behavior is accounted for by strong pair breaking that is traceable to
scattering at non-magnetic impurities or radiation defects in unconventional
superconductors. In such superconductors the sign of the order parameter
changes between the different Fermi sheets (s+- model). Some relations that are
specified for the properties of the normal and superconducting states in
high-temperature superconductors are also observed in Lu2Fe3Si5. The first is
the relationship -dHc2/dT ~ Tc, instead of the one expected for dirty
superconductors -dHc2/dT ~ r0. The second is a correlation between the
low-temperature linear coefficient a in the resistivity r = r0 + a1T, which
appears presumably due to the scattering at magnetic fluctuations, and Tc; this
correlation being an evidence of a tight relation between the superconductivity
and magnetism. The data point to an unconventional (non-fononic) mechanism of
superconductivity in Lu2Fe3Si5, and, probably, in some other Fe-based
compounds, which can be fruitfully studied via the radiation-induced
disordering.
