We determine the joint distribution of the lengths of, and angles between,
the N shortest lattice vectors in a random n-dimensional lattice as n tends to
infinity. Moreover we interpret the result in terms of eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on flat tori. Finally we discuss the limit
distribution of any finite number of successive minima of a random
n-dimensional lattice as n tends to infinity.
