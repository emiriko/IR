The explicit relations between the thermodynamic functions of the Lattice Gas
model and the fluid within the framework of approach proposed earlier in [V. L.
Kulinskii, J. Phys. Chem. B \textbf{114} 2852 (2010)] are derived. It is shown
that the Widom line serves as the natural border between the gas-like and the
liquid-like states of the fluid. The explanation of the global cubic form of
the binodal for the molecular liquids is proposed and the estimate for the
amplitude of the binodal opening is obtained.
