We report growth of high quality ZnO/Zn0.8Mg0.2O quantum well on M-plane
oriented ZnO substrates. The optical properties of these quantum wells are
studied by using reflectance spectroscopy. The optical spectra reveal strong
in-plane optical anisotropies, as predicted by group theory, and marked
reflectance structures, as an evidence of good interface morphologies.
Signatures ofc onfined excitons built from the spin-orbit split-off valence
band, the analog of exciton C in bulk ZnO are detected in normal incidence
reflectivity experiments using a photon polarized along the c axis of the
wurtzite lattice. Experiments performed in the context of an orthogonal photon
polarization, at 90^{\circ}; of this axis, reveal confined states analogs of A
and B bulk excitons. Envelope function calculations which include excitonic
interaction nicely account for the experimental report.
