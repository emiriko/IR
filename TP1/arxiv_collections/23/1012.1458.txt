The anomalous inhibition of $^{14}$C-dating $\beta$ decay rate is restudied
in terms of shell-model calculations in the $jj$ coupling scheme with both
realistic and empirical Hamiltonians. It is seen that the accidental
cancellation of the decay strength is dominated by the mixing effect of two
configurations of the final state wave function, $|0p^{-2}_{1/2}>$ and
$|0p_{3/2}^{-1}0p_{1/2}^{-1}>$. By decomposing the effective interactions into
different tensor components, it is clearly seen that the mixing is largely
induced by the tensor force. The failure of realistic calculations in
reproducing the inhibition may be related to its ill description of the
monopole component rather than the tensor force.
