The quantum transport of Dirac cone states in the iron pnictide Ba(FeAs)$_2$
with a d-\,multiband system is studied by using single crystal samples. The
transverse magnetoresistance develops linearly against magnetic field at low
temperatures. The transport phenomena are interpreted in terms of the 0$^{th}$
Landau level by applying the theory predicted by Abrikosov. The results of the
semiclassical analyses of a two carrier system under low magnetic field limit
show that both electron and hole reside as the high mobility states, being
indicative to the fact that both electron- and hole Dirac cone states should be
taken into account in pairs for having the real interpretation of low
temperature electronic states in iron pnictides, being in contrast to the
previous reports.
