We report inelastic neutron scattering experiments on single crystals of
superconducting Ba0.67K0.33Fe2As2 (Tc = 38 K). In addition to confirming the
resonance previously found in powder samples, we find that spin excitations in
the normal state form longitudinally elongated ellipses along the QAFM
direction in momentum space, consistent with density functional theory
predictions. On cooling below Tc, while the resonance preserves its momentum
anisotropy as expected, spin excitations at energies below the resonance become
essentially isotropic in the in-plane momentum space and dramatically increase
their correlation length. These results suggest that the superconducting gap
structures in Ba0.67Ka0.33Fe2As2 are more complicated than those suggested from
angle resolved photoemission experiments.
