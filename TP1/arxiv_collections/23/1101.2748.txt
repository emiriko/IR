The history of Current Algebra is reviewed up to the appearance of the
Adler-Weisberger sum rule. Particular emphasis is given to the role current
algebra played for the historical struggle in strong interaction physics of
elementary particles between the S-matrix approach based on dispersion
relations and field theory. The question whether there are fundamental
particles or all hadrons are bound or resonant states of one another played an
important role in this struggle and is thus also regarded.
