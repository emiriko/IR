In view of the fact that the data on neutrino mixing are still compatible
with a situation where Bimaximal mixing is valid in first approximation and it
is then corrected by terms of order of the Cabibbo angle, we present examples
where these properties are naturally realized. The models are supersymmetric in
4-dimensions and based on the discrete non-Abelian flavour symmetry S4.
