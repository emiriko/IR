A detailed presentation of hypothesis testing is given. The "look elsewhere"
effect is illustrated, and a treatment of the trials factor is proposed with
the introduction of hypothesis hypertests. An example of such a hypertest is
presented, named BumpHunter, which is used in the recent ATLAS dijet resonance
search, and in an earlier version in the CDF Global Search, to look for exotic
phenomena in high energy physics. As a demonstration, the BumpHunter is used to
address Problem 1 of the Banff Challenge.
