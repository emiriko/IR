We take advantage of the high sensitivity of the IBIS/ISGRI telescope and the
improvements in the data analysis software to investigate the nature of the
still poorly known X-ray source AX J1910.7+0917, and search for close-by
previously undetected objects. We analyze all publicly available INTEGRAL data
of AX J1910.7+0917, together with a number of archival observations that were
carried out in the direction of the source with Chandra, XMM-Newton, and ASCA.
In the IBIS/ISGRI field-of-view around AX J1910.7+0917, we discovered three new
sources: IGR J19173+0747, IGR J19294+1327 and IGR J19149+1036; the latter is
positionally coincident with the Einstein source 2E 1912.5+1031. For the first
two sources, we also report the results of follow-up observations carried out
with Swift/XRT. AX J1910.7+0917 features a clear variability in the X-rays. Its
spectrum can be well described with an absorbed (N_H~6x10^(22) cm^(-2))
power-law ({\Gamma}~1.5) model plus an iron line at ~6.4 keV. We also obtained
a refined position and report on possible infrared counterparts. The present
data do not allow for a unique classification of the sources. Based on the
property of its X-ray emission and the analysis of a likely infrared
counterpart, we investigate different possibilities for the nature of AX
J1910.7+0917.
