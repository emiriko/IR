We study the dissipation of the centre of mass oscillation of a harmonically
confined condensate in the presence of a disorder potential. An extension of
the Generalized Harmonic Theorem allows one to formulate the dynamics from the
point of view of an oscillating disorder potential. This formulation leads to a
rigorous result for the damping rate in the limit of weak disorder.
