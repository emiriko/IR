We propose a new local, deterministic and parameter-free algorithm that
detects fuzzy and crisp overlapping communities in a weighted network and
simultaneously reveals their hierarchy. Using a local fitness function, the
algorithm greedily expands natural communities of seeds until the whole graph
is covered. The hierarchy of communities is obtained analytically by
calculating resolution levels at which communities grow rather than numerically
by testing different resolution levels. This analytic procedure is not only
more exact than its numerical alternatives such as LFM and GCE but also much
faster. Critical resolution levels can be identified by searching for intervals
in which large changes of the resolution do not lead to growth of communities.
We tested our algorithm on benchmark graphs and on a network of 492 papers in
information science. Combined with a specific post-processing, the algorithm
gives much more precise results on LFR benchmarks with high overlap compared to
other algorithms and performs very similar to GCE.
