Swift satellite measurements contributed substantially to the gamma-ray burst
(GRB) redshift observations through fast slewing to the source of the GRBs.
Still, a large number of bursts are without redshift. We study the celestial
distribution of bursts with various methods and compare them to a random
catalog using Monte-Carlo simulations. We find an anisotropy in the
distribution of the intermediate class of bursts and find that the short and
long population are distributed isotropically.
