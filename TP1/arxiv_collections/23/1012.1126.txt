We present a formalism that allows the computation of the baryon asymmetry of
the universe from first principles of statistical physics and quantum field
theory that is applicable to certain types of beyond the Standard Model physics
(such as the neutrino Minimal Standard Model -- $\nu$MSM) and does not require
the solution of Boltzmann or Kadanoff-Baym equations. The formalism works if a
thermal bath of Standard Model particles is very weakly coupled to a new sector
(sterile neutrinos in the $\nu$MSM case) that is out-of-equilibrium. The key
point that allows a computation without kinetic equations is that the number of
sterile neutrinos produced during the relevant cosmological period remains
small. In such a case, it is possible to expand the formal solution of the von
Neumann equation perturbatively and obtain a master formula for the lepton
asymmetry expressed in terms of non-equilibrium Wightman functions. The master
formula neatly separates CP-violating contributions from finite temperature
correlation functions and satisfies all three Sakharov conditions. These
correlation functions can then be evaluated perturbatively; the validity of the
perturbative expansion depends on the parameters of the model considered. Here
we choose a toy model (containing only two active and two sterile neutrinos) to
illustrate the use of the formalism, but it could be applied to other models.
