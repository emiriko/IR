The stationary Maxwell-Born-Infeld field equations of electromagnetism with
integrable regular sources in a Hoelder space are solved using a perturbation
series expansion in powers of Born's electromagnetic constant. The convergence
of the power series for the fields is proved with the help of Banach algebra
arguments and complex analysis. The finite radius of convergence depends on the
norm of both, the Coulombfield generated by the charge density and the Amp`ere
field generated by the current density. No symmetry is assumed.
