This paper investigates wave properties of hot plasma in a Veselago medium.
For the Schwarzschild black hole, the $3+1$ GRMHD equations are re-formulated
which are linearly perturbed and then Fourier analyzed for rotating
(non-magnetized and magnetized) plasmas. The graphs of wave vector, refractive
index and change in refractive are used to discuss the wave properties. The
results obtained confirm the presence of Veselago medium for both rotating
(non-magnetized and magnetized) plasmas. This work generalized the isothermal
plasma waves in the Veselago medium to hot plasma case.
