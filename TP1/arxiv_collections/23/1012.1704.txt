In this article, we take the scalar mesons $K^*_0(1430)$ and $a_0(1450)$ as
the conventional two-quark states, and study the $B \to K^*_0(1430), a_0(1450)$
form-factors with the $B$-meson light-cone QCD sum rules, then take those
form-factors as basic input parameters to study the semi-leptonic decays
$\bar{B}^0\to a_0^+(1450)l \bar{\nu}_l $ and $B^-\to K_0^{*-}(1430)l\bar{l}$,
the predictions can be confronted with the experimental data in the future.
