Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process in space and astrophysical
plasmas in which oppositely directed magnetic fields changes its connectivity
and eventually converts its energy into kinetic and thermal energy of the
plasma. Recently, ubiquitous jets (for example, chromospheric anemone jets,
penumbral microjets, umbral light bridge jets) have been observed by Solar
Optical Telescope on board the satellite Hinode. These tiny and frequently
occurring jets are considered to be a possible evidence of small-scale
ubiquitous reconnection in the solar atmosphere. However, the details of three
dimensional magnetic configuration are still not very clear. Here we propose a
new model based on three dimensional simulations of magnetic reconnection using
a typical current sheet magnetic configuration with a strong guide field. The
most interesting feature is that the jets produced by the reconnection
eventually move along the guide field lines. This model provides a fresh
understanding of newly discovered ubiquitous jets and moreover a new
observational basis for the theory of astrophysical magnetic reconnection.
