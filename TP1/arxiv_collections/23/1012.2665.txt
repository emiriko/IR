Following the high detection rate achieved by EVN observations of the central
regions of local Seyfert galaxies (Giroletti & Panessa 2009, ApJL 706, 260), we
have targeted a few additional sources from a complete sample. We have detected
three more sources (NGC 3982, NGC 3227, and NGC 4138) at both 1.6 and 5 GHz and
present preliminary results. Moreover, the declination of the sources was
suitable to include Arecibo in the EVN observations, which provides important
clues on the compactness of the emission region.
