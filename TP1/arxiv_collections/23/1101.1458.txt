Using the relationship between totally nonnegative matrices and directed
acyclic weighted planar networks, we show that $2\times 2$ minors of minor
matrices of totally nonnegative matrices are also nonnegative. We give a
combinatorial interpretation for the minors of minor matrices in terms of the
weights of families of paths in a network.
