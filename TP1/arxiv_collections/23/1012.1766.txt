We investigated the superconducting gap structure of SrNi$_2$P$_{2}$
($T_c$=1.4 K) via low-temperature magneto-thermal conductivity $\kappa(T,H)$
measurements. Zero field thermal conductivity $\kappa$ decreases exponentially
$\kappa \propto$ exp($-aT_c/T$) with $a$=1.5, in accord with the BCS theory,
and rolls over to a phonon-like $\kappa\propto T^3$ behavior at low
temperature, similar to a number of conventional s-wave superconductors. In
addition, we observed a "concave" field dependence of the residual linear term
$\kappa_0(H)/T$. These facts strongly rule out the presence of nodes in the
superconducting energy gap of SrNi$_2$P$_{2}$. Together with a fully gapped
Fermi surface in the superconducting state of BaNi$_2$As$_{2}$ ($T_c$=0.6-0.7
K), demonstrated in our recent work, these results lead us to postulate that
fully gapped superconductivity is a universal feature of Ni-based pnictide
superconductors.
