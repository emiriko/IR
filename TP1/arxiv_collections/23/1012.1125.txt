The concepts of phase space Feynman integrals in White Noise Analysis are
established. As an example the harmonic oscillator is treated. The approach
perfectly reproduces the right physics. I.e., solutions to the Schr\"odinger
equation are obtained and the canonical commutation relations are satisfied.
The later can be shown, since we not only construct the integral but rather the
Feynman integrand and the corresponding generating functional.
