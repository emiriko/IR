We have examined methanol emission from Orion KL with of the {\em
Herschel}/HIFI instrument, and detected two methanol bands centered at 524 GHz
and 1061 GHz. The 524 GHz methanol band (observed in HIFI band 1a) is dominated
by the isolated $\Delta$J$=$0, K$=-4\rightarrow$-3, v$_t$$=$0 Q branch, and
includes 25 E-type and 2 A-type transitions. The 1061 GHz methanol band
(observed in HIFI band 4b) is dominated by the $\Delta$J$=$0,
K$=7\rightarrow$6, v$_t$$=$0 Q branch transitions which are mostly blended. We
have used the isolated E-type v$_t$$=$0 methanol transitions to explore the
physical conditions in the molecular gas. With HIFI's high velocity resolution,
the methanol emission contributed by different spatial components along the
line of sight toward Orion KL (hot core, low velocity flow, and compact ridge)
can be distinguished and studied separately. The isolated transitions detected
in these bands cover a broad energy range (upper state energy ranging from 80 K
to 900 K), which provides a unique probe of the thermal structure in each
spatial component. The observations further show that the compact ridge is
externally heated. These observations demonstrate the power of methanol lines
as probes of the physical conditions in warm regions in close proximity to
young stars.
