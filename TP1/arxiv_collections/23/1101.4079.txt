Room temperature ferromagnetic materials composed only by light elements like
carbon, hydrogen and/or nitrogen, so called carbon magnet, are very attractive
for creating new material categories both in science and industry. Recently
several experiments suggest ferromagnetic features at a room temperature,
especially in graphite base materials. This paper reveals a mechanism of such
ferromagnetic features by modeling nanometer size asymmetric graphene molecule
by using both a semi-empirical molecular orbital method and a first principle
density function theory. Asymmetrically dihydrogenated zigzag edge graphene
molecule shows that high spin state is more stable in total molecular energy
than low spin state. Proton ion irradiation play an important role to create
such asymmetric features. Also, nitrogen contained graphite ferromagnetism is
explained by a similar asymmetric molecule model.
