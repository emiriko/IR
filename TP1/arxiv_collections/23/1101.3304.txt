In this work, a sample of planetary nebulae located in the inner-disk and
bulge of the Galaxy is used in order to find the galactocentric distance which
better separates these two populations, from the point of view of abundances.
Statistical distance scales were used to study the distribution of abundances
across the disk-bulge interface. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to find the
distance in which the chemical properties of these regions better separate.The
results of the statistical analysis indicate that, on the average, the inner
population has lower abundances than the outer. Additionally, for the
$\alpha$-elements abundances, the inner population does not follow the disk
radial gradient towards the galactic center. Based on our results, we suggest a
bulge-disk interface at 1.5 kpc, marking the transition between the bulge and
inner-disk of the Galaxy, as defined by the intermediate mass population.
