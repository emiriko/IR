To better understand the dynamical process of active-region filament
eruptions and associated flares and CMEs, we carried out a statistical study of
120 events observed by BBSO, TRACE, and t(SOHO/EIT) from 1998 to 2007 and
combined filament observations with the NOAA's flare reports, MDI magnetograms,
and LASCO data, to investigate the relationship between active-region filament
eruptions and other solar activities. We found that 115 out of 120 filament
eruptions are associated with flares. 56 out of 105 filament eruptions are
found to be associated with CMEs except for 15 events without corresponding
LASCO data. We note the limitation of coronagraphs duo to geometry or
sensitivity, leading to many smaller CMEs that are Earth-directed or well out
of the plane of sky not being detected by near-Earth spacecraft. Excluding
those without corresponding LASCO data, the CME association rate of
active-region filament eruptions clearly increases with X-ray flare class from
about 32% for C-class flares to 100% for X-class flares. The eruptions of
active-region filaments associated with Halo CMEs are often accompanied by
large flares. About 92% events associated with X-class flare are associated
with Halo CMEs. Such a result is due to that the Earth-directed CMEs detected
as Halo CMEs are often the larger CMEs and many of the smaller ones are not
detected because of the geometry and low intensity. The average speed of the
associated CMEs of filament eruptions increases with X-ray flare size from
563.7 km/s for C-class flares to 1506.6 km/s for X-class flares. Moreover, the
magnetic emergence and cancellation play an important role in triggering
filament eruptions. These findings may be instructive to not only in respect to
the modeling of active-region filament eruptions but also in predicting flares
and CMEs.
