Michael Hochman showed that every 1D effectively closed subshift can be
simulated by a 3D subshift of finite type and asked whether the same can be
done in 2D. It turned out that the answer is positive and necessary tools were
already developed in tilings theory. We discuss two alternative approaches:
first, developed by N. Aubrun and M. Sablik, goes back to Leonid Levin; the
second one, developed by the authors, goes back to Peter Gacs.
