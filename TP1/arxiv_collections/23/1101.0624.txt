We study theoretically the effect of spin-orbit coupling and sublattice
asymmetry in graphene on the spin polarization of photoelectrons. We show that
sublattice asymmetry in graphene not only opens a gap in the band structure but
in case of finite spin-orbit interaction it also gives rise to an out-of-plane
spin polarization of electrons close to the Dirac point of the Brillouin zone.
This can be detected by measuring the spin polarization of photoelectrons and
therefore spin resolved photoemission spectroscopy can reveal the presence of a
band gap even if it is too small to be observed directly by angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy because of the finite resolution of measurements or
because the sample is $p$-doped. We present analytical and numerical
calculations on the energy and linewidth dependence of photoelectron intensity
distribution and spin polarization.
