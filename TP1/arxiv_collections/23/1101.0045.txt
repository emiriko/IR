Plasma Display Panels (PDP), the underlying engine of panel plasma television
displays, are being investigated for their utility as radiation detectors
called Plasma Panel Sensors (PPS). The PPS a novel variant of a micropattern
radiation detector, is intended to be a fast, high resolution detector
comprised of an array of plasma discharge cells operating in a hermetically
sealed gas mixture. We report on the PPS development effort, including recent
laboratory measurements.
