At finite density parity can be spontaneously broken in strong interactions
with far reaching implications. In particular, a time-dependent pseudoscalar
background would modify QED by adding a Chern-Simons term to the lagrangian. As
a striking consequence we propose a novel explanation for the dilepton excess
observed in heavy ion collisions at low invariant masses. The presence of local
parity breaking due to a time-dependent pseudoscalar condensate substantially
modifies the dispersion relation of photons and vector mesons propagating in
such a medium, changing the $\rho$ spectral function and resulting in a
potentially large excess of dileptons with respect to the predictions based in
a `cocktail' of known processes.
