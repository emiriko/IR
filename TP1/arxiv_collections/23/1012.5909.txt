The term unfoldome has been recently used to indicate the universe of
intrinsically disordered proteins. These proteins are characterized by an
ensemble of high-flexible interchangeable conformations and therefore they can
interact with many targets without requiring pre-existing stereo-chemical
complementarity. It has been suggested that intrinsically disordered proteins
are frequent in proteomes and disorder is widespread also in structured
proteins. However, several studies raise some doubt about these views. It this
paper we estimate the frequency of intrinsically disordered proteins in several
living organisms by using the ratio S between the likelihood, for a protein
sequence, of being composed mainly by order-promoting or disorder-promoting
residues. We scan several proteomes from Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya. We find
the following figures: 1.63% for Archaea, 3.91% for Bacteria, 16.35% for
Eukarya. The frequencies we found can be considered an upper bound to the real
frequency of intrinsically disordered proteins in proteomes. Our estimates are
lower than those previously reported in several studies. A scanning of proteins
in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) searching for segments of non-observed residues
reveals that segments of non-observed residues longer than 30 amino acids, are
rare. Our observations support the idea that the spread of the unfoldome has
been often overestimated. If we exclude some exceptions, the structure-function
paradigm is generally valid and pre-existing stereo-chemical complementarity
among structures remains an important requisite for interactions between
biological macromolecules.
