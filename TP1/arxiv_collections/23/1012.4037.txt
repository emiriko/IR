ALICE is the dedicated heavy-ion experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The
experiment has also a broad program of QCD measurements in proton-proton (pp)
collisions, which have two-fold interest: the study of particle production at
the highest energy frontier, and the definition of references for the
corresponding measurements in the upcoming Pb-Pb run. We present the first
results on the pseudorapidity and transverse-momentum dependence of charged
particle production in pp collisions at LHC energies, on the anti-p/p ratio and
on the Bose-Einstein particle correlations. As an outlook, we report on the
status of the ongoing analyses for strangeness and heavy-flavour production
measurements.
