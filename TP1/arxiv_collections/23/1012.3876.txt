We study heat transport and thermoelectric effects in two-dimensional
superconductors in a magnetic field. These are modeled as granular
Josephson-junction arrays, forming either regular or random lattices. We employ
two different models for the dynamics, relaxational model-A dynamics or
resistively and capacitively shunted Josephson junction (RCSJ) dynamics. We
derive expressions for the heat current in these models, which are then used in
numerical simulations to calculate the heat conductivity and the Nernst
coefficient for different temperatures and magnetic fields. At low temperatures
and zero magnetic field the heat conductivity in the RCSJ model is calculated
analytically from a spin wave approximation, and is seen to have an anomalous
logarithmic dependence on the system size, and also to diverge in the
completely overdamped limit C -> 0. From our simulations we find at low
magnetic fields that the Nernst signal displays a characteristic "tilted hill"
profile similar to experiments and a non-monotonic temperature dependence of
the heat conductivity. We also investigate the effects of granularity and
randomness, which become important for higher magnetic fields. In this regime
geometric frustration strongly influences the results in both regular and
random systems and leads to highly non-trivial magnetic field dependencies of
the studied transport coefficients.
