The Landau Fermi Liquid parameters are calculated for charge neutral
asymmetric nuclear matter in beta equilibrium at zero temperature in the
presence of a very strong magnetic field with relativistic mean-field models.
Due to the isospin structure of the system, with different populations of
protons and neutrons and spin alignment to the field, we find non-vanishing
Landau mixing parameters. The existence of quantized Landau levels for the
charged sector has some impact on the Landau parameters with the presence of
discretized features in those involving the proton sector. Using the Fermi
liquid formalism singlet and triplet excited quasiparticle states are analyzed,
and we find that in-medium effects and magnetic fields are competing, however,
the former are more important in the interaction energy range considered. It is
found that for magnetic field strengths Log$_{10}$ B (G) $\le 17$ the relative
low polarization of the system produces mild changes in the generalized Landau
parameters with respect to the unmagnetized case, while for larger strengths
there is a resolution of the degeneracy of the interaction energies of
quasiparticles in the system.
