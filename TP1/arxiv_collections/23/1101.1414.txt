A selfconsistent system of equations describing evolution of linear
spherically symmetric perturbations in Fridmann world by an arbitrary equation
of state is obtained. The perturbations singular part corresponding to massive
particle-like source is extracted, an evolutionary equation for mass of this
source is obtained and exactly solved. An exact solution of evolutionary
equations of state for perturbations by an arbitrary equation of state is
constructed.
