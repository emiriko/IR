In this contribution we will discuss two aspects of the matter created in
ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. First we will attempt to define a
universal measure for the fluidity of a substance, which will allow a correct
comparison between the fluidity of a Quark Gluon Plasma and any well known
substance. Second we will discuss current measurements of particle correlations
and their implication for possible local parity violation.
