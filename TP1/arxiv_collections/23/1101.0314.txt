The topological magnetoelectric effect (TME) is the fundamental quantization
effect for topological insulators in units of the fine structure constant
$\alpha$. In [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 166803(2010)], a topological quantization
condition of the TME is given under orthogonal incidence of the optical beam,
in which the wave length of the light or the thickness of the TI film must be
tuned to some commensurate values. This fine tuning is difficult to realize
experimentally. In this article, we give manifestly $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
covariant expressions for Kerr and Faraday angles at oblique incidence at a
topological insulator thick film. We obtain a generalized quantization
condition independent of material details, and propose a more easily realizable
optical experiment, in which only the incidence angle is tuned, to directly
measure the topological quantization associated with the TME.
