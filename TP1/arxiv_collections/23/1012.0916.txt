We propose a new method for mass production of the photonic crystal devices
on the basis of widely-known and well-developed technology such as
microstructured optical fibers. In this paper, we investigate the optical
properties of side-excited microstructured optical fiber and discuss the
conditions for utilization such a structure as a planar photonic crystal
device, namely, the high-quality resonance filter.
