We present, theoretically and experimentally, amorphous photonic lattices
exhibiting a band-gap yet completely lacking Bragg diffraction: 2D waveguides
distributed randomly according to a liquid-like model responsible for the
absence of Bragg peaks as opposed to ordered lattices containing disorder,
which always exhibit Bragg peaks. In amorphous lattices the bands are comprised
of localized states, but we find that defect states residing in the gap are
more localized than the Anderson localization length. Finally, we show how the
concept of effective mass carries over to amorphous lattices.
