Quantum integrable systems have very strong mathematical properties that
allow an exact description of their energetic spectrum. From the Bethe
equations, I formulate the Baxter "T-Q" relation, that is the starting point of
two complementary approaches based on nonlinear integral equations. The first
one is known as thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, the second one as
Kl\"umper-Batchelor-Pearce-Destri- de Vega. I show the steps toward the
derivation of the equations for some of the models concerned. I study the
infrared and ultraviolet limits and discuss the numerical approach. Higher rank
integrals of motion can be obtained, so gaining some control on the
eigenvectors. After, I discuss the Hubbard model in relation to the N = 4
supersymmetric gauge theory. The Hubbard model describes hopping electrons on a
lattice.
  In the second part, I present an evolutionary model based on Turing machines.
The goal is to describe aspects of the real biological evolution, or Darwinism,
by letting evolve populations of algorithms. Particularly, with this model one
can study the mutual transformation of coding/non coding parts in a genome or
the presence of an error threshold. The assembly of oligomeric proteins is an
important phenomenon which interests the majority of proteins in a cell. I
participated to the creation of the project "Gemini" which has for purpose the
investigation of the structural data of the interfaces of such proteins. The
objective is to differentiate the role of amino acids and determine the
presence of patterns characterizing certain geometries.
