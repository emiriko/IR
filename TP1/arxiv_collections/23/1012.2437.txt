We describe an event-based approach to simulate the propagation of an
electromagnetic plane wave through dielectric media. The basic building block
is a deterministic learning machine that is able to simulate a plane interface.
We show that a network of two of such machines can simulate the propagation of
light through a plane parallel plate. With properly chosen parameters this
setup can be used as a beam splitter. The modularity of the simulation method
is illustrated by constructing a Mach-Zehnder interferometer from plane
parallel plates, the whole system reproducing the results of wave theory. A
generalization of the event-based model of the plane parallel plate is also
used to simulate a periodically stratified medium.
