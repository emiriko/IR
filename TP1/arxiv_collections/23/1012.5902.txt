Inspired by the approach of kinetic theory of gases, a three-level
description (microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic) of cellular automaton is
presented. To provide an analytical treatment a simple domino cellular
automaton with avalanches was constructed. Formulas concerning exact relations
for density, clusters, avalanches and other parameters in an equilibrium state
were derived. It appears that some relations are approximately valid for
deviations from the equilibrium, so the adequate Ito equation could be
constructed. The equation provides the time evolution description of some
variable on the macroscopic level. The results also suggest a motive for
applying of the procedure of construction of the Ito equation (from time series
data) to natural time series.
