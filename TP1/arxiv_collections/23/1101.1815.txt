In recent times, many protocols have been proposed to provide security for
various information and communication systems. Such protocols must be tested
for their functional correctness before they are used in practice. Application
of formal methods for verification of security protocols would enhance their
reliability thereby, increasing the usability of systems that employ them.
Thus, formal verification of security protocols has become a key issue in
computer and communications security. In this paper we present, analyze and
compare some prevalent approaches towards verification of secure systems. We
follow the notion of - same goal through different approaches - as we formally
analyze the Needham Schroeder Public Key protocol for Lowe's attack using each
of our presented approaches.
