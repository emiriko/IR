We calculate the irreducible decomposition of the images of the Johnson
homomorphisms of the automorphism group of a free group and a free metabelian
group. We determine the abelianization of the derivation algebra of the Chen
Lie algebra as a Lie algebra, and show that the abelianizaton is given by the
degree one part and the Morita's trace maps. We also consider twisted
cohomology groups of the automorphism group of a free nilpotent group. We show
that the trace map for the exterior product defines a non-trivial twisted
second cohomology class of it.
