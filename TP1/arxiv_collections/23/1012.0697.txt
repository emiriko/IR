The role of data libraries in Monte Carlo simulation is discussed. A number
of data libraries currently in preparation are reviewed; their data are
critically examined with respect to the state-of-the-art in the respective
fields. Extensive tests with respect to experimental data have been performed
for the validation of their content.
