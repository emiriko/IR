We consider a noninteracting disordered system designed to model particle
diffusion, relaxation in glasses, and impurity bands of semiconductors.
Disorder originates in the random spatial distribution of sites. We find strong
numerical evidence that this model displays the same universal behavior as the
standard Anderson model. We use finite-size-scaling to find the localization
length as a function of energy and density, including localized states away
from the delocalization transition. Results at many energies all fit onto the
same universal scaling curve.
