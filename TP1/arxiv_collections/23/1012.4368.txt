We discuss how to calculate Yukawa couplings in string-derived orbifold GUTs.
As an application we investigate the quark mass hierarchies in these models. An
interplay of different mechanisms derived from string theory leads to an
interesting pattern. We discuss concrete examples in the context of heterotic
orbifold compactifications.
