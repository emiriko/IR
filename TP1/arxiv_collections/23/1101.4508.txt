We consider a cloud of fermionic atoms in an optical lattice described by a
Hubbard model with an additional linear potential. While homogeneous
interacting systems mainly show damped Bloch oscillations and heating, a finite
cloud behaves differently: It expands symmetrically such that gains of
potential energy at the top are compensated by losses at the bottom.
Interactions stabilize the necessary heat currents by inducing gradients of the
inverse temperature 1/T, with T<0 at the bottom of the cloud. An analytic
solution of hydrodynamic equations shows that the width of the cloud increases
with t^(1/3) for long times consistent with results from our Boltzmann
simulations.
