Electrons travelling in free space have allowed to explore fundamental
physics like the wave nature of matter, the Aharonov-Bohm and the Hanbury
Brown-Twiss effect. Complementarily, the precise control over the external
degrees of freedom of electrons has proven pivotal for wholly new types of
experiments such as high precision measurements of the electron's mass and
magnetic moment in Penning traps. Interestingly, the confinement of electrons
in the purely electric field of an alternating quadrupole has rarely been
considered. Recent advances in the development of planar chip-based ion traps
suggest that this technology can be applied to enable entirely new experiments
with electron beams guided in versatile potentials. Here we demonstrate the
transverse confinement of a low energy electron beam in a linear quadrupole
guide based on microstructured planar electrodes and driven at microwave
frequencies. A new guided matter-wave system will result, with applications
ranging from electron interferometry to novel non-invasive electron microscopy.
