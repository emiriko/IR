We demonstrate through exact solutions that a spin bath leads to stronger
(faster) dephasing of a qubit than a bosonic bath with identical bath-coupling
spectrum. This difference is due to the spin-bath "dressing" by the coupling.
Consequently, the quantum statistics of the bath strongly affects the pulse
sequences required to dynamically decouple the qubit from its bath.
