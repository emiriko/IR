Motivated by the recent work on critical gravity theories in dimensions D>3,
we reexamine the results in [arXiv:hep-th/0501044], where the conformal mass
definition of Ashtekar, Magnon and Das (AMD) for asymptotically AdS space-times
was generalized to incorporate curvature squared terms. The results in
[arXiv:hep-th/0501044] appear to contradict the findings in critical gravity,
where, using the methods of Deser and Tekin, black holes were shown to have
zero mass. We show that after correcting an error in [arXiv:hep-th/0501044],
the AMD approach actually produces results in complete agreement with those
obtained by using the methods of Deser and Tekin.
