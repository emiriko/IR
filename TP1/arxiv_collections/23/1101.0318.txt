In this paper, we apply the sorting network theory to construct an analog
rank order filter. We present a voltage mode CMOS two-input sorting element and
arrange these to form a rank order filter. The resulting circuit is simpleand
is a high-speed, high-precision design. Although the transistor count is
moderately higher than other designs, the proposed circuit simultaneously
outputs signals of all ranks rather than of just one specified rank. We also
develop a slightly modified design which calculates the rank of a given signal.
We present reports of simulations to verify the performance of the device.
