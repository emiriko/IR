Metastable LiMeO2-ZnO (Me = Fe3+, Ti3+) solid solutions with rock salt
crystal structure have been synthesized by solid state reaction of ZnO with
LiMeO2 complex oxides at 7.7 GPa and 1350-1450 K. Structure, phase composition,
thermal stability and thermal expansion of the recovered samples have been
studied by X-ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation. At ambient pressure
rock salt LiMeO2-ZnO solid solutions are kinetically stable up to 670-800 K
depending on the composition.
