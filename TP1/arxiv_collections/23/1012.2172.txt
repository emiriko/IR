We present combined CDF and D0 searches for the Standard Model (SM) and
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) Higgs boson using up to 6.7
fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity from 1.96 TeV proton-antiproton collisions
at the Tevatron. Specialized searches for Higgs bosons produced via gluon
fusion, associated boson production, and vector boson fusion, decaying to
$b\bar{b}$, $W^{+}W^{-}$, $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$, and $\gamma\gamma$ are combined
to produce 95\% CL upper limits on SM Higgs production as a function of mass.
Current Tevatron limits are shown, including a new exclusion for SM Higgs
masses between 158 and 175 GeV$/c^2$. We also present prospects for future
sensitivity.
