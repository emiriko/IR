This paper gives a geometric interpretation of the generalized (including the
regularization relation) double shuffle relation for multiple $L$-values.
Precisely it is proved that Enriquez' mixed pentagon equation implies the
relations. As a corollary, an embedding from his cyclotomic analogue of the
Grothendieck-Teichmuller group into Racinet's cyclotomic double shuffle group
is obtained. It cyclotomically extends the result of our previous paper and the
project of Deligne and Terasoma which are the special case N=1 of our result.
