We show that the complex Radon transform realizes an isomorphism between the
space of residual $\bar\partial$-cohomologies of a locally complete
intersection subvariety in a linearly concave domain of ${\C}P^n$ and the space
of holomorphic solutions of the associated homogeneous system of differential
equations withconstant coefficients in the dual domain in $({\C}P^n)^*$.
