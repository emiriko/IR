Massive stars are powerful sources of radiation, stellar winds, and supernova
explosions. The radiative and mechanical energies injected by massive stars
into the interstellar medium (ISM) profoundly alter the structure and evolution
of the ISM, which subsequently influences the star formation and chemical
evolution of the host galaxy. In this review, we will use the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC) as a laboratory to showcase effects of energy feedback from massive
young stellar objects (YSOs) and mature stars. We will also use the Carina
Nebula in the Galaxy to illustrate a multi-wavelength study of feedback from
massive star.
