This is an extended Reply to Comment by A. Sergeev, M.Y. Reizer, and V. Mitin
[arXiv:0906.2389] on our Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 067001 (2009)]. We
explicitly demonstrate that all claims by Sergeev et al. are completely
unfounded, because their underlying theoretical work contains multiple errors
and inconsistencies. For this reason, there is no need to revise the existing
theories of thermoelectric response in superconductors.
