We perform the baseline and energy optimization of the Neutrino Factory
including the latest simulation results on the magnetized iron detector (MIND).
We also consider the impact of tau decays, generated by nu_mu to nu_tau or nu_e
to nu_tau appearance, on the mass hierarchy, CP violation, and theta_{13}
discovery reaches, which we find to be negligible for the considered detector.
For the baseline-energy optimization for small theta_{13}, we qualitatively
recover the results with earlier simulations of the MIND detector. We find
optimal baselines of about 2500 km to 5000 km for the CP violation measurement,
where now values of E_mu as low as about 12 GeV may be possible. However, for
large theta_{13}, we demonstrate that the lower threshold and the backgrounds
reconstructed at lower energies allow in fact for muon energies as low as 5 GeV
at considerably shorter baselines, such as FNAL-Homestake. This implies that
with the latest MIND analysis, low- and high-energy versions of the Neutrino
Factory are just two different versions of the same experiment optimized for
different parts of the parameter space. Apart from a green-field study of the
updated detector performance, we discuss specific implementations for the
two-baseline Neutrino Factory, where the considered detector sites are taken to
be currently discussed underground laboratories. We find that reasonable setups
can be found for the Neutrino Factory source in Asia, Europe, and North
America, and that a triangular-shaped storage ring is possible in all cases
based on geometrical arguments only.
