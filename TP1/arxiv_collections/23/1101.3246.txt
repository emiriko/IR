The final results of processing the data from the balloon-born experiment
ATIC-2 (Antarctica, 2002-2003) for the energy spectra of protons and He, C, O,
Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe nuclei, the spectrum of all particles, and the mean
logarithm of atomic weight of primary cosmic rays as a function of energy are
presented. The final results are based on improvement of the methods used
earlier, in particular, considerably increased resolution of the charge
spectrum. The preliminary conclusions on the significant difference in the
spectra of protons and helium nuclei (the proton spectrum is steeper) and the
non-power character of the spectra of protons and heavier nuclei (flattening of
carbon spectrum at energies above 10 TeV) are confirmed. A complex structure of
the energy dependence of the mean logarithm of atomic weight is found.
