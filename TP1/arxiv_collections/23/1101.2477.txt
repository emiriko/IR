The no-signaling polytope associated to a Bell scenario with three parties,
two inputs, and two outputs is found to have 53856 extremal points, belonging
to 46 inequivalent classes. We provide a classification of these points
according to various definitions of multipartite non-locality and briefly
discuss other issues like the interconversion between extremal points seen as a
resource and the relation of the extremal points to Bell-type inequalities.
