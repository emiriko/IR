The RXTE and Swift observations on the 2009 outburst from a newly discovered
transient and black-hole candidate XTE J1652$-$453 are analyzed. The source was
observed by RXTE to behave a sequence of spectral states that are typical to
the black hole XRBs. During the first 7 observations, the source is diagnosed
to stay in a high/soft state, from the spectrum dominated by soft thermal
component which contributes an average of $\sim$ 85% to the X-ray flux at
2-20keV, and from the hardness $\sim$ 0.1 showing up in the hardness-intensity
diagram (HID). For the last 20 observations the spectral state is classified as
{\sl low/hard} according to an average hardness of $\sim$ 0.8 and a balance
between the thermal and the non-thermal components: a power-law component takes
${\geq}80%$ of total 2-20keV flux. Located in between is an {\sl intermediate}
state that the source might have experienced. The usual relationship between
rms and hardness presents in HRD as well. Throughout the outburst no QPOs are
found in XTE J1652$-$453.
