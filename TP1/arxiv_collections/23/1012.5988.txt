A numerical modeling of the radiation emitted from a Luminescent dye embedded
in a finite one-dimensional photonic crystal is presented. The Photonic Band
Structure and the Photonic Density of States are derived using classical
electromagnetic approach, and the Finite Difference Time-Domain formalism is
used to calculate the electromagnetic field distribution. It is found that the
periodic modulation provides an effective way to control the Spontaneous
Emission under certain circumstances. We find the conditions where a large
amount of light can be enhanced on the vicinity of a photonic band edge due to
the presence of a high density of states.
  This phenomena opens the possibility to design new Lasers sources.
