We consider a simple model of quantum disorder in two dimensions,
characterized by a long-range site-to-site hopping. The system undergoes a
metal-insulator transition -- its eigenfunctions change from being extended to
being localized. We demonstrate that at the point of the transition the
eigenfunctions do not become fractal. Their density moments do not scale as a
power of the system size. Instead, in one of the considered limits our result
suggests a power of the logarithm of the system size. In this regard, the
transition differs from a similar one in the one-dimensional version of the
same system, as well as from the conventional Anderson transition in more than
two dimensions.
