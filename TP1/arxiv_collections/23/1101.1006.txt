We study a spin 1 Bose condensate small enough to be treated as a single
magnetic `domain': a system that we term a microcondensate. Because all
particles occupy a single spatial mode, this quantum many body system has a
well defined classical limit consisting of three degrees of freedom,
corresponding to the three macroscopically occupied spin states. We study both
the classical limit and its quantization, finding an integrable system in both
cases. Depending on the sign of the ratio of the spin interaction energy and
the quadratic Zeeman energy, the classical limit displays either a separartrix
in phase space, or Hamiltonian monodromy corresponding to non-trivial phase
space topology. We discuss the quantum signatures of these classical phenomena
using semiclassical quantization as well as an exact solution using the Bethe
ansatz.
