Sifting limits for the $\Lambda^{2}\Lambda^{-}$ sieve, Selberg's lower bound
sieve, are computed for integral dimensions $1<\kappa\le10$. The evidence
strongly suggests that for all $\kappa\ge3$ the $\Lambda^{2}\Lambda^{-}$ sieve
is superior to the competing combinatorial sieves of Diamond, Halberstam, and
Richert. A method initiated by Grupp and Richert for computing sieve functions
for integral $\kappa$ is also outlined.
