We derive five-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory from mass-deformed ABJM
theory by expanding about $S^2$ for large Chern-Simons level $K$. We obtain the
Yang-Mills coupling constant $g_{YM}^2 = 4\pi^2 R/K$. If we consider
$S^3/{\mb{Z}_K}$ as a fiber bundle over $S^2$ then $R/K$ is the circumference
of the fiber. The value on the coupling constant agrees with what one gets by
compactifying M five-brane on that fiber. For this computation we take $R,K\to
\infty$ while keeping $R/K$ at a fixed finite value. We also study mass
deformed star-three-product BLG theory at K=1 and $R\to \infty$. In that limit
we obtain Lorentz covariant supersymmetry variations and gauge variations of a
non-Abelian tensor multiplet.
