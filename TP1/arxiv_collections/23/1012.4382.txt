Excitonic models of light-harvesting complexes, where the vibrational degrees
of freedom are treated as a bath, are commonly used to describe the motion of
the electronic excitation through a molecule. Recent experiments point toward
the possibility of memory effects in this process and require to consider time
non-local propagation techniques. The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)
were proposed by Ishizaki and Fleming to describe the site-dependent
reorganization dynamics of protein environments (J. Chem. Phys., 130, p.
234111, 2009), which plays a significant role in photosynthetic electronic
energy transfer. HEOM are often used as a reference for other approximate
methods, but have been implemented only for small systems due to their adverse
computational scaling with the system size. Here, we show that HEOM are also
solvable for larger systems, since the underlying algorithm is ideally suited
for the usage of graphics processing units (GPU). The tremendous reduction in
computational time due to the GPU allows us to perform a systematic study of
the energy-transfer efficiency in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO)
light-harvesting complex at physiological temperature under full consideration
of memory-effects. We find that approximative methods differ qualitatively and
quantitatively from the HEOM results and discuss the importance of finite
temperature to achieve high energy-transfer efficiencies.
