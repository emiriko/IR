The superallowed beta-decay rates that provide stringent constraints on
physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics are affected by nuclear
structure effects through isospin-breaking corrections. The self-consistent
isospin- and angular-momentum-projected nuclear density functional theory is
used for the first time to compute those corrections for a number of Fermi
transitions in nuclei from A=10 to A=74. The resulting leading element of the
CKM matrix, |V_{ud}|= 0.97447(23), agrees well with the recent result by Towner
and Hardy [Phys. Rev. C {\bf 77}, 025501 (2008)].
