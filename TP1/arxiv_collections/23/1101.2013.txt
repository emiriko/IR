We present the magnetic and transport behavior of some Tb compounds, viz.,
TbIrGe2, TbFe(0.4)Ge2, and TbCo(0.4)Ge2. The stoichoometric germanide TbIrGe2
exhibits at least two distinct magnetic transitions in a close temperature
interval around 10 K. The non-stoichiometric compounds, TbFe(0.4)Ge2 and
TbCo(0.4)Ge2, undergo magnetic ordering around 17 and 19 K respectively. The
magnetic state of these compouds appears to be antiferromagnetic-like.
Qualitatively, there is a correlation between the field response of the
magnetization (M), the magnetoresistance (MR) and the entropy change curve in
all these compouds. That is, these Tb compounds exhibit a "positive" MR and
entropy change beyond a magnetic field where M also shows a field-induced
transition. On the basis of this correlaion, we conclude that magnetic
disorder/fluctuations beyond a critical field - "a phenomenon called inverse
metamagnetism" - rather than metamagnetism,is induced in these compounds.
