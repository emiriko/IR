The fluid-scale evolution of relativistic magnetic reconnection is
investigated by using two-fluid and magnetofluid simulation models.
Relativistic two-fluid simulations demonstrate the meso-scale evolution beyond
the kinetic scales, and exhibit quasi-steady Petschek-type reconnection.
Resistive relativistic MHD simulations further show new shock structures in and
around the downstream magnetic island (plasmoid). General discussions on these
models are presented.
