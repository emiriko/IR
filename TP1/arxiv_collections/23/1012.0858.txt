We review recent progresses on jet quenching measurements by PHENIX. With
increased statistics, PHENIX has gone beyond the single hadron suppression
$R_{\rm AA}$, and made measurements on multiple jet quenching observables, such
as $v_2$, $I_{\rm AA}$ and $v_2^{I_{\rm AA}}$. We argue that, by combining
these observables together, one can achieve a better understanding of the
energy loss mechanism. We present new $\gamma$-hadron correlation results with
associated hadrons extended to low $p_T$; an enhancement has been observed,
suggesting a contribution of genuine medium response that is relatively
unbiased by the initial geometry fluctuations. The status of full jet
reconstruction and future perspective of PHENIX jet quenching program are
discussed.
