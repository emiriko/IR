Moments of the vorticity are used to define and estimate a hierarchy of
time-averaged inverse length scales for weak solutions of the
three-dimensional, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a periodic box.
The estimate for the smallest of these inverse scales coincides with the
inverse Kolmogorov length but thereafter the exponents of the Reynolds number
rise rapidly for correspondingly higher moments. The implications of these
results for the computational resolution of small scale vortical structures are
discussed.
