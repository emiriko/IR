In the faint star KIC 9700322 observed by the Kepler satellite, 76
frequencies with amplitudes from 14 to 29000 ppm were detected. The two
dominant frequencies at 9.79 and 12.57 c/d (113.3 and 145.5 \mu Hz),
interpreted to be radial modes, are accompanied by a large number of
combination frequencies. A small additional modulation with a 0.16 c/d
frequency is also seen; this is interpreted to be the rotation frequency of the
star. The corresponding prediction of slow rotation is confirmed by a spectrum
from which v sin i = 19 \pm 1 km/s is obtained. The analysis of the spectrum
shows that the star is one of the coolest {\delta} Sct variables. We also
determine Teff = 6700 \pm 100 K and log g = 3.7 \pm 0.1, compatible with the
observed frequencies of the radial modes. Normal solar abundances are found. An
\ell = 2 frequency quintuplet is also detected with a frequency separation
consistent with predictions from the measured rotation rate. A remarkable
result is the absence of additional independent frequencies down to an
amplitude limit near 14 ppm, suggesting that the star is stable against most
forms of nonradial pulsation. The frequency spectrum of this star emphasizes
the need for caution in interpreting low frequencies in {\delta} Sct stars as
independent gravity modes. A low frequency peak at 2.7763 c/d in KIC 9700322
is, in fact, the frequency difference between the two dominant modes and is
repeated over and over in various frequency combinations involving the two
dominant modes. The relative phases of the combination frequencies show a
strong correlation with frequency, but the physical significance of this result
is not clear.
