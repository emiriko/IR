Measurement based quantum computation requires the generation of a cluster
state (quantum resource) prior to starting a computation. Generation of this
entangled state can be difficult with many schemes already proposed. We present
an abstract scheme which can create 2D cluster states as a universal resource
for quantum computing. We find a linear scaling of grid size with cluster
depth. The scheme is also capable of creating more exotic topologies including
3D structures and the unit cell for topological error correction. We note its
relevance to the cavity QED scheme in [30] although it could be applied to
various architectures.
