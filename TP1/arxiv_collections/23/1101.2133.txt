We implement in a reactive programming framework a simulation of three
aspects of quantum mechanics: self-interference, state superposition, and
entanglement. The simulation basically consists in a cellular automaton
embedded in a synchronous environment which defines global discrete instants
and broadcast events. The implementation shows how a simulation of fundamental
aspects of quantum mechanics can be obtained from the synchronous parallel
combination of a small number of elementary components.
