Within the field of numerical multilinear algebra, block tensors are
increasingly important. Accordingly, it is appropriate to develop an
infrastructure that supports reasoning about block tensor computation. In this
paper we establish concise notation that is suitable for the analysis and
development of block tensor algorithms, prove several useful block tensor
identities, and make precise the notion of a block tensor unfolding.
