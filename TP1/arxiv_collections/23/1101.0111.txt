We say that a symmetric noncommutative polynomial in the noncommutative free
variables (x_1, x_2, ..., x_g) is noncommutative plurisubharmonic on a
noncommutative open set if it has a noncommutative complex hessian that is
positive semidefinite when evaluated on open sets of matrix tuples of
sufficiently large size. In this paper, we show that if a noncommutative
polynomial is noncommutative plurisubharmonic on a noncommutative open set,
then the polynomial is actually noncommutative plurisubharmonic everywhere and
has the form p = \sum f_j^T f_j + \sum k_j k_j^T + F + F^T where the sums are
finite and f_j, k_j, F are all noncommutative analytic. In the paper by Greene,
Helton, and Vinnikov, it is shown that if p is noncommutative plurisubharmonic
everywhere, then p has the form above. In other words, the paper by Greene,
Helton, and Vinnikov makes a global assumption while the current paper makes a
local assumption, but both reach the same conclusion. This paper uses a
Gram-like matrix representation of noncommutative polynomials. A careful
analysis of this Gram matrix plus the main theorem in the paper by Greene,
Helton, and Vinnikov ultimately force the form in the equation above.
