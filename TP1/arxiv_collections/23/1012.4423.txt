We study the gravitational wave emission of three compact objects using
post-Newtonian (PN) equations of motion derived from the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner
Hamiltonian formulation, where we include (for the first time in this context)
terms up to 2.5 PN order. We perform numerical simulations of a hierarchical
configuration of three compact bodies in which a binary system is perturbed by
a third, lighter body initially far away from the binary. The relative
importance of the different PN orders is examined. We compute the waveform in
the linear regime considering mass quadrupole, current quadrupole and mass
octupole contributions. Performing a spherical harmonic decomposition of the
waveforms we find that from the l = 3 modes it is possible to extract
information about the third body, in particular, the period, eccentricity of
its orbit, and the inclination angle between the inner and outer binary orbits.
