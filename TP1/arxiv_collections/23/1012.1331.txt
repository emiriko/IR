In this presentation Gfitter results from the global Standard Model (SM) fit
to electroweak precision data are discussed. We have used the latest
measurements of m_top and M_W and the most recent results for direct Higgs
searches at LEP and Tevatron. We obtain M_H=121^{+17}_{-6} GeV and a 95% CL
upper limit of 155 GeV for the SM Higgs mass. The forth-order result for the
strong coupling constant is given by alpha_S(M_Z^2)=0.1193 +- 0.0028(exp) +-
0.0001(theo). In addition the electroweak fit has been performed with the top
mass determined from the ttbar cross-section as measured at Tevatron.
