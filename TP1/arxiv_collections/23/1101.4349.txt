The paper deals with Bianchi type V Universe, which has dynamical energy
density. We consider Bianchi type V space-time, introducing three different
skewness parameters along spatial directions to quantify the deviation of
pressure from isotropy. To study the anisotropic nature of the dynamical dark
energy, we assume that the skewness parameters are time dependent. It is found
that the Universe achieves flatness in quintessence model. The physical
behavior of the Universe has been discussed in detail.
