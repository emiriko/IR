We present a new class of exponential integrators for ordinary differential
equations. They are locally exact, i.e., they preserve the linearization of the
original system at every point. Their construction consists in modifying
existing numerical schemes in order to make them locally exact. The resulting
schemes preserve all fixed points and are A-stable. The most promising results
concern the discrete gradient method (modified implicit midpoint rule) where we
succeeded to preserve essential geometric properties and the final results have
a relatively simple form. In the case of one-dimensional Hamiltonian systems
numerical experiments show that our modifications can increase the accuracy by
several orders of magnitude. The main result of this paper is the construction
of energy-preserving locally exact discrete gradient schemes for arbitrary
multidimensional Hamiltonian systems in canonical coordinates.
