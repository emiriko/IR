We study the influence of turbulent viscosity variability on the properties
of self-propelled body wake model. In addition to the already known integrals
of motion obtained with constant turbulent viscosity, we obtain new ones. The
presence of new integrals of motion leads, in particular, to changes in the
behavior of the width and profile of the wake leading to its conservation.
