Single dopants in semiconductor nanostructures have been studied in great
details recently as they are good candidates for quantum bits, provided they
are coupled to a detector. Here we report coupling of a single As donor atom to
a single-electron transistor (SET) in a silicon nanowire field-effect
transistor. Both capacitive and tunnel coupling are achieved, the latter
resulting in a dramatic increase of the conductance through the SET, by up to
one order of magnitude. The experimental results are well explained by the rate
equations theory developed in parallel with the experiment.
