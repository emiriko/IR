We concern with a special class of binary cellular automata, i.e., the
so-called particle cellular automata (PCA) in the present paper. We first
propose max-plus expressions to PCA of 4 neighbors. Then, by utilizing basic
operations of the max-plus algebra and appropriate transformations, PCA4-1, 4-2
and 4-3 are solved exactly and their general solutions are found in terms of
max-plus expressions. Finally, we analyze the asymptotic behaviors of general
solutions and prove the fundamental diagrams exactly.
