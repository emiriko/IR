We have identified several lithium-rich low-mass (0.08<M<0.3 Msun). stars
within 5.5 deg of the young open cluster Eta Chamaeleontis, nearly four times
the radius of previous search efforts. We propose 4 new probable cluster
members and 3 possible members requiring further investigation. Candidates were
selected on the basis of DENIS and 2MASS photometry, NOMAD astrometry and
extensive follow-up spectroscopy. Several of these stars show substantial
variation in their H-alpha emission line strengths on timescales of days to
months, with at least one event attributable to accretion from a circumstellar
disk. These findings are consistent with a dynamical origin for the current
configuration of the cluster, without the need to invoke an abnormally
top-heavy Initial Mass Function, as proposed by some authors.
