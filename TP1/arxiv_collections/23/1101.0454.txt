Maximally symmetric manifolds with holonomy in the unitary quaternionic group
Sp(d/4) emerge from the non-Abelian Kaluza-Klein reduction of conformally flat
spaces. Thus, all special manifolds with constant properly `holonomy-related'
sectional curvature, are in natural correspondence with conformally flat,
possibly non-Abelian, Kaluza-Klein spaces.
