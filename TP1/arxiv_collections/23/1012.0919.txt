We investigate nonlinear one- and two-dimensional photonic crystals by
applying a finite element-iterative method.Numerical results show the essential
influence of nonlinear elements embedded into a quarter-wave stack and the
sharp photonic crystal waveguide bend on the spectral characteristics of these
structures. We compare our results with those obtained in [21] from the
discrete equation method for the case of a sharp waveguide bend. The comparison
shows that neglecting the nonuniform field distribution inside the embedded
nonlinear elements leads to overestimation of the waveguide bend
transmissivity.
