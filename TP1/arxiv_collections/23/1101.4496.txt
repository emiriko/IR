A direct experimental evidence of the occurrence of the weak reaction
$\Lambda np\rightarrow nnp$ in nuclei has been obtained by the FINUDA
experiment. Three events have been found that can be attributed to
$^{7}_{\Lambda}$Li and $^{9}_{\Lambda}$Be two nucleon-induced non mesonic weak
decays. The kinematic analysis of such events is presented here.
