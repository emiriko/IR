This paper presents an exhaustive approach for verification of the weak
reconstruction of Self Complementary Graphs up to 17 vertices. It describes the
general problem of the Reconstruction Conjecture, explaining the complexity
involved in checking deck-isomorphism between two graphs. In order to improve
the computation time, various pruning techniques have been employed to reduce
the number of graph-isomorphism comparisons. These techniques offer great help
in proceeding with a reconstructive approach. An analysis of the numbers
involved is provided, along with the various limitations of this approach. A
list enumerating the number of SC graphs up till 101 vertices is also appended.
