We report a statistical analysis about people agglomeration soundscape.
Specifically, we investigate the normalized sound amplitudes and intensities
that emerge from people collective meetings. Our findings support the existence
of nontrivial dynamics characterized by heavy tail distributions in the sound
amplitudes, long-range correlations in the sound intensity and non-exponential
distributions in the return interval distributions. Additionally, motivated by
the time-dependent behavior present in the volatility/variance series, we
compare the observational data with those obtained from a minimalist
autoregressive stochastic model, a GARCH process, finding a good agreement.
