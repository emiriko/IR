The downside risk of a portfolio of (equity)assets is generally substantially
higher than the downside risk of its components. In particular in times of
crises when assets tend to have high correlation, the understanding of this
difference can be crucial in managing systemic risk of a portfolio. In this
paper we generalize Merton's option formula in the presence jumps to the
multi-asset case. It is shown how common jumps across assets provide an
intuitive and powerful tool to describe systemic risk that is consistent with
data. The methodology provides a new way to mark and risk-manage systemic risk
of portfolios in a systematic way.
