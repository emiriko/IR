We show that a von Neumann measurement on a part of a composite quantum
system unavoidably creates distillable entanglement between the measurement
apparatus and the system if the state has nonzero quantum discord. The minimal
distillable entanglement is equal to the one-way information deficit. The
quantum discord is shown to be equal to the minimal partial distillable
entanglement that is the part of entanglement which is lost, when we ignore the
subsystem which is not measured. We then show that any entanglement measure
corresponds to some measure of quantum correlations. This powerful
correspondence also yields necessary properties for quantum correlations. We
generalize the results to multipartite measurements on a part of the system and
on the total system.
