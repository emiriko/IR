Far-infrared spectra of magneto-dielectric Dy3Fe5O12 garnet were studied
between 13 and 100 cm-1 and at low temperatures between 5 and 80 K. A
combination of transmission, reflectivity, and rotating analyzer ellipsometry
was used to unambiguously identify the type of the dipole activity of the
infrared modes. In addition to purely dielectric and magnetic modes, we
observed several hybrid modes with a mixed magnetic and electric dipole
activity. These modes originate from the superexchange between magnetic moments
of Fe and Dy ions. Using 4x4 matrix formalism for materials with Mu=/=1, we
modeled the experimental optical spectra and determined the far-infrared
dielectric and magnetic permeability functions. The matching condition
Mu(Wh)*Se=Eps(Wh)*Sm for the oscillator strengths Se(m) explains the observed
vanishing of certain hybrid modes at Wh in reflectivity.
