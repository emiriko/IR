The bold diagrammatic Monte Carlo (BDMC) method performs an unbiased sampling
of Feynman's diagrammatic series using skeleton diagrams. For lattice models
the efficiency of BDMC can be dramatically improved by incorporating dynamic
mean-field theory (DMFT) solutions into renormalized propagators. From the DMFT
perspective, combining it with BDCM leads to an unbiased method with
well-defined accuracy. We illustrate the power of this approach by computing
the single-particle propagator (and thus the density of states) in the
non-perturbative regime of the Anderson localization problem, where a gain of
the order of $10^4$ is achieved with respect to conventional BDMC in terms of
convergence to the exact answer.
