This article surveys the procedures used for deriving detector transfer
functions and normalizing probability densities for the statistical analysis
technique known as the "matrix element method" in the context of high energy
physics (HEP) data analysis. Common misconceptions about transfer functions and
efficiencies are pointed out and clarified.
