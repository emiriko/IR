Using two simulations of 1.5D, for the first time, in Costa et al. (2009) and
Shulz et al. (2010) we numerically reproduce the observational dark inflows
described in Verwichte et al. (2005). We show that the dark tracks can be
explained as hot plasma vacuums generated upstream of a slow magnetoacoustic
shock wave produced by a localized deposition of energy. In this work, we show
that the overall 2D results are in agreement with the observational behaviour.
However they show a slight shift in the characteristic parameter with respect
to those found previously. Also, we confirm qualitatively the behaviour found
in the previous papers, i.e. for a given numerical domain the period of the
kink--like structure is a function of the magnetic field intensity: larger
periods are associated with lower magnetic field intensities. Contrary to the
1D result -where the sunward dynamic is independent of the magnetic field
intensity due to its exclusively waveguide role- in the 2D simulation the
sunward speed is larger for larger values of the magnetic field. This can be
interpreted as the capability of the low coronal plasma to collimate the
deposition of energy into the magnetic field direction. The moving features
consistent of low--density and high--temperature plasma cavities have larger
inside values of the structuring parameter beta than the neighboring media.
Thus, the voids seem to be the emergence structures of a whole nonlinear
interacting plasma context of shocks and waves more than voided plasma loops
magnetically structured.
