The directed transport of Brownian particles requires a system with an
asymmetry and with non-equilibrium noise. We here investigate numerically
alternative ways of fulfilling these requirements for a two-state Brownian
motor, realised with Brownian particles alternating between two phase-shifted,
symmetric potentials. We show that, besides the previously known
spatio-temporal asymmetry based on unequal transfer rates between the
potentials, inequalities in the potential depths, the frictions, or the
equilibrium temperatures of the two potentials also generate the required
asymmetry. We also show that the effects of the thermal noise and the noise of
the transfer's randomness depend on the way the asymmetry is induced.
