We propose a new type of bottom-up holographic model describing the Regge
like spectrum of mesons. This type of spectrum emerges due to condensation of a
scalar field in the bulk anti-de Sitter space. The gauge invariance of the
action describing the vector mesons requires that the bulk scalar field must
correspond to an operator of canonical dimension two. This is not necessary for
the description of the scalar sector where the generation of the mass spectrum
can be directly related to the formation of gluon condensate in QCD. It is also
demonstrated that such an explicit introduction of local dim2 operator into the
model leads to disappearance of the corresponding contribution from the dim2
condensate in the power expansion of the gauge-invariant vector correlator as
required by QCD.
