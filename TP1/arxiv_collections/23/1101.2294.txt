Influence of quantum critical point (QCP) of first-order valence transition
(FOVT) on Ce- and Yb-based heavy fermions is discussed as a key origin of
anomalies such as non-Fermi liquid, metamagnetism, and unconventional
superconductivity. Even in intermediate-valence materials, the QCP of the FOVT
is shown to be induced by applying a magnetic field, which creates a new
characteristic energy distinct from the Kondo temperature. It is stressed that
the key concept is closeness to the QCP of the FOVT by pointing out that the
proximity of the QCP explains sharp contrast between X=Ag and X=Cd in YbXCu4,
field-induced valence crossover in X=Au, and field-induced first order
transition as well as non-Fermi-liquid critical behaviours in CeIrIn5. The
valence fluctuations can be a key origin of unresolved phenomena in this family
of materials.
