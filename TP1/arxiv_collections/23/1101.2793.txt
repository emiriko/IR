M-theory can be defined on closed manifolds as well as on manifolds with
boundary. As an extension, we show that manifolds with corners appear naturally
in M-theory. We illustrate this with four situations: The lift to bounding
twelve dimensions of M-theory on Anti de Sitter spaces, ten-dimensional
heterotic string theory in relation to twelve dimensions, and the two M-branes
within M-theory in the presence of a boundary. The M2-brane is taken with (or
as) a boundary and the worldvolume of the M5-brane is viewed as a tubular
neighborhood. We then concentrate on (variant) of the heterotic theory as a
corner and explore analytical and geometric consequences. In particular, we
formulate and study the phase of the partition function in this setting and
identify the corrections due to the corner(s). The analysis involves
considering M-theory on disconnected manifolds, and makes use of the extension
of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem to manifolds with corners and the
b-calculus of Melrose.
