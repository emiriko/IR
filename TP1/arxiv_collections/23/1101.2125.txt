The AGILE gamma-ray satellite provides large sky exposure levels ($\geq 10^9$
cm$^2$ s per year on the Galactic Plane) with sensitivity peaking at $E\sim$100
MeV where the bulk of pulsar energy output is typically released. Its $\sim$1
$\mu$s absolute time tagging capability makes it perfectly suited for the study
of gamma-ray pulsars. AGILE collected a large number of gamma-ray photons from
EGRET pulsars ($\geq$40,000 pulsed counts for Vela) in two years of
observations unveiling new interesting features at sub-millisecond level in the
pulsars' high-energy light-curves, gamma-ray emission from pulsar glitches and
Pulsar Wind Nebulae. AGILE detected about 20 nearby and energetic pulsars with
good confidence through timing and/or spatial analysis. Among the newcomers we
find pulsars with very high rotational energy losses, such as the remarkable
PSR B1509--58 with a magnetic field in excess of 10$^{13}$ Gauss, and PSR
J2229+6114 providing a reliable identification for the previously unidentified
EGRET source 3EG 2227+6122. Moreover, the powerful millisecond pulsar
B1821--24, in the globular cluster M28, is detected during a fraction of the
observations.
