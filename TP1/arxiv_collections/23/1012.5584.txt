We propose and demonstrate a scheme for boosting up the efficiency of
entanglement distribution based on a decoherence-free subspace (DFS) over lossy
quantum channels. By using backward propagation of a coherent light, our scheme
achieves an entanglement-sharing rate that is proportional to the transmittance
T of the quantum channel in spite of encoding qubits in multipartite systems
for the DFS. We experimentally show that highly entangled states, which can
violate the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, are distributed at a rate
proportional to T.
