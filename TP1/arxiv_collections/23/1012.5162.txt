It was shown that two distant particles can be entangled by sending a third
particle never entangled with the other two [T. S. Cubitt et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 91, 037902 (2003)]. In this paper, we investigate a class of three-qubit
separable states to distribute entanglement by the same way, and calculate the
maximal amount of entanglement which two particles of separable states in the
class can have after applying the way.
