We report the piezoresisitivity in magnetic thin films of FeGa and their use
for fabricating self transducing microcantilevers. The actuation occurs as a
consequence of both the ferromagnetic and magnetostrictive property of FeGa
thin films, while the deflection readout is achieved by exploiting the
piezoresisitivity of these films. This self-sensing, self-actuating
micromechanical system involves a very simple bilayer structure, which
eliminates the need for the more complex piezoelectric stack that is commonly
used in active cantilevers. Thus, it potentially opens opportunities for
remotely actuated, cantilever-based sensors.
