The anticipated physics program at an high energy e+e- linear collider places
special emphasis on the accuracy in extrapolating charged particle tracks to
their production vertex to tag heavy quarks and leptons. This paper reviews
physics motivations and performance requirements, sensor R&D directions and
current results of the studies for a vertex tracker at a future linear
collider.
