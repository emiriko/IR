We establish the reciprocity law along a vertical curve for residues of
differential forms on arithmetic surfaces, and describe Grothendieck's trace
map of the surface as a sum of residues. Points at infinity are then
incorporated into the theory and the reciprocity law is extended to all curves
on the surface. Applications to adelic duality for the arithmetic surface are
discussed.
