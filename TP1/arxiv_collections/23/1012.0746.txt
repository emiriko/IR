We present a terminating tableau calculus for graded hybrid logic with global
modalities, reflexivity, transitivity and role hierarchies. Termination of the
system is achieved through pattern-based blocking. Previous approaches to
related logics all rely on chain-based blocking. Besides being conceptually
simple and suitable for efficient implementation, the pattern-based approach
gives us a NExpTime complexity bound for the decision procedure.
