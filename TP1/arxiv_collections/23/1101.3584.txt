Natural earthquake fault systems are highly non-homogeneous. The
inhomogeneities occur be- cause the earth is made of a variety of materials
which hold and dissipate stress differently. In this work, we study scaling in
earthquake fault models which are variations of the Olami-Feder- Christensen
(OFC) and Rundle-Jackson-Brown (RJB) models. We use the scaling to explore the
effect of spatial inhomogeneities due to damage and inhomogeneous stress
dissipation in the earthquake-fault-like systems when the stress transfer range
is long, but not necessarily longer than the length scale associated with the
inhomogeneities of the system. We find that the scaling depends not only on the
amount of damage, but also on the spatial distribution of that damage.
