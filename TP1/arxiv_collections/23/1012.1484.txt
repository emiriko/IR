We observe apparent hole pockets in the Fermi surfaces of single-layer
Bi-based cuprate superconductors from angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES).
From detailed low-energy electron diffraction measurements and an analysis of
the ARPES polarization-dependence, we show that these pockets are not
intrinsic, but arise from multiple overlapping superstructure replicas of the
main and shadow bands. We further demonstrate that the hole pockets reported
recently from ARPES [Meng et al, Nature 462, 335 (2009)] have a similar
structural origin, and are inconsistent with an intrinsic hole pocket
associated with the electronic structure of a doped CuO$_2$ plane. The nature
of the Fermi surface topology in the enigmatic pseudogap phase therefore
remains an open question.
