Long-lived electronic coherences in various photosynthetic complexes at
cryogenic and room temperature have generated vigorous efforts both in theory
and experiment to understand their origins and explore their potential role to
biological function. The ultrafast signals resulting from the experiments that
show evidence for these coherences result from many contributions to the
molecular polarization. Quantum process tomography (QPT) was conceived in the
context of quantum information processing to characterize and understand
general quantum evolution of controllable quantum systems, for example while
carrying out quantum computational tasks. We introduce our QPT method for
ultrafast experiments, and as an illustrative example, apply it to a simulation
of a two-chromophore subsystem of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic
complex, which was recently shown to have long-lived quantum coherences. Our
Fenna-Matthews-Olson model is constructed using an atomistic approach to
extract relevant parameters for the simulation of photosynthetic complexes that
consists of a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics approach combined with
molecular dynamics and the use of state-of-the-art quantum master equations. We
provide a set of methods that allow for quantifying the role of quantum
coherence, dephasing, relaxation and other elementary processes in energy
transfer efficiency in photosynthetic complexes, based on the information
obtained from the atomistic simulations, or, using QPT, directly from the
experiment. The ultimate goal of the combination of this diverse set of
methodologies is to provide a reliable way of quantifying the role of
long-lived quantum coherences and obtain atomistic insight of their causes.
