In this paper we investigate statistical equilibrium of Ti in the atmospheres
of late-type stars. The Ti I/Ti II level populations are computed with
available experimental atomic data, except for photoionization and collision
induced transition rates, for which we have to rely on theoretical
approximations. For the Sun, the NLTE line formation with adjusted H I
inelastic collision rates and MAFAGS-OS model atmosphere solve the
long-standing discrepancy between Ti I and Ti II lines. The NLTE abundances
determined from both ionization stages agree within $0.01$ dex with each other
and with the Ti abundance in C I meteorites. The Ti NLTE model does not perform
similarly well for the metal-poor stars, overestimating NLTE effects in the
atmospheres of dwarfs, but underestimating overionization for giants.
Investigating different sources of errors, we find that only [Ti/Fe] ratios
based on Ti II and Fe II lines can be safely used in studies of Galactic
chemical evolution. To avoid spurious abundance trends with metallicity and
dwarf/giant discrepancies, it is strongly recommended to disregard Ti I lines
in abundance analyses, as well as in determination of surface gravities.
