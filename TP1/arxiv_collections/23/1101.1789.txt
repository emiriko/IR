The scaling of the growth of CdTe films on glass substrates was investigated
by Mata \textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{78}, 115305 (2008)]. Part of the
analysis consisted of the estimation of the correlation length $\xi$ using the
decay in the height-height correlation function. Afterwards, the dynamical
exponent $z$ was determined using the scaling hypothesis $\xi\sim t^{1/z}$. In
this Addendum, we show that the correlation lengths obtained by Mata \textit{et
al.} provide a long wavelength coarsening exponent that does not correspond to
the dynamical exponent $z$. We also show that the short wavelength coarsening
exponent is consistent with the exponent $z$ obtained by Nascimento \textit{et
al}. [arXiv:1101.1493] via generic dynamical scaling theory.
