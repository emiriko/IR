We demonstrate non-destructive (loss-less) fluorescent state detection of
individual neutral atom qubits trapped in an optical lattice. The hyperfine
state of the atom is measured with a 95% accuracy and an atom loss rate of 1%.
Individual atoms are initialized and detected over 100 times before being lost
from the trap, representing a 100-fold improvement in data collection rates
over previous experiments. Microwave Rabi oscillations are observed with
repeated measurements of one-and-the-same single atom.
