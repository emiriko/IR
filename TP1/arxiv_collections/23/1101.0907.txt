The mass spectrum of pure Yang-Mills theory in 3+1 dimensions is discussed
for an arbitrary simple gauge algebra within a quasigluon picture. The general
structure of the low-lying gluelump and two-quasigluon glueball spectrum is
shown to be common to all algebras, while the lightest $C=-$ three-quasigluon
glueballs only exist when the gauge algebra is A$_{r\geq 2}$, that is in
particular $\mathfrak{su}(N\geq3)$. Higher-lying $C=-$ glueballs are shown to
exist only for the A$_{r\geq2}$, D$_{{\rm odd}-r\geq 4}$ and E$_6$ gauge
algebras. The shape of the static energy between adjoint sources is also
discussed assuming the Casimir scaling hypothesis and a funnel form; it appears
to be gauge-algebra dependent when at least three sources are considered. As a
main result, the present framework's predictions are shown to be consistent
with available lattice data in the particular case of an $\mathfrak{su}(N)$
gauge algebra within 't Hooft's large-$N$ limit.
