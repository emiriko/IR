The establishment of links between data (e.g., patient records) and Web
resources (e.g., literature) and the proper visualization of such discovered
knowledge is still a challenge in most Life Science domains (e.g.,
biomedicine). In this paper we present our contribution to the community in the
form of an infrastructure to annotate information resources, to discover
relationships among them, and to represent and visualize the new discovered
knowledge. Furthermore, we have also implemented a Web-based prototype tool
which integrates the proposed infrastructure.
