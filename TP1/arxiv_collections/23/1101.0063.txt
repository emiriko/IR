We suggest a new approach to the detection of gravitational waves using
observations of a group of millisecond pulsars. In contrast to the usual
method, based on increasing the accuracy of the arrival times of pulses by
excluding possible distorting factors, our method supposes that the additive
phase noise that is inevitably present even in the most accurate observational
data has various spectral components, which have characteristic amplitudes and
begin to appear on different time scales. We use the "Caterpillar" (Singular
Spectral Analysis, SSA) method to decompose the signal into its components. Our
initial data are the residuals of the pulse arrival times for six millisecond
pulsars. We constructed the angular correlation function for components of the
decomposition of a given number, whose theoretical form for the case of an
isotropic and homogeneous gravitational-wave background is known. The
individual decomposition components show a statistically significant agreement
with the theoretical expectations (correlation coefficient $\rho=0.92\pm
0.10$).
