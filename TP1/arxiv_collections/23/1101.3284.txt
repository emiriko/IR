The origin of the high-energy emission of blazars is still a matter of
debate. To investigate the emission mechanism of extragalactic outflows and to
pin down the location of the emission, we have constructed a broadband spectral
energy distribution (SED) database covering from the radio to the gamma-ray
band for the complete MOJAVE sample, which consists of 135 relativistically
beamed AGN with well-studied parsec-scale jets. Typically, the broadband SEDs
of blazars shows a double-humped profile. It is believed that the lower-energy
hump is due to synchrotron emission from the radio jet, and the higher-energy
hump is generated by i) inverse-Compton upscattered seed photons (leptonic),
ii) proton-induced shower (hadronic). Combining the results of high-resolution
VLBI observations and the gamma-ray properties of the MOJAVE sources, we
attempt to reveal the origin of the high-energy emission in relativistic jets,
and search for correlations between VLBI and high-energy properties.
