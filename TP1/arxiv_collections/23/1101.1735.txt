This Letter reports a demonstration of off-axis compressed holography in
low-light level imaging conditions. An acquisition protocol relying on a single
exposure of a randomly undersampled diffraction map of the optical field,
recorded in the high heterodyne gain regime, is proposed. The image acquisition
scheme is based on compressed sensing, a theory establishing that near-exact
recovery of an unknown sparse signal is possible from a small number of
nonstructured measurements. Image reconstruction is further enhanced by
introducing an off-axis spatial support constraint to the image estimation
algorithm. We report accurate experimental recovering of holographic images of
a resolution target in low-light conditions with a frame exposure of 5 \mu s,
scaling down measurements to 9% of random pixels within the array detector.
