Diffractive rho meson production has been identified as one of the important
processes where saturation can be probed at a future Electron-Ion Collider
(EIC). A source of uncertainty in making predictions for this process lies
within the assumed form of the meson light-cone wavefunction. We report here
the results of reference [1] where a Regge-inspired dipole model was used to
extract this wavefunction as well as the corresponding leading twist-2
Distribution Amplitude from the current accurate HERA data. In addition, we
shall check the robustness of the conclusions in reference [1] by using
alternative Colour Glass Condensate dipole models.
