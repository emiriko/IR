The gravitational wave signal from an inspiralling binary neutron star system
will contain detailed information about tidal coupling in the system, and thus,
about the internal physics of the neutron stars. To extract this information
will require highly accurate models for the gravitational waveform. We present
here a calculation of the gravitational wave signal from a binary with
quadrupolar tidal interactions which includes all post-1-Newtonian-order
effects in both the conservative dynamics and wave generation. We consider
stars with adiabatically induced quadrupoles moving in circular orbits, and
work to linear in the stars' quadrupole moments. We find that post-1-Newtonian
corrections increase the tidal signal by approximately 20% at gravitational
wave frequencies of 400 Hz.
