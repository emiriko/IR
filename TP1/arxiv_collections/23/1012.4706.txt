Quantum entanglement plays crucial roles in quantum information processing.
Quantum entangled states have become the key ingredient in the rapidly
expanding field of quantum information science. Although the nonclassical
nature of entanglement has been recognized for many years, considerable efforts
have been taken to understand and characterize its properties recently. In this
review, we introduce some recent results in the theory of quantum entanglement.
In particular separability criteria based on the Bloch representation,
covariance matrix, normal form and entanglement witness; lower bounds,
subadditivity property of concurrence and tangle; fully entangled fraction
related to the optimal fidelity of quantum teleportation and entanglement
distillation will be discussed in detail.
