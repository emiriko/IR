The cataclysmic variable SDSS154453+2553 was recently identified in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. We obtained spectra and photometry at the MDM Observatory,
which revealed an eclipse with a 6.03 hour period. The H{\alpha} emission line
exhibits a strong rotational disturbance during eclipse, indicating that it
arises in an accretion disk. A contribution from an M-type companion is also
observed. Time-series photometry during eclipse gives an ephemeris of
2454878.0062(15) + 0.251282(2)E. We present spectroscopy through the orbit and
eclipse photometry. Our analysis of the secondary star indicates a distance of
800 {\pm} 180 pc.
