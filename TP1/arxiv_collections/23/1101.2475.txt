We show that two-photon coherent control in a $V$-shape three-level system
projects one-photon coherent transient in a simple two-level system. Higher
order chirps of a shaped laser pulse play the roles of time and linear chirp in
conventional coherent transients. In a devised scheme of a three-pulse coherent
excitation experiment, the phase and amplitude of controlled transition
probability is retrieved from a 2D Fourier-transform spectral peak.
