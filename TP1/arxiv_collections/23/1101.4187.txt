The Void Galaxy Survey (VGS) is a multi-wavelength program to study $\sim$60
void galaxies. Each has been selected from the deepest interior regions of
identified voids in the SDSS redshift survey on the basis of a unique geometric
technique, with no a prior selection of intrinsic properties of the void
galaxies. The project intends to study in detail the gas content, star
formation history and stellar content, as well as kinematics and dynamics of
void galaxies and their companions in a broad sample of void environments. It
involves the HI imaging of the gas distribution in each of the VGS galaxies.
Amongst its most tantalizing findings is the possible evidence for cold gas
accretion in some of the most interesting objects, amongst which are a polar
ring galaxy and a filamentary configuration of void galaxies. Here we shortly
describe the scope of the VGS and the results of the full analysis of the pilot
sample of 15 void galaxies.
