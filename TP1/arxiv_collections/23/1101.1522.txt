We construct the magnetic dual of QCD with one adjoint Weyl fermion. The dual
is a consistent solution of the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions, allows
for flavor decoupling and remarkably constitutes the first nonsupersymmetric
dual valid for any number of colors. The dual allows to bound the anomalous
dimension of the Dirac fermion mass operator to be less than one in the
conformal window.
