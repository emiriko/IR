We present J-band long-slit spectroscopic observation of NGC 1068 classified
as a Seyfert 2 galaxy. J-band observations with OAO/ISLE provide clear
detection of spatially extended [Fe II]1.257um and [P II]1.188um lines. We
found that [Fe II]1.257um/[P II]1.188um increases with distance from a central
continuum peak. Observed line ratios around the nucleus (continuum peak) are
consistent with a typical value expected from photoionization models, while the
ratios at 3" - 4" (210-280 pc) east and west of the nucleus are slightly higher
than this. In the off nucleus region of NGC 1068 we also found a possible
association between [Fe II]1.257um/[P II]1.188um and the radio continuum. This
suggests a mild contribution of shock ionization induced by a radio jet outside
nucleus while photoionization by the central energy source is dominant near the
nucleus.
