Applications based on Single Walled Carbon Nanotube (SWNT) are good example
of the great need to continuously develop metrology methods in the field of
nanotechnology. Contact and interface properties are key parameters that
determine the efficiency of SWNT functionalized nanomaterials and nanodevices.
In this work we have taken advantage of a good control of the SWNT growth
processes at an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip apex and the use of a low
noise (1E-13 m/rtHz) AFM to investigate the mechanical behavior of a SWNT
touching a surface. By simultaneously recording static and dynamic properties
of SWNT, we show that the contact corresponds to a peeling geometry, and
extract quantities such as adhesion energy per unit length, curvature and
bending rigidity of the nanotube. A complete picture of the local shape of the
SWNT and its mechanical behavior is provided.
