The paper analyzes the radiative thermal transfer in a liquid helium cryostat
with liquid nitrogen shielding. A infinite plane walls model is used for
demonstrating a method for lowering the radiative heat transfer and the
numerical results for two such systems are presented. Some advantages
concerning the opportunity of using semi-transparent walls are analytically and
numerically demonstrated.
