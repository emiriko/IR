The development of molecular nanostructures plays a major role in emerging
organic electronic applications, as it leads to improved performance and is
compatible with our increasing need for miniaturisation. In particular,
nanowires have been obtained from solution or vapour phase and have displayed
high conductivity, or large interfacial areas in solar cells. In all cases
however, the crystal structure remains as in films or bulk, and the
exploitation of wires requires extensive post-growth manipulation as their
orientations are random. Here we report copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) nanowires
with diameters of 10-100 nm, high directionality and unprecedented aspect
ratios. We demonstrate that they adopt a new crystal phase, designated
eta-CuPc, where the molecules stack along the long axis. The resulting high
electronic overlap along the centimetre length stacks achieved in our wires
mediates antiferromagnetic couplings and broadens the optical absorption
spectrum. The ability to fabricate ultralong, flexible metal phthalocyanine
nanowires opens new possibilities for applications of these simple molecules.
