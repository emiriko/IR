We study the photon generation in a transmission line oscillator coupled to a
driven qubit in the presence of a dissipative electromagnetic environment. It
has been demonstrated previously that a population inversion in the qubit may
lead to a lasing state of the oscillator. Here we show that the circuit can
also exhibit the effect of "lasing without inversion". This is possible since
the coupling to the dissipative environment enhances photon emission as
compared to absorption, similar to the recoil effect which was predicted for
atomic systems. While the recoil effect is very weak, and so far elusive, the
effect described here should be observable with present circuits. We analyze
the requirements for the system parameters and environment.
