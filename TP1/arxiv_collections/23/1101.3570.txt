To study the processes and mechanisms of the correlation between space and
time, particularly between lengths and durations in human perception, a special
method (device and procedure) to conduct this experiment was designed and
called LDR (Length Duration Relation) In the present study a pilot and three
series of the primary experiment were conducted under conditions of different
levels of uncertainty. In all types of experiments, signals of a certain
duration and modality were presented twice in random order to the subjects.
Subjects had to respond to time signals of different durations by choosing a
corresponding space interval. The data which were obtained during the 1st and
the 2nd time signal presentations were examined separately. The comparative
data analysis of the experiment showed significant differences between the 1st
and 2nd presentation of signals in the quantity of correct responses, the
responses distribution along the scale of stimuli, the phenomena which occurred
during the experiment. The higher level of uncertainty condition under which a
certain type of the experiment was conducted, the more clearly this difference
was manifested.
  Based on results of the experiments comparative data analysis, one can
suppose that the perceptive mechanism, named by us as an innate mechanism of
proportionality, performed the correlation of these intervals into two stages:
adaptation and activation
