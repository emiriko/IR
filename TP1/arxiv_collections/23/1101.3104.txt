We generalize the topological response theory of three-dimensional
topological insulators (TI) to metallic systems-specifically, doped TI with
finite bulk carrier density and a time-reversal symmetry breaking field near
the surface. We show that there is an inhomogeneity-induced Berry phase
contribution to the surface Hall conductivity that is completely determined by
the occupied states and is independent of other details such as band dispersion
and impurities. In the limit of zero bulk carrier density, this intrinsic
surface Hall conductivity reduces to the half-integer quantized surface Hall
conductivity of TI. Based on our theory we predict the behavior of the surface
Hall conductivity for a doped topological insulator with a top gate, which can
be directly compared with experiments.
