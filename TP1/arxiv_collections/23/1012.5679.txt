Context. TW Draconis is one of the best studied Algol-type eclipsing
binaries. There is significant evidence for miscellaneous physical processes
between interacting binary components manifesting themselves by period and
light curve changes. Aims. Obtaining new set of photometric and spectroscopic
observations, we analysed them together with the older spectroscopic and
photometric data to build model of this eclipsing system with respect to
observed changes of O-C diagram and light curve. Methods. Reduction of new
spectra was carried out in the IRAF and SPEFO programs. Radial velocities were
determined manually using SPEFO, by CCF using the Zverko's code and from the
program KOREL. Orbital elements were derived with the FOTEL program and via
disentangling with KOREL. The final combined solution was obtained with the
programs PHOEBE and FOTEL. Results. Photometry shows small irregularities in
light curves as a results of pulsating of one component and spot activity.
Using net of KOREL outputs we found the mass ratio q=0.405(3).We confirm the
presence of stellar matter around the primary. Even after subtraction of ADS
9706B influence, light curve solutions show third light in the system. Models
in FOTEL and Phoebe are presented. Conclusions. TW Dra is an astrophysically
very interesting eclipsing binary. Future combination of interferometry,
spectroscopy, and photometry is promising. It could definitely confirm the
hypothesis of quadruple system for TW Dra and explain behaviour of this system
in complex.
