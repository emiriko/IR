Parameters of a dense 10^13-10^14cm^-3) multicomponent gas-metal plasma in
the pulsed reflex discharge with a moderate power (W \leq 10 MW) have been
studied. The dynamics of the plasma density in time, the mass-element
composition of the plasma generated, the radial distribution of the electron
density in plasma, the rotation velocity and the rotation frequency of a plasma
layer with n_p \geq n_crit, the radial electric field strength, and the
recombination factor at the stage of plasma density decay in the discharge have
been determined. The plasma particle separation factor has been evaluated.
