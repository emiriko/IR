We study cubic ferroelectrics films that become uniaxial with a polar axis
perpendicular to the film because of a misfit strain due to a substrate. The
main present result is the analytical account for the elastic anisotropy as
well as the anisotropy of the electrostriction. They define, in particular, an
orientation of the domain boundaries and stabilizing or destabilizing effect of
inhomogeneous elastic strains on the single domain state. We apply the general
results to perovskite systems like BaTiO3/SrRuO3/SrTiO3 films and find that at
least not far from the ferroelectric phase transition the equilibrium domain
structure consists of the stripes along the cubic axes or at 45 degrees to
them. We have also showed that in this system the inhomogeneous strains
increase stability with regards to the small fluctuations of the metastable
single domain state, which may exist not very close to the ferroelectric
transition. The latter analytical result is in qualitative agreement with the
numerical result by Pertsev and Kohlstedt [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 257603 (2007)],
but we show that the effect is much smaller than those authors claim. We have
found also that under certain conditions on the material constants, which are
not satisfied in the perovskites but are not forbidden either, a checkerboard
domain structure can be realized instead of the stripe-like one and that the
polarization-strain coupling decreases stability of a single domain state
instead of increasing it. The single domain state is metastable at certain
large thicknesses and becomes suitable for memory applications at even larger
thicknesses when the lifetime of the metastable state becomes sufficiently
large.
