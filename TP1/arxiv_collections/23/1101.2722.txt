We study the thermodynamics and the thermodynamic geometries of charged
rotating BTZ (CR-BTZ) black holes in (2+1)-gravity. We investigate the
thermodynamics of these systems within the context of the Weinhold and
Ruppeiner thermodynamic geometries and the recently developed formalism of
geometrothermodynamics (GTD). Considering the behavior of the heat capacity and
the Hawking temperature, we show that Weinhold and Ruppeiner geometries cannot
describe completely the thermodynamics of these black holes and of their
limiting case of vanishing electric charge. In contrast, the Legendre
invariance imposed on the metric in GTD allows one to describe the CR-BTZ black
holes and their limiting cases in a consistent and invariant manner.
