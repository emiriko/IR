We study the focusing of light through random photonic materials using
wavefront shaping. We explore a novel approach namely binary amplitude
modulation. To this end, the light incident to a random photonic medium is
spatially divided into a number of segments. We identify the segments that give
rise to fields that are out of phase with the total field at the intended focus
and assign these a zero amplitude, whereas the remaining segments maintain
their original amplitude. Using 812 independently controlled segments of light,
we find the intensity at the target to be 75 +/- 6 times enhanced over the
average intensity behind the sample. We experimentally demonstrate focusing of
light through random photonic media using both an amplitude only mode liquid
crystal spatial light modulator and a MEMS-based spatial light modulator. Our
use of Micro Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS)-based digital micromirror devices
for the control of the incident light field opens an avenue to high speed
implementations of wavefront shaping.
