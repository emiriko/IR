We searched for radio pulsars in 25 of the non-variable, unassociated sources
in the Fermi LAT Bright Source List with the Green Bank Telescope at 820 MHz.
We report the discovery of three radio and gamma-ray millisecond pulsars (MSPs)
from a high Galactic latitude subset of these sources. All of the pulsars are
in binary systems, which would have made them virtually impossible to detect in
blind gamma-ray pulsation searches. They seem to be relatively normal, nearby
(<=2 kpc) millisecond pulsars. These observations, in combination with the
Fermi detection of gamma-rays from other known radio MSPs, imply that most, if
not all, radio MSPs are efficient gamma-ray producers. The gamma-ray spectra of
the pulsars are power-law in nature with exponential cutoffs at a few GeV, as
has been found with most other pulsars. The MSPs have all been detected as
X-ray point sources. Their soft X-ray luminosities of ~10^{30-31} erg/s are
typical of the rare radio MSPs seen in X-rays.
