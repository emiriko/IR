The properties of nearby galaxies that can be observed in great detail
suggest that a better theory rather than cold dark matter (CDM) would describe
in a better way a mechanism by which matter is more rapidly gathered into
large-scale structure such as galaxies and groups of galaxies. In this work we
develop and simulate a hydrodynamical approach for the early formation of
structure in the Universe, this approach is based on the fact that dark matter
is on the form of some kind of scalar field (SF) with a potential that goes as
$\mu^2\Phi^2/2+\lambda\Phi^4/4$, we expect that the fluctuations coming from
the SF will give us some information about the matter distribution we observe
these days.
