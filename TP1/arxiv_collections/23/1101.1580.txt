We present the results of a high resolution study with the Submillimeter
Array towards the massive star forming complex G9.62+0.19. Three sub-mm cores
are detected in this region. The masses are 13, 30 and 165 M$_{\sun}$ for the
northern, middle and southern dust cores, respectively. Infall motions are
found with HCN (4-3) and CS (7-6) lines at the middle core (G9.62+0.19 E). The
infall rate is $4.3\times10^{-3}~M_{\odot}\cdot$yr$^{-1}$. In the southern
core, a bipolar-outflow with a total mass about 26 M$_{\sun}$ and a mass-loss
rate of $3.6\times10^{-5}~M_{\odot}\cdot$yr$^{-1}$ is revealed in SO
($8_{7}-7_{7}$) line wing emission. CS (7-6) and HCN (4-3) lines trace higher
velocity gas than SO ($8_{7}-7_{7}$). G9.62+0.19 F is confirmed to be the
driving source of the outflow. We also analyze the abundances of CS, SO and HCN
along the redshifted outflow lobes. The mass-velocity diagrams of the outflow
lobes can be well fitted by a single power law. The evolutionary sequence of
the cm/mm cores in this region are also analyzed. The results support that
UC~H{\sc ii} regions have a higher blue excess than their precursors.
