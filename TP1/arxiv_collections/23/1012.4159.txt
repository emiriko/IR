We propose an experimental scheme for studying the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU)
phenomenon in a quantum mechanical regime using ultracold atoms. Specifically,
we suggest and analyze a setup of one-dimensional Bose gases confined into an
optical lattice. The strength of quantum fluctuations is controlled by tuning
the number of atoms per lattice sites (filling factor). By simulating the
real-time dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model by means of the exact numerical
method of time-evolving block decimation, we investigate the effects of quantum
fluctuations on the FPU recurrence and show that strong quantum fluctuations
cause significant damping of the FPU oscillation.
