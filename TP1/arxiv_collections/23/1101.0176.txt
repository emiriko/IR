Plasma experiments in laboratory settings offer unique opportunities to
address fundamental aspects of the solar dynamo and magnetism in the solar
atmosphere. We argue here that ground-based laboratory experiments have direct
connections to NASA based missions and NSF programs, and that a small
investment in laboratory heliophysics may have a high payoff. We advocate for
broad involvement in community-scale plasma experiments.
