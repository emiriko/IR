Non-adiabatic interaction ramps are considered for trapped Bose-Einstein
condensates. The deviation from adiabaticity is characterized through the
heating or residual energy produced during the ramp. We find that the
dependence of the heat on the ramp time is very sensitive to the ramp protocol.
We explain features of this dependence through a single-parameter effective
description based on the dynamics of the condensate size.
