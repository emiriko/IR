In order to illustrate the emergence of Coulomb blockade from coherent
quantum phase-slip processes in thin superconducting wires, we propose and
theoretically investigate two elementary setups, or "devices". The setups are
derived from Cooper-pair box and Cooper-pair transistor, so we refer to them as
QPS-box and QPS-transistor, respectively. We demonstrate that the devices
exhibit sensitivity to a charge induced by a gate electrode, this being the
main signature of Coulomb blockade. Experimental realization of these devices
will unambiguously prove the Coulomb blockade as an effect of coherence of
phase-slip processes. We analyze the emergence of discrete charging in the
limit strong phase-slips. We have found and investigated six distinct regimes
that are realized depending on the relation between three characteristic energy
scales: inductive and charging energy, and phase-slip amplitude. For
completeness, we include a brief discussion of dual Josephson-junction devices.
