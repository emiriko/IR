Quantum mechanics is a special kind of description of motion. The concept of
wave function itself implies the openness of quantum system. We show that
quantum mechanics describes the quantum correlation, i.e., entanglement, and
information in a new kind of space, tangnet T^2, where exist the basic quantum
structure of qubit and the universal out-in symmetry. This work tries to form a
new view to the fundamental problems of the foundation of quantum mechanics.
