We present the program Boundary, whose source files are available at
http://people.sissa.it/~maggiolo/boundary/. Given two natural numbers g and n
satisfying 2g+n-2>0, the program generates all genus g stable graphs with n
unordered marked points. Each such graph determines the topological type of a
nodal stable curve of arithmetic genus g with n unordered marked points. Our
motivation comes from the fact that the boundary of the moduli space of stable
genus g, n-pointed curves can be stratified by taking loci of curves of a fixed
topological type.
