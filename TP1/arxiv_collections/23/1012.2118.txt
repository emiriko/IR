We propose a new way to implement an inflationary prior to a cosmological
dataset that incorporates the inflationary observables at arbitrary order. This
approach employs an exponential form for the Hubble parameter $H(\phi)$ without
taking the slow-roll approximation. At lowest non-trivial order, this $H(\phi)$
has the unique property that it is the solution to the brachistochrone problem
for inflation.
