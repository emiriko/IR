While building up a catalog of Earth orbiting objects, if the available
optical observations are sparse, not deliberate follow ups of specific objects,
no orbit determination is possible without previous correlation of observations
obtained at different times. This correlation step is the most computationally
intensive, and becomes more and more difficult as the number of objects to be
discovered increases. In this paper we tested two different algorithms (and the
related prototype software) recently developed to solve the correlation problem
for objects in geostationary orbit (GEO), including the accurate orbit
determination by full least squares solutions with all six orbital elements.
Because of the presence in the GEO region of a significant subpopulation of
high area to mass objects, strongly affected by non-gravitational
perturbations, it was actually necessary to solve also for dynamical parameters
describing these effects, that is to fit between 6 and 8 free parameters for
each orbit. The validation was based upon a set of real data, acquired from the
ESA Space Debris Telescope (ESASDT) at the Teide observatory (Canary Islands).
We proved that it is possible to assemble a set of sparse observations into a
set of objects with orbits, starting from a sparse time distribution of
observations, which would be compatible with a survey capable of covering the
region of interest in the sky just once per night. This could result in a
significant reduction of the requirements for a future telescope network, with
respect to what would have been required with the previously known algorithm
for correlation and orbit determination.
