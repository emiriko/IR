We compare the efficiencies of two optical cooling schemes, where a single
particle is either inside or outside an optical cavity, under
experimentally-realisable conditions. We evaluate the cooling forces using the
general solution of a transfer matrix method for a moving scatterer inside a
general one-dimensional system composed of immobile optical elements. Assuming
the same atomic saturation parameter, we find that the two cooling schemes
provide cooling forces and equilibrium temperatures of comparable magnitude.
