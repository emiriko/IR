Mixed finite element methods solve a PDE using two or more variables. The
theory of Discrete Exterior Calculus explains why the degrees of freedom
associated to the different variables should be stored on both primal and dual
domain meshes with a discrete Hodge star used to transfer information between
the meshes. We show through analysis and examples that the choice of discrete
Hodge star is essential to the numerical stability of the method. Additionally,
we define interpolation functions and discrete Hodge stars on dual meshes which
can be used to create previously unconsidered mixed methods. Examples from
magnetostatics and Darcy flow are examined in detail.
