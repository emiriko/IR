We show that the linear group of automorphism of Hermitian matrices which
preserves the set of separable states is generated by \emph{natural}
automorphisms: change of an orthonormal basis in each tensor factor, partial
transpose in each tensor factor, and interchanging two tensor factors of the
same dimension. We apply our results to preservers of the product numerical
range.
