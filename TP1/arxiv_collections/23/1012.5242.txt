We discuss phases of hot and dense hadronic matter using chiral Lagrangians.
A two-flavored parity doublet model constrained by the nuclear matter ground
state predicts chiral symmetry restoration. The model thermodynamics is shown
within the mean field approximation. A field-theoretical constraint on possible
phases from the anomaly matching is also discussed.
