Incentives play an important role in (security and IT) risk management of a
large-scale organization with multiple autonomous divisions. This paper
presents an incentive mechanism design framework for risk management based on a
game-theoretic approach. The risk manager acts as a mechanism designer
providing rules and incentive factors such as assistance or subsidies to
divisions or units, which are modeled as selfish players of a strategic
(noncooperative) game. Based on this model, incentive mechanisms with various
objectives are developed that satisfy efficiency, preference-compatibility, and
strategy-proofness criteria. In addition, iterative and distributed algorithms
are presented, which can be implemented under information limitations such as
the risk manager not knowing the individual units' preferences. An example
scenario illustrates the framework and results numerically. The incentive
mechanism design approach presented is useful for not only deriving guidelines
but also developing computer-assistance systems for large-scale risk
management.
