We present the phase diagram for the current states of superconducting films,
based on the experimental investigation of the resistive transition induced by
transport current. We found that a rather narrow film never enters the vortex
state, but experiences direct transition from the purely superconducting state
to the resistive state with phase-slip centers as soon as the current exceeds
the Ginzburg-Landau critical current Ic. The Meissner current state of the
films of intermediate width transforms at I > 0.8Ic to the vortex resistive
state which exists within the current interval 0.8Ic < I < Im, where the value
Im of the upper critical current is in a good agreement with the theory. The
vortex state of wide films is realized within the current region I^{AL} < I <
Im, where I^{AL} is the transition point to the vortex state by Aslamazov and
Lempitskiy. At I>Im, the wide films enter a vortex-free resistive state with
phase-slip lines.
