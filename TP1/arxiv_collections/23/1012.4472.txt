We study the stability of superpositions of macroscopically distinct quantum
states under decoherence. We introduce a class of quantum states with
entanglement features similar to Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, but
with an inherent stability against noise and decoherence. We show that in
contrast to GHZ states, these so-called concatenated GHZ states remain
multipartite entangled even for macroscopic numbers of particles and can be
used for quantum metrology in noisy environments. We also propose a scalable
experimental realization of these states using existing ion-trap set-ups.
