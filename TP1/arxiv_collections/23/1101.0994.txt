The nonocomposites on the base of long (5-10 $\mu$m, ${o}$-MWCNTs) and short
(2 $\mu$m, ${m}$-MWCNTs) multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) hosted by
nematic 5CB were investigated in details by means of polarizing microscopy,
studies of electrical conductivity and electro-optical behaviour. The
spontaneous self-organization of MWCNTs was observed and investigated both
theoretically and experimentally. The simple Smoluchowski approach was used for
estimation of the half-time of aggregation. It was shown that aggregation
process includes two different stages: fast, resulting in formation of loose
aggregates (${L}$-aggregates) and slow, resulting in formation of compacted
aggregates (${C}$-aggregates). Both ${L}$- and ${C}$- aggregates possess
extremely ramified fractal borders. Formation of the percolation structures was
observed for ${o}$-MWCNTs at $C=C_p\approx$ 0.0025-0.05 % wt and for $m$-MWCNTs
at $C=C_p\approx$ 0.005-0.25 % wt. A physical model describing formation of
$C$-aggregates with captured 5CB molecules inside was proposed. It shows good
agreement with experimentally measured characteristics. It was shown that
MWCNTs strongly affect the structural organization of LC molecules captured
inside the MWCNT skeleton and of interfacial LC layers in the vicinity of
aggregate borders. Moreover, the structure of the interfacial layer, as well as
its birefringence, drastically changed when the applied electric voltage
exceeded the Freedericksz threshold. Finally, formation of the inversion walls
between branches of the neighbouring MWCNT aggregates was observed and
discussed for the first time.
