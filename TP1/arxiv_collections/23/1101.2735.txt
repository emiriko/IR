The paper provides a theoretical analysis for elastic unpolarized neutron
scattering by systems having a non-coplanar magnetic induction spatial
distribution. It is shown that reciprocity does not hold for neutron scattered
by these systems. The scattering of unpolarized neutrons by a system of three
magnetic mirrors and by a ferromagnetic particle in a "vortex" state is also
explored.
