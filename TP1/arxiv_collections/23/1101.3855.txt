Photon-added coherent states have been realized in optical parametric
down-conversion by Zavatta {\em et al} [Science 306 (2004) 660-662]. In this
report, it is established that the states generated in the process are {\em
ideal} photon-added coherent states. It is shown that the scheme can generate
higher order photon-added coherent states. A comparative study of the
down-conversion process and atom-cavity interaction in generating the
photon-added coherent states is presented.
