We propose a new fast scalable method for achieving a two-qubit entangling
gate between arbitrary distant qubits in a network by exploiting dispersionless
propagation in uniform chains. This is achieved dynamically by switching on a
strong interaction between the qubits and a bus formed by a non-engineered
chain of interacting qubits. The quality of the gate scales very efficiently
with qubit separations. Surprisingly, a sudden switching of the coupling is not
necessary and our gate mechanism is not altered by a possibly gradual
switching. The bus is also naturally reset to its initial state making the
complex resetting procedure unnecessary after each application of the gate.
Moreover, we propose a possible experimental realization in cold atoms trapped
in optical lattices and near field Fresnel trapping potentials, which are both
accessible to current technology.
