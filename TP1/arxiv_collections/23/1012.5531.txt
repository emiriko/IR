We have considered the flat FRW model of the universe which is filled with
only dark energy. The general descriptions of first and second laws of
thermodynamics are investigated on the apparent horizon and event horizon of
the universe. We have assumed the equation of state of three different types of
dark energy models. We have examined the validity of first and second laws of
thermodynamics on apparent and event horizons for these dark energies. For
these dark energy models, it has been found that on the apparent horizon, first
and second laws are always valid. On the event horizon, the laws are break down
for dark energy models 1 and 2. For model 3, first law cannot be satisfied on
the event horizon, but second law may be satisfied at the late stage of the
evolution of the universe and so the validity of second law on the event
horizon depends on the values of the parameters only.
