The results of experimental investigations of the critical currents and
certain nonequilibrium phenomena in thin Sn films of different width w are
analyzed. Usually, thin superconducting films are divided into two groups:
narrow channels w<lambda and wide films w>lambda. A wide transitional region
where the condition w>lambda holds with a large margin and at the same time
cannot be explained from the standpoint of the theory of the appearance of a
vortex state has been found. This shows that the generally accepted criterion w
\sim lambda for dividing films into wide and narrow does not work. The
transition into a wide-film regime, described by the existing theory of the
vortex state, is fully completed only for w/lambda(T) > 10-20.
