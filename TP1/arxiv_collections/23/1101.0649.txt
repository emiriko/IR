We calculate loop-induced Higgs production and decay processes which are
relevant for the LHC in various six-dimensional Universal Extra Dimension
models. More concretely, we focus on Higgs production through gluon fusion and
Higgs decay into two photons induced by loop diagrams. They are one-loop
leading processes and the contribution of Kaluza-Klein particles is considered
to be significant. These processes are divergent in six dimensions. Therefore,
we employ a momentum cutoff, whose size is fixed from the validity of
perturbative calculation through naive dimensional analysis. In these
six-dimensional Universal Extra Dimension models, the Higgs production cross
section through gluon fusion strongly increases considerably and the Higgs
decay width into two photons decrease somehow. In particular in the case of the
compactification on Projective Sphere, these effects are remarkable. The
deviation of the $h^{(0)} \rightarrow 2 \gamma$ signal from the prediction of
the Standard model is much larger than that in the case of the five-dimensional
minimal UED model. We also consider threshold corrections in the two processes
and these effect are noteworthy when we choose low cutoff scale in 6D UED.
Comparing our calculation to the latest LHC results which were published at the
Lepton-Photon 2011 is performed briefly.
