We study the ground state phases of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg quantum
antiferromagnet on the spatially anisotropic triangular lattice and on the
square lattice with up to next-next-nearest neighbor coupling (the $J_1J_2J_3$
model), making use of Takahashi's modified spin-wave (MSW) theory supplemented
by ordering vector optimization. We compare the MSW results with exact
diagonalization and projected-entangled-pair-states calculations, demonstrating
their qualitative and quantitative reliability. We find that MSW theory
correctly accounts for strong quantum effects on the ordering vector of the
magnetic phases of the models under investigation: in particular collinear
magnetic order is promoted at the expenses of non-collinear (spiral) order, and
several spiral states which are stable at the classical level, disappear from
the quantum phase diagram. Moreover, collinear states and non-collinear ones
are never connected continuously, but they are separated by parameter regions
in which MSW breaks down, signaling the possible appearance of a non-magnetic
ground state. In the case of the spatially anisotropic triangular lattice, a
large breakdown region appears also for weak couplings between the chains
composing the lattice, suggesting the possible occurrence of a large
non-magnetic region continuously connected with the spin-liquid state of the
uncoupled chains.
