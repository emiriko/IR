The simplest little Higgs model predicts a light pseudoscalar boson $\eta$
and opens up some new decay modes for $Z$-boson, such as $Z \to \bar{f} f
\eta$, $Z\to \eta\eta\eta$, $Z\to \eta\gamma$ and $Z\to \eta gg$. We examine
these decay modes in the parameter space allowed by current experiments, and
find that the branching ratios can reach $10^{-7}$ for $Z\to \bar{b}b\eta$,
$10^{-8}$ for $Z\to \bar{\tau}\tau\eta$, and $10^{-8}$ for $Z\to \eta\gamma$,
which should be accessible at the GigaZ option of the ILC. However, the
branching ratios can reach $10^{-12}$ for $Z\to \eta\eta\eta$, and $10^{-11}$
for $Z\to \eta gg$, which are hardly accessible at the GigaZ option.
