Synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments have been carried out on Eu metal
at ambient temperature to pressures as high as 92 GPa (0.92 Mbar). Following
the well-known bcc-to-hcp transition at 12 GPa, a mixed phase region is
observed from 18 to 66 GPa until finally a single orthorhombic (Pnma) phase
persists from 66 to 92 GPa. These results are compared to predictions from
density functional theory calculations. Under pressure the relatively large
molar volume Vmol of divalent Eu is rapidly diminished, equaling or falling
below Vmol(P) for neighboring trivalent lanthanides above 15 GPa. The present
results suggest that above 15 GPa Eu is neither divalent nor fully trivalent to
pressures as high as 92 GPa.
