The number of known transiting exoplanets is rapidly increasing, which has
recently inspired significant interest as to whether they can host a detectable
moon. Although there has been no such example where the presence of a satellite
was proven, several methods have already been investigated for such a detection
in the future. All these methods utilize post-processing of the measured light
curves, and the presence of the moon is decided by the distribution of a timing
parameter. Here we propose a method for the detection of the moon directly in
the raw transit light curves. When the moon is in transit, it puts its own
fingerprint on the intensity variation. In realistic cases, this distortion is
too little to be detected in the individual light curves, and must be
amplified. Averaging the folded light curve of several transits helps decrease
the scatter, but it is not the best approach because it also reduces the
signal. The relative position of the moon varies from transit to transit, the
moon's wing will appear in different positions on different sides of the
planet's transit. Here we show that a careful analysis of the scatter curve of
the folded light curves enhances the chance of detecting the exomoons directly.
