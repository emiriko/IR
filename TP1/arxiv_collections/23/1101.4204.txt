We propose deterministic timed automata (DTA) as a model-independent language
for specifying performance and dependability measures over continuous-time
stochastic processes. Technically, these measures are defined as limit
frequencies of locations (control states) of a DTA that observes computations
of a given stochastic process. Then, we study the properties of DTA measures
over semi-Markov processes in greater detail. We show that DTA measures over
semi-Markov processes are well-defined with probability one, and there are only
finitely many values that can be assumed by these measures with positive
probability. We also give an algorithm which approximates these values and the
associated probabilities up to an arbitrarily small given precision. Thus, we
obtain a general and effective framework for analysing DTA measures over
semi-Markov processes.
