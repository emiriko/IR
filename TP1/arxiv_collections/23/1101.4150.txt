We present results from the final six months of a survey to search for
pulsations in white dwarfs and hot subdwarf stars with the Kepler spacecraft.
Spectroscopic observations are used to separate the objects into accurate
classes, and we explore the physical parameters of the subdwarf B (sdB) stars
and white dwarfs in the sample. From the Kepler photometry and our
spectroscopic data, we find that the sample contains 5 new pulsators of the
V1093 Her type, one AM CVn type cataclysmic variable, and a number of other
binary systems. This completes the survey for compact pulsators with Kepler. No
V361 Hya type of short-period pulsating sdB stars were found in this half,
leaving us with a total of one single multiperiodic V361 Hya and 13 V1093 Her
pulsators for the full survey. Except for the sdB pulsators, no other clearly
pulsating hot subdwarfs or white dwarfs were found, although a few
low-amplitude candidates still remain. The most interesting targets discovered
in this survey will be observed throughout the remainder of the Kepler Mission,
providing the most long-term photometric datasets ever made on such compact,
evolved stars. Asteroseismic investigations of these datasets will be
invaluable in revealing the interior structure of these stars, and will boost
our understanding of their evolutionary history.
