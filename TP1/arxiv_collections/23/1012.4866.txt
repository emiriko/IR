In this paper, the exact dynamics of open quantum systems in the presence of
initial system-reservoir correlations is investigated for a photonic cavity
system coupled to a general non-Markovian reservoir. The exact
time-convolutionless master equation incorporating with initial
system-reservoir correlations is obtained. The non-Markovian dynamics of the
reservoir and the effects of the initial correlations are embedded into the
time-dependent coefficients in the master equation. We show that the effects
induced by the initial correlations play an important role in the non-Markovian
dynamics of the cavity but they are washed out in the steady-state limit in the
Markovian regime. Moreover, the initial two-photon correlation between the
cavity and the reservoir can induce nontrivial squeezing dynamics to the cavity
field.
