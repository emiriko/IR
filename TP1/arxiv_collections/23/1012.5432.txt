Models for topological quantum computation are based on braiding and fusing
anyons (quasiparticles of fractional statistics) in (2+1)-D. The anyons that
can exist in a physical theory are determined by the symmetry group of the
Hamiltonian. In the case that the Hamiltonian undergoes spontaneous symmetry
breaking of the full symmetry group G to a finite residual gauge group H,
particles are given by representations of the quantum double $D(H)$ of the
subgroup. The quasi-triangular Hopf Algebra D(H) is obtained from Drinfeld's
quantum double construction applied to the algebra F(H) of functions on the
finite group H.
  A major new contribution of this work is a program written in MAGMA to
compute the particles (and their properties - including spin) that can exist in
a system with an arbitrary finite residual gauge group, in addition to the
braiding and fusion rules for those particles. We compute explicitly the fusion
rules for two non-abelian group doubles suggested for universal quantum
computation: $S_3$ and $A_5$, and discover some interesting results,
subsystems, and symmetries in the tables. SO(3)_4 (the restriction of
Chern-Simons theory $SU(2)_4$) and its mirror image are discovered as
3-particle subsystems in the 8-particle $S_3$ quantum double. The tables
demonstrate that both $S_3$ and $A_5$ anyons are all Majorana, but this is not
the case for all finite groups. In the appendices, the quantum doubles for the
remaining nonabelian subgroups of SO(3) - $S_4$, $A_4$, and $D_4$ (the second
in the infinite family $D_n$) - are tabulated and analyzed. In addition, the
probabilities of obtaining any given fusion product in quantum computation
applications are determined and programmed in MAGMA. Throughout, connections to
possible experiments are mentioned.
