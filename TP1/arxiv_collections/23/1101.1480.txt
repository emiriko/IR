We have performed numerical simulations to evaluate the effect on the
capacitance of finite size boundaries realistically present in the parallel
plane, sphere-plane, and cylinder-plane geometries. The potential impact of
edge effects in assessing the accuracy of the parameters obtained in the
electrostatic calibrations of Casimir force experiments is then discussed.
