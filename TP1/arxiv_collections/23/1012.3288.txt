We study a modified version of a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauged MSSM that was recently
shown to produce a new source of leptogenesis through the CP asymmetry of
sneutrinos and antisneutrinos (K.S. Babu, Y. Meng, Z. Tavartkiladze, Phys Lett
B681:37 (2009)). By taking all superpotential terms and couplings between the
MSSM Higgs and $B-L$ scalar sectors into account we find that the model allows
a large enough CP violation to explain the observed baryon number to entropy
ratio. Monte Carlo analysis shows that a large amount of CP violation can be
produced in the decays of the $B-L$ Higgs bosons and that there are two
dominating channels that drive CP violation.
