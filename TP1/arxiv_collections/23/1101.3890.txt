Meteorological data have been used to calculate refractive index fluctuations
- the indicator of optical instability of the Earth's atmosphere. The
calculations were made for standard pressure levels of the atmosphere in winter
and summer. They are presented as distributions over the Earth's surface. The
findings enabled us to determine preferred areas for astronomical observations
as well as to compare astroclimate conditions of the world's largest
observatories.
