In this work we show that the trigonal warping of the electronic bands in
bilayer graphene dramatically modifies the behavior of the one-dimensional
modes topologically confined due to an inhomogeneous bias that changes sign
across a channel. The topologically protected states are present but their
behavior is disrupted from the predicted in the isotropic approximation. We
present detailed studies of the electronic properties of the 1D channel in
function of the orientation of the channel.
