Observations of radio pulsars have revealed that they have large velocities
which may be greater than 1000 km/s. In this work, the efficacy of an
active-sterile neutrino transformation mechanism to provide these large pulsar
kicks is investigated. A phase-space based approach is adopted to follow the
the transformation of active neutrinos to sterile neutrinos through an MSW-like
resonance in the protoneutron star to refine an estimate to the magnitude of
the pulsar kick that can be generated in such an event. The result is that this
mechanism can create the large pulsar kicks that are observed while not
overcooling the star.
