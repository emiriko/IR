A simple microscopic model of a small superconducting loop interrupted by
Josephson junction (flux qubit) allows to compute from the experimental data of
Wal et.al \cite{Wal} an important parameter - the density of Cooper pairs at
zero temperature. This density is determined by the cut-off energy in the BCS
model and agrees with the original BCS suggestion but is lower by two orders of
magnitude than the value accepted in the modern literature. The immediate
consequences of this result are: the validity of the strong coupling BCS model,
a plausible picture of electrons recombination into Cooper pairs, and a much
weaker condition for the appearance of high-temperature superconductivity.
Another consequence is that the popular interpretation of Josephson qubits as
macroscopic quantum systems is replaced by a picture of qubit states being
superpositions of the ground state and the state containing only a single
excited Cooper pair.
