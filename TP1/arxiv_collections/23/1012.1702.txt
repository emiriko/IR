The quasi one-dimensional compound BaCu2Si2O7 demonstrates numerous
spin-reorientation transitions both for a magnetic field applied along the easy
axis of magnetization, and for a magnetic field applied perpendicular to it.
The magnetic phase diagram for all three principal orientations is obtained by
magnetization and specific heat measurements. Values of all critical fields and
low-temperature values of magnetization jumps are determined for all
transitions.
