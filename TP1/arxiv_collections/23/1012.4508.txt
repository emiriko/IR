Starting from an analogy between the Planck-Einstein scale and the dual
length scales in Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity, and assuming that
space-time is a condensate of neutral fermionic particles with Planck mass, we
derive the baryonic mass of the universe. In that theoretical framework
baryonic matter appears to be associated with the condensation energy gained by
spacetime in the transition from its normal (symetric) to its (less symetric)
superconducting-like phase. It is shown however that the critical transition
temperature cannot be the Planck temperature. Thus leaving open the enigma of
the microscopic description of spacetime at quantum level.
