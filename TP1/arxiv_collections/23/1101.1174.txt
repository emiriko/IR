In this contribution to PSAS'2010 we report on recent progress on an
experiment aimed at measuring small optical directional anisotropies by
frequency metrology in a high finesse ring cavity. We focus on our first
experimental goal, the measurement of magneto-electric effects in gases. After
a review of the expected effects in our set-up, we present the apparatus and
the measurement procedure, showing that we already have the necessary
sensitivity to start novel experiments.
