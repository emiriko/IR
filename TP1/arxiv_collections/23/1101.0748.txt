In this work we address the study of movement of charged particles in the
background of charged black holes with non-trivial asymptotic behavior. We
compute the exact trajectories for massive-charged particles in term of
elliptic Jacobi function. Finally we obtain a detailed description of orbits
for Reissner-Nordstr\"om (Anti)-de Sitter black holes in terms of charge, mass
and energy of the particles.
