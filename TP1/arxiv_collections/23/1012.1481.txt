We investigate the motion of a magnetized particle orbiting around a black
hole in braneworld placed in asymptotically uniform magnetic field. The
influence of brane parameter on effective potential of the radial motion of
magnetized spinning particle around the braneworld black hole using
Hamilton-Jacobi formalism is studied. It is found that circular orbits for
photons and slowly moving particles may become stable near $r = 3M$. It was
argued that the radii of the innermost stable circular orbits are sensitive on
the change of brane parameter. Similar discussion without Weil parameter has
been considered by de Felice et all in Ref. \refcite{rs99,98}.
