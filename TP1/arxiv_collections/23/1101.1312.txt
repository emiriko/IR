The variational method is very important in mathematical and theoretical
physics because it allows us to describe the natural systems by physical
quantities independently from the frame of reference used. A global and
statistical approach have been introduced starting from non-equilibrium
thermodynamics, obtaining the principle of maximum entropy generation for the
open systems. This principle is a consequence of the lagrangian approach to the
open systems. Here it will be developed a general approach to obtain the
thermodynamic hamiltonian for the dynamical study of the open systems. It
follows that the irreversibility seems to be the fundamental phenomenon which
drives the evolution of the states of the open systems.
