We present a novel computational scheme to predict chemical compositions at
interfaces as they emerge in a growth process. The scheme uses the Gibbs free
energy of reaction associated with the formation of interfaces with a specific
composition as predictor for their prevalence. It explicitly accounts for the
growth conditions by rate-equation modeling of the deposition environment. The
Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle motivates our emphasis on an effective
nonequilibrium thermodynamic description inspired by chemical reaction theory.
We illustrate the scheme by characterizing the interface between TiC and
alumina. Equilibrium thermodynamics favors a nonbinding interface, being in
conflict with the wear-resistant nature of TiC/alumina multilayer coatings. Our
novel scheme predicts that deposition of a strongly adhering interface is
favored under realistic conditions.
