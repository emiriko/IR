Relativistic mean field (RMF) theory is applied to investigate the properties
of the radioactive neutron-rich doubly magic nucleus $^{132}$Sn and the
corresponding isotopes and isotones. The two-neutron and two-proton separation
energies are well reproduced by the RMF theory. In particular, the RMF results
agree with the experimental single-particle spectrum in $^{132}$Sn as well as
the Nilsson spin-orbit parameter $C$ and orbit-orbit parameter $D$ thus
extracted, but remarkably differ from the traditional Nilsson parameters.
Furthermore, the present results provide a guideline for the isospin dependence
of the Nilsson parameters.
