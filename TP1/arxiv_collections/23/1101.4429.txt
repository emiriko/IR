We propose a semantically grounded theory of session types which relies on
intersection and union types. We argue that intersection and union types are
natural candidates for modeling branching points in session types and we show
that the resulting theory overcomes some important defects of related
behavioral theories. In particular, intersections and unions provide a native
solution to the problem of computing joins and meets of session types. Also,
the subtyping relation turns out to be a pre-congruence, while this is not
always the case in related behavioral theories.
