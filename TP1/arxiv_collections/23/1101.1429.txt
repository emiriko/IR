Quantum optimal control theory is a powerful tool for engineering quantum
systems subject to external fields such as the ones created by intense lasers.
The formulation relies on a suitable definition for a target functional, that
translates the intended physical objective to a mathematical form. We propose
the use of target functionals defined in terms of the one-particle density and
its current. A strong motivation for this is the possibility of using
time-dependent density-functional theory for the description of the system
dynamics. We exemplify this idea by defining an objective functional that on
one hand attempts a large overlap with a target density and on the other hand
minimizes the current. The latter requirement leads to optimized states with
increased stability, which we prove with a few examples of one- and
two-dimensional one-electron systems.
