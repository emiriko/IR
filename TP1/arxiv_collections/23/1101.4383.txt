Novel materials are in great demand for future applications. The discovery of
graphene, a one atom thick carbon layer, holds the promise for unique device
architectures and functionalities exploiting unprecedented physical phenomena.
The ability to embed graphene materials in a double gated structure allowed
on-chip realization of relativistic tunneling experiments in single layer
graphene, the discovery of a gate tunable band gap in bilayer graphene and of a
gate tunable band overlap in trilayer graphene. Here we discuss recent advances
in the physics and nanotechnology fabrication of double gated single- and
few-layer graphene devices.
