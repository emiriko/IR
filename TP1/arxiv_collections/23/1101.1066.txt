Projections for the earliest interstellar mission possibilities are
calculated based on 27 years of data on historic energy trends, societal
priorities, required mission energy, and the implications of the Incessant
Obsolescence Postulate (Where newer probes pass prior probes). Two sample
missions are considered: launching a minimal colony ship where destination is
irrelevant, and sending a minimal probe to Alpha Centauri with a 75 year
mission duration. The colony ship is assumed to have a mass of 10^7 kg, and the
probe 10^4 kg. It is found that the earliest interstellar missions could not
begin for roughly another 2 centuries, or 1 century at best. Even when
considering only the kinetic energy of the vehicles without any regard for
propellant, the colony ship cannot launch until around the year 2200, and the
probe cannot launch until around 2500. Examination of the Incessant Obsolesce
Postulate shows that it becomes irrelevant under several conditions.
