The Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) is a 36-element
array with a 30-square-degree field of view being built at the proposed SKA
site in Western Australia. We are conducting a Design Study for pulsar
observations with ASKAP, planning both timing and search observations. We
provide an overview of the ASKAP telescope and an update on pulsar-related
progress.
