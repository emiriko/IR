Resonant valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectra (ResPES) excited near
2p$_{3/2}$ core level energies, 2p X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and
L$_{3,2}$ X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) of Ti and Mn in single crystal of
1T-Mn$_2$TiSe$_2$ were studied for the first time. The ionic-covalent character
of bonds formed by Mn atoms with the neighboring Se atoms in the octahedral
coordination is established. From the XPS and XAS measurements compared with
results of atomic multiplet calculations of Ti and Mn L$_{3,2}$ XAS it is found
that Ti atoms are in ionic state of 4+ and Mn atoms are in the state of 2+. In
ResPES of Mn$_{0.2}$TiSe$_2$ excited near Ti 2p$_{3/2}$ and Mn 2p$_{3/2}$
absorption edges the Ti 3d and Mn 3d bands at binding energies just below the
Fermi level are observed. According to band structure calculations
E$(\textbf{k})$ the Ti 3d states are localized in the vicinity of
$\mathsf{\Gamma}$ point and the Mn 3d states are localized along the direction
K-$\mathsf{\Gamma}$-M in the Brillouin zone of the crystal.
