A new analytical approach to description of electromagnetic waves in
nonmagnetic anisotropic media is presented. Amplitudes of their reflection and
refraction at interfaces and also reflection and transmission of plane parallel
plates are derived. Beam splitting at reflection, and creation of surface waves
at the interfaces are studied. A simple laboratory demonstration of the beam
splitting is proposed. D'yakonov surface waves, their description and
observation are discussed.
