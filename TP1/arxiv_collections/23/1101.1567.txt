VDB0-B195D is a massive, blue star cluster in M31. It was observed as part of
the Beijing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut (BATC) Multicolor Sky Survey using 15
intermediate-band filters covering a wavelength range of 3000--10,000 \AA.
Based on aperture photometry, we obtain its spectral-energy distribution (SED)
as defined by the 15 BATC filters. We apply previously established relations
between the BATC intermediate-band and the Johnson-Cousins $UBVRI$ broad-band
systems to convert our BATC photometry to the standard system. A detailed
comparison shows that our newly derived $VRI$ magnitudes are fully consistent
with previous results, while our new $B$ magnitude agrees to within $2\sigma$.
In addition, we determine the cluster's age and mass by comparing its SED (from
3000 to 20,000{\AA}, comprising photometric data in the 15 BATC intermediate
bands, optical broad-band $BVRI$, and 2MASS near-infrared $JHK_{\rm s}$ data)
with theoretical stellar population synthesis models, resulting in age and mass
determinations of $60.0\pm 8.0$~Myr and $(1.1-1.6) \times 10^5 M_\odot$,
respectively. This age and mass confirms previous suggestions that VDB0-B195D
is a young massive cluster in M31.
