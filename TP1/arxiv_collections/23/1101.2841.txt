We show that an invariant an universal length scale can be consistently
introduced in a generally covariant theory through the gravitational sector
using the Palatini approach. The resulting theory is able to capture different
aspects of quantum gravity phenomenology in a single framework. In particular,
it is found that in this theory field excitations propagating with different
energy-densities perceive different background metrics, which is a fundamental
characteristic of the DSR and Rainbow Gravity approaches. We illustrate these
properties with a particular gravitational model and explicitly show how the
{\it soccer ball problem} is avoided in this framework. The isotropic and
anisotropic cosmologies of this model also avoid the big bang singularity by
means of a big bounce.
