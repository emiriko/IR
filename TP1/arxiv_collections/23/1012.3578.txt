For active galactic nuclei (AGNs) we study the role of the mechanism of
quasi-linear diffusion (QLD) in producing the high energy emission in the
MeV-GeV domains strongly connected with the submillimeter/infrared radiation.
Considering the kinetic equation governing the stationary regime of the QLD we
investigate the feedback of the diffusion on electrons. We show that this
process leads to the distribution of particles by the pitch angles, implying
that the synchrotron mechanism is no longer prevented by energy losses.
Examining a reasonable interval of physical parameters, we show that it is
possible to produce MeV-GeV gamma-rays, strongly correlated with
submillimeter/infrared bands.
