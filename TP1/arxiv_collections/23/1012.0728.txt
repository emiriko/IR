The suppression of high $p_{T}$ hadron production in heavy ion collisions is
thought to be due to energy loss by gluon radiation off hard partons in a QCD
medium. Existing models of QCD radiative energy loss in a color-charged medium
give estimates of the coupling strength of the parton to the medium which
differ by a factor of $5$. We will present a side-by-side comparison of two
different formalisms to calculate the energy loss of light quarks and gluons:
the multiple soft scattering approximation (ASW-MS) and the opacity expansion
formalism (ASW-SH and WHDG-rad). A common time-temperature profile is used to
characterize the medium. The results are compared to the single hadron
suppression $R_{AA}$ at RHIC energies. In addition the influcence of
homogeneous and non-homogeneous distribution of scattering centers is
discussed. We find that using an equivalent brick overestimates the energy loss
for long parton trajectories.
