We address soliton transmission and reflection in nonlinear photonic lattices
embedded into uniform Kerr nonlinear media. We show that by introducing
disorder into the guiding lattice channels, one may achieve soliton
transmission even under conditions where regular lattices reflect the input
beam completely. In contrast, in the parameter range where the lattice is
almost transparent for incoming solitons, disorder may induce a significant
reflection.
