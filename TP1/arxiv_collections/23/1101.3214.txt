The performance of the generalized belief propagation algorithm for computing
the noiseless capacity and mutual information rates of finite-size
two-dimensional and three-dimensional run-length limited constraints is
investigated. For each constraint, a method is proposed to choose the basic
regions and to construct the region graph. Simulation results for the capacity
of different constraints as a function of the size of the channel and mutual
information rates of different constraints as a function of signal-to-noise
ratio are reported. Convergence to the Shannon capacity is also discussed.
