Thermodynamics of small systems has become an important field of statistical
physics. They are driven out of equilibrium by a control, and the question is
naturally posed how such a control can be optimized. We show that optimization
problems in small system thermodynamics are solved by (deterministic) optimal
transport, for which very efficient numerical methods have been developed, and
of which there are applications in Cosmology, fluid mechanics, logistics, and
many other fields. We show, in particular, that minimizing expected heat
released or work done during a non-equilibrium transition in finite time is
solved by Burgers equation of Cosmology and mass transport by the Burgers
velocity field. Our contribution hence considerably extends the range of
solvable optimization problems in small system thermodynamics.
