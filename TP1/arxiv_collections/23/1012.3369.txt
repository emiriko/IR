A well-balanced scheme for a gravitational hydrodynamic system is defined as
a scheme which could precisely preserve a hydrostatic isothermal solution. In
this paper, we will construct a well-balanced gas-kinetic
symplecticity-preserving BGK (SP-BGK) scheme. In order to develop such a
scheme, we model the gravitational potential as a piecewise step function with
a potential jump at the cell interface. At the same time, the Liouville's
theorem and symplecticity preserving property of a Hamiltonian flow have been
used in the description of particles penetration, reflection, and deformation
through a potential barrier. The use of the symplecticity preserving property
for a Hamiltonian flow is crucial in the evaluation of the high-order moments
of a gas distribution function when crossing through a potential jump. As far
as we know, the SP-BGK method is the first shock capturing Navier-Stokes flow
solver with well-balanced property for a gravitational hydrodynamic system. A
few theorems will be proved for this scheme, which include the necessity to use
an exact Maxwellian for keeping the hydrostatic state, the total mass and
energy (the sum of kinetic, thermal, and gravitational ones) conservation, and
the well-balanced property to keep a hydrostatic state during particle
transport and collision processes. Many numerical examples will be presented to
validate the SP-BGK scheme.
