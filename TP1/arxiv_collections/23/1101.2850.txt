In a recent study [arXiv:1011.3254] the contact process with a modified
creation rate at a single site was shown to exhibit a non-universal scaling
behavior with exponents varying with the creation rate at the special site. In
the present work we argue that the survival probability decays according to a
stretched exponential rather than a power law, explaining previous
observations.
