For high-pT forward processes at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), QCD
logarithmic corrections in the hard transverse momentum and in the large
rapidity interval may both be quantitatively significant. The theoretical
framework to resum consistently both kinds of logarithmic corrections to higher
orders in perturbation theory is based on QCD high-energy factorization. We
present numerical Monte Carlo applications of this method to final-state
observables associated with production of one forward and one central jet. By
computing jet correlations in rapidity and azimuth, we analyze the role of
corrections to the parton-showering chain from large-angle gluon radiation, and
discuss this in relationship with Monte Carlo results modeling interactions due
to multiple parton chains.
