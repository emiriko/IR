We address the question of understanding the production of $J/\psi$ particles
regarding the global underlying event in proton-proton collisions. To do so, we
propose to look at a new observable: the $J/\psi$ production as a function of
the charged particles multiplicity of the event. We demonstrate the interest
for an experimental measurement by varying the model of multiple interactions
in the PYTHIA generator.
