The mean field approach to the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is developed
systematically. Approximate mean field action is obtained, based on the study
of divergencies in the mean field action. A special scalar case of the
approximate motion equations is studied and inhomogenouous solutions are
discussed. It is shown that the model can have inhomogeneous vacuum
configurations which leads to bound fermionic states.
