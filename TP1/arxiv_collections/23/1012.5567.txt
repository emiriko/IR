Dirac electrons in finite graphene samples with zigzag edges under high
magnetic fields (in the regime of Landau-level formation) are investigated with
regard to their bulk-type and edge-type character. We employ tight-binding
calculations on finite graphene flakes (with various shapes) to determine the
sublattice components of the electron density in conjunction with analytic
expressions (via the parabolic cylinder functions) of the relativistic-electron
spinors that solve the continuous Dirac-Weyl equation for a semi-infinite
graphene plane. Away from the sample edge, the higher Landau levels are found
to comprise exclusively electrons of bulk-type character (for both
sublattices); near the sample edge, these electrons are described by edge-type
states similar to those familiar from the theory of the integer quantum Hall
effect for nonrelativistic electrons. In contrast, the lowest (zero) Landau
level contains relativistic Dirac electrons of a mixed bulk-edge character
without an analog in the nonrelativistic case. It is shown that such mixed
bulk-edge states maintain also in the case of a square flake with combined
zigzag and armchair edges. Implications for the many-body correlated-electron
behavior (relating to the fractional quantum Hall effect) in finite graphene
samples are discussed.
