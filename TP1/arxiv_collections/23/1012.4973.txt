A two-state-model consisting of hexagonally connected lipids being either in
the ordered or disordered state is used to set up a Monte Carlo Simulation for
lipid monolayers. The connection of the lipids is realized by Newtonian springs
emulating the surfaces elasticity and allowing for the calculation of
translational movement of the lipids, whereas all necessary simulation
parameters follow from experiments. Simulated monolayer isotherms can be
directly compared to measured ones concurrently allowing the calculation of the
experimentally hardly accessible monolayer heat capacity.
