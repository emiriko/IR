The influence of the combined effects of substrate-induced strain, finite
size and electron irradiation-induced defects have been studied on individual
micron-sized domains of the organic charge transfer compound
tetrathiafulvalene-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TTF-TCNQ) by temperature-dependent
conductivity and current-voltage measurements. The individual domains have been
isolated by focused ion beam etching and electrically contacted by focused ion
and electron beam induced deposition of metallic contacts. The
temperature-dependent conductivity follows a variable range hopping behavior
which shows a crossover of the exponent as the Peierls transition is
approached. The low temperature behavior is analyzed within the segmented rod
model of Fogler, Teber and Shklowskii, as originally developed for a
charge-ordered quasi one-dimensional electron crystal. The results are compared
with data obtained on as-grown and electron irradiated epitaxial TTF-TCNQ thin
films of the two-domain type.
