We derive the equations of second order dissipative fluid dynamics from the
relativistic Boltzmann equation following the method of W. Israel and J. M.
Stewart. We present a frame independent calculation of all first- and
second-order terms and their coefficients using a linearised collision
integral. Therefore, we restore all terms that were previously neglected in the
original papers of W. Israel and J. M. Stewart.
