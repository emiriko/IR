We quantify the degree of disorder in the {\pi}-{\pi} stacking direction of
crystallites of a high performing semicrystalline semiconducting polymer with
advanced X-ray lineshape analysis. Using first principles calculations, we
obtain the density of states of a system of {\pi}-{\pi} stacked polymer chains
with increasing amounts of paracrystalline disorder. We find that for an
aligned film of PBTTT the paracrystalline disorder is 7.3%. This type of
disorder induces a tail of trap states with a breadth of ~100 meV as determined
through calculation. This finding agrees with previous device modeling and
provides physical justification for the mobility edge model.
