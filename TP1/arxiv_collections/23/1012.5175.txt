Noise filtering is an essential part for measurement of quantum phenomena at
extremely low temperatures. Here, we present the design of a filter which can
be installed in space constrained cryogenic environment containing a large
number of signal carrying lines. Our filters have a -3db point of 65kHz and its
performance at GHz frequencies are comparable to the best available RF filters.
