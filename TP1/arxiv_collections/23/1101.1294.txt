Final states with four tops appear in various extensions of the Standard
Model. Alas, top reconstruction faces combinatorial issues as they show up as
large multiplicity events. In this paper, we present a new procedure to
determine whether new physics is in fact due to a new source for tops. We
establish the use of this procedure to separate the signal from background
(primarily $t\bar{t}$+jets). Our analysis is model independent, in that it does
not use any details of the four top production (such as possible missing
energy), and does not require b-tagging.
