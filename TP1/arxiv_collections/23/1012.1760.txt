We give texture analyses of cascade hierarchical mass matrices in
supersymmetric SO(10) grand unified theory. We embed cascade mass textures of
the standard model fermion with right-handed neutrinos into the theory, which
gives relations among the mass matrices of the fermions. The related
phenomenologies, such as the lepton flavor violating processes and
leptogenesis, are also investigated in addition to the PMNS mixing angles.
