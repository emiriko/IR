We have studied the context and development of the ideas of physical forces
and differential calculus in ancient India by studying relevant literature
related to both astrology and astronomy since pre-Greek periods. The concept of
Naisargika Bala (natural force) discussed in Hora texts from India is defined
to be proportional to planetary size and inversely related to planetary
distance. This idea developed several centuries prior to Isaac Newton resembles
fundamental physical forces in nature especially gravity. We show that the
studies on retrograde motion and Chesta Bala of planets like Mars in the
context of astrology lead to development of differential calculus and planetary
dynamics in ancient India. The idea of instantaneous velocity was first
developed during the 1st millennium BC and Indians could solve first order
differential equations as early as 6th cent AD. Indian contributions to
astrophysics and calculus during European dark ages can be considered as a land
mark in the pre-renaissance history of physical sciences.
