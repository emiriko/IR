A community of agents is subject to a stream of messages, which are
represented as points on a plane of issues. Messages are sent by media and by
agents themselves. Messages from media shape the public opinion. They are
unbiased, i.e. positive and negative opinions on a given issue appear with
equal frequencies. In our previous work, the only criterion to receive a
message by an agent is if the distance between this message and the ones
received earlier does not exceed the given value of the tolerance parameter.
Here we introduce a possibility to address a message to a given neighbour. We
show that this option reduces the unanimity effect, what improves the
collective performance.
