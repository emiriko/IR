A thermodynamically consistent framework able to model either diffusive and
displacive phase transitions is proposed. The first law of thermodynamics, the
balance of linear momentum equation and the Cahn-Hilliard equation for solute
mass conservation are the governing equations of the model, which is
complemented by a suitable choice of the Helmholtz free energy and consistent
boundary and initial conditions.
