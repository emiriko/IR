We study photon-meson transition formfactors of light mesons in the
kinematics, where one photon is real and other is virtual. Dispersive approach
to axial anomaly leads to the anomaly sum rule. The absence of corrections to
it allows us to get the relation between possible corrections to continuum and
to lower states within QCD method which does not rely on factorization
hypothesis. We show, relying on the recent data of the BaBar Collaboration,
that the relative correction to continuum is quite small, and small correction
to continuum can dramatically change the pion formfactor. The same effect for
{\eta} meson is shown to be less pronounced.
