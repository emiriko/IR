In 2008, the German Federal Office for Information Security issued the common
criteria protection profile for Online Voting Products (PP-0037). Accord-
ingly, we evaluated the Polyas electronic voting system, which is used for
legally binding elections in several international organizations (German
Gesellschaft for Informatik, GI, among others), for compliance with the common
criteria protection profile and worked toward fulfilling the given
requirements. In this article we pre- sent the findings of the process of
creating a compliant security target, necessary restrictions and assumptions to
the system design as well as the workings of the committee, and architectural
and procedural changes made necessary.
