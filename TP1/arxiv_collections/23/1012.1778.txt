We propose a protocol to generate a stream of mobile qubits in a graph state
through a single stationary parent qubit and discuss two types of its physical
implementation, namely, the generation of photonic graph states through an
atom-like qubit and those of flying atoms through a cavity-mode photonic qubit.
The generated graph states fall into an important class that can hugely reduce
the resource requirement of fault-tolerant linear optics quantum computation,
which was previously known to be far from realistic. In regard to the flying
atoms, we also propose a heralded generation scheme, which allows for
high-fidelity graph states even under the photon loss.
