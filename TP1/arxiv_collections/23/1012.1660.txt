The primary mission of UniProt is to support biological research by
maintaining a stable, comprehensive, fully classified, richly and accurately
annotated protein sequence knowledgebase, with extensive cross-references to
external resources, that is freely available to the scientific community. To
enable users of the knowledgebase to accurately assess the reliability of the
information contained in this resource, the evidence for and provenance of the
information must be recorded. This paper discusses the user requirements for
this kind of metadata and the manner in which UniProtKB records it.
