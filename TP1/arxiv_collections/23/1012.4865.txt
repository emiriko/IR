We investigate the thermoelectric properties of electrons at the interface of
oxide heterostructure and in the presence of a multiferroic oxide with spiral
spin order. We find there is no (spin) Hall current generated by the
temperature gradient. A Seebeck effect is however present. Due to the
magnetoelectric coupling, the charge and thermal conductivities are
electrically controllable via the spin spiral helicity. Moreover, the
thermopower exhibits a sign change when tuning electro-statically the carrier
density.
