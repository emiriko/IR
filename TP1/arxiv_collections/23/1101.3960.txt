A bicriteria approximation algorithm is presented for the unrooted traveling
repairman problem, realizing increased profit in return for increased speedup
of repairman motion. The algorithm generalizes previous results from the case
in which all time windows are the same length to the case in which their
lengths can range between l and 2. This analysis can extend to any range of
time window lengths, following our earlier techniques. This relationship
between repairman profit and speedup is applicable over a range of values that
is dependent on the cost of putting the input in an especially desirable form,
involving what are called "trimmed windows." For time windows with lengths
between 1 and 2, the range of values for speedup $s$ for which our analysis
holds is $1 \leq s \leq 6$. In this range, we establish an approximation ratio
that is constant for any specific value of $s$.
