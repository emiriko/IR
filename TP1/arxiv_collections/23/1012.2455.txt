The process of electron-positron annihilation into a pair of $\pi^0$ and
$\omega$ mesons is considered in the framework of the SU(2)$\times$SU(2)
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. Contributions of intermediate photons, $\rho(770)$
and $\rho'(1450)$ vector mesons are taken into account. It is shown that the
bulk of the cross section at energies below 2 GeV is provided by the process
with intermediate $\rho'(1450)$ state. The contribution due to single photon
and $\rho(770)$ exchange is in agreement with the vector meson dominance model.
Numerical results are compared with experimental data.
