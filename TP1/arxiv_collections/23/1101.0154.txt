SU(2) gauge theory with two fermions transforming under the adjoint
representation may appear conformal or almost conformal in the infrared, and is
one of the candidate theories for building models for technicolor. Early
lattice Monte Carlo studies of this model have used unimproved Wilson fermion
formulation, which can be expected to have large lattice cutoff effects. In
this paper we present the calculation of the O(a) improved lattice
Wilson-clover action of the theory. The Sheikholeslami-Wohlert coefficient has
been determined non-perturbatively, and various boundary improvement terms,
needed for the Schroedinger functional formalism, have been calculated in
perturbation theory. For comparison, we have also determined the improvement
coefficients for SU(2) gauge theory with two fundamental representation
fermions. The calculation paves way for more accurate lattice Monte Carlo
analyses of the theory in the future.
