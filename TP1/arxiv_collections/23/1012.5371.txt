In a recent Letter [arXiv:1004.0874], Volpe et al. describe experiments on a
colloidal particle near a wall in the presence of a gravitational field for
which they study the influence of noise on the measurement of force. Their
central result is a striking discrepancy between the forces derived from
experimental drift measurements via their Eq. (1), and from the equilibrium
distribution. From this discrepancy they infer the stochastic calculus realised
in the system.
  We comment, however: (a) that Eq. (1) does not hold for space-dependent
diffusion, and corrections should be introduced; and (b) that the "force"
derived from the drift need not coincide with the "force" obtained from the
equilibrium distribution.
