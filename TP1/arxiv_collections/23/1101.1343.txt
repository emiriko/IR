BiFeO3 thin films with various thicknesses were grown epitaxially on (001)
LaSrAlO4 single crystal substrates using pulsed laser deposition. High
resolution x-ray diffraction measurements revealed that a tetragonal-like phase
with c-lattice constant ~4.65 {\AA} is stabilized by a large misfit strain.
Besides, a rhombohedral-like phase with c-lattice constant ~3.99 {\AA} was also
detected at film thickness of ~50 nm and above to relieve large misfit strains.
In-plane piezoelectric force microscopy studies showed clear signals and
self-assembled nanoscale stripe domain structure for the tetragonal-like
regions. These findings suggest a complex picture of nanoscale domain patterns
in BiFeO3 thin films subjected to large compressive strains.
