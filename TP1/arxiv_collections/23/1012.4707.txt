This is a review paper invited by the journal "Classical ad Quantum Gravity"
for a "Cluster Issue" on approaches to quantum gravity. I give a synthetic
presentation of loop gravity. I spell-out the aims of the theory and compare
the results obtained with the initial hopes that motivated the early interest
in this research direction. I give my own perspective on the status of the
program and attempt of a critical evaluation of its successes and limits.
