The late-time behaviour of the Einstein-dust system is well understood for
homogeneous spacetimes. For the case of Bianchi I we have been able to show
that the late-time behaviour of the Einstein-Vlasov system is well approximated
by the Einstein-dust system assuming that one is close to the unique stationary
solution which is the attractor of the Einstein-dust system.
