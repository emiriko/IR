We investigate a system of two polarized molecules in a layered trap. The
molecules reside in adjacent layers and interact purely via the dipole-dipole
interaction. We determine the properties of the ground state of the system as a
function of the dipole moment and polarization angle. A bound state is always
present in the system and in the weak binding limit the bound state extends to
a very large distance and shows universal behavior.
