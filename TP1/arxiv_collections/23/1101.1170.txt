The lifetime of solar-like stars, the envelope structure of more massive
stars, and stellar acoustic frequencies largely depend on the radiative
properties of the stellar plasma. Up to now, these complex quantities have been
estimated only theoretically. The development of the powerful tools of helio-
and astero- seismology has made it possible to gain insights on the interiors
of stars. Consequently, increased emphasis is now placed on knowledge of the
monochromatic opacity coefficients. Here we review how these radiative
properties play a role, and where they are most important. We then concentrate
specifically on the envelopes of $\beta$ Cephei variable stars. We discuss the
dispersion of eight different theoretical estimates of the monochromatic
opacity spectrum and the challenges we need to face to check these calculations
experimentally.
