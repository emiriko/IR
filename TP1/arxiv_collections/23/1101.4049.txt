We consider a simple modification of the amplitude defining the dynamics of
loop quantum gravity, corresponding to the introduction of the cosmological
constant, and possibly related to the SL(2,C)q extension of the theory recently
considered by Fairbairn-Meusburger and Han. We show that in the context of
spinfoam cosmology, this modification yields the de Sitter cosmological
solution.
