A long-standing, though ill-understood problem in rocket dynamics, rocket
response to random, altitude-dependent nozzle side-loads, is investigated. Side
loads arise during low altitude flight due to random, asymmetric, shock-induced
separation of in-nozzle boundary layers. In this paper, stochastic evolution of
the in-nozzle boundary layer separation line, an essential feature underlying
side load generation, is connected to random, altitude-dependent rotational and
translational rocket response via a set of simple analytical models. Separation
line motion, extant on a fast boundary layer time scale, is modeled as an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Pitch and yaw responses, taking place on a long,
rocket dynamics time scale, are shown to likewise evolve as OU processes.
Stochastic, altitude-dependent rocket translational motion follows from linear,
asymptotic versions of the full nonlinear equations of motion; the model is
valid in the practical limit where random pitch, yaw, and roll rates all remain
small. Computed altitudedependent rotational and translational velocity and
displacement statistics are compared against those obtained using recently
reported high fidelity simulations [Srivastava, Tkacik, and Keanini, J. Applied
Phys., 108, 044911 (2010)]; in every case, reasonable agreement is observed. As
an important prelude, evidence indicating the physical consistency of the model
introduced in the above article is first presented: it is shown that the
study's separation line model allows direct derivation of experimentally
observed side load amplitude and direction densities. Finally, it is found that
the analytical models proposed in this paper allow straightforward
identification of practical approaches for: i) reducing pitch/yaw response to
side loads, and ii) enhancing pitch/yaw damping once side loads cease.
