The CMS pixel detector consists of approximately 66 million silicon pixels
whose analog signals are read out by 15,840 programmable Readout Chips. With
the recent startup of the LHC, the detector is now collecting data used for
precise vertexing and track-finding. In preparation for data taking, the
detector's Readout Chips and their supporting readout and control electronics
were calibrated. The calibration that has taken place since the detector's
installation in the summer of 2008 will be described. These calibrations
focused on the optimization of the Readout Chips' thresholds and analog
response. The operation of the detector during the early running of the LHC
will also be discussed. The calibrations that are performed on a regular basis
and a mechanism to handle the readout of large beam background events will be
described.
