In this talk we present the perspectives about measurements of CP and CPT
violating quantities at future Super Flavour Factories. In particular we will
focus on the expected sensitivities reachable after 5 years of data taking with
the SuperB detector: this dataset will allow to perform measurements on B
meson, D meson and tau lepton systems with greatly enhanced precision over the
current results.
