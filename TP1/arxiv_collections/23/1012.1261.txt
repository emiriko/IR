Aim of this paper is to give an extensive treatment of bipartite mean field
spin systems, ordered and disordered: at first, bipartite ferromagnets are
investigated, achieving an explicit expression for the free energy trough a new
minimax variational principle. Furthermore via the Hamilton-Jacobi technique
the same free energy structure is obtained together with the existence of its
thermodynamic limit and the minimax principle is connected to a standard max
one. The same is investigated for bipartite spin-glasses: By the Borel-Cantelli
lemma a control of the high temperature regime is obtained, while via the
double stochastic stability technique we get also the explicit expression of
the free energy at the replica symmetric level, uniquely defined by a minimax
variational principle again. A general results that states that the free
energies of these systems are convex linear combinations of their independent
one party model counterparts is achieved too. For the sake of completeness we
show further that at zero temperature the replica symmetric entropy becomes
negative and, consequently, such a symmetry must be broken. The treatment of
the fully broken replica symmetry case is deferred to a forthcoming paper. As a
first step in this direction, we start deriving the linear and quadratic
constraints to overlap fluctuations.
