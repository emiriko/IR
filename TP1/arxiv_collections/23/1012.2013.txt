We study the feasibility of nonlocally compensating for polarization mode
dispersion (PMD), when polarization entangled photons are distributed in
fiber-optic channels.We quantify the effectiveness of nonlocal compensation
while taking into account the possibility that entanglement is generated
through the use of a pulsed optical pump signal.
