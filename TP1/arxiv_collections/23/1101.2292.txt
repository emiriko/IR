The fact that self-confined jets are observed around black holes, neutron
stars and young forming stars points to a jet launching mechanism independent
of the nature of the central object, namely the surrounding accretion disc. The
properties of Jet Emitting Discs (JEDs) are briefly reviewed. It is argued
that, within an alpha prescription for the turbulence (anomalous viscosity and
diffusivity), the steady-state problem has been solved. Conditions for
launching jets are very stringent and require a large scale magnetic field
$B_z$ close to equipartition with the total (gas and radiation) pressure. The
total power feeding the jets decreases with the disc thickness: fat ADAF-like
structures with $h\sim r$ cannot drive super-Alfv\'enic jets. However, there
exist also hot, optically thin JED solutions that would be observationally very
similar to ADAFs.
  Finally, it is argued that variations in the large scale magnetic $B_z$ field
is the second parameter required to explain hysteresis cycles seen in LMXBs
(the first one would be $\dot M_a$).
