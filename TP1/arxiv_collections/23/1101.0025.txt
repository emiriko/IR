Using Schwinger Variational Principle we solve the problem of quantum
harmonic oscillator with time dependent frequency. Here, we do not take the
usual approach which implicitly assumes an adiabatic behavior for the
frequency. Instead, we propose a new solution where the frequency only needs
continuity in its first derivative or to have a finite set of removable
discontinuities.
