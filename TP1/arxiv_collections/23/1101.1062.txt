The paper reports on a study of electron-phonon interaction within a limited
nanosized region. We invoked the modified Fr\"{o}hlich's Hamiltonian to
calculate the electron self-energy, as well as the elastic and inelastic
scattering cross sections. New effects have been revealed, more specifically: a
bound state forms within the limited nanosized region, electrons undergo
resonant elastic scattering, with strong inelastic scattering being possible
from this state even at low electron energies. The effect of scattering on the
magnetic-field-independent dephasing time, in particular, in a
diamond-decorated carbon nanotube, has been determined. The effect of strong
inelastic electron scattering on thermal resistance at the metal-insulator
interface is discussed.
