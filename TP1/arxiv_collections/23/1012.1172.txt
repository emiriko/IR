A detailed study of the magnetic and transport properties of Si$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$
($x\approx 0.35$) films is presented. We observe the anomalous Hall effect
(AHE) in these films up to room temperature. The results of the magnetic
measurements and the AHE data are consistent and demonstrate the existence of
long-range ferromagnetic (FM) order in the systems under study. A correlation
of the AHE and the magnetic properties of Si$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ ($x\approx 0.35$)
films with their conductivity and substrate type is shown. A theoretical model
based on the idea of a two-phase magnetic material, in which molecular clusters
with localized magnetic moments are embedded in the matrix of a weak itinerant
ferromagnet, is discussed. The long-range ferromagnetic order at high
temperatures is mainly due to the Stoner enhancement of the exchange coupling
between clusters through thermal spin fluctuations (paramagnons) in the matrix.
Theoretical predictions and experimental data are in good qualitative
agreement.
