We consider the use in quantum Monte Carlo calculations of two types of
valence bond wave functions based on strictly localized active orbitals, namely
valence bond self-consistent-field (VBSCF) and breathing-orbital valence bond
(BOVB) wave functions. Complemented by a Jastrow factor, these
Jastrow-Valence-Bond wave functions are tested by computing the equilibrium
well depths of the four diatomic molecules C$_2$, N$_2$, O$_2$, and F$_2$ in
both variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). We show
that it is possible to design compact wave functions based on chemical grounds
that are capable of describing both static and dynamic electron correlation.
These wave functions can be systematically improved by inclusion of valence
bond structures corresponding to additional bonding patterns.
