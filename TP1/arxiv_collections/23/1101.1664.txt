We develop a parallel algorithm that calculates the exact partition function
of a lattice polymer, by enumerating the number of conformations for each
energy level. An efficient parallelization of the calculation is achieved by
classifying the conformations according to the shape of the box spanned by a
conformation, and enumerating only those in a given box at a time. The
calculation time for each box is reduced by preventing the conformations
related by symmetries from being generated more than once. The algorithm is
applied to study the collapse transition of a lattice homopolymer on a square
lattice, by calculating the specific heat for chain lengths up to 36.
