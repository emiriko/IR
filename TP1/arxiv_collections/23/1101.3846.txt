The magneto-transport of a superconducting/ferromagnetic hybrid structure
consisting of a superconducting thin film in contact with an array of magnetic
nanodots in the so-called "magnetic vortex-state" exhibits interesting
properties. For certain magnetic states, the stray magnetic field from the
vortex array is intense enough to drive the superconducting film into the
normal state. In this fashion, the normal-to-superconducting phase transition
can be controlled by the magnetic history. The strong coupling between
superconducting and magnetic subsystems allows characteristically ferromagnetic
properties, such as hysteresis and remanence, to be dramatically transferred
into the transport properties of the superconductor.
