`Water In Star-forming regions with Herschel' (WISH) is a key program on the
Herschel Space Observatory designed to probe the physical and chemical
structure of young stellar objects using water and related molecules and to
follow the water abundance from collapsing clouds to planet-forming disks.
About 80 sources are targeted covering a wide range of luminosities and
evolutionary stages, from cold pre-stellar cores to warm protostellar envelopes
and outflows to disks around young stars. Both the HIFI and PACS instruments
are used to observe a variety of lines of H2O, H218O and chemically related
species. An overview of the scientific motivation and observational strategy of
the program is given together with the modeling approach and analysis tools
that have been developed. Initial science results are presented. These include
a lack of water in cold gas at abundances that are lower than most predictions,
strong water emission from shocks in protostellar environments, the importance
of UV radiation in heating the gas along outflow walls across the full range of
luminosities, and surprisingly widespread detection of the chemically related
hydrides OH+ and H2O+ in outflows and foreground gas. Quantitative estimates of
the energy budget indicate that H2O is generally not the dominant coolant in
the warm dense gas associated with protostars. Very deep limits on the cold
gaseous water reservoir in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks are
obtained which have profound implications for our understanding of grain growth
and mixing in disks.
