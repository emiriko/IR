Motivated by recent experimental data (Sepioni, M. et al. Phys. Rev. Lett.
2010, 105, 207205), we have studied the possibility of forming magnetic
clusters with spin S> 1/2 on graphene by adsorption of hydrogen atoms or
hydroxyl groups. Migration of hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl groups on the surface
of graphene during the delamination of HOPG led to the formation of seven-atom
or seven-OH-group clusters with S=5/2 that were of a special interest. The
coincidence of symmetry of the clusters with the graphene lattice strengthens
the stability of the cluster. For (OH)7 clusters that were situated greater
than 3 nm from one another, the reconstruction barrier to a nonmagnetic
configuration was approximately 0.4 eV, whereas for H7 clusters, there was no
barrier and the high-spin state was unstable. Stability of the high-spin
clusters increased if they were formed on top of ripples. Exchange interactions
between the clusters were studied and we have shown that the ferromagnetic
state is improbable. The role of the chemical composition of the solvent used
for the delamination of graphite is discussed.
