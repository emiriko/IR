We show that quantum coherence can increase the quantum efficiency of various
thermodynamic systems. For example, we can enhance the quantum efficiency for a
quantum dot photocell, a laser based solar cell and the photo-Carnot quantum
heat engine. Our results are fully consistent with the laws of thermodynamics
contrary to comments found in the paper of A.P. Kirk, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106,
048703 (2011).
