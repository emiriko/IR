The $^{15}{\rm N}(p,\gamma)^{16}{\rm O}$ reaction provides a path from the CN
cycle to the CNO bi-cycle and CNO tri-cycle. The measured astrophysical factor
for this reaction is dominated by resonant capture through two strong
$J^{\pi}=1^{-}$ resonances at $E_{R}= 312$ and 962 keV and direct capture to
the ground state. Recently, a new measurement of the astrophysical factor for
the $^{15}{\rm N}(p,\gamma)^{16}{\rm O}$ reaction has been published [P. J.
LeBlanc {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. {\bf C 82}, 055804 (2010)]. The analysis has
been done using the $R$-matrix approach with unconstrained variation of all
parameters including the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC). The best
fit has been obtained for the square of the ANC $C^{2}= 539.2$ fm${}^{-1}$,
which exceeds the previously measured value by a factor of $\approx 3$. Here we
present a new $R$-matrix analysis of the Notre Dame-LUNA data with the fixed
within the experimental uncertainties square of the ANC $C^{2}=200.34$
fm${}^{-1}$. Rather than varying the ANC we add the contribution from a
background resonance that effectively takes into account contributions from
higher levels. Altogether we present 8 fits, five unconstrained and three
constrained. In all the fits the ANC is fixed at the previously determined
experimental value $C^{2}=200.34$ fm${}^{-1}$. For the unconstrained fit with
the boundary condition $B_{c}=S_{c}(E_{2})$, where $E_{2}$ is the energy of the
second level, we get $S(0)=39.0 \pm 1.1 $ keVb and normalized ${\tilde
\chi}^{2}=1.84$, i.e. the result which is similar to [P. J. LeBlanc {\it et
al.}, Phys. Rev. {\bf C 82}, 055804 (2010)]. From all our fits we get the range
$33.1 \leq S(0) \leq 40.1$ keVb which overlaps with the result of [P. J.
LeBlanc {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. {\bf C 82}, 055804 (2010)]. We address also
physical interpretation of the fitting parameters.
