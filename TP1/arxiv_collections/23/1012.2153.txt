We investigate propagations of graviton and additional scalar on
four-dimensional anti de Sitter (AdS$_4$) space using $f(R)$ gravity models
with external sources. It is shown that there is the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov
(vDVZ) discontinuity in $f(R)$ gravity models because $f(R)$ gravity implies GR
with additional scalar. This indicates a difference between general relativity
and $f(R)$ gravity clearly.
