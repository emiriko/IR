We study the low energy edge states of bilayer graphene in a strong
perpendicular magnetic field. Several possible simple boundaries geometries
related to zigzag edges are considered. Tight-binding calculations reveal three
types of edge state behaviors: weakly, strongly, and non-dispersive edge
states. These three behaviors may all be understood within a continuum model,
and related by non-linear transformations to the spectra of quantum Hall
edge--states in a conventional two-dimensional electron system. In all cases,
the edge states closest to zero energy include a hole-like edge state of one
valley and a particle-like state of the other on the same edge, which may or
may not cross depending on the boundary condition. Edge states with the same
spin generically have anticrossings that complicate the spectra, but which may
be understood within degenerate perturbation theory. The results demonstrate
that the number of edge states crossing the Fermi level in clean, undoped
bilayer graphene depends BOTH on boundary conditions and the energies of the
bulk states.
