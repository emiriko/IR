We derive formal expressions of time-dependent energy and heat currents
through a nanoscopic device using the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green function
technique. Numerical results are reported for a metal/dot/metal junction where
the dot level energy is abruptly changed by a step-shaped voltage pulse.
Analytical linear responses are obtained for the time-dependent thermoelectric
coefficients. We show that the Seebeck coefficient can be enhanced in the
transient regime up to an amount (here rising 40%) controlled by both the dot
energy and the height of the voltage step.
