One of the striking properties of artificially structured materials is the
negative refraction, an optical feature that known natural materials do not
exhibit. Here, we propose a simple design, composed of two parallel layers of
materials with different refraction indices $n_1=-n_2$, that constructs perfect
reflection-less devices. The electromagnetic waves can tunnel from one layer to
the other, a feature that resembles a truncation of the physical space leading
to an electromagnetic warp drive. Since the refractive indices do not require
any large values, this method demonstrates for the first time the practical
feasibility of guiding electromagnetic fields in complete absence of reflection
phenomena and without degradation of transmission efficiency at all.
