Photoluminescence (PL) of the 50 nm $Zn_{0.9}Be_{0.05}Mn_{0.05}Se$/ $d$ nm
$Zn_{0.943}Be_{0.057}Se$/ 2.5 nm $ZnSe$/ 30 nm $Zn_{0.943}Be_{0.057}Se$
structures is investigated as a function of magnetic field ($B$) and thickness
($d$) of intermediate $Zn_{0.943}Be_{0.057}Se$ nonmagnetic barrier between the
$Zn_{0.9}Be_{0.05}Mn_{0.05}Se$ semimagnetic barrier and $ZnSe$ quantum well at
the temperature 1.2 K. The rate of the shift of different PL bands of the
structures under study is estimated in low and high magnetic fields. The causes
of the shift rate increase under pass from low to high magnetic fields are
interpreted. The peculiarities of the effect of the intermediate barrier on the
luminescence properties of the structures are presented. It is shown that
deformation of adjacent layers by the barrier plays a crucial role in the
formation of these properties, especially in forming the $Mn$ complexes in the
$Zn_{0.9}Be_{0.05}Mn_{0.05}Se$ layer. The change of the band gap as well as of
the donor and acceptor levels energies under the effect of biaxial compression
of the $Zn_{0.9}Be_{0.05}Mn_{0.05}Se$ layer by the $Zn_{0.943}Be_{0.057}Se$ are
estimated. It is concluded that the $Zn_{0.943}Be_{0.057}Se$ intermediate
barrier also appreciably changes the effect of giant Zeeman splitting of the
semimagnetic $Zn_{0.9}Be_{0.05}Mn_{0.05}Se$ barrier energy levels on the
movement of the energy levels of $ZnSe$ quantum well in a magnetic field and on
polarization of the quantum well exciton emission.
