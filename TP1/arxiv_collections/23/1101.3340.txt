A white light system based on a 65 cm x 35 cm diffractive screen is
demonstrated to be capable of displaying three-dimensional figures with
continuous horizontal parallax. Three computer-controlled mirrors and a
diffractive-refractive optical system are employed for positioning each element
of the figure. No visual accessories are necessary and more than one observer
can watch it simultaneously.
