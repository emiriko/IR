An attempt to shed light on the various belief/idea systems in high Tc
superconductivity that are at present popular. This text is in first instance
intended to serve both string theorists and junior condensed matter physicists
who want to enter this field. It departs from the premise that the often
confusing, mutually contradicting portfolio of theories can be best appreciated
by viewing it from a historical perspective. The histories of the following
subjects are chronicled: the spin fluctuation superglue, Mottness, Resonating
Valence Bonds and the gauge theories, pseudo-gap and competing orders, quantum
critical metals. The author is well aware that any attempt to write such a
history is subjective and comments are welcomed.
