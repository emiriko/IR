We study the possible suppression of the extragalactic neutrino flux due to a
nonstandard interaction during its propagation. In particular, we study
neutrino interaction with an ultra-light scalar field dark matter. It is shown
that the extragalactic neutrino flux may be suppressed by such an interaction,
leading to a new mechanism to reduce the ultra-high energy neutrino flux. We
study both the cases of non-self-conjugate as well as self-conjugate dark
matter. In the first case, the suppression is independent of the neutrino and
dark matter masses. We conclude that care must be taken when explaining limits
on the neutrino flux through source acceleration mechanisms only, since there
could be other mechanisms for the reduction of the neutrino flux.
