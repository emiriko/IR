Focusing on the connection between the Landau theory of second order phase
transitions and the holographic approach to critical phenomena, we study
diverse field theories in an anti-de Sitter black hole background. Through
simple analytical approximations, solutions to the equations of motion can be
obtained in closed form which give rather good approximations of the results
obtained using more involved numerical methods. The agreement we find stems
from rather elementary considerations on perturbation of Schr\"odinger
equations.
