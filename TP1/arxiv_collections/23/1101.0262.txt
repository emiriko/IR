This paper presents a high speed and area efficient DWT processor based
design for Image Compression applications. In this proposed design, pipelined
partially serial architecture has been used to enhance the speed along with
optimal utilization and resources available on target FPGA. The proposed model
has been designed and simulated using Simulink and System Generator blocks,
synthesized with Xilinx Synthesis tool (XST) and implemented on Spartan 2 and 3
based XC2S100-5tq144 and XC3S500E-4fg320 target device. The results show that
proposed design can operate at maximum frequency 231 MHz in case of Spartan 3
by consuming power of 117mW at 28 degree/c junction temperature. The result
comparison has shown an improvement of 15% in speed.
