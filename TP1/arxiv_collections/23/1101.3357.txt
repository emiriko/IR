We examine observational signatures of dark matter annihilation in the Milky
Way arising from electroweak bremsstrahlung contributions to the annihilation
cross section. It has been known for some time that photon bremsstrahlung may
significantly boost DM annihilation yields. Recently, we have shown that
electroweak bremsstrahlung of W and Z gauge bosons can be the dominant
annihilation channel in some popular models with helicity-suppressed 2 --> 2
annihilation. W/Z-bremsstrahlung is particularly interesting because the gauge
bosons produced via annihilation subsequently decay to produce large correlated
fluxes of electrons, positrons, neutrinos, hadrons (including antiprotons) and
gamma rays, which are all of importance in indirect dark matter searches. Here
we calculate the spectra of stable annihilation products produced via
gamma/W/Z-bremsstrahlung. After modifying the fluxes to account for the
propagation through the Galaxy, we set upper bounds on the annihilation cross
section via a comparison with observational data. We show that stringent cosmic
ray antiproton limits preclude a sizable dark matter contribution to observed
cosmic ray positron fluxes in the class of models for which the bremsstrahlung
processes dominate.
