Theoretical arguments and observations suggest that the atmospheres of Brown
Dwarfs and planets are very dynamic on chemical and on physical time scales.
The modelling of such substellar atmospheres has, hence, been much more
demanding than initially anticipated. This Splinter
(http://star-www.st-and.ac.uk/~ch80/CS16/MultiDSplinter_CS16.html) has combined
new developments in atmosphere modelling, with novel observational techniques,
and new challenges arising from planetary and space weather observations.
