We study photoionization of argon atoms excited by attosecond pulses using an
interferometric measurement technique. We measure the difference in time delays
between electrons emitted from the $3s^2$ and from the $3p^6$ shell, at
different excitation energies ranging from 32 to 42 eV. The determination of
single photoemission time delays requires to take into account the measurement
process, involving the interaction with a probing infrared field. This
contribution can be estimated using an universal formula and is found to
account for a substantial fraction of the measured delay.
