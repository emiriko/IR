The study of the spin structure of the nucleon and of the effects rising from
the quarks transverse momentum are part of the scientific program of COMPASS, a
fixed target experiment at the CERN SPS. The azimuthal asymmetries which appear
in the cross-section of SIDIS off unpolarized targets can give insights on the
intrinsic momentum structure of the nucleon and on the possible correlation
between transverse spin and transverse momentum of the quarks. Here we present
the new results for these asymmetries obtained from the COMPASS data collected
with a 160 GeV/c positive muon beam impinging on a $^6LiD$ target. The
asymmetries are measured for both positive and negative hadrons, and their
dependence on several kinematical variable has been studied
