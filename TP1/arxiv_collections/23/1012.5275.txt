We show the in-plane/out-of-plane effect, in the two-particle correlation
function, computed with the NexSPheRIO code, in Au+Au collisions at 200AGeV. In
order to clarify the origin of the effect, a simplified model, which consists
of a peripheral high-energy-density tube in a smooth background with
longitudinal boost invariance, is applied.
