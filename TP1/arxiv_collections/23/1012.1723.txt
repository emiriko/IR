We discuss a simple architecture for a quantum Toffoli gate implemented using
three trapped ions. The gate, which in principle can be implemented with a
single laser-induced operation, is effective under rather general conditions
and is strikingly robust (within any experimentally realistic range of values)
against dephasing, heating and random fluctuations of the Hamiltonian
parameters. We provide a full characterization of the unitary and
noise-affected gate using three-qubit quantum process tomography.
