Neutrino oscillation experiments are known to be sensitive to Non-Standard
Interactions (NSIs). We extend the NSI formalism to include one-loop effects.
We discuss universal effects induced by corrections to the tree level W
exchange, as well as non-universal effects that can arise from scalar charged
current interactions. We show how the parameters that can be extracted from the
experiments are obtained from various loop amplitudes, which include vertex
corrections, wave function renormalizations, mass corrections as well as box
diagrams. As an illustrative example, we discuss NSIs at one loop in the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with generic lepton flavor
violating sources in the soft sector. We argue that the size of one-loop NSIs
can be large enough to be probed in future neutrino oscillation experiments.
