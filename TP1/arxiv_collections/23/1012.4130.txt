We develop a second order formalism for spin 1/2 fermions based on the
projection over Poincar\'{e} invariant subspaces in the $(1/2,0)\oplus(0,1/2)$
representation of the homogeneous Lorentz group. Using $U(1)_{em}$ gauge
principle we obtain second order description for the electromagnetic
interactions of a spin 1/2 fermion with two free parameters, the gyromagnetic
factor $g$ and a parameter $\xi$ related to odd-parity Lorentz structures. We
calculate Compton scattering in this formalism. In the particular case $g=2,
\xi=0$ and for states with well defined parity we recover Dirac results. In
general, we find the correct classical limit and a finite value $r_{c}^{2}$ for
the forward differential cross section, independent of the photon energy and of
the value of the parameters $g$ and $\xi$. The differential cross section
vanishes at high energies for all $g, \xi$ except in the forward direction. The
total cross section at high energies vanishes only for $g=2, \xi=0$. We argue
that this formalism is more convenient than Dirac theory in the description of
low energy electromagnetic properties of baryons and illustrate the point with
the proton case.
