The after-dinner talk has by now become a tradition of this Conference series
on Quark Confinement and the Hadron Spectrum. On this occasion, I have tried to
combine a free-style and (hopefully) amusing presentation with deep questions
of physics especially connected with the dynamics of strong interaction. To
this end some masterpieces of classical music (by Beethoven, Mozart, Dvorak,
Stravinsky ...) and pop music (by Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton) were employed to
illustrate certain aspects of physics. By no means was this presentation (nor
this paper) intended as a comprehensive review of the different topics examined
during the Conference, but rather a call for further thinking on the sinergy of
different branches of physics and the excitement of foreseen discoveries in a
not too distant future.
