We use a method recently introduced in Barcel\'o et al (2011 Phys. Rev. D 83
41501), to analyse Hawking radiation in a Schwarzschild black hole as perceived
by different observers in the system. The method is based on the introduction
of an 'effective temperature' function that varies with time. First we
introduce a non-stationary vacuum state for a quantum scalar field, which
interpolates between the Boulware vacuum state at early times and the Unruh
vacuum state at late times. In this way we mimic the process of switching on
Hawking radiation in realistic collapse scenarios. Then, we analyse this vacuum
state from the perspective of static observers at different radial positions,
observers undergoing a free-fall trajectory from infinity and observers
standing at rest at a radial distance and then released to fall freely towards
the horizon. The physical image that emerges from these analyses is rather rich
and compelling. Among many other results, we find that generic freely-falling
observers do not perceive vacuum when crossing the horizon, but an effective
temperature a few times larger than the one that they perceived when it started
to free-fall. We explain this phenomenon as due to a diverging Doppler effect
at horizon crossing.
