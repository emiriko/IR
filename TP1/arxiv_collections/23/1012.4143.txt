A novel type of photonic crystal formed by embedding a periodic array of
constituent stacks of alternating graphene and dielectric discs into a
background dielectric medium is proposed. The photonic band structure and
transmittance of such photonic crystal are calculated. The graphene-based
photonic crystals can be used effectively as the frequency filters and
waveguides for the far infrared region of electromagnetic spectrum. Due to
substantial suppression of absorption of low-frequency radiation in doped
graphene the damping and skin effect in the photonic crystal are also
suppressed. The advantages of the graphene-based photonic crystal are
discussed.
