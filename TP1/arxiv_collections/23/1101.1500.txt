We provide a generalized discussion of tidal evolution to arbitrary order in
the expansion of the gravitational potential between two spherical bodies of
any mass ratio. To accurately reproduce the tidal evolution of a system at
separations less than five times the radius of the larger primary component,
the tidal potential due to the presence of a smaller secondary component is
expanded in terms of Legendre polynomials to arbitrary order rather than
truncated at leading order as is typically done in studies of well-separated
system like the Earth and Moon. The equations of tidal evolution including
tidal torques, the changes in spin rates of the components, and the change in
semimajor axis (orbital separation) are then derived for binary asteroid
systems with circular and equatorial mutual orbits. Accounting for higher-order
terms in the tidal potential serves to speed up the tidal evolution of the
system leading to underestimates in the time rates of change of the spin rates,
semimajor axis, and mean motion in the mutual orbit if such corrections are
ignored. Special attention is given to the effect of close orbits on the
calculation of material properties of the components, in terms of the rigidity
and tidal dissipation function, based on the tidal evolution of the system. It
is found that accurate determinations of the physical parameters of the system,
e.g., densities, sizes, and current separation, are typically more important
than accounting for higher-order terms in the potential when calculating
material properties. In the scope of the long-term tidal evolution of the
semimajor axis and the component spin rates, correcting for close orbits is a
small effect, but for an instantaneous rate of change in spin rate, semimajor
axis, or mean motion, the close-orbit correction can be on the order of tens of
percent.
