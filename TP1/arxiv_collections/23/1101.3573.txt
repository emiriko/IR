We describe a new Godunov algorithm for relativistic magnetohydrodynamics
(RMHD) that combines a simple, unsplit second order accurate integrator with
the constrained transport (CT) method for enforcing the solenoidal constraint
on the magnetic field. A variety of approximate Riemann solvers are implemented
to compute the fluxes of the conserved variables. The methods are tested with a
comprehensive suite of multidimensional problems. These tests have helped us
develop a hierarchy of correction steps that are applied when the integration
algorithm predicts unphysical states due to errors in the fluxes, or errors in
the inversion between conserved and primitive variables. Although used
exceedingly rarely, these corrections dramatically improve the stability of the
algorithm. We present preliminary results from the application of these
algorithms to two problems in RMHD: the propagation of supersonic magnetized
jets, and the amplification of magnetic field by turbulence driven by the
relativistic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). Both of these applications
reveal important differences between the results computed with Riemann solvers
that adopt different approximations for the fluxes. For example, we show that
use of Riemann solvers which include both contact and rotational
discontinuities can increase the strength of the magnetic field within the
cocoon by a factor of ten in simulations of RMHD jets, and can increase the
spectral resolution of three-dimensional RMHD turbulence driven by the KHI by a
factor of 2. This increase in accuracy far outweighs the associated increase in
computational cost. Our RMHD scheme is publicly available as part of the Athena
code.
