Atom interferometers allow the measurement of the acceleration of freely
falling atoms with respect to an experimental platform at rest on Earth's
surface. Such experiments have been used to test the universality of free fall
by comparing the acceleration of the atoms to that of a classical freely
falling object. In a recent paper, M\"uller, Peters and Chu [Nature {\bf 463},
926-929 (2010)] argued that atom interferometers also provide a very accurate
test of the gravitational redshift when considering the atom as a clock
operating at the Compton frequency associated with the rest mass. We analyze
this claim in the frame of general relativity and of different alternative
theories. We show that the difference of "Compton phases" between the two paths
of the interferometer is actually zero in a large class of theories, including
general relativity, all metric theories of gravity, most non-metric theories
and most theoretical frameworks used to interpret the violations of the
equivalence principle. Therefore, in most plausible theoretical frameworks,
there is no redshift effect and atom interferometers only test the universality
of free fall. We also show that frameworks in which atom interferometers would
test the redshift pose serious problems, such as (i) violation of the Schiff
conjecture, (ii) violation of the Feynman path integral formulation of quantum
mechanics and of the principle of least action for matter waves, (iii)
violation of energy conservation, and more generally (iv) violation of the
particle-wave duality in quantum mechanics. Standard quantum mechanics is no
longer valid in such frameworks, so that a consistent interpretation of the
experiment would require an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics. As
such an alternative has not been proposed to date, we conclude that the
interpretation of atom interferometers as testing the gravitational redshift is
unsound.
