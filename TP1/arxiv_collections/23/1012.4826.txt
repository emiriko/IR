We construct a family of irreducible unitary representations of the loop
affine group of a line (ax+b group) with central extension on the Hilbert space
of square integrable functions with respect to the Wiener measure. We relate
the matrix coefficients of the elements of the loop ax+b group to the loop
analogue of the Gamma-function.
