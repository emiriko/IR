In this article we consider chirally enhanced corrections to Higgs vertices
in the most general MSSM. We include the contributions stemming from
bilinear-terms, from the trilinear A-terms and their non-holomorphic analogues,
the A'-terms, which couple squarks to the "wrong" Higgs field. We perform a
consistent renormalization of the Higgs vertices beyond the decoupling limit
M_SUSY->infinity, using a purely diagrammatic approach. The cancellation of the
different contributions in and beyond the decoupling limit is discussed and the
possible size of decoupling effects which occur if the SUSY particles are not
much heavier than the electroweak-scale are examined. In the decoupling limit
we recover the results obtained in the effective-field-theory approach. For the
non-holomorphic A'-terms we find the well known $\tan\beta$ enhancement in the
down-sector similar to the one for terms proportional to mu. Due to the a
priori generic flavor structure of these trilinear terms large flavour-changing
neutral Higgs couplings can be induced. We also discover new tan(beta) enhanced
contributions involving the usual holomorphic A-terms, which were not discussed
before in the literature. These corrections occur only if also flavor-diagonal
non-holomorphic corrections to the Higgs couplings are present. This reflects
the fact that the A-terms, and also the chirality-changing self-energies, are
physical quantities and cannot be absorbed into renormalization constants.
