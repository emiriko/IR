We consider a model for superconductivity in a two-band superconductor,
having an anisotropic electronic structure made of two partially overlapping
bands with a first hole-like and a second electron-like fermi surface. In this
pairing scenario, driven by the interplay between interband $V_{i,j}$ and
intraband $V_{i,i}$ pairing terms, we have solved the two gap equations at the
critical temperature $T = T_c$ and calculate $T_c$ and the chemical potential
$\mu$ as a function of the number of carriers $n$ for various values of pairing
interactions, $V_{1,1}$, $V_{2,2}$, and $V_{1,2}$. The results show the
complexity of the physics of condensates with multiple order parameters with
the chemical potential near band edges.
