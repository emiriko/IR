The main solutions in sense of Kantorovich of nonlinear Volterra
operator-integral equations are constructed. Convergence of the successive
approximations is established through studies of majorant integral and majorant
algebraic equations. Estimates are derived for the solutions and for the
intervals on the right margin of which the solution has blow-up or solution
start branching.
