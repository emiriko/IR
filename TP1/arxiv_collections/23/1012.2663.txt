The detection of gamma-ray emission by Fermi-LAT from the radio loud Narrow
Line Seyfert 1 PMN J0948+0022 (Abdo et al. 2009, ApJ 699, 976) triggered a
multi-wavelength campaign between March and July 2009. Given its high
compactness (Doi et al. 2006, PASJ 58, 829), inverted spectrum, and 0deg
declination, the source was an ideal target to observe at 22 GHz with a Global
VLBI array extending from Europe to East Asia and Australia. In order to
deliver prompt results to be analysed in combination with the other instruments
participating in the campaign, the observations were carried out with real time
VLBI, for the first time on a Global scale. Indeed, the main results have been
published just a few months after the campaign (Abdo et al. 2009, ApJ 707,
727). Here we present additional details about the e-VLBI observations.
