Phase-space procedure based on coherent state representation is proposed for
investigation of reflection and transmission of light beams at a curved
dielectric boundary. Numerical simulations of reflection and transmission of
light at various boundaries separating two different dielectrics are carried
out. Significant influence of wave-front curvature and polarization of incident
beam on the reflectance and transmittance is shown.
