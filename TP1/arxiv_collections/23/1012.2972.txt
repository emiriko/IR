We report on measurements of extremely high reflection rates of solar wind
particles from regolith-covered lunar surfaces. Measurements by the Sub-keV
Atom Reflecting Analyzer (SARA) instrument on the Indian Chandrayaan-1
spacecraft in orbit around the Moon show that up to 20% of the impinging solar
wind protons are reflected from the lunar surface back to space as neutral
hydrogen atoms. This finding, generally applicable to regolith-covered
atmosphereless bodies, invalidates the widely accepted assumption that regolith
almost completely absorbs the impinging solar wind.
