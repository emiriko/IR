One of the most promising probes to study deconfined matter created in high
energy nuclear collisions is the energy loss of (heavy) quarks. It has been
shown in experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) that even
charm and bottom quarks, despite their high mass, experience a remarkable
medium suppression in the Quark Gluon Plasma. In this exploratory investigation
we study the energy loss of heavy quarks in high multiplicity proton-proton
collisions at LHC energies. Although the colliding systems are smaller than
compared to those at RHIC (p+p vs. Au+Au) the higher energy might lead to
multiplicities comparable to Cu+Cu collisions at RHIC. Recently the CMS
collaboration has shown that these particles likely interact among each other.
The interaction of charm quarks with this environment gives rise to a
non-negligible suppression of high momentum heavy quarks in elementary
collisions.
