We place two atoms in quantum superposition states and observe coherent phase
evolution for 3.4x10^15 cycles. Correlation signals from the two atoms yield
information about their relative phase even after the probe radiation has
decohered. This technique was applied to a frequency comparison of two Al+
ions, where a fractional uncertainty of 3.7+1.0-0.8x10^-16/\sqrt{\tau/s} was
observed. Two measures of the Q-factor are reported: The Q-factor derived from
quantum coherence is 3.4+2.4-1.1x10^16, and the spectroscopic Q-factor for a
Ramsey time of 3 s is 6.7x10^15. As part of this experiment, we demonstrate a
method to detect the individual quantum states of two Al+ ions in a Mg+-Al+-Al+
linear ion chain without spatially resolving the ions.
