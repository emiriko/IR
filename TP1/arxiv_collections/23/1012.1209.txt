The dynamics of well-mixed biological populations is usually studied by
mean-field methods and weak-noise expansions. Similar methods have been applied
also in spatially extended problems, relying on the fact that these populations
are organized in colonies with a large local density of individuals. We provide
a counterexample discussing a one-dimensional neutral population with negative
frequency-dependent selection. The system exhibits a continuous phase
transition between genetic fixation and coexistence unexpected from weak-noise
arguments. We show that the behavior is a non-perturbative effect of the
internal noise that is amplified by presence of spatial correlations
(strong-noise regime).
