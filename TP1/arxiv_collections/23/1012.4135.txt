We prove a Theorem on homotheties between two given tangent sphere bundles
$S_rM$ of a Riemannian manifold $M,g$ of $\dim\geq 3$, assuming different
variable radius functions $r$ and weighted Sasaki metrics induced by the
conformal class of $g$. New examples are shown of manifolds with constant
positive or with constant negative scalar curvature, which are not Einstein.
Recalling results on the associated almost complex structure $I^G$ and
symplectic structure ${\omega}^G$ on the manifold $TM$, generalizing the
well-known structure of Sasaki by admitting weights and connections with
torsion, we compute the Chern and the Stiefel-Whitney characteristic classes of
the manifolds $TM$ and $S_rM$.
