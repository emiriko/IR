We obtain an asymptotically AdS, non-extremal, electrically charged and
rotating black hole solution of 4-dimensional U(1)^4 gauged supergravity with 2
non-zero and independent U(1) charges. The thermodynamical quantities are
computed. We find BPS solutions that are nakedly singular. The solution is
generalized to include a NUT parameter and dyonic gauge fields. The string
frame metric has a rank-2 Killing-Stackel tensor and has completely integrable
geodesic motion, and the massless Klein-Gordon equation separates for the
Einstein frame metric.
