We demonstrate a probe for nearest-neighbor correlations of fermionic quantum
gases in optical lattices. It gives access to spin and density configurations
of adjacent sites and relies on creating additional doubly occupied sites by
perturbative lattice modulation. The measured correlations for different
lattice temperatures are in good agreement with an ab initio calculation
without any fitting parameters. This probe opens new prospects for studying the
approach to magnetically ordered phases.
