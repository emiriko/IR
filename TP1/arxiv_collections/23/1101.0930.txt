Weak spontaneous magnetic fields are observed near the surface of YBCO films
using Beta-detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. Below Tc, the magnetic field
distribution in a silver film evaporated onto the superconductor shows
additional line broadening, indicating the appearance of small disordered
magnetic fields. The line broadening increases linearly with a weak external
magnetic field applied parallel to the surface, and is depth-independent up to
45 nm from the Ag/YBCO interface. The magnitude of the line broadening at 10 K
extrapolated to zero applied field is less than 0.2 G, and is close to nuclear
dipolar broadening in the Ag. This indicates that any fields due to broken
time-reversal symmetry are less than 0.2 G.
