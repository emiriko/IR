In over two years of operation Fermi-LAT has revolutionized our knowledge of
the gamma-ray sky. Interstellar gamma rays are part of this new era and allow
unprecedented tests for models of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. The extension to
lower energies with INTEGRAL/SPI data is also evolving. The global
multiwavelength luminosity of the Milky Way has been derived, with implications
for the Galactic energy balance and the radio-FIR correlation.
