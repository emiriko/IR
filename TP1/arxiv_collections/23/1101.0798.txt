We present an oracle problem, which we call the Repeated Randomness problem,
that a quantum algorithm can solve in one query, while any classical algorithm
requires $\Omega(\log n)$ queries, where the oracle function has $2^n$ inputs.
This problem has connections to the parity problem introduced by Bernstein and
Vazirani \cite{Bernstein1993} and to a variation of the NAND tree described by
Zhan et al \cite{Zhan}.
