The polytropic gas model is investigated as an interacting dark energy
scenario. The cosmological implications of the model including the evolution of
EoS parameter $w_{\Lambda}$, energy density $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ and deceleration
parameter $q$ are investigated. We show that, depending on the parameter of
model, the interacting polytropic gas can behave as a quintessence or phantom
dark energy. In this model, the phantom divide is crossed from below to up. The
evolution of $q$ in the context of polytropic gas dark energy model represents
the decelerated phase at the early time and accelerated phase later. The
singularity of this model is also discussed. Eventually, we establish the
correspondence between interacting polytropic gas model with tachyon, K-essence
and dilaton scalar fields. The potential and the dynamics of these scalar field
models are reconstructed according to the evolution of interacting polytropic
gas.
