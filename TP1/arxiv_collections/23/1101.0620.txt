We present the first spectroscopic images of solar radio transients from the
prototype for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), observed on 2010 March 27.
Our observations span the instantaneous frequency band 170.9-201.6 MHz. Though
our observing period is characterized as a period of `low' to `medium'
activity, one broadband emission feature and numerous short-lived, narrowband,
non-thermal emission features are evident. Our data represent a significant
advance in low radio frequency solar imaging, enabling us to follow the
spatial, spectral, and temporal evolution of events simultaneously and in
unprecedented detail. The rich variety of features seen here reaffirms the
coronal diagnostic capability of low radio frequency emission and provides an
early glimpse of the nature of radio observations that will become available as
the next generation of low frequency radio interferometers come on-line over
the next few years.
