We investigated the relative stability of the amorphous vs crystalline
nanoparticles of size ranging between 0.8 and 1.8 nm. We found that, at
variance from bulk systems, at low T small nanoparticles are amorphous and they
undergo to an amorphous-to-crystalline phase transition at high T. On the
contrary, large nanoparticles recover the bulk-like behavior: crystalline at
low T and amorphous at high T. We also investigated the structure of
crystalline nanoparticles, providing evidence that they are formed by an
ordered core surrounded by a disordered periphery. Furthermore, we also provide
evidence that the details of the structure of the crystalline core depend on
the size of the nanoparticle
