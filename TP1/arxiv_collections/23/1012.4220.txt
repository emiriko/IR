We demonstrate that counterflowing electrical currents can move through the
bulk of the excitonic quantized Hall phase found in bilayer two-dimensional
electron systems (2DES) even as charged excitations cannot. These
counterflowing currents are transported by neutral excitons which are emitted
and absorbed at the inner and outer boundaries of an annular 2DES sample via an
Andreev reflection process.
