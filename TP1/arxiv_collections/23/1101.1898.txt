We study the $\bG_a^M$ degenerations $\Fl^a_\la$ of the type $A$ flag
varieties $\Fl_\la$. We describe these degenerations explicitly as subvarieties
in the products of Grassmanians. We construct cell decompositions of
$\Fl^a_\la$ and show that for complete flags the number of cells is equal to
the normalized median Genocchi numbers $h_n$. This leads to a new combinatorial
definition of the numbers $h_n$. We also compute the Poincar\' e polynomials of
the complete degenerate flag varieties via a natural statistics on the set of
Dellac's configurations, similar to the length statistics on the set of
permutations. We thus obtain a natural $q$-version of the normalized median
Genocchi numbers.
