Chaotic micromixers such as the staggered herringbone mixer developed by
Stroock et al. allow efficient mixing of fluids even at low Reynolds number by
repeated stretching and folding of the fluid interfaces. The ability of the
fluid to mix well depends on the rate at which "chaotic advection" occurs in
the mixer. An optimization of mixer geometries is a non trivial task which is
often performed by time consuming and expensive trial and error experiments. In
this paper an algorithm is presented that applies the concept of finite-time
Lyapunov exponents to obtain a quantitative measure of the chaotic advection of
the flow and hence the performance of micromixers. By performing lattice
Boltzmann simulations of the flow inside a mixer geometry, introducing massless
and non-interacting tracer particles and following their trajectories the
finite time Lyapunov exponents can be calculated. The applicability of the
method is demonstrated by a comparison of the improved geometrical structure of
the staggered herringbone mixer with available literature data.
