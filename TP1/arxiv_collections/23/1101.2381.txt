The measurement of the identified charged hadron p_t spectra using the ITS
energy loss signal in the p-p data at sqrt{s}=900 GeV collected by the ALICE
experiment at LHC will be discussed. It is performed using the Inner Tracking
System (ITS) in stand-alone mode, both for track reconstruction and particle
identification, allowing one to detect low momentum particles with p_t below
200 MeV/c. A second method using the tracks reconstructed by both the ITS and
the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) has also been developed. The obtained results
will be compared with the ones obtained from the TPC and from the Time Of
Flight detector and used to extract the mean p_t value.
