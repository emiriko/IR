We report on the study of the structural, magnetic and transport properties
of highly textured MnBi films with the Curie temperature of 628K. In addition
to detailed measurements of resistivity and magnetization, we measure transport
spin polarization of MnBi by Andreev reflection spectroscopy and perform fully
relativistic band structure calculations of MnBi. A spin polarization from
51\pm1 to 63\pm1% is observed, consistent with the calculations and with an
observation of a large magnetoresistance in MnBi contacts. The band structure
calculations indicate that, in spite of almost identical densities of states at
the Fermi energy, the large disparity in the Fermi velocities leads to high
transport spin polarization of MnBi. The correlation between the values of
magnetization and spin polarization is discussed.
