We have considered a model of two component mixture i.e., mixture of
Chaplygin gas and barotropic fluid with tachyonic field. In the case, when they
have no interaction then both of them retain their own properties. Let us
consider an energy flow between barotropic and tachyonic fluids. In both the
cases we find the exact solutions for the tachyonic field and the tachyonic
potential and show that the tachyonic potential follows the asymptotic
behavior. We have considered an interaction between these two fluids by
introducing a coupling term. Finally, we have considered a model of three
component mixture i.e., mixture of tachyonic field, Chaplygin gas and
barotropic fluid with or without interaction. The coupling functions decays
with time indicating a strong energy flow at the initial period and weak stable
interaction at later stage. To keep the observational support of recent
acceleration we have considered two particular forms (i) Logamediate Scenario
and (ii) Intermediate Scenario, of evolution of the Universe. We have examined
the natures of the recent developed statefinder parameters and slow-roll
parameters in both scenarios with and without interactions in whole evolution
of the universe.
