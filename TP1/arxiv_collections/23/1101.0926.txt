We investigate the velocity statistics by calculating the Biot--Savart
velocity induced by vortex filaments in steady counterflow turbulence
investigated in a previous study [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 81}, 104511 (2010)]. The
probability density function (PDF) obeys a Gaussian distribution in the
low-velocity region and a power-law distribution $v^{-3}$ in the high-velocity
region. This transition between the two distributions occur at the velocity
characterized by the mean inter-vortex distance. Counterflow turbulence causes
anisotropy of the vortex tangle, which leads to a difference in the PDF for the
velocities perpendicular to and parallel to the counterflow.
