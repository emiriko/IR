The von Neumann evolution equation for density matrix and the Moyal equation
for the Wigner function are mapped onto evolution equation for optical tomogram
of quantum state. The connection with known evolution equation for symplectic
tomogram of the quantum state is clarified. The stationary states corresponding
to quantum energy levels are associated with the probability representation of
the von Neumann and Moyal equations written for the optical tomograms.
Classical Liouville equation for optical tomogram is obtained. Example of
parametric oscillator is considered in detail.
