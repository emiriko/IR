We present results from further tests of Microstrip Gas Counters (MSGCs) with
resistive electrodes. The maim advantage of this detector is that it is
spark-protected: in contrast to "classical" MSGCs with metallic electrodes,
sparks in this new detector do not destroy its electrodes. As a consequence the
MSGC with resistive electrodes is more reliable in operation which may open new
avenues in applications. One of them which is under investigation now is the
use of Resistive electrodes MSGC (R-MSGC) as photodetector in some particular
designs of noble liquid dark matter detectors.
