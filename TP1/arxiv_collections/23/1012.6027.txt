We use the long-wavelength formalism to compute the bispectral
non-Gaussianity produced in two-field inflation. We find an exact result that
is used as the basis of numerical studies, and an explicit analytical slow-roll
expression for several classes of potentials that gives insight into the origin
and importance of the various contributions to fNL. We also discuss the
momentum dependence of fNL. Based on these results we find a simple model that
produces a relatively large non-Gaussianity. We show that the long-wavelength
formalism is a viable alternative to the standard delta-N formalism, and can be
preferable to it in certain situations.
