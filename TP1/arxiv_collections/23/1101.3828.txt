We present our theoretical results on the ground states in layered
triangular-lattice compounds ANiO2 (A=Na, Li, Ag). To describe the interplay
between charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom in these
materials, we study a doubly-degenerate Hubbard model with electron-phonon
couplings by the Hartree-Fock approximation combined with the adiabatic
approximation. In a weakly-correlated region, we find a metallic state
accompanied by \sqroot3x\sqroot3 charge ordering. On the other hand, we obtain
an insulating phase with spin-ferro and orbital-ferro ordering in a wide range
from intermediate to strong correlation. These phases share many
characteristics with the low-temperature states of AgNiO2 and NaNiO2,
respectively. The charge-ordered metallic phase is stabilized by a compromise
between Coulomb repulsions and effective attractive interactions originating
from the breathing-type electronphonon coupling as well as the Hund's-rule
coupling. The spin-orbital-ordered insulating phase is stabilized by the
cooperative effect of electron correlations and the Jahn-Teller coupling, while
the Hund's-rule coupling also plays a role in the competition with other
orbital-ordered phases. The results suggest a unified way of understanding a
variety of low-temperature phases in ANiO2. We also discuss a keen competition
among different spin-orbital-ordered phases in relation to a puzzling behavior
observed in LiNiO2.
