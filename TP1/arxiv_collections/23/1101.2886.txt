Controlling interactions between cold molecules using external fields can
elucidate the role of quantum mechanics in molecular collisions. We create a
new experimental platform in which ultracold rubidium atoms and cold ammonia
molecules are separately trapped by magnetic and electric fields and then
combined to study collisions. We observe inelastic processes that are faster
than expected from earlier field-free calculations. We use quantum scattering
calculations to show that electric fields can have a major effect on collision
outcomes, even in the absence of dipole-dipole interactions.
