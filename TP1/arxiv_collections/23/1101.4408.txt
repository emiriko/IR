We investigate the dynamics of many interacting bubbles in boiling water by
using a laser scattering experiment. Specifically, we analyze the temporal
variations of a laser intensity signal which passed through a sample of boiling
water. Our empirical results indicate that the return interval distribution of
the laser signal does not follow an exponential distribution; contrariwise, a
heavy-tailed distribution has been found. Additionally, we compare the
experimental results with those obtained from a minimalist phenomenological
model, finding a good agreement.
