The superstatistics concept is a useful statistical method to describe
inhomogeneous complex systems for which a system parameter $\beta$ fluctuates
on a large spatio-temporal scale. In this paper we analyze a measured time
series of wind speed fluctuations and extract the superstatistical distribution
function $f(\beta)$ directly from the data. We construct suitable Langevin and
Fokker-Planck models with a position dependent $\beta$-field and show that they
reduce to standard type of superstatistics in the overdamped limit.
