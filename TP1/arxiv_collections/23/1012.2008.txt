It is argued that a superconducting instability appears in the electronic
states on the surface of a topological insulator due purely to electromagnetic
interactions. The discussion of this instability is based on the analysis of
the effective Coulomb interaction and the assumption that the system behaves
like a two dimensional Fermi liquid. It is shown that this superconducting
instability appears in the p-wave channel (like in the pure QED$_{3}$ case) and
an expression for the critical temperature of the transition is provided.
