We derive an effective Hamiltonian for the one-dimensional Hubbard-Holstein
model, valid in a regime of both strong electron-electron (e-e) and
electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions and in the non-adiabatic limit ($t/\omega_0
\leq 1$), by using a non-perturbative approach. We obtain the phase diagram at
quarter-filling by employing a modified Lanczos method and studying various
density-density correlations. The spin-spin AF (antiferromagnetic) interactions
and nearest-neighbor repulsion, resulting from the e-e and the e-ph
interactions respectively, are the dominant terms (compared to hopping) and
compete to determine the various correlated phases. As e-e interaction $(U/t)$
is increased, the system transits from an AF cluster to a correlated singlet
phase through a discontinuous transition at all strong e-ph couplings $2 \leq g
\leq 3$ considered. At higher values of $U/t$ and moderately strong e-ph
interactions ($2 \leq g \leq 2.6$), the singlets break up to form an AF order
and then to a paramagnetic order all in a single sublattice; whereas at larger
values of $g$ ($> 2.6$), the system jumps directly to the spin disordered
charge-density-wave (CDW) phase.
