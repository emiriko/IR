We examine the constraints on the luminosity-dependent density evolution
model for the evolution of blazars given the observed spectrum of the diffuse
gamma-ray background (DGRB), blazar source-count distribution, and the blazar
spectral energy distribution sequence model, which relates the observed the
blazar spectrum to its luminosity. We show that the DGRB observed by the Large
Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope can be produced
entirely by gamma-ray emission from blazars and nonblazar active galactic
nuclei, and that our blazar evolution model is consistent with and constrained
by the spectrum of the DGRB and flux source-count distribution function of
blazars observed by Fermi-LAT. Our results are consistent with previous work
that used EGRET spectral data to forecast the Fermi-LAT DGRB. The model
includes only three free parameters, and forecasts that >~ 95% of the flux from
blazars will be resolved into point sources by Fermi-LAT with 5 years of
observation, with a corresponding reduction of the flux in the DGRB by a factor
of ~2 to 3 (95% confidence level), which has implications for the Fermi-LAT's
sensitivity to dark matter annihilation photons.
