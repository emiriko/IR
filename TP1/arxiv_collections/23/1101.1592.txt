This investigation employs a square lattice and Glauber dynamics methodology
to probe the effects of diluteness in the crystal-field interaction in a
Blume-Capel Ising system under an oscillating magnetic-field. Fourteen
different phase diagrams have been observed in temperature-magnetic-field space
as the concentration of the crystal-field interactions is varied. Besides, a
comparison is given with the results of the pure spin-1 Ising systems.
