We compute the lattice spacing corrections to the spectral density of the
Hermitean Wilson Dirac operator using Wilson Chiral Perturbation Theory at NLO.
We consider a regime where the quark mass $m$ and the lattice spacing $a$ obey
the relative power counting $m\sim a \Lambda_{\rm QCD}^2$: in this situation
discretisation effects can be treated as perturbation of the continuum
behaviour. While this framework fails to describe lattice spectral density
close to the threshold, it allows nevertheless to investigate important
properties of the spectrum of the Wilson Dirac operator. We discuss the range
of validity of our results and the possible implications in understanding the
phase diagram of Wilson fermions.
