Using data from the B factories and the Tevatron, we perform tests of how
well non-leptonic B decays of the kind B -> D^{(*)}_{(s)} P, where P is a pion
or kaon, are described within the factorization framework. We find that
factorization works well - as is theoretically expected - for color-allowed,
tree-diagram-like topologies. Moreover, also exchange topologies, which have a
non-factorizable character, do not show any anomalous behavior. We discuss also
isospin triangles between the B -> D^{(*)} pi decay amplitudes, and determine
the corresponding amplitudes in the complex plane, which show a significant
enhancement of the color-suppressed tree contribution with respect to the
factorization picture. Using data for B -> D^{(*)} K decays, we determine
SU(3)-breaking effects and cannot resolve any non-factorizable SU(3)-breaking
corrections larger than \sim 5%. In view of these results, we point out that a
comparison between the \bar B^0_d -> D^+\pi^- and \bar B^0_s -> D_s^+\pi^-
decays offers an interesting new determination of f_d/f_s. Using CDF data, we
obtain the most precise value of this ratio at CDF, and discuss the prospects
for a corresponding measurement at LHCb.
