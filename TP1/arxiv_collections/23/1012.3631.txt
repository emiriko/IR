Although photometric and spectroscopic surveys with the Spitzer Space
Telescope increased remarkably the number of well studied debris disks around
A-type and Sun-like stars, detailed analyzes of debris disks around F-type
stars remained less frequent. Using the MIPS camera and the IRS spectrograph we
searched for debris dust around 82 F-type stars with Spitzer. We found 27 stars
that harbor debris disks, nine of which are new discoveries. The dust
distribution around two of our stars, HD 50571 and HD 170773, was found to be
marginally extended on the 70um MIPS images. Combining the MIPS and IRS
measurements with additional infrared and submillimeter data, we achieved
excellent spectral coverage for most of our debris systems. We have modeled the
excess emission of 22 debris disks using a single temperature dust ring model
and of 5 debris systems with two-temperature models. The latter systems may
contain two dust rings around the star. In accordance with the expected trends,
the fractional luminosity of the disks declines with time, exhibiting a decay
rate consistent with the range of model predictions. We found the distribution
of radial dust distances as a function of age to be consistent with the
predictions of both the self stirred and the planetary stirred disk evolution
models. A more comprehensive investigation of the evolution of debris disks
around F-type stars, partly based on the presented data set, will be the
subject of an upcoming paper.
