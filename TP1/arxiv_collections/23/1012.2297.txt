It has been suggested that coronal mass ejections (CMEs) remove the magnetic
helicity of their coronal source region from the Sun. Such removal is often
regarded to be necessary due to the hemispheric sign preference of the
helicity, which inhibits a simple annihilation by reconnection between volumes
of opposite chirality. Here we monitor the relative magnetic helicity contained
in the coronal volume of a simulated flux rope CME, as well as the upward flux
of relative helicity through horizontal planes in the simulation box. The
unstable and erupting flux rope carries away only a minor part of the initial
relative helicity; the major part remains in the volume. This is a consequence
of the requirement that the current through an expanding loop must decrease if
the magnetic energy of the configuration is to decrease as the loop rises, to
provide the kinetic energy of the CME.
