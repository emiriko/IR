To every Gorenstein algebra $A$ of finite dimension greater than 1 over a
field ${\Bbb F}$ of characteristic zero, and a projection $\pi$ on its maximal
ideal ${\mathfrak m}$ with range equal to the annihilator
$\hbox{Ann}({\mathfrak m})$ of ${\mathfrak m}$, one can associate a certain
algebraic hypersurface $S_{\pi}\subset{\mathfrak m}$. Such hypersurfaces
possess remarkable properties. They can be used, for instance, to help decide
whether two given Gorenstein algebras are isomorphic, which for ${\Bbb F}={\Bbb
C}$ leads to interesting consequences in singularity theory. Also, for ${\Bbb
F}={\Bbb R}$ such hypersurfaces naturally arise in CR-geometry. Applications of
these hypersurfaces to problems in algebra and geometry are particularly
striking when the hypersurfaces are affine homogeneous. In the present paper we
establish a criterion for the affine homogeneity of $S_{\pi}$. This condition
requires the automorphism group $\hbox{Aut}({\mathfrak m})$ of ${\mathfrak m}$
to act transitively on the set of hyperplanes in ${\mathfrak m}$ complementary
to $\hbox{Ann}({\mathfrak m})$. As a consequence of this result we obtain the
affine homogeneity of $S_{\pi}$ under the assumption that the algebra $A$ is
graded.
