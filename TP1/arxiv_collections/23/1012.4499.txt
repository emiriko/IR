We study the phase diagram of an SU(3)-symmetric mixture of three-component
ultracold fermions with attractive interactions in an optical lattice,
including the additional effect on the mixture of an effective three-body
constraint induced by three-body losses. We address the properties of the
system in $D \geq 2$ by using dynamical mean-field theory and variational Monte
Carlo techniques. The phase diagram of the model shows a strong interplay
between magnetism and superfluidity. In the absence of the three-body
constraint (no losses), the system undergoes a phase transition from a color
superfluid phase to a trionic phase, which shows additional particle density
modulations at half-filling. Away from the particle-hole symmetric point the
color superfluid phase is always spontaneously magnetized, leading to the
formation of different color superfluid domains in systems where the total
number of particles of each species is conserved. This can be seen as the SU(3)
symmetric realization of a more general tendency to phase-separation in
three-component Fermi mixtures. The three-body constraint strongly disfavors
the trionic phase, stabilizing a (fully magnetized) color superfluid also at
strong coupling. With increasing temperature we observe a transition to a
non-magnetized SU(3) Fermi liquid phase.
