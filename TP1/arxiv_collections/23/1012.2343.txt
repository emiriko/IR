We extend the results of a previous analysis of ours showing that, when both
heavy and light flavour effects are taken into account, successful minimal
(type I + thermal) leptogenesis with SO(10)-inspired relations is possible.
Barring fine tuned choices of the parameters, these relations enforce a
hierarchical RH neutrino mass spectrum that results into a final asymmetry
dominantly produced by the next-to-lightest RH neutrino decays (N_2 dominated
leptogenesis). We present the constraints on the whole set of low energy
neutrino parameters. Allowing a small misalignment between the Dirac basis and
the charged lepton basis as in the quark sector, the allowed regions enlarge
and the lower bound on the reheating temperature gets relaxed to values as low
as ~ 10^10 GeV. It is confirmed that for normal ordering (NO) there are two
allowed ranges of values for the lightest neutrino mass: m_1 \simeq (1-5)\times
10^-3 eV and m_1\simeq (0.03-0.1) eV. For m_1\lesssim 0.01 eV the allowed
region in the plane theta_13-theta_23 is approximately bounded by 44 +
3(theta_13-9) \lesssim theta_23 \lesssim 48 + 0.4 (theta_13-5), while the
neutrinoless double beta decay effective neutrino mass falls in the range
m_ee=(1-3)10^-3 eV for theta_13=(6 -11.5). For m_1 \gtrsim 0.01 eV, one has
quite sharply m_ee\simeq m_1 and an upper bound theta_23 \lesssim 46 . These
constraints will be tested by low energy neutrino experiments during next
years. We also find that inverted ordering (IO), though quite strongly
constrained, is not completely ruled out. In particular, we find approximately
theta_23 \simeq 43 +12 log(0.2 eV/m_1), that will be fully tested by future
experiments.
