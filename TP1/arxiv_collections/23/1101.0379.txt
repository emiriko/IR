While dealing with a class of generalized Bargmann spaces, we rederive their
reproducing kernels from the knowledge of an orthonormal basis by using an
addition formula for Laguerre polynomials involving the disk polynomials. We
construct for each of these spaces a set of coherent states to apply a coherent
states quantization method. This provides us with another way to recover the
Berezin transforms attached to these spaces. Finally, two new formulae
representing these transforms as functions of the Euclidean Laplacian are
established and a possible physics direction for the application of such
formulae is discussed.
