Typically, the exact ground state energy of integrable models at finite
volume can be computed using two main methods: the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz
approach and the lattice discretization technique. For quantum sigma models
(with non-ultra local Poisson structures) the bridge between these two
approaches has only been done through numerical methods. We briefly review
these two techniques on the example of the SU(2) principal chiral field model
and derive a single integral equation based on the Faddeev-Reshetikhin
discretization of the model. We show that this integral equation is equivalent
to the single integral equation of Gromov, Kazakov and Vieira derived from the
TBA approach.
