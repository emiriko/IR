LHCf is an experiment dedicated to the measurement of neutral particles
emitted in the very forward region of LHC collisions. The physics goal is to
provide data for calibrating hadron interaction models that are used in the
study of Extremely High-Energy Cosmic-Rays. The LHCf experiment acquired data
from April to July 2010 during commissioning time of LHC operations at low
luminosity. Production spectra of photons and neutrons emitted in the very
forward region ($\eta>$ 8.4) have been obtained. In this paper preliminary
results of the photon spectra taken at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7TeV are reported.
