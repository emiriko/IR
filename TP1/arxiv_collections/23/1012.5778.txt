An alternative model of the fragmentation of the Lund string, investigating
the hypothesis of helix-like ordered gluon field, is compared with hadronic
$Z^0$ data. A significant improvement in the description of various measured
quantities is achieved. In particular, the existence of correlations between
longitudinal and transverse components of hadron momenta (as suggested by the
helix string model) seems to be supported by the data.
