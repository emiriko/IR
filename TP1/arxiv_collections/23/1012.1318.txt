The long-lived stau scenario is an interesting possibility at the LHC. We
study squark mass measurements in this scenario; in particular, we show that
left- and right-handed squark masses are both measurable. In SUSY events,
multiple jets are expected, which become a source of combinatorial backgrounds.
In order to reduce such backgrounds a hemisphere analysis is applied, and we
discuss mass measurements of squarks in decay modes of left-handed squark into
quark + (neutral / charged) Wino and also right-handed squark into quark +
Bino.
