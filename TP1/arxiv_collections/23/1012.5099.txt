We discuss a new class of low energy supersymmetric models in which the Higgs
sector includes a single doublet, for example H_u, but not H_d. Chiral gauge
anomalies are canceled against new electroweak-charged states. We discuss the
main challenges in building such models, and present several models where these
issues are addressed. The resulting phenomenology can be distinguished from
that of the MSSM in a number of ways, most notably in physics related to
down-type quarks and charged leptons. As a first step toward a chiral Higgs
sector, we discuss the scenario of an inert H_d doublet. We show that a UV
completion of such model naturally includes dark matter with novel, flavorful
couplings to SM quarks.
