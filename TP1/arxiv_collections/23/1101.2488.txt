In this review, we discuss inflation models based on supergravity. After
explaining the difficulties in realizing inflation in the context of
supergravity, we show how to evade such difficulties. Depending on types of
inflation, we give concrete examples, particularly paying attention to chaotic
inflation because the ongoing experiments like Planck might detect the tensor
perturbations in near future. We also discuss inflation models in Jordan frame
supergravity, motivated by Higgs inflation.
