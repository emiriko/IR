The rectification of noise into directed movement or useful energy is
utilized by many different systems. The peculiar nature of the energy source
and conceptual differences between such Brownian motor systems makes a
characterization of the performance far from straightforward. In this work,
where the Brownian motor consists of atoms interacting with dissipative optical
lattices, we adopt existing theory and present experimental measurements for
both the efficiency and the transport coherence. We achieve up to 0.3% for the
efficiency and 0.01 for the P\'eclet number.
