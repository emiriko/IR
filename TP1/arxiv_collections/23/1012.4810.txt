Durda et al. (2004), using numerical models, suggested that binary asteroids
with large separation, called Escaping Ejecta Binaries (EEBs), can be created
by fragments ejected from a disruptive impact event. It is thought that six
binary asteroids recently discovered might be EEBs because of the high
separation between their components (~100 > a/Rp > ~20). However, the rotation
periods of four out of the six objects measured by our group and others and
presented here show that these suspected EEBs have fast rotation rates of 2.5
to 4 hours. Because of the small size of the components of these binary
asteroids, linked with this fast spinning, we conclude that the
rotational-fission mechanism, which is a result of the thermal YORP effect, is
the most likely formation scenario. Moreover, scaling the YORP effect for these
objects shows that its timescale is shorter than the estimated ages of the
three relevant Hirayama families hosting these binary asteroids. Therefore,
only the largest (D~19 km) suspected asteroid, (317) Roxane, could be, in fact,
the only known EEB. In addition, our results confirm the triple nature of
(3749) Balam by measuring mutual events on its lightcurve that match the
orbital period of a nearby satellite in addition to its distant companion.
Measurements of (1509) Esclangona at different apparitions show a unique shape
of the lightcurve that might be explained by color variations.
