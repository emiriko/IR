A specific class of flat Emergent Universe (EU) is considered and its
viability is tested in view of the recent observations. Model parameters are
constrained from Stern data for Hubble Parameter and Redshift ($H(z)$ vs. $z$)
and from a model independent measurement of BAO peak parameter. It is noted
that a composition of Exotic matter, dust and dark energy, capable of producing
an EU, can not be ruled out with present data. Evolution of other relevant
cosmological parameters, viz. density parameter ($\Omega$), effective equation
of state (EOS) parameter ($\omega_{eff}$) are also shown.
