We propose a new subtraction scheme for next-to-leading order QCD
calculations. Our scheme is based on the momentum mapping and on the splitting
functions derived in the context of an improved parton shower formulation.
Compared to standard schemes, the new scheme features a significantly smaller
number of subtraction terms and facilitates the matching of NLO calculations
with parton showers including quantum interference. We provide formulae for the
momentum mapping and the subtraction terms, and present a detailed comparison
with the Catani-Seymour dipole subtraction for a variety of 2 -> 2 scattering
processes.
