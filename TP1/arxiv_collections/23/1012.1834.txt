We study the impact of minimal non-supersymmetric models of resonant
leptogenesis on charged lepton flavour violation and the neutrino mixing angle
theta(13). Possible low-scale flavour realisations of resonant tau-, mu- and
e-leptogenesis provide very distinct and predictive frameworks to explain the
observed baryon asymmetry in the Universe by sphaleron conversion of an
individual tau-, mu- and e-lepton-number asymmetry which gets resonantly
enhanced via out-of-equilibrium decays of nearly degenerate heavy Majorana
neutrinos. Based on approximate flavour symmetries, we construct viable
scenarios of resonant tau-, mu- and e-leptogenesis compatible with universal
right-handed neutrino masses at the GUT scale, where the required
heavy-neutrino mass splittings are generated radiatively. The heavy Majorana
neutrinos in such scenarios can be as light as 100 GeV and their couplings to
two of the charged leptons may be large. In particular, we explicitly
demonstrate the compelling role that the three heavy Majorana neutrinos play,
in order to obtain successful leptogenesis and experimentally testable rates
for lepton flavour violating processes, such as mu --> e gamma and mu --> e
conversion in nuclei.
