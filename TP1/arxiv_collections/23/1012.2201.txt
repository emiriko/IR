We consider a Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) constrained by the condition
that assures cancellation of quadratic divergences up to the leading two-loop
order. Regions in the parameter space consistent with existing experimental
constraints and with the cancellation condition are determined. The possibility
for CP violation in the scalar potential is discussed and regions of
\tan_\beta-M_{H^\pm} with substantial amount of CP violation are found. The
model allows to ameliorate the little hierarchy problem by lifting the minimal
scalar Higgs boson mass and by suppressing the quadratic corrections to scalar
masses. The cutoff originating from the naturality arguments is therefore
lifted from ~0.6 TeV in the Standard Model to ~2.5 TeV in the 2HDM, depending
on the mass of the lightest scalar.
