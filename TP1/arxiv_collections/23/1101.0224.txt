A new prototype of large area Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chamber (MRPC) with
long readout strips was built. This Long-strip Multi-gap Resistive Plate
Chamber (LMRPC) is double stacked and has ten 250 $\mu$m-thick gas gaps.
Signals are read out from two ends of strip with an active area of 50
cm$\times$2.5 cm in each. The detector was tested at FOPI in GSI, using the
secondary particles of proton beams ($E = 3.5 GeV$) colliding with a Pb target.
The results show that the LMRPC prototype has a time resolution of about
60$\sim$70 ps; the detecting efficiency is over 98% and the ratio of cross-talk
is lower than 2%. The detector also has a good spatial resolution of 0.36 cm
along the strip direction.
