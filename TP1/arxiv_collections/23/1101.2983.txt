In this short paper, it is shown that the multiplet structure of the standard
genetic code is derivable from the total number of nucleotides contained in 64
codons, 192, a small number. The degeneracy class-number is derived as the
number of numbers coprime to the number of Family-Boxes involved for the
quartets, the doublets and the singlets. Those for the triplet and the sextets
are computed as simple linear combinations of the preceeding ones. Some
interesting consequences are also presented.
