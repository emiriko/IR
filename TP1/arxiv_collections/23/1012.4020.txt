We derive a generalised form of flow equations for extremal static and
rotating non-BPS black holes in four-dimensional ungauged N = 2 supergravity
coupled to vector multiplets. For particular charge vectors, we give
stabilisation equations for the scalars, analogous to the BPS case, describing
full known solutions. Based on this, we propose a generic ansatz for the
stabilisation equations, which surprisingly includes ratios of harmonic
functions.
