Observations on comet C/2007 N3 (Lulin) were made at phase angles close to
opposition ($1.7^{\circ}$ - $10^{\circ}$). Photometric observations were
carried out during 2009 February 24-28, in the IHW blue and red continuum and
$R$ broad band using photo-polarimeter mounted on the 1.2m telescope at Mt Abu
IR Observatory. In all the bands, a significant linear increase in brightness
with decreasing phase angle is detected for the above phase angle range. The
phase coefficient ($\beta = 0.040\pm 0.001$ mag deg$^{-1}$ estimated in IHW red
(6840\AA) filter band) is found to be independent of wavelength. No non-linear
opposition surge is observed for phase angle $>1.7^{\circ}$. The linear
increase in brightness with decreasing phase angle in the range mentioned
earlier can be explained using the shadow hiding model. The colour of the comet
is found to be similar to the solar colour indicating the dominance of grains
larger than $0.1\mu m$. A dip in the brightness of about 0.20 mag is seen at
the phase angle $\sim 6.5^\circ$.
