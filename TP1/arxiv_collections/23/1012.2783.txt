Invisibility cloaks of light, which used to be confined to the imagination,
have now been turned into a scientific reality, thanks to the enabling
theoretical tools of transformation optics and conformal mapping. Inspired by
those theoretical works, the experimental realisation of electromagnetic
invisibility cloaks has been reported at various electromagnetic frequencies.
All the invisibility cloaks demonstrated thus far, however, have relied on
nano- or micro-fabricated artificial composite materials with spatially varying
electromagnetic properties, which limit the size of the cloaked region to a few
wavelengths. Here we report realisation of a macroscopic volumetric
invisibility cloak constructed from natural birefringent crystals. The cloak
operates at visible frequencies and is capable of hiding three-dimensional
objects of the scale of centimetres and millimetres. Our work opens avenues for
future applications with macroscopic cloaking devices.
