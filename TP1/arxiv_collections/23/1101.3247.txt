We present exact calculations of Potts model partition functions and the
equivalent Tutte polynomials for polygon chain graphs with open and cyclic
boundary conditions. Special cases of the results that yield flow and
reliability polynomials are discussed. We also analyze special cases of the
Tutte polynomials that determine various quantities of graph-theoretic
interest.
