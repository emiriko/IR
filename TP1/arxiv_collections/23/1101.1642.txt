The eta(1835) is confirmed clearly in new BESIII data for J/Psi -> gamma
(eta'-pi-pi); the angular distribution of the photon is consistent with a
pseudoscalar. This makes it a candidate for an s-sbar radial excitation of eta'
and eta(1440) (or one or both of eta(1405) and eta(1475)). However, a
conspicuous feature of the BES III data is the absence of evidence for
eta(1440) -> eta'-pi-pi while it is well known that eta(1440) appears in
eta-pi-pi. Can these facts be reconciled? There is in fact a simple
explanation. The channel eta(1440) -> eta-pi-pi may be explained by the
two-step process eta(1440) -> [K*K]_{L=1} and [kappa K ]_{L=0}, followed by KK
-> a0(980) -> eta-pi. This process does not produce any significant eta'-pi
signal because of the Adler zero close to the eta'-pi threshold.
