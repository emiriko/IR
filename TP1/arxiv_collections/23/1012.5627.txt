Recent results from the SNO, Super-Kamiokande and Borexino experiments do not
show the expected upturn of the energy spectrum of events (the ratio $R \equiv
N_{obs}/N_{SSM}$) at low energies. At the same time, cosmological observations
testify for possible existence of additional relativistic degrees of freedom in
the early Universe: $\Delta N_{eff} = 1 - 2$. These facts strengthen the case
of very light sterile neutrino, $\nu_s$, with $\Delta m^2_{01} \sim (0.7 - 2)
\cdot 10^{-5}$ eV$^2$, which mixes weakly with the active neutrinos. The
$\nu_s$ mixing in the mass eigenstate $\nu_1$ characterized by $\sin^2 2\alpha
\sim 10^{-3}$ can explain an absence of the upturn. The mixing of $\nu_s$ in
the eigenstate $\nu_3$ with $\sin^2 \beta \sim 0.1$ leads to production of
$\nu_s$ via oscillations in the Universe and to additional contribution $\Delta
N_{eff} \approx 0.7 - 1$ before the big bang nucleosynthesis and later. Such a
mixing can be tested in forthcoming experiments with the atmospheric neutrinos
as well as in future accelerator long baseline experiments. It has substantial
impact on conversion of the supernova neutrinos.
