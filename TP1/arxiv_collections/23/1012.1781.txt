The measurement of CP-violating asymmetries and branching ratios of $B \to
DK$ modes allows a theoretically-clean extraction of the CKM angle $\gamma$. We
report recent CDF measurements with Cabibbo suppressed ($\pi\pi$, $KK$) or
doubly Cabibbo suppressed ($K^+ \pi^-$) $D$ decays. These measurements are
performed for the first time in hadron collisions.
