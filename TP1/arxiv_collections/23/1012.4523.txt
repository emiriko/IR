We consider the inflation model generated by the Standard Model (SM) Higgs
boson having a strong non-minimal curvature coupling. This model suggests the
range of the Higgs mass $135.6\; {\rm GeV} \lesssim M_H\lesssim 184.5\;{\rm
GeV}$ entirely determined by the lower WMAP bound on the CMB spectral index.
This result is based on the renormalization group analysis of quantum effects
which make the SM phenomenology sensitive to the current cosmological data and
thus suggest CMB measurements as a SM test complementary to the LHC program. We
show naturalness of the gradient and curvature expansion in this model in a
conventional perturbation theory range of SM. The origin of initial conditions
for inflation within the quantum cosmology concept of the tunneling state of
the Universe is also considered. In this way a complete cosmological scenario
is obtained, which embraces the formation of initial conditions for the
inflationary background in the form of a sharp probability peak in the
distribution of the inflaton field and the ongoing generation of the CMB
spectrum on this background.
