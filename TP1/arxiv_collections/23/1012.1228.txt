Intertwining operators for infinite-dimensional representations of the
Sklyanin algebra with spins l and -l-1 are constructed using the technique of
intertwining vectors for elliptic L-operator. They are expressed in terms of
elliptic hypergeometric series with operator argument. The intertwining
operators obtained (W-operators) serve as building blocks for the elliptic
R-matrix which intertwines tensor product of two L-operators taken in
infinite-dimensional representations of the Sklyanin algebra with arbitrary
spin. The Yang-Baxter equation for this R-matrix follows from simpler equations
of the star-triangle type for the W-operators. A natural graphic representation
of the objects and equations involved in the construction is used.
