In this work, we derive the nuclear form factor for the spin-independent
collision between the WIMPs and nucleus in terms of the relativistic mean field
(RMF) theory. Comparison with the traditional form factors which are commonly
used in literature is given and it is found that our results are slightly above
that of the 2PF model by 4% to 8%, but deviate from the Helm form factor by 15%
to 25% for the whole recoil energy spectrum of 0$\sim $ 100 keV. Moreover,
taking Xe and Ge as examples, we show the dependence of the form factor on the
recoil energy.
