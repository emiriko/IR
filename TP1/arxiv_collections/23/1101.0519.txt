In carbon nanotubes, the most abundant defects, caused for example by
irradiation or chemisorption treatments, are small perturbing clusters, i.e.
bi-site defects, extending over both A and B sites. The relative positions of
these perturbing clusters play a crucial role in determining the electronic
properties of carbon nanotubes. Using bandstructure and electronic transport
calculations, we find out that in the case of armchair metallic nanotubes a
band gap opens up when the clusters fulfill a certain periodicity condition.
This phenomenon might be used in future nanoelectronic devices in which certain
regions of single metallic nanotubes could be turned to semiconducting ones.
Although in this work we study specifically the effect of hydrogen adatom
clusters, the phenomenon is general for different types of defects. Moreover,
we study the influence of the length and randomness of the defected region on
the electron transport through it.
