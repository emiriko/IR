We review the status of publicly available software tools applicable to
charged Higgs physics. A selection of codes are highlighted in more detail,
focusing on new developments that have taken place since the previous charged
Higgs workshop in 2008. We conclude that phenomenologists now have the tools
ready to face the LHC data. A new webpage collecting charged Higgs resources is
presented.
