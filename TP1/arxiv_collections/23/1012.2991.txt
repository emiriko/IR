The total contribution of strange quarks to the intrinsic spin of the nucleon
can be determined from a measurement of the strange-quark contribution to the
nucleon's elastic axial form factor. We have studied the strangeness
contribution to the elastic vector and axial form factors of the nucleon, using
all available elastic electroweak scattering data. Specifically, we combine
elastic $\nu p$ and $\bar{\nu} p$ scattering cross section data from the
Brookhaven E734 experiment with elastic $ep$ and quasi-elastic $ed$ and
$e$-$^4$He scattering parity-violating asymmetry data from the SAMPLE, HAPPEx,
G0 and PVA4 experiments. We have not only determined these form factors at
individual values of momentum-transfer ($Q^2$), as has been done recently, but
also have fit the $Q^2$-dependence of these form factors using simple
functional forms. We present the results of these fits using existing data,
along with some expectations of how our knowledge of these form factors can be
improved with data from the MicroBooNE experiment planned at Fermilab.
