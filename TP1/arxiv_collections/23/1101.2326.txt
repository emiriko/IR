We give an update on our ongoing efforts to compute the nucleon's form
factors and moments of structure functions using Nf=2 flavours of
non-perturbatively improved Clover fermions. We focus on new results obtained
on gauge configurations where the pseudo-scalar meson mass is in the range of
170-270 MeV. We will compare our results with various estimates obtained from
chiral effective theories since we have some overlap with the quark mass region
where results from such theories are believed to be applicable.
