It has been recently shown that puzzling excess events observed by the LSND
and MiniBooNE neutrino experiments could be interpreted as a signal from the
radiative decay of a heavy sterile neutrino ($\nu_h$) of the mass from 40 to 80
MeV, with a muonic mixing strength $\mix \simeq 10^{-3} - 10^{-2}$, and the
lifetime $10^{-11} < \tau_h < 10^{-9}$ s. We discuss bounds on $\mix$ obtained
from the recent precision measurements with muons and show that they are
consistent with the above limits. If the $\nu_h$ exists its admixture in the
ordinary muon or kaon decay would result in the decay chain $\muhd$ or $\khd$,
respectively. We propose a new experiment for a sensitive search for these
processes in $\mu$ and $K$ decays at rest allowing to either definitively
confirm or exclude the existence of the $\nu_h$. To our knowledge, no
experiment has specifically searched for the signature of radiative decay of
massive neutrinos from particles decays as proposed in this work. The search is
complementary to the current experimental efforts to clarify the origin of the
LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies.
