We consider all matches played by professional tennis players between 1968
and 2010, and, on the basis of this data set, construct a directed and weighted
network of contacts. The resulting graph shows complex features, typical of
many real networked systems studied in literature. We develop a diffusion
algorithm and apply it to the tennis contact network in order to rank
professional players. Jimmy Connors is identified as the best player of the
history of tennis according to our ranking procedure. We perform a complete
analysis by determining the best players on specific playing surfaces as well
as the best ones in each of the years covered by the data set. The results of
our technique are compared to those of two other well established methods. In
general, we observe that our ranking method performs better: it has a higher
predictive power and does not require the arbitrary introduction of external
criteria for the correct assessment of the quality of players. The present work
provides a novel evidence of the utility of tools and methods of network theory
in real applications.
