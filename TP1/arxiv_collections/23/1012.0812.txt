Chemical abundances in solar-type stars are a much debated topic.
Planet-hosting stars are known to be metal-rich, but whether or not this
peculiarity applies also to the chemical composition of the outer stellar
atmospheres is still to be clarified. More in general, coronal and photospheric
abundances in late-type stars appear to be different in many cases, but
understanding how chemical stratification effects work in stellar atmospheres
requires an observational base larger than currently available. We obtained
XMM-Newton high-resolution X-ray spectra of Tau Bootis, a well known nearby
star with a Jovian-mass close-in planet. We analyzed these data with the aim to
perform a detailed line-based emission measure analysis and derive the
abundances of individual elements in the corona with two different methods
applied independently. We compared the coronal abundances of Tau Bootis with
published photospheric abundances based on high-resolution optical spectra and
with those of other late-type stars with different magnetic activity levels,
including the Sun. We find that the two methods provide consistent results
within the statistical uncertainties for both the emission measure distribution
of the hot plasma and for the coronal abundances, with discrepancies at the
2-sigma level limited to the amount of plasma at temperatures of 3-4 MK and to
the O and Ni abundances. In both cases, the elements for which both coronal and
photospheric measurements are available (C, N, O, Si, Fe, and Ni) result
systematically less abundant in the corona by a factor 3 or more, with the
exception of the coronal Ni abundance, which is similar to the photospheric
value. Comparison with other late-type stars of similar activity level shows
that these coronal/photospheric abundance ratios are peculiar to Tau Bootis and
possibly related to the characteristic over-metallicity of this planet-hosting
star.
