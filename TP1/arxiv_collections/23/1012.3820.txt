We study a general class of holographic superconductor models via the
St\"{u}ckelberg mechanism in the non-minimal derivative coupling theory in
which the charged scalar field is kinetically coupling to Einstein's tensor. We
explore the effects of the coupling parameter on the critical temperature, the
order of phase transitions and the critical exponents near the second-order
phase transition point. Moreover, we compute the electric conductive using the
probe approximation and check the ratios $\omega_g/T_c$ for the different
coupling parameters.
