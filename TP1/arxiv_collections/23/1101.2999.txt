By using the representational power of Chu spaces we define the notion of a
generalized topological space (or GTS, for short), i.e., a mathematical
structure that generalizes the notion of a topological space. We demonstrate
that these topological spaces have as special cases known topological spaces.
Furthermore, we develop the various topological notions and concepts for GTS.
Moreover, since the logic of Chu spaces is linear logic, we give an
interpretation of most linear logic connectives as operators that yield
topological spaces.
