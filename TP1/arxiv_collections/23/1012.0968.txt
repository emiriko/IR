The weak antilocalization effect of InSb film in perpendicular as well as
tilted magnetic field is investigated. It is found that the InSb film has
quasi-two-dimensional feature and the Nyquist mechanism dominates decoherence.
The two dimensionality is also verified further and the influence of roughness
effect and Zeeman effect on weak antilocalization effect is studied by
systematically investigating the anisotropy of weak field magnetoresistance
with respect to magnetic field. It is also found that the existence of in-plane
field can effectively suppress the weak antilocalization effect of InSb film
and the roughness effect plays an important role in the anisotropy.
