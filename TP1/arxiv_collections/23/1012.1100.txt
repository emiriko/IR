The intrinsic values of the carriers mobility and density of the graphene
layers inside graphite, the well known structure built on these layers in the
Bernal stacking configuration, are not well known mainly because most of the
research was done in rather bulk samples where lattice defects hide their
intrinsic values. By measuring the electrical resistance through
microfabricated constrictions in micrometer small graphite flakes of a few tens
of nanometers thickness we studied the ballistic behavior of the carriers. We
found that the carriers' mean free path is micrometer large with a mobility
$\mu \simeq 6 \times 10^6 $cm$^2$/Vs and a carrier density $n \simeq 7 \times
10^8 $cm$^{-2}$ per graphene layer at room temperature. These distinctive
transport and ballistic properties have important implications for
understanding the values obtained in single graphene and in graphite as well as
for implementing this last in nanoelectronic devices.
