We study the kinetic and chemical equilibration in 'infinite' parton-hadron
matter within the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics transport approach, which is
based on a dynamical quasiparticle model for partons matched to reproduce
lattice-QCD results - including the partonic equation of state - in
thermodynamic equilibrium. The 'infinite' matter is simulated within a cubic
box with periodic boundary conditions initialized at different baryon density
(or chemical potential) and energy density. The transition from initially pure
partonic matter to hadronic degrees of freedom (or vice versa) occurs
dynamically by interactions. Different thermodynamical distributions of the
strongly-interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) are addressed and discussed.
