We present an implementation of the next-to-leading order dijet production
process in hadronic collisions in the framework of POWHEG, which is a method to
implement NLO calculations within a shower Monte Carlo context. In constructing
the simulation, we have made use of the POWHEG BOX toolkit, which makes light
of many of the most technical steps. The majority of this article is concerned
with the study of the predictions of the Monte Carlo simulation. In so doing,
we validate our program for use in experimental analyses, elaborating on some
of the more subtle features which arise from the interplay of the NLO and
resummed components of the calculation. We conclude our presentation by
comparing predictions from the simulation against a number of Tevatron and LHC
jet-production results.
