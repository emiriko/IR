In this paper we prove an approximate controllability result for the bilinear
Schr\"odinger equation. This result requires less restrictive non-resonance
hypotheses on the spectrum of the uncontrolled Schr\"odinger operator than
those present in the literature. The control operator is not required to be
bounded and we are able to extend the controllability result to the density
matrices. The proof is based on fine controllability properties of the finite
dimensional Galerkin approximations and allows to get estimates for the $L^{1}$
norm of the control. The general controllability result is applied to the
problem of controlling the rotation of a bipolar rigid molecule confined on a
plane by means of two orthogonal external fields.
