We report on the implementation of metallic microtubes in a system of
rubidium vapour at 230\,bar of argon buffer gas. The high buffer gas pressure
leads to a widely pressure broadened linewidth of several nanometers,
interpolating between the sharp atomic physics spectra and the band structure
of solid state systems. Tube-like metallic waveguide structures have been
inserted in the high pressure buffer gas system, allowing for an enhancement of
the atom-light interaction over an optical guiding length in the tube of up to
1\,mm. The system holds promise for nonlinear optics experiments and the study
of atom-light polariton condensation.
