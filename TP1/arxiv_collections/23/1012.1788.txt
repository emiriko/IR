Coupled arrays of Andronov-Hopf oscillators are investigated. These arrays
can be diffusively or repulsively coupled, and can serve as central pattern
generator models in animal locomotion and robotics. It is shown that repulsive
coupling generates out-of-phase oscillations, while diffusive coupling
generates synchronous oscillations. Specifically, symmetric solutions and their
corresponding amplitudes are derived, and contraction analysis is used to prove
global stability and convergence of oscillations to either symmetric
out-of-phase or synchronous states, depending on the coupling constant. Next,
the two mechanisms are used jointly by coupling multiple arrays. The resulting
dynamics is analyzed, in a model inspired by the CPG-motorneuron network that
controls the heartbeat of a medicinal leech.
