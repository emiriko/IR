Recently, de Roany & Pacheco (2010) performed a Newtonian analysis on the
evolution of perturbations for a class of relativistic cosmological models with
Creation of Cold Dark Matter (CCDM) proposed by the present authors. In this
note we demonstrate that the basic equations adopted in their work do not
recover the specific (unperturbed) CCDM model. Unlike to what happens in the
original CCDM cosmology, their basic conclusions refer to a decelerating
cosmological model in which there is no transition from a decelerating to an
accelerating regime as required by SNe type Ia and complementary observations.
