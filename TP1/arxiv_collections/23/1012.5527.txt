Data on the variability of the continuum optical emission are used for the
first time to estimate the degree of spotting in stars similar to that of the
sun. It is sown that the amount of spotting increases gradually from the sun to
the highly spotted stars for which Alekseev and Gershberg constructed the zonal
model for the distributions of spots. A close relationship is found between
spotting and the power of the x-ray emission from the stars with widely varying
levels of activity.
