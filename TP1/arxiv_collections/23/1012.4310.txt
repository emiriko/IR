We discuss the possibility of the non-one-neutron emission channels in the
cold fusion reaction $^{70}$Zn + $^{209}$Bi to produce the element Z=113. For
this purpose, we calculate the evaporation-residue cross sections of
one-proton, radiative-capture, and two-neutron emissions relative to the
one-neutron emission in the reaction $^{70}$Zn + $^{209}$Bi. To estimate the
upper bounds of those quantities, we vary model parameters in the calculations,
such as the level-density parameter and the height of the fission barrier. We
conclude that the highest possibility is for the 2n reaction channel, and its
upper bounds are 2.4$%$ and at most less than 7.9% with unrealistic parameter
values, under the actual experimental conditions of [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf
73} (2004) 2593].
