We report the successful growth of high-quality single crystals of potassium
intercalated iron selenide KxFe2-ySe2 by Bridgeman method. The effect of iron
vacancies on transport properties was investigated by electrical resistivity
and magnetic susceptibility measurements. With varying iron content, the system
passes from semiconducting/insulating to superconducting state. Comparing with
superconductivity, the anomalous "hump" effect in the normal state resistivity
is much more sensitive to the iron deficiency. The electrical resistivity
exhibits a perfect metallic behavior (R300K/R35K=42) for the sample with little
iron vacancies. Our results suggest that the anomalous "hump" effect in the
normal state resistivity may be due to the ordering process of the cation
vacancies in this non-stoichiometric compound rather than magnetic/structure
transition. A trace of superconductivity extending up to near 44 K was also
detected in some crystals of KxFe2-ySe2, which has the highest Tc of the
reported iron selenides.
