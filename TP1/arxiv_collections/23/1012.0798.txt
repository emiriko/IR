Assuming that in the hot dense matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion
collisions, the energy density, entropy density, and pressure as well as the
azimuthal and space-time rapidity components of the shear tensor are uniform in
the direction transversal to the reaction plane, we derive a set of schematic
equations from the Isreal-Stewart causal viscous hydrodynamics. These equations
are then used to describe the evolution dynamics of relativistic heavy-ion
collisions by taking the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio of $1/4\pi$
for the initial quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phase and of ten times this value for
the later hadron-gas (HG) phase. Using the production rate evaluated with
particle distributions that take into account the viscous effect, we study
dilepton production in central heavy-ion collisions. Compared with results from
the ideal hydrodynamics, we find that although the dilepton invariant mass
spectra from the two approaches are similar, the transverse momentum spectra
are significantly enhanced at high transverse momenta by the viscous effect. We
also study the transverse momentum dependence of dileptons produced from QGP
for a fixed transverse mass which is essentially absent in the ideal
hydrodynamics, and find that this so-called transverse mass scaling is violated
in the viscous hydrodynamics, particularly at high transverse momenta.
