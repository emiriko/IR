In this paper, we introduce the concept of dual universality of hash
functions and present its applications to quantum cryptography. We begin by
establishing the one-to-one correspondence between a linear function family
{\cal F} and a code family {\cal C}, and thereby defining \varepsilon-almost
dual universal_2 hash functions, as a generalization of the conventional
universal_2 hash functions. Then we show that this generalized (and thus
broader) class of hash functions is in fact sufficient for the security of
quantum cryptography. This result can be explained in two different formalisms.
First, by noting its relation to the \delta-biased family introduced by Dodis
and Smith, we demonstrate that Renner's two-universal hashing lemma is
generalized to our class of hash functions. Next, we prove that the proof
technique by Shor and Preskill can be applied to quantum key distribution (QKD)
systems that use our generalized class of hash functions for privacy
amplification. While Shor-Preskill formalism requires an implementer of a QKD
system to explicitly construct a linear code of the Calderbank-Shor-Steane
type, this result removes the existing difficulty of the construction a linear
code of CSS code by replacing it by the combination of an ordinary classical
error correcting code and our proposed hash function. We also show that a
similar result applies to the quantum wire-tap channel. Finally we compare our
results in the two formalisms and show that, in typical QKD scenarios, the
Shor-Preskill--type argument gives better security bounds in terms of the trace
distance and Holevo information, than the method based on the \delta-biased
family.
