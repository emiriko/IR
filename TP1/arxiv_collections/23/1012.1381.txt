Thermal molecular motion in an accelerated coordinate system causes variety
in pseudo forces and thus variety in pseudo stress in rotating matter. Averaged
E\"otv\"os effects and Coriolis accelerations on molecular level become
noticeable. The effect is here derived for gas but does also exist in liquids,
solid matter and plasma. In the atmosphere of Venus and Earth the pseudo shear
stress is negligible and the vertical normal pseudo stress from E\"otv\"os
effects is lowered by 0.51 % and 0.27 % respectively. The shear stress
component is not dependent on temperature and the normal stress component
increases with the square root of the temperature.
