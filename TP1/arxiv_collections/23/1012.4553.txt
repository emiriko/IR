Recently, a tunable bandwidth white light cavity (WLC) was demonstrated by
using an anomalously dispersive intra-cavity medium to adjust a cavity
linewidth without reducing the cavity buildup factor [G.S. Pati et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 99, 133601 (2007)]. In this paper, we show theoretically how such a
WLC can be used to realize a distortion-free delay system for a data pulse. The
system consists of two WLCs placed in series. Once the pulse has passed through
them, the fast-light media in both WLCs are deactivated, so that each of these
now acts as a very high reflectivity mirror. The data pulse bounces around
between these mirrors, undergoing negligible attenuation per pass. The trapped
pulse can be released by activating the fast-light medium in either WLC.
Numerical simulations show that such a system can far exceed the
delay-bandwidth constraint encountered in a typical data buffer employing slow
light. We also show that the pulse remains virtually undistorted during the
process.
