We introduce an efficient, scalable Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate
cross-linked architectures of freely-jointed and discrete worm-like chains.
Bond movement is based on the discrete tractrix construction, which effects
conformational changes that exactly preserve fixed-length constraints of all
bonds. The algorithm reproduces known end-to-end distance distributions for
simple, analytically tractable systems of cross-linked stiff and freely jointed
polymers flawlessly, and is used to determine the effective persistence length
of short bundles of semi-flexible worm-like chains, cross-linked to each other.
It reveals a possible regulatory mechanism in bundled networks: the effective
persistence of bundles is controlled by the linker density.
