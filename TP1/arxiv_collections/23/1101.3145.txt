We determine the upper critical field $\mu_0 H_{c2}(T_c)$ of
non-centrosymmetric superconductor $Y_2 C_3$ using two distinct methods: the
bulk magnetization M(T) and the tunnel-diode oscillator (TDO) based impedance
measurements. It is found that the upper critical field reaches a value of 30T
at zero temperature which is above the weak-coupling Pauli paramagnetic limit.
We argue that the observation of such a large $\mu_0 H_{c2}(0)$ in $Y_2 C_3$
could be attributed to the admixture of spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing
states as a result of broken inversion symmetry.
