In this paper we begin an investigation into the $l_p^3$ corrections to the
supersymmetry transformations of the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson (BLG) theory. We
begin with a review of the dNS duality transformation which allows a
non-abelian gauge field to be dualised to a scalar field in 2+1 dimensions.
Applying this duality to $\alpha'^2$ terms of the non-abelian D2-brane theory
gives rise to the $l_p^3$ corrections of the Lorentzian BLG theory. We then
apply this duality transformation to the $\alpha'^2$ corrections of the
D2-brane supersymmetry transformations. For the `abelian' BLG theory we are
able to uniquely determine the $l_p^3$ corrections to the supersymmetry
transformations of the scalar and fermion fields. Generalising to the
`non-abelian' BLG theory we are able to determine the $l_p^3$ correction to the
supersymmetry transformation of the fermion field. Along the way make a number
of observations relating to the implementation of the dNS duality
transformation at the level of supersymmetry transformations.
