Asymptotic safety offers a field theory based UV completion to gravity. For
low Planck scales, gravitational effects on low-energy precision observables
cannot be neglected. We compute the contribution to the rho parameter from
asymptotically safe gravitons and find that in contrast to effective theory,
constraints on models with more than three extra dimensions are significantly
weakened. The relative size of the trans-Planckian contribution increases
proportional to the number of extra dimensions.
