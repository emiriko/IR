We study the effects of next-nearest neighbor (NNN) interactions in the
two-dimensional ferromagnetic kinetic Ising model exposed to an oscillating
field. By tuning the interaction ratio (p = JNNN/JNN) of the NNN (JNNN) to the
nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction (JNN) we find that the model undergoes a
transition from a regime in which the dynamic order parameter Q is equal to
zero to a phase in which Q is not equal to zero. From our studies we conclude
that the model can exhibit an interaction induced transition from a
deterministic to a stochastic state. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
systems' metastable lifetime is sensitive not only to the lattice size,
external field amplitude, and temperature (as found in earlier studies) but
also to additional interactions present in the system.
