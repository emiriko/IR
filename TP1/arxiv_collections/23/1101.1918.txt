We study the band structure of graphene's Dirac-Weyl quasi-particles in a
one-dimensional magnetic superlattice formed by a periodic sequence of
alternating magnetic barriers. The spectrum and the nature of the states
strongly depend on the conserved longitudinal momentum and on the barrier
width. At the center of the superlattice Brillouin zone we find new Dirac
points at finite energies where the dispersion is highly anisotropic, in
contrast to the dispersion close to the neutrality point which remains
isotropic. This finding suggests the possibility of collimating Dirac-Weyl
quasi-particles by tuning the doping.
