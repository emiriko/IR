A global hybrid coupled model is developed, with the aim of studying the
effects of ocean-atmosphere feedbacks on the stability of the Atlantic
meridional overturning circulation. The model includes a global ocean general
circulation model and a statistical atmosphere model. The statistical
atmosphere model is based on linear regressions of data from a fully coupled
climate model on sea surface temperature both locally and hemispherically
averaged, being the footprint of Atlantic meridional overturning variability.
It provides dynamic boundary conditions to the ocean model for heat, freshwater
and wind-stress. A basic but consistent representation of ocean-atmosphere
feedbacks is captured in the hybrid coupled model and it is more than ten times
faster than the fully coupled climate model. The hybrid coupled model reaches a
steady state with a climate close to the one of the fully coupled climate
model, and the two models also have a similar response (collapse) of the
Atlantic meridional overturning circulation to a freshwater hosing applied in
the northern North Atlantic.
