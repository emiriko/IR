The Science Operation Department is composed of Astronomers, Telescope
Instruments Operators (TIO) and Data Handling Administrators (DHAs). Their main
goal is to produce top-quality astronomical data by operating a suite of 9
telescopes, 14 Instruments and related systems, supporting the execution of
Visitor Mode Observations or executing Service Mode Observations. Astronomers
and TIOs have to deal with atmospheric parameters like seeing, coherence time,
isoplanatic angle, precipitable water vapor, etc. in order to take in real time
the best decisions on the best program to be executed according to the current
conditions. We describe the tools available in the control room, provided by
the environmental monitoring and forecast system.
