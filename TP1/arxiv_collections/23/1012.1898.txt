The Zebrafish Model Organism Database (ZFIN) provides a Web resource of
zebrafish genomic, genetic, developmental, and phenotypic data. Four different
ontologies are currently used to annotate data to the most specific term
available facilitating a better comparison between inter-species data. In
addition, ontologies are used to help users find and cluster data more quickly
without the need of knowing the exact technical name for a term.
