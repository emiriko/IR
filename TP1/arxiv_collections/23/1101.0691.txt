Planetary magnetic fields could impact the evolution of planetary atmospheres
and have a role in the determination of the required conditions for the
emergence and evolution of life (planetary habitability). We study here the
role of rotation in the evolution of dynamo-generated magnetic fields in
massive earth-like planets, Super Earths (1-10 $M_\oplus$). Using the most
recent thermal evolution models of Super Earths (Gaidos et al. 2010; Tachinami
et al. 2011) and updated scaling laws for convection-driven dynamos, we predict
the evolution of the local Rossby number. This quantity is one of the proxies
for core magnetic field regime, i.e. non-reversing dipolar, reversing dipolar
and multipolar. We study the dependence of the local Rossby number and hence
the core magnetic field regime on planetary mass and rotation rate. Previous
works have focused only on the evolution of core magnetic fields assuming
rapidly rotating planets i.e. planets in the dipolar regime. In this work we go
further, including the effects of rotation in the evolution of planetary
magnetic field regime and obtaining global constraints to the existence of
intense protective magnetic fields in rapidly and slowly rotating Super Earths.
We find that the emergence and continued existence of a protective planetary
magnetic field is not only a function of planetary mass but also depend on
rotation rate. Low-mass Super Earths ($M\lesssim 2 M_\oplus$) develop intense
surface magnetic fields but their lifetimes will be limited to 2-4 Gyrs for
rotational periods larger than 1-4 days. On the other hand and also in the case
of slowly rotating planets, more massive Super Earths ($M\gtrsim 2 M_\oplus$)
have weak magnetic fields but their dipoles will last longer. Finally we
analyze tidally locked Super Earths inside and outside the habitable zone of
GKM stars.
