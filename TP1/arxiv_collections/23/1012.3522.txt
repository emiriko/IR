Two, lightweight diode laser frequency stabilization systems designed for
experiments in the field are described. A significant reduction in size and
weight in both models supports the further miniaturization of measurement
devices in the field. Similar to a previous design, magnetic-field lines are
contained within a magnetic shield enclosing permanent magnets and a Rb cell,
so that these DAVLL systems may be used for magnetically sensitive instruments.
The Mini-DAVLL system (49 mm long) uses a vapor cell (20 mm long), and does not
require cell heaters. An even smaller Micro-DAVLL system (9mm long) uses a
micro-fabricated cell (3 mm square), and requires heaters. These new systems
show no degradation in performance with regard to previous designs, while
considerably reducing dimensions.
