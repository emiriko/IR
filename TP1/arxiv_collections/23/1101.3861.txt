TIM (The Interactive METATOY) is a ray-tracing program specifically tailored
towards our research in METATOYs, which are optical components that appear to
be able to create wave-optically forbidden light-ray fields. For this reason,
TIM possesses features not found in other ray-tracing programs. TIM can either
be used interactively or by modifying the openly available source code; in both
cases, it can easily be run as an applet embedded in a web page. Here we
describe the basic structure of TIM's source code and how to extend it, and we
give examples of how we have used TIM in our own research.
