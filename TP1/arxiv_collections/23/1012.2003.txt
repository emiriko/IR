The Sznajd model for opinion dynamics has attracted a large interest as a
simple realization of the psychological principle of social validation. As its
most salient feature, it has been claimed that the Sznajd model is
qualitatively different from other ordering processes, because it is the only
one featuring outflow of information as opposed to inflow. We show that this
claim is unfounded by presenting a generalized zero-temperature Glauber-type of
dynamics which yields results indistinguishable from those of the Sznajd model.
In one-dimension we also derive an exact expression for the exit probability of
the Sznajd model, that turns out to coincide with the result of an analytical
approach based on the Kirkwood approximation. This observation raises
interesting questions about the applicability and limitations of this approach.
