We consider the impact of incomplete information on incentives for node
cooperation in parallel relay networks with one source node, one destination
node, and multiple relay nodes. All nodes are selfish and strategic, interested
in maximizing their own profit instead of the social welfare. We consider the
practical situation where the channel state on any given relay path is not
observable to the source or to the other relays. We examine different
bargaining relationships between the source and the relays, and propose a
framework for analyzing the efficiency loss induced by incomplete information.
We analyze the source of the efficiency loss, and quantify the amount of
inefficiency which results.
