We report on the results of a simultaneous monitoring campaign employing
eight Chandra X-ray (0.5-10 keV) and six VLA/EVLA (8.4 GHz) radio observations
of NGC 4051 over seven months. Evidence for compact jets is observed in the 8.4
GHz radio band; This builds on mounting evidence that jet production may be
prevalent even in radio-quiet Seyferts. Assuming comparatively negligible local
diffuse emission in the nucleus, the results also demonstrate an inverse
correlation of L_radio proportional to L_X-ray ^(-0.72+/-0.04) . Current
research linking the mass of supermassive black holes and stellar-mass black
holes in the "low/hard" state to X-ray luminosities and radio luminosities
suggest a "fundamental plane of accretion onto black holes" that has a positive
correlation of L_radio proportional to L_X-ray^(0.67+/-0.12) . Our simultaneous
results differ from this relation by more than 11 sigma, indicating that a
separate mode of accretion and ejection may operate in this system. A review of
the literature shows that the inverse correlation seen in NGC 4051 is seen in
three other black hole systems, all of which accrete at near 10% of their
Eddington luminosity, perhaps suggesting a distinct mode of disk-jet coupling
at high Eddington fractions. We discuss our results in the context of disk and
jets in black holes and accretion across the black hole mass scale.
