The Lifshitz theory provides a method to calculate the Casimir force between
two flat plates if the frequency dependent dielectric function of the plates is
known. In reality any plate is rough and its optical properties are known only
to some degree. For high precision experiments the plates must be carefully
characterized otherwise the experimental result cannot be compared with the
theory or with other experiments. In this chapter we explain why optical
properties of interacting materials are important for the Casimir force, how
they can be measured, and how one can calculate the force using these
properties. The surface roughness can be characterized, for example, with the
atomic force microscope images. We introduce the main characteristics of a
rough surface that can be extracted from these images, and explain how one can
use them to calculate the roughness correction to the force. At small
separations this correction becomes large as our experiments show. Finally we
discuss the distance upon contact separating two rough surfaces, and explain
the importance of this parameter for determination of the absolute separation
between bodies.}
