We study the quantum group deformation of the Lorentzian EPRL spin-foam
model. The construction uses the harmonic analysis on the quantum Lorentz
group. We show that the quantum group spin-foam model so defined is free of the
infra-red divergence, thus gives a finite partition function on a fixed
triangulation. We expect this quantum group spin-foam model is a spin-foam
quantization of discrete gravity with a cosmological constant.
