A thorough mapping between the hydrodynamics of a two-dimensional
Bose-Einstein condensate and the nonrelativistic classical electrodynamics of a
charged material medium is proposed. This is shown to provide a very useful
frame to discuss several features of vortex dynamics. Two important local
conservation theorems of energy and angular momentum are derived and further
applications are summarized.
