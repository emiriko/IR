In this paper we study the characteristics of subwavelength imaging of a
photonic crystal (PhC) superlens under the influence of source displacement.
For square- and triangular-lattice photonic crystal lenses, we investigate the
influence of changing the lateral position of a single point source on the
imaging uniformity and stability. We also study the effect of changing the
geometrical center of a pair of sources on the resolution of the double-image.
Both properties are found to be sensitive to the displacement, which implies
that a PhC slab cannot be treated seriously as a flat lens. We also show that
by introducing material absorption into the dielectric cylinders of the PhC
slab and widening the lateral width of the slab, the imaging uniformity and
stability can be substantially improved. This study helps us to clarify the
underlying mechanisms of some recently found phenomena concerning imaging
instability.
