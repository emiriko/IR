In non-central collisions between ultra-relativistic heavy ions, the
freeze-out distribution is anisotropic, and its major longitudinal axis may be
tilted away from the beam direction. The shape and orientation of this
distribution are particularly interesting, as they provide a snapshot of the
evolving source and reflect the space-time aspect of anisotropic flow.
Experimentally, this information is extracted by measuring pion HBT radii as a
function of angle with respect to the reaction plane. Existing formulae
relating the oscillations of the radii and the freezeout anisotropy are in
principle only valid for Gaussian sources with no collective flow. With a
realistic transport model of the collision, which generates flow and
non-Gaussian sources, we find that these formulae approximately reflect the
anisotropy of the freezeout distribution.
