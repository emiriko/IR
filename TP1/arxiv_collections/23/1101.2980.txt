An anisotropic fluid with variable energy density and negative pressure is
proposed, both outside and inside stars. The gravitational field is constant
everywhere in free space (if we neglect the local contributions) and its value
is of the order of $g = 10^{-8} cm/s^{2}$, in accordance with MOND model. With
$\rho,~ p \propto 1/r$, the acceleration is also constant inside stars but the
value is different from one star to another and depends on their mass $M$ and
radius $R$. In spite of the fact that the spacetime is of Rindler type and
curved even far from a local mass, the active gravitational energy on the
horizon is $-1/4g$, as for the flat Rindler space, excepting the negative sign.
