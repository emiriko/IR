Measurements of jet production in the photoproduction region at HERA are
presented, which are sensitive to the underlying event structure. It is argued
that in the photoproduction region a significant amount of multi-parton
interactions in the collinear factorisation ansatz are needed to describe the
measurement. A different approach for higher order parton radiation (CCFM
parton showers) can also describe the measurement.
