We propose an experiment to directly probe the non-Abelian statistics of
Majorana fermions by braiding them in an s-wave superfluid of ultracold atoms.
We show different orders of braiding operations give orthogonal output states
that can be distinguished through Raman spectroscopy. Realization of Majorana
bound states in an s-wave superfluid requires strong spin-orbital coupling and
a controllable Zeeman field in the perpendicular direction. We present a simple
laser configuration to generate the artificial spin-orbital coupling and the
required Zeeman field in the dark state subspace.
