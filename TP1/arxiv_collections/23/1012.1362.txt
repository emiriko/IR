Using data from our Parkes & ATCA HI survey of six groups analogous to the
Local Group, we find that the HI mass function and velocity distribution
function for loose groups are the same as those for the Local Group. Both mass
functions confirm that the "missing satellite" problem exists in other galaxy
groups.
