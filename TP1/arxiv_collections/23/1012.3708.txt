The seminal paper on the meaning of the vector potential by E. J. Konopinski
is revisited. The full significance of this work has not been generally
recognized to date. We first briefly review Konopinski's findings and show that
many of his key results can be obtained from a simpler and more familiar
approach. We then discuss the additional implications of his analyses, which
were overlooked by Konopinski himself.
