A study of events containing two tau leptons with high transverse momentum
has been performed with the ZEUS detector at HERA, using a data sample
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.33 fb-1. The tau candidates were
identified from their decays into electrons, muons or hadronic jets. The number
of tau-pair candidates has been compared with the prediction from the Standard
Model, where the largest contribution is expected from Bethe-Heitler processes.
The total visible cross section was extracted.Standard Model expectations agree
well with the measured distributions, also at high invariant mass of the tau
pair.
