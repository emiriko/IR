Quantum mechanical search induces polynomial speed up in an unsorted database
search process. In case of classical linear search the computational time
increases with the dimensionality of the query. However, quantum parallelism,
inherent to quantum systems, does not let multi-dimensional query processing
affect the computational time of the quantum search algorithm. In this letter,
a two-dimensional search process has been proposed. It has been shown that a
two-dimensional search process can be accomplished without increasing the
computational time due to implicit quantum parallelism
