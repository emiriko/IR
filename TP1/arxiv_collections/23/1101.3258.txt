A review of charm semileptonic decays results obtained at B factories is
presented. It focuses on form factors measurements in $D^0\to K^- \ell^+ \nu$,
$D^0\to \pi^- \ell^+ \nu$, $D_s^+ \to K^+K^- e^+\nu_e$, and $D^+ \to K^-\pi^+
e^+\nu_e$. For the last two decay channels, the contribution and
characteristics of other components in the final state, in addition to the main
vector contribution, is also studied.
