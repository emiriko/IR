We studied the (001/2) diffraction peak in the low-temperature phase of
magnetite (Fe3O4) using resonant soft x-ray diffraction (RSXD) at the Fe-L2,3
and O-K resonance. We studied both molecular-beam-epitaxy (MBE) grown thin
films and in-situ cleaved single crystals. From the comparison we have been
able to determine quantitatively the contribution of intrinsic absorption
effects, thereby arriving at a consistent result for the (001/2) diffraction
peak spectrum. Our data also allow for the identification of extrinsic effects,
e.g. for a detailed modeling of the spectra in case a "dead" surface layer is
present that is only absorbing photons but does not contribute to the
scattering signal.
