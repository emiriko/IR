We model the expected X-ray polarisation induced by complex reprocessing in
the active nucleus of the Seyfert-2 galaxy NGC 1068. Recent analysis of
infrared interferometry observations suggests that the ionised outflows ejected
by the central engine are not aligned with the symmetry axis of the obscuring
torus. This conclusion was obtained by extrapolating the apparent orientation
of the narrow line region to the inner parts of the ionisation cones. We show
that future measurements of the soft X-ray polarisation vector unambiguously
determine the orientation of the ionisation cones. Furthermore, X-ray
polarimetry across a broad photon energy range may independently verify the
misalignment between the ionisation cones and the axis of the torus. To model
the expected polarisation percentage and position angle, we apply the radiative
transfer code STOKES. Reprocessing of the primary X-ray radiation takes place
in the accretion disc, the surrounding equatorial torus and the inclined,
ionised outflows. We also examine additional equatorial scattering occurring in
between the accretion disc and the inner surfaces of the torus. Radiative
coupling between the different reprocessing components is computed coherently.
The resulting polarisation properties depend on the optical depth of the
reprocessing regions and on the viewing angle of the observer. We show that
even under unfavourable conditions the misalignment of the outflows with
respect to the torus axis can be determined from a rotation of the polarisation
position angle between softer and harder X-rays. We argue that the misalignment
of the outflows with respect to the torus axis in NGC 1068 may be constrained
by a future X-ray mission if equipped with a broad band polarimeter.
