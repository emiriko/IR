Ion traps offer the opportunity to study fundamental quantum systems with
high level of accuracy highly decoupled from the environment. Individual atomic
ions can be controlled and manipulated with electric fields, cooled to the
ground state of motion with laser cooling and coherently manipulated using
optical and microwave radiation. Microfabricated ion traps hold the advantage
of allowing for smaller trap dimensions and better scalability towards large
ion trap arrays also making them a vital ingredient for next generation quantum
technologies. Here we provide an introduction into the principles and operation
of microfabricated ion traps. We show an overview of material and electrical
considerations which are vital for the design of such trap structures. We
provide guidance in how to choose the appropriate fabrication design, consider
different methods for the fabrication of microfabricated ion traps and discuss
previously realized structures. We also discuss the phenomenon of anomalous
heating of ions within ion traps, which becomes an important factor in the
miniaturization of ion traps.
