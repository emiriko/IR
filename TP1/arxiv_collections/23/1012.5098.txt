Ratios of charmed meson and baryon semileptonic decay rates appear to be
satisfactorily described by considering only the lowest-lying (S-wave) hadronic
final states and assuming the kinematic factor describing phase space
suppression is the same as that for free quarks. For example, the rate for
$D_s$ semileptonic decay is known to be $(17.0 \pm 5.3)%$ lower than those for
$D^0$ or $D^+$, and the model accounts for this difference. When applied to
hadrons containing $b$ quarks, this method implies that the $B_s$ semileptonic
decay rate is about 1% higher than that of the nonstrange $B$ mesons. This
small difference thus suggests surprisingly good local quark-hadron duality for
$B$ semileptonic decays, complementing the expectation based on inclusive
quark-hadron duality that these differences in rates should not exceed a few
tenths of a percent. For $\Lambda_b$ semileptonic decay, however, the inclusive
rate is predicted to be about 13% greater than that of the nonstrange $B$
mesons. This value, representing a considerable departure from a calculation
using a heavy quark expansion, is close to the corresponding experimental ratio
$\Gamma(\Lambda_b)/ \bar \Gamma(B) = 1.13 \pm 0.03$ of total decay rates.
