Motivated by the holographic principle, within the context of the AdS/CFT
Correspondence in the large t'Hooft limit, we investigate how the geometry of
certain highly symmetric bulk spacetimes can be recovered given information of
physical quantities in the dual boundary CFT. In particular, we use holographic
entanglement entropy proposal (relating the entanglement entropy of certain
subsystems on the boundary to the area of static minimal surfaces) to recover
the bulk metric using higher dimensional minimal surface probes within a class
of static, planar symmetric, asymptotically AdS spacetimes. We find analytic
and perturbative expressions for the metric function in terms of the
entanglement entropy of straight belt and circular disk subsystems of the
boundary theory respectively. Finally, we discuss how such extractions can be
generalised.
