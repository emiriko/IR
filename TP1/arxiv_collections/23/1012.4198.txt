This is the fourth part in a series of papers in which we introduce and
develop a natural, general tensor category theory for suitable module
categories for a vertex (operator) algebra. In this paper (Part IV), we give
constructions of the P(z)- and Q(z)-tensor product bifunctors using what we
call "compatibility conditions" and certain other conditions.
