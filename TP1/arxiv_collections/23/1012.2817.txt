The field containing the candidate High Mass X-ray Binary IGR J01363+6610 was
observed by XMM-Newton on 2009 July 31 for 28 ks. A Be star was previously
suggested as the possible counterpart of the INTEGRAL source, and although
Chandra, during a 2007 observation, did not detect an X-ray source at the
position of the Be star, we find a variable source (XMMU J013549.5+661243) with
an average X-ray flux of 2e-13 ergs/cm2/s (0.2-12 keV, unabsorbed) at this
position with XMM-Newton. The spectrum of this source is consistent with a hard
power-law with a photon index of 1.4 +/- 0.3 and a column density of 1.5e22
cm^-2 (90% confidence errors). These results, along with our optical
investigation of other X-ray sources in the field, makes the association with
the Be star very likely, and the 2 kpc distance estimate for the Be star
indicates an X-ray luminosity of 9.1e31 ergs/s. This is lower than typical for
a Be X-ray binary, and the upper limit on the luminosity was even lower
(<1.4e31 ergs/s assuming the same spectral model) during the Chandra
observation. We discuss possible implications of the very low quiescent
luminosity for the physical properties of IGR J01363+6610.
