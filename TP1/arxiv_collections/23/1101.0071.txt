For projectile fragmentation we work out details of a model whose origin can
be traced back to the Bevalac era. The model positions itself between the
phenomenological EPAX parametrization and microscopic transport models like
"Heavy Ion Phase Space Exploration Model" (HIPSE) and antisymmetrised molecular
dynamics(AMD). We apply the model to some recent data of projectile
fragmentation of Ni on Ta and Be at beam energy 140 MeV/nucleon and some older
data of Xe on Al at beam energy 790 MeV/nucleon. Reasonable values of
cross-sections for various composites populated in the reactions are obtained.
