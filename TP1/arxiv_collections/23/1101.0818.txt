In this paper we present the coordinates of 67 55' x 55' patches of sky which
have the rare combination of both high stellar surface density (>0.5
arcmin^{-2} with 13<R<16.5 mag) and low extinction (E(B-V)<0.1). These fields
are ideal for adaptive-optics based follow-up of extragalactic targets. One
region of sky, situated near Baade's Window, contains most of the patches we
have identified. Our optimal field, centered at RA: 7h24m3s, Dec: -1deg27'15",
has an additional advantage of being accessible from both hemispheres. We
propose a figure of merit for quantifying real-world adaptive optics
performance, and use this to analyze the performance of multi-conjugate
adaptive optics in these fields. We also compare our results to those that
would be obtained in existing deep fields. In some cases adaptive optics
observations undertaken in the fields given in this paper would be orders of
magnitude more efficient than equivalent observations undertaken in existing
deep fields.
