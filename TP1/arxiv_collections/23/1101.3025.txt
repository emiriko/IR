We calculate the shot noise power in a junction of a network of Majorana
bound states (MBS) with a normal metal. These Majorana bound states are on the
border of alternative ferromagnetic and superconducting regions at the quantum
spin Hall insulator edge. We analyze different realization of MBS networks
including a few isolated ones or in a chain allowing for the limit of weak and
strong tunneling. The conductance, as well as the shot noise are considerably
stronger than those of a weakly coupled normal-superconduting junction, being a
hallmark of the MBS. We find that the Fano factor is quantized $F=2$ when one
MBS member of a pair is coupled to the lead, however if both MBS members are
coupled $F$ is non-integer.
