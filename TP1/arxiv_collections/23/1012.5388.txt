Adopting the theoretical framework for the generalized fishbonelike
dispersion relation, an extended hybrid magnetohydrodynamics gyrokinetic
simulation model has been derived analytically by taking into account both
thermal ion compressibility and diamagnetic effects in addition to energetic
particle kinetic behaviors. The extended model has been used for implementing
an eXtended version of Hybrid Magnetohydrodynamics Gyrokinetic Code (XHMGC) to
study thermal ion kinetic effects on Alfv\'enic modes driven by energetic
particles, such as kinetic beta induced Alfv\'en eigenmodes in tokamak fusion
plasmas.
