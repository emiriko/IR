We consider the hyperbolic Casimir operator C defined on the tangent sphere
bundle SY of a compact hyperbolic Riemann surface Y. We prove a nontrivial
bound on the L^2-norm of the restriction of eigenfunctions of C to certain
natural hypersurfaces in SY. The result that we obtain goes beyond known
(sharp) local bounds of L. Hormander.
