We propose a formulation of quantum mechanics in three dimensions with
spherical symmetry for a finite level system whose dynamics is not governed by
a differential equation of motion. The wavefunction is written as an infinite
sum in a complete set of square integrable functions. Interaction in the theory
is introduced in function space by a real finite tridiagonal symmetric matrix.
Information about the structure and dynamics of the system is contained in the
scattering matrix, which is defined in the usual way.
