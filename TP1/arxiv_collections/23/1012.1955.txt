Using optical microscopy, phase shifting interferometry and atomic force
microscopy, we demonstrate the existence of undulated structures in the
meniscus of ferroelectric smectic-C* films. The meniscus is characterized by a
periodic undulation of the smectic-air interface, which manifests itself in a
striped pattern. The instability disappears in the untilted smectic-A phase.
The modulation amplitude and wavelength both depend on meniscus thickness. We
study the temperature evolution of the structure and propose a simple model
that accounts for the observed undulations.
