The Large Hadron Collider at CERN currently provides p$+$p collisions at
center of mass energies of $\sqrt{s} = 7$~TeV, which allow to study high $\pT$
particle production and jet properties in a new energy regime. For a clear
interpretation and the quantification of the medium influence in heavy-ion
collisions on high $\pT$ observables a detailed understanding of these
elementary reactions is essential. We present first results on the observation
of jet-like properties with the ALICE experiment and discuss the performance of
jet reconstruction in the first year of data taking.
