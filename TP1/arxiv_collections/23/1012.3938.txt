We study the spatio-temporal dynamics of the generalized repressilator, a
system of coupled repressing genes arranged in a directed ring topology, and
give analytical conditions for the emergence of a cascade of unstable periodic
orbits (UPOs) that lead to reachable long-lived oscillating transients. Such
transients dominate the finite time horizon dynamics that is relevant in
confined, noisy environments such as bacterial cells (see our previous work
[Strelkowa and Barahona, 2010]) and are therefore of interest for
bioengineering and synthetic biology. We show that the family of unstable
orbits possesses spatial symmetries and can also be understood in terms of
traveling wave solutions of kink-like topological defects. The long-lived
oscillatory transients correspond to the propagation of quasistable two-kink
configurations that unravel over a long time. We also assess the similarities
between the generalized repressilator model and other unidirectionally coupled
electronic systems, such as magnetic flux gates, which have been implemented
experimentally.
