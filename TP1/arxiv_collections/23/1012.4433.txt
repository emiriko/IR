We study quarkonium spectral functions at high temperatures using potential
model with complex potential. The real part of the potential is constrained by
the lattice QCD data on static quark anti-quark correlation functions, while
the imaginary part of the potential is taken from perturbative calculations. We
find that the imaginary part of the potential has significant effect on
quarkonium spectral functions, in particular, it leas to the dissolution of the
1S charmonium and excited bottomonium states at temperatures about 250 MeV and
melting of the ground state bottomonium at temperatures slightly above 450 MeV.
