We introduce a simple model consisting of two or three coupled
one-dimensional channels of particles with Yukawa interactions. For the two
channel system, when an external drive is applied only to the top or primary
channel, we find a transition from locked flow where particles in both channels
move together to decoupled flow where the particles in the secondary or
undriven channel move at a slower velocity than the particles in the primary or
driven channel. Pronounced commensurability effects in the decoupling
transition occur when the ratio of the number of particles in the top and
bottom channels is varied, and the coupling of the two channels is enhanced
when this ratio is an integer or a rational fraction. Near the commensurate
fillings, we find additional features in the velocity-force curves caused by
the slipping of individual vacancies or incommensurations in the secondary
channels. For three coupled channels, when only the top channel is driven we
find a remarkably rich variety of distinct dynamic phases, including multiple
decoupling and recoupling transitions. These transitions produce pronounced
signatures in the velocity response of each channel. We also find regimes where
a negative drag effect can be induced in one of the non-driven channels. The
particles in this channel move in the opposite direction from the particles in
the driven channel due to the mixing of the two different periodic frequencies
produced by the discrete motion of the particles in the two other channels. In
the two channel system, we also demonstrate a ratchet effect for the particles
in the secondary channel when an asymmetric drive is applied to the primary
channel. This ratchet effect is similar to that observed in superconducting
vortex systems when there is a coupling between two different species of
vortices.
