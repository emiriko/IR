Using first-principles calculations, we study the work function of single
wall silicon carbide nanotube (SiCNT). The work function is found to be highly
dependent on the tube chirality and diameter. It increases with decreasing the
tube diameter. The work function of zigzag SiCNT is always larger than that of
armchair SiCNT. We reveal that the difference between the work function of
zigzag and armchair SiCNT comes from their different intrinsic electronic
structures, for which the singly degenerate energy band above the Fermi level
of zigzag SiCNT is specifically responsible. Our finding offers potential
usages of SiCNT in field-emission devices.
