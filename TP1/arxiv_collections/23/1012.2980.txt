We present the light curves and spectral data of two exceptionally luminous
gamma-ray outburts observed by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) experiment on
board Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope from 3C 273 in September 2009. During
these flares, having a duration of a few days, the source reached its highest
gamma-ray flux ever measured. This allowed us to study in some details their
spectral and temporal structures. The rise and decay are asymmetric on
timescales of 6 hours, and the spectral index was significantly harder during
the flares than during the preceding 11 months. We also found that short, very
intense flares put out the same time-integrated energy as long, less intense
flares like that observed in August 2009.
