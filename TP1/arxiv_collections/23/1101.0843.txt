We report the detection of color gradients in six massive (stellar mass >
10^{10} M_{sun}) and passively evolving (specific SFR < 10^{-11}/yr) galaxies
at redshift 1.3<z<2.5 identified in the HUDF using HST ACS and WFC3/IR images.
After matching different PSFs, we obtain color maps and multi-band
optical/near-IR photometry (BVizYJH) in concentric annuli, from the smallest
resolved radial (~1.7 kpc) up to several times the H-band effective radius. We
find that the inner regions of these galaxies have redder rest-frame
UV--optical colors than the outer parts. The slopes of the color gradients
mildly depend on the overall dust obscuration and rest-frame (U-V) color, with
more obscured or redder galaxies having steeper color gradients. The z~2 color
gradients are also steeper than those of local early-types. The gradient of a
single parameter (age, extinction or metallicity) cannot fully explain the
observed color gradients. Fitting spatially resolved HST seven-band photometry
to stellar population synthesis models, we find that, regardless of assumptions
for metallicity gradient, the redder inner regions of the galaxies have
slightly higher dust obscuration than the bluer outer regions, although the
magnitude depends on the assumed extinction law. The derived age gradient
depends on the assumptions for metallicity gradient. We discuss the
implications of a number of assumptions for metallicity gradient on the
formation and evolution of these galaxies. We find that the evolution of the
mass--size relationship from z~2 to z~0 cannot be driven by in--situ extended
star formation, implying that accretion or merger is mostly responsible for the
evolution. The lack of a correlation between color gradient and stellar mass
argues against the metallicity gradient predicted by the monolithic collapse,
which would require significant major mergers to evolve into the one observed
at z~0. (Abridged)
