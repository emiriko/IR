We present an original approach to fabricate single GaAs/AlGaAs core-shell
nanowire with robust and reproducible transport properties. The core-shell
structure is buried in an insulating GaAs overlayer and connected as grown in a
two probe set-up using the highly doped growth substrate and a top diffused
contact. The measured conductance shows a non-ohmic behavior with temperature
and voltage-bias dependences following power laws, as expected for a quasi-1D
system.
