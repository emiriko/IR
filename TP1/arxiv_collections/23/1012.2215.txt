After reviewing the main mechanisms by which cosmological measurements
constrain the sum of neutrino masses, I give the current reached upper limits,
emphasizing the level of model-dependence. A large improvement is to be
expected with PLANCK's satellite data, on which I give some news, in particular
due to the characterization of the CMB-lensing effect. It will however require
a thorough control of many systematics effects upon which progress has been
made recently.
