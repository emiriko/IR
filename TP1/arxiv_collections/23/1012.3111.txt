We study the interplay between collective and incoherent single-particle
motion in a model of two chains of particles whose interaction comprises a
non-integrable part. In the perturbative regime, but for a general form of the
interaction, we calculate the spectral density for collective excitations. We
obtain the remarkable result that it always has a unique semiclassical
interpretation. We show this by a proper renormalization procedure which allows
us to map our system to a Caldeira-Leggett--type of model in which the bath is
part of the system.
