We have previously presented a critique of the standard Marshallian theory of
the firm, and developed an alternative formulation that better agreed with the
results of simulation. An incorrect mathematical fact was used in our previous
presentation. This paper deals with correcting the derivation of the Keen
equilibrium, and generalising the result to the asymmetric case. As well, we
discuss the notion of rationality employed, and how this plays out in a two
player version of the game.
