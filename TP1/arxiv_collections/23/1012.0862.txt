We describe an alternate gauge electroweak model that permits neutrinos with
mass, and at the same time explains why right-handed neutrinos do not appear in
weak interactions. This is a local gauge theory involving a space [V ] of three
scalar functions. The standard Lagrangian density for the Yang-Mills field part
and Higgs doublet remain invariant. A ma jor change is made in the
transformation and corresponding Lagrangian density parts involving the
right-handed leptons. A picture involving two types of right-handed leptons
emerges. A dichotomy of matter on the [V ] space corresponds to coupled and
uncoupled right-handed Leptons. Here, we describe a covariant dipole-mode
solution in which the neutral bosons A{\mu} and Z{\mu} produce precessions on
[V ]. The W {\pm} {\mu} bosons provide nutations on [V ], and consequently,
provide transitions between the coupled and uncoupled regions. To elucidate the
[V ] space matter dichotomy, and to generate the boson masses, we also provide
an alternate potential Lagrangian density.
