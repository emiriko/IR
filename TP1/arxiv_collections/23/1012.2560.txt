The non-local Machian model is regarded as an alternative theory of
gravitation which states that all particles in the Universe as a
'gravitationally entangled' statistical ensemble. It is shown that the
Klein-Gordon equation can be derived within this Machian model of the universe.
The crucial point of the derivation is the activity of the Machian energy
background field which causing a fluctuation about the average momentum of a
particle, the non-locality problem in quantum theory is addressed in this
framework.
