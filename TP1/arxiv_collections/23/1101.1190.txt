The status and prospects of time-integrated measurements of the CKM angle
gamma at LHCb, the LHC's dedicated flavor physics experiment, are reviewed.
Yields obtained from early data taking are presented and extrapolations are
made to estimate what can be expected to be obtained from the 2011 data. The
conclusions drawn from these extrapolations are that LHCb will produce the
world's best measurement of gamma by the end of 2011 and that the long-term
outlook is excellent.
