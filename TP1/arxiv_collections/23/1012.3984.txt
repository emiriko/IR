We review the constructions and tests of the dilatation operator and of the
spectrum of composite operators in the flavour SU(2) subsector of N=4 SYM in
the planar limit by explicit Feynman graph calculations with emphasis on
analyses beyond one loop. From four loops on, the dilatation operator
determines the spectrum only in the asymptotic regime, i.e. to a loop order
which is strictly smaller than the number of elementary fields of the composite
operators. We review also the calculations which take a first step beyond this
limitation by including the leading wrapping corrections.
