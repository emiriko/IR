This document describes the scientific requirements for the SED builder and
analysis tool that will be designed and built by the US Virtual Astronomical
Observatory (VAO). VAO is the VO effort based in the US, whose primary emphasis
is to provide new scientific research capabilities to the astronomy community.
The near-term goal of the VAO is to put useful and efficient tools in the hands
of research astronomers as soon as possible. The VAO has identified eight major
research initiatives that are of high priority, including the science obtained
with the creation and analysis of the spectral energy distributions of
astronomical sources. This document contains the high-level scientific
requirements that will drive the design and implementation of the VAO SED tool.
