We present the derivation of the formulas for the proton structure-dependent
terms in the hyperfine splitting of muonic hydrogen. We use compatible
conventions throughout the calculations to derive a consistent set of formulas
that reconcile differences between our results and some specific terms in
earlier work. Convention conversion corrections are explicitly presented, which
reduce the calculated hyperfine splitting by about 46 ppm. We also note that
using only modern fits to the proton elastic form factors gives a smaller than
historical spread of Zemach radii and leads to a reduced uncertainty in the
hyperfine splitting. Additionally, hyperfine splittings have an impact on the
muonic hydrogen Lamb shift/proton radius measurement, however the correction we
advocate has a small effect there.
