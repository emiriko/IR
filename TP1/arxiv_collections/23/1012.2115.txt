We present deep J-, H-, and Ks-band imaging data of the MOIRCS Deep Survey
(MODS), which was carried out with Multi-Object Infrared Camera and
Spectrograph (MOIRCS) mounted on the Subaru telescope in the GOODS-North
region. The data reach 5sigma total limiting magnitudes for point sources of
J=23.9, H=22.8, and Ks=22.8 (Vega magnitude) over 103 arcmin^2 (wide field). In
28 arcmin^2 of the survey area, which is ultra deep field of the MODS (deep
field), the data reach the 5sigma depths of J=24.8, H=23.4, and Ks=23.8. The
spatial resolutions of the combined images are FWHM ~ 0.6 arcsec and ~ 0.5
arcsec for the wide and deep fields in all bands, respectively. Combining the
MODS data with the multi-wavelength public data taken with the HST, Spitzer,
and other ground-based telescopes in the GOODS field, we construct a
multi-wavelength photometric catalog of Ks-selected sources. Using the catalog,
we present Ks-band number counts and near-infrared color distribution of the
detected objects, and demonstrate some selection techniques with the NIR colors
for high redshift galaxies. These data and catalog are publicly available via
internet.
