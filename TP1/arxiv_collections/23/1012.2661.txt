We first recall some basic notions on minimalist grammars and on categorial
grammars. Next we shortly introduce partially commutative linear logic, and our
representation of minimalist grammars within this categorial system, the
so-called categorial minimalist grammars. Thereafter we briefly present
\lambda\mu-DRT (Discourse Representation Theory) an extension of \lambda-DRT
(compositional DRT) in the framework of \lambda\mu calculus: it avoids type
raising and derives different readings from a single semantic representation,
in a setting which follows discourse structure. We run a complete example which
illustrates the various structures and rules that are needed to derive a
semantic representation from the categorial view of a transformational
syntactic analysis.
