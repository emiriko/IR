Constraints on the Equation of State for symmetric matter (equal neutron and
proton numbers) have been extracted from energetic collisions of heavy ions
over a range of energies. Collisions of neutron-deficient and neutron-rich
heavy ions now provide initial constraints on the EoS of neutron-rich matter at
sub-saturation densities from isospin diffusions and neutron proton ratios.
This article reviews the experimental constraints on the density dependence of
Symmetry Energy at sub-saturation density.
