The geometrical interpretation of electromagnetism in transparent media
(transformation optics) is extended to include media with isotropic,
inhomogeneous, chirality. It is found that such media may be described through
introducing the non-Riemannian geometrical property of torsion into the Maxwell
equations, and shown how such an interpretation may be applied to the design of
optical devices.
