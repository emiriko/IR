In a trapped atomic Fermi gas, one can tune continuously via a Feshbach
resonance the effective pairing interaction between fermionic atoms from very
weak to very strong. As a consequence, the low temperature superfluidity
evolves continuously from the BCS type in the weak interaction limit to that of
Bose-Einstein condensation in the strong pairing limit, exhibiting a BCS-BEC
crossover. In this paper, we review recent experimental progress in atomic
Fermi gases which elucidates the nature of the superfluid phase as the
interaction is continuously tuned. Of particular interest is the intermediate
or crossover regime where the $s$-wave scattering length diverges. We will
present an intuitive pairing fluctuation theory, and show that this theory is
in quantitative agreement with existing experiments in cold atomic Fermi gases.
