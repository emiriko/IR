The analysis of climate regions is very important for designers and
architects, because the increase in density and built up spaces and reduction
in open spaces and green lands induce the increase of heat, especially in an
urban area, deteriorating the environment and causing health problems. This
study analyzes the Land Surface Temperature (LST) differences in the region of
Dobrogea, Romania, and compares with the land use and land cover types using TM
and ETM+ data of 1989 and 2000. As the analysis is performed on large data
sets, we used Grid Computing to implement a service for using on Computational
Grids with a Web-based client interface, which will be greatly useful and
convenient for those who are studying the ground thermal environment and heat
island effects by using Landsat TM/ETM+ bands, and have typical workstations,
with no special computing and storing resources for computationally intensive
satellite image processing and no license for a commercial image processing
tool. Based on the satellite imagery, the paper also addresses a Supervised
Classification algorithm and the computation of two indices of great value in
water resources management, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),
respectively Land Surface Emissivity (LSE).
