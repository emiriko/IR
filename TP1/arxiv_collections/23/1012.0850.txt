The origin of the highest energy cosmic rays remains an enigma. They offer a
window to new physics, including tests of physical laws relevant to their
propagation and interactions, at energies unattainable by terrestrial
accelerators. They must be accelerated locally, as otherwise background
radiations would severely suppress the flux of protons and nuclei, at energies
above the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) limit. Nearby Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs),
Hypernovae, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and their flares, have all been
suggested and debated as possible sources. A local sub-population of type Ibc
supernovae (SNe) with mildly relativistic outflows have been detected as
sub-energetic GRBs or X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) and recently as radio afterglows
without detected GRB counterparts. We measure the size-magnetic field
evolution, baryon loading and energetics, using the observed radio spectra of
SN 2009bb. We place such engine-driven SNe above the Hillas line and establish
that they can readily explain the post-GZK UHECRs.
