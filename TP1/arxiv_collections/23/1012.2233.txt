We analyze s-wave pion-nucleon scattering in a unitarized chiral effective
Lagrangian including all dimension two contact terms. We find that both the
S11(1535) and the S11(1650) are dynamically generated, but the S31(1620) is
not. We further discuss the structure of these dynamically generated
resonances.
