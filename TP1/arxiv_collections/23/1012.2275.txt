Elastic scattering cross sections of the $^{89}$Y($\alpha$,$\alpha$)$^{89}$Y
reaction have been measured at energies E$_{c.m.}$ = 15.51 and 18.63 MeV. The
high precision data for the semi-magic $N = 50$ nucleus $^{89}$Y are used to
derive a local potential and to evaluate the predictions of global and regional
$\alpha$-nucleus potentials. The variation of the elastic alpha scattering
cross sections along the $N = 50$ isotonic chain is investigated by a study of
the ratios of angular distributions for $^{89}$Y($\alpha$,$\alpha$)$^{89}$Y and
$^{92}$Mo($\alpha$,$\alpha$)$^{92}$Mo at E$_{c.m.} \approx$ 15.51 and 18.63
MeV. This ratio is a very sensitive probe at energies close to the Coulomb
barrier, where scattering data alone is usually not enough to characterize the
different potentials. Furthermore, $\alpha$-cluster states in $^{93}$Nb =
$^{89}$Y $\otimes$ $\alpha$ are investigated.
