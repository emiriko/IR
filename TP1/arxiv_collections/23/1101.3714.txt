We determine the conditions in which negative differential resistance (NDR)
appears in the C$_{60}$-based molecular device of [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 100},
036807 (2008)] by means of ab-initio electron-transport simulations. Our
calculations grant access to bias-dependent intrinsic properties of the
molecular device, such as electronic levels and their partial widths. We show
that these quantities depend on the molecule-molecule and molecule-electrode
interactions of the device. Hence, NDR can be tuned by modifying the bias
behavior of levels and widths using both types of interactions.
