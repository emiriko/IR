We present an item-based approach for collaborative filtering. We determine a
list of recommended items for a user by considering their previous purchases.
Additionally other features of the users could be considered such as page
views, search queries, etc... In particular we address the problem of
efficiently comparing items. Our algorithm can efficiently approximate an
estimate of the similarity between two items. As measure of similarity we use
an approximation of the Jaccard similarity that can be computed by constant
time operations and one bitwise OR. Moreover we improve the accuracy of the
similarity by introducing the concept of user preference for a given product,
which both takes into account multiple purchases and purchases of related
items. The product of the user preference and the Jaccard measure (or its
approximation) is used as a score for deciding whether a given product has to
be recommended.
