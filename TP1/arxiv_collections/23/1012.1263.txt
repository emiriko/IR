Large-mass bolometers are used in particle physics experiments to search for
rare processes. The energy threshold of such detectors plays a critical role in
their capability to search for dark matter interactions and rare nuclear
decays. We have developed a trigger and a pulse shape algorithm based on the
matched filter technique which, when applied to data from test bolometers of
the CUORE experiment, lowered the energy threshold from tens of keV to the few
keV region. The detection efficiency is in excess of 80%, and nearly all
nonphysical pulses are rejected.
