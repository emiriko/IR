We apply the adiabatic time-dependent density functional theory to magnetic
ci the real-space, real-time computational method. The standard formulas for
the MCD response and its A and B terms are derived from the observables in the
time-dependent wave function. We find the real time method is well suited for
calculating the overall spectrum, particularly at higher excitation energies
where individual excited states are numerous and overlapping. The MCD sum rules
are derived and interpreted in the real-time formalism; we find that they are
very useful for normalization purposes and assessing the accuracy of the
theory. The method is applied to MCD spectrum of C-60 using the adiabatic
energy functional from the local density approximation. The theory correctly
predicts the signs of the A and B terms for the lowest allowed excitations.
However, the magnitudes of the terms only show qualitative agreement with
experiment.
