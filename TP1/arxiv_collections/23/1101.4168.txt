Recent results on inclusive charmless semileptonic decays of B mesons are
reviewed. Emphasis is given to measurements on the recoil of fully
reconstructed B mesons, which allow to exploit several regions of phase space.
Preliminary averages of the CKM matrix element $|V_{ub}|$ from the Heavy
Flavour Working Group are shown, using four different theoretical calculations.
