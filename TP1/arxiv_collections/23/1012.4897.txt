Term rewriting has a significant presence in various areas, not least in
automated theorem proving where it is used as a proof technique. Many theorem
provers employ specialised proof tactics for rewriting. This results in an
interleaving between deduction and computation (i.e., rewriting) steps. If the
logic of reasoning supports partial functions, it is necessary that rewriting
copes with potentially ill-defined terms. In this paper, we provide a basis for
integrating rewriting with a deductive proof system that deals with
well-definedness. The definitions and theorems presented in this paper are the
theoretical foundations for an extensible rewriting-based prover that has been
implemented for the set theoretical formalism Event-B.
