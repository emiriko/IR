We consider surface diffusion of a single particle, which performs
site-to-site under-barrier hopping, fulfils intrasite motion between the ground
and the first excited states within a quantum well, and interacts with surface
phonons. On the basis of quantum kinetic equations for one-particle
distribution functions obtained earlier we study the coherent and incoherent
motion of the adparticle. In the latter case we derive the generalized
diffusion coefficients and study various dynamic regimes of the adparticle. The
critical values of the coupling constant $G_{cr}(T,\Omega)$, which separate
domains with possible recrossing from those with the monotonic motion of the
adparticle, are calculated as functions of a temperature $T$ and a vibrational
frequency $\Omega$. These domains are found to coincide with the regions where
the experimentally observed diffusion coefficients change its behavior from
weakly dependent on $T$ to quite a sensitive function of the temperature. We
also evaluate the off-diagonal (relative to the site labels) distribution
functions both in the Markovian limit and when the memory effects become
important. The obtained results are discussed in the context of the "long
tails" problem of the generalized diffusion coefficients, the
recrossing/multiple crossing phenomena, and an eventual interrelation between
the adparticle dynamics at short times and the temperature dependence of the
diffusion coefficients measured experimentally.
