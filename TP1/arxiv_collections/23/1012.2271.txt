We present experimental results on the formation of supersonic, radiatively
cooled jets driven by pressure due to the toroidal magnetic field generated by
the 1.5 MA, 250 ns current from the MAGPIE generator. The morphology of the jet
produced in the experiments is relevant to astrophysical jet scenarios in which
a jet on the axis of a magnetic cavity is collimated by a toroidal magnetic
field as it expands into the ambient medium. The jets in the experiments have
similar Mach number, plasma beta and cooling parameter to those in protostellar
jets. Additionally the Reynolds, magnetic Reynolds and Peclet numbers are much
larger than unity, allowing the experiments to be scaled to astrophysical
flows. The experimental configuration allows for the generation of episodic
magnetic cavities, suggesting that periodic fluctuations near the source may be
responsible for some of the variability observed in astrophysical jets.
Preliminary measurements of kinetic, magnetic and Poynting energy of the jets
in our experiments are presented and discussed, together with estimates of
their temperature and trapped toroidal magnetic field.
