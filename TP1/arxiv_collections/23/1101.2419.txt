High current through cold YBaCuO produced effects on the mounting and on
remote piezoelectric detectors. The effects were not observed with warm YBaCuO
or other cold or warm materials. Two hypotheses are evaluated for the direct
mechanical forces: a hypothetical vacuum field, and a model in which boil off
of liquid nitrogen acts as a thruster. Data from the remote detector are
compared with data from Podkletnov. Properties of a field required to explain
data with the remote detectors are described.
