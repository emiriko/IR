We study the scattering of magnetoinductive plane waves by internal
(external) capacitive (inductive) defects coupled to a one-dimensional
split-ring resonator array. We examine a number of simple defect configurations
where Fano resonances occur and study the behavior of the transmission
coefficient as a function of the controllable external parameters. We find that
for embedded capacitive defects, the addition of a small amount of coupling to
second neighbors is necessary for the occurrence of Fano resonance. For
external inductive defects, Fano resonances are commonplace, and they can be
tuned by changing the relative orientation or distance between the defect and
the SSR array.
