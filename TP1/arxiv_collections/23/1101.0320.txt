We characterize gapless edge modes in translation invariant topological
insulators. We show that the edge mode spectrum is a continuous deformation of
the spectrum of a certain gluing function defining the occupied state bundle
over the Brillouin zone (BZ). Topologically non-trivial gluing functions,
corresponding to non-trivial bundles, then yield edge modes exhibiting spectral
flow. We illustrate our results for the case of chiral edge states in two
dimensional Chern insulators, as well as helical edges in quantum spin Hall
states.
