We found that very strong negative optical pressure can be induced in
plasmonic cavities by LC resonance. This interesting effect could be described
qualitatively by a Lagrangian model which shows that the negative optical
pressure is driven by the internal inductance and the kinetic energy of the
conduction electrons. If the metal is replaced by perfect conductors, the
optical pressure becomes much smaller and positive.
