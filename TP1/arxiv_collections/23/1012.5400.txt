The article describes the identification of hadronically decaying tau leptons
in ppbar collisions at 1.96 TeV collected by the DZero detector at the Fermilab
Tevatron. After a brief description of the motivations and the challenges of
considering tau leptons in high energy hadronic collisions, details of the tau
reconstruction and identification will be discussed. The challenges associated
for tau energy measurements in an hadronic environment will be presented
including approaches to deal with such measurements.
