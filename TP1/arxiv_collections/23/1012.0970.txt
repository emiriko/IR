The general aim of this paper is to extend the Modal-Hamiltonian
interpretation of quantum mechanics to the case of relativistic quantum
mechanics with gauge U(1) elds. In this case we propose that the actual- valued
observables are the Casimir operators of the Poincar\'e group and of the group
U(1) of the internal symmetry of the theory. Moreover, we also show that the
magnitudes that acquire actual values in the relativistic and in the
non-relativistic cases are correctly related through the adequate limit.
