The SPIRAL facility at GANIL, operational since 2001, is described briefly.
The diverse physics program using the re-accelerated (1.2 to 25 MeV/u) beams
ranging from He to Kr and the instrumentation specially developed for their
exploitation are presented. Results of these studies, using both direct and
compound processes, addressing various questions related to the existence of
exotic states of nuclear matter, evolution of new "magic numbers", tunnelling
of exotic nuclei, neutron correlations, exotic pathways in astrophysical sites
and characterization of the continuum are discussed. The future prospects for
the facility and the path towards SPIRAL2, a next generation ISOL facility, are
also briefly presented.
