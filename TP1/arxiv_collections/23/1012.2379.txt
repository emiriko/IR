We study the electronic properties of h-BN/graphene/h-BN ABC-stacked trilayer
systems using tight binding and DFT methods. We comment on the recent work of
Ramasubramaniam et al. (arxiv:1011.2489) whose results seem to be in
disagreement with our recent calculations. Detailed analysis reaffirms our
previous conclusions.
