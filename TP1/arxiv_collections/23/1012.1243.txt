We provide a simple proof of a generalization of the multivariate
Chu-Vandermonde identity recently derived in Favaro et al. (2010a). Exploiting
known results for rising factorials and fourth Lauricella polynomials we show
resorting to Laplace-type integral representation of the fourth Lauricella
function may be avoided.
