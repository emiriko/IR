There has been increased interest in the use and manipulation of optical
fields to address challenging problems that have traditionally been approached
with microwave electronics. Some examples that benefit from the low
transmission loss, agile modulation and large bandwidths accessible with
coherent optical systems include signal distribution, arbitrary waveform
generation, and novel imaging. We extend these advantages to demonstrate a
microwave generator based on a high-Q optical resonator and a frequency comb
functioning as an optical-to-microwave divider. This provides a 10 GHz
electrical signal with fractional frequency instability <8e-16 at 1 s, a value
comparable to that produced by the best microwave oscillators, but without the
need for cryogenic temperatures. Such a low-noise source can benefit radar
systems, improve the bandwidth and resolution of communications and digital
sampling systems, and be valuable for large baseline interferometry, precision
spectroscopy and the realization of atomic time.
