We discuss the application of a strong-coupling expansion (perturbation
theory in the hopping) for studying light-Fermi-heavy-Bose (like
$^{40}$K-$^{87}$Rb) mixtures in optical lattices. We use the strong-coupling
method to evaluate the efficiency for pre-forming molecules, the entropy per
particle and the thermal fluctuations. We show that within the strong
interaction regime (and at high temperature), the strong-coupling expansion is
an economical way to study this problem. In some cases, it remains valid even
down to low temperatures. Because the computational effort is minimal, the
strong-coupling approach allows us to work with much larger system sizes, where
boundary effects can be eliminated, which is particularly important at higher
temperatures. Since the strong-coupling approach is so efficient and accurate,
it allows one to rapidly scan through parameter space in order to optimize the
pre-forming of molecules on a lattice (by choosing the lattice depth and
interspecies attraction). Based on the strong-coupling calculations, we test
the thermometry scheme based on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and find
the scheme gives accurate temperature estimation even at very low temperature.
We believe this approach and the calculation results will be useful in the
design of the next generation of experiments, and will hopefully lead to the
ability to form dipolar matter in the quantum degenerate regime.
