We analyze the intrinsic polarization of two classical Be stars in the
process of losing their circumstellar disks via a Be to normal B star
transition originally reported by Wisniewski et al. During each of five
polarimetric outbursts which interrupt these disk-loss events, we find that the
ratio of the polarization across the Balmer jump (BJ+/BJ-) versus the V-band
polarization traces a distinct loop structure as a function of time. Since the
polarization change across the Balmer jump is a tracer of the innermost disk
density whereas the V-band polarization is a tracer of the total scattering
mass of the disk, we suggest such correlated loop structures in Balmer jump-V
band polarization diagrams (BJV diagrams) provide a unique diagnostic of the
radial distribution of mass within Be disks. We use the 3-D Monte Carlo
radiation transfer code HDUST to reproduce the observed clockwise loops simply
by turning "on/off" the mass decretion from the disk. We speculate that
counter-clockwise loop structures we observe in BJV diagrams might be caused by
the mass decretion rate changing between subsequent "on/off" sequences.
Applying this new diagnostic to a larger sample of Be disk systems will provide
insight into the time-dependent nature of each system's stellar decretion rate.
