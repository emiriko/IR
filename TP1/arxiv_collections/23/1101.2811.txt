Ni-Mn-Ga films in the austenite and the martensite structures at room
temperature have been obtained using the DC magnetron sputtering technique. Two
elaboration processes were studied. A first batch of samples was deposited
using a resist sacrificial layer in order to release the film from the
substrate before vacuum annealing. This process leads to polycrystalline films
with a strong (022) fiber texture. The martensitic phase transformation of such
polycrystalline freestanding films has been studied by optical and scanning
electron microscopy. A second batch of samples was grown epitaxially on
(100)MgO substrates using different deposition temperatures. The texture has
been analyzed with four-circle X-ray diffraction. Epitaxial films crystallized
both in the austenite and the martensite structures at room temperature have
been studied.
