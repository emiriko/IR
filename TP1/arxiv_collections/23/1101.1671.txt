We show how to create maximally entangled dressed states of a weakly
interacting multi-partite quantum system by suitably tuning an external,
periodic driving field. Floquet theory allows us to relate, in a transparent
manner, the occurrence of entanglement resonances to avoided crossings in the
spectrum of quasi-energies, tantamount of well-defined conditions for the
controlled, resonant interaction of particles. We demonstrate the universality
of the phenomenon for periodically driven, weakly interacting two-level
systems, by considering different interaction mechanisms and driving profiles.
In particular, we show that entanglement resonances are a generic feature of
driven, multi-partite systems, widely independent of the details of the
interaction mechanism. Our results are therefore particularly relevant for
experiments on interacting two-level systems, in which the microscopic
realization of the inter-particle coupling is unknown.
