We have extended our recent molecular-dynamic simulations of memristors to
include the effect of thermal inhomogeneities on mobile ionic species appearing
during operation of the device. Simulations show a competition between an
attractive short-ranged interaction between oxygen vacancies and an enhanced
local temperature in creating/destroying the conducting oxygen channels. Such a
competition would strongly affect the performance of the memristive devices.
