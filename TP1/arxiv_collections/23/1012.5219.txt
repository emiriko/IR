The average transverse momentum dependence on multiplicity shows in many
experiments at center of mass energies ranging from 22 to 7000 GeV a slope
change at a charged particle rapidity density constant within systematic
uncertainties. We find correlated signals which together with the slope change
may indicate a transition to a new mechanism of particles production.
