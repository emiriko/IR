The stationary problem of light interaction with a dense collection of
two-level atoms embedded in a dielectric is treated semiclassically. The effect
of dielectric absorption on the phenomenon of intrinsic optical bistability is
discussed in terms of the complex local-field enhancement factor. The
calculations accounting propagation effects (nonlocal regime) show that even
low dielectric absorption results in elimination of response instabilities.
