We present a rigidity analysis on a large number of X-ray crystal structures
of the enzyme HIV-1 protease using the 'pebble game' algorithm of the software
FIRST. We find that although the rigidity profile remains similar across a
comprehensive set of high resolution structures, the profile changes
significantly in the presence of an inhibitor. Our study shows that the action
of the inhibitors is to restrict the flexibility of the beta-hairpin flaps
which allow access to the active site. The results are discussed in the context
of full molecular dynamics simulations as well as data from NMR experiments.
