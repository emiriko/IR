We present experimental and theoretical results on hole-spin dynamics in bulk
GaAs after ultrafast optical excitation. The experimental differential
transmission are compared with a dynamical calculation of the momentum-resolved
hole distributions, which includes the carrier-carrier, carrier-phonon and
carrier-impurity interaction at the level of Boltzmann scattering integrals. We
obtain good agreement with the experimentally determined hole-spin relaxation
times, but point out that depending on how the spin-polarization dynamics is
extracted, deviations from an exponential decay at short times occur. We also
study theoretically the behavior of the spin-relaxation for heavily p-doped
GaAs at low temperatures.
