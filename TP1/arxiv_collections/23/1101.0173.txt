In this paper, we propose a novel digital watermarking scheme in DCT domain
based fuzzy inference system and the human visual system to adapt the embedding
strength of different blocks. Firstly, the original image is divided into some
8 \times 8 blocks, and then fuzzy inference system according to different
textural features and luminance of each block decide adaptively different
embedding strengths. The watermark detection adopts correlation technology.
Experimental results show that the proposed scheme has good imperceptibility
and high robustness to common image processing operators.
