Recent measurements of high E_T jet production at the Tevatron are presented.
These data provide stringent tests of perturbative QCD as well as constraints
on parton distribution functions, the strong coupling constant and models
implemented in event generators. Measurements of inclusive jet and multijet
production as well as the associated production of jets with the electroweak
bosons obtained by both the D0 and CDF collaborations are reviewed.
