We answer a question by Vasco Brattka and Guido Gherardi by proving that the
Weihrauch-lattice is not a Brouwer algebra. The computable Weihrauch-lattice is
also not a Heyting algebra, but the continuous Weihrauch-lattice is. We further
investigate the existence of infinite infima and suprema, as well as embeddings
of the Medvedev-degrees into the Weihrauch-degrees.
