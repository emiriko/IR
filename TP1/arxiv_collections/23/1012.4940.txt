The metal-poor, fundamental-mode (P0) and first-overtone (P1) Cepheids in the
dwarf galaxies IC 1613, WLM, Pegasus, Sextans A, Sextans B, and Leo A are
compared with the about equally metal-poor Cepheids of the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC). The period-color (P-C) and period-luminosity (P-L) relations of
the seven galaxies are indistinguishable, but differ distinctly from those in
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the solar neighborhood. Adopting
(m-M)^{0}_{SMC}=18.93 from independent evidence, one can determine reliable
distance moduli for the other dwarf galaxies of (m-M)^{0} = 24.34+/-0.03,
24.95+/-0.03, 24.87+/-0.06, 25.60+/-0.03 (mean for Sextans A & B), and
24.59+/-0.03, respectively.
