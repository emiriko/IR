The precise measurement of the cross section e+e- --> pi+ pi-(gamma) from
threshold to an energy of 3 GeV, using events with Initial State Radiation
(ISR) collected with the BABAR detector, is presented. The ISR luminosity is
determined from a study of the leptonic process e+e- --> mu+ mu- gamma(gamma),
and the method is tested by the comparison with the next-to-leading order (NLO)
QED prediction. The leading-order hadronic contribution to the muon magnetic
anomaly calculated using the BABAR pi pi cross section measured from threshold
to 1.8 GeV is (514.1 +- 2.2(stat) +- 3.1(syst)) * 10^{-10}. Other results on
ISR multihadronic cross sections from BABAR are presented.
