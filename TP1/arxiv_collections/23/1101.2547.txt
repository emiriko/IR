The Hoyle state plays a crucial role in the hydrogen burning of stars heavier
than our sun and in the production of carbon and other elements necessary for
life. This excited state of the carbon-12 nucleus was postulated by Hoyle [1]
as a necessary ingredient for the fusion of three alpha particles to produce
carbon at stellar temperatures. Although the Hoyle state was seen
experimentally more than a half century ago [2,3], nuclear theorists have not
yet uncovered the nature of this state from first principles. In this letter we
report the first ab initio calculation of the low-lying states of carbon-12
using supercomputer lattice simulations and a theoretical framework known as
effective field theory. In addition to the ground state and excited spin-2
state, we find a resonance at -85(3) MeV with all of the properties of the
Hoyle state and in agreement with the experimentally observed energy. These
lattice simulations provide insight into the structure of this unique state and
new clues as to the amount of fine-tuning needed in nature for the production
of carbon in stars.
