We found that the current-voltage characteristics of the single-layer
graphene field-effect transistors exhibit an intriguing feature - an abrupt
change of the current near zero gate bias at elevated temperatures T > 500 K.
The strength of the effect - referred to as the "memory step" by analogy with
the "memory dips" - known phenomenon in electron glasses - depends on the rate
of the voltage sweep. The slower the sweep - the more pronounced is the step in
the current. Despite differences in examined graphene transistor
characteristics, the "memory step" always appears near zero gate bias. The
effect is reproducible and preserved after device aging. A similar feature has
been previously observed in electronic glasses albeit at cryogenic temperatures
and with opposite dependence on the rate of the voltage sweep. The observed
"memory step" can be related to the slow relaxation processes in graphene. This
new characteristic of electron transport in graphene can be used for
applications in high-temperature sensors and switches.
