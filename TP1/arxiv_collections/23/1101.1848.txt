We wished to analyse a sample of observations from the XMM-Newton Science
Archive to search for evidence of exospheric solar wind charge exchange (SWCX)
emission. We analysed 3012 observations up to and including revolution 1773.
The method employed extends from that of the previously published paper by
these authors on this topic. We detect temporal variability in the diffuse
X-ray background within a narrow low-energy band and contrast this to a
continuum. The low-energy band was chosen to represent the key indicators of
charge exchange emission and the continuum was expected to be free of SWCX.
Approximately 3.4 % of observations studied are affected. We discuss our
results with reference to the XMM-Newton mission. We further investigate
remarkable cases by considering the state of the solar wind and the orientation
of XMM-Newton at the time of these observations. We present a method to
approximate the expected emission from observations, based on given solar wind
parameters taken from an upstream solar wind monitor. We also compare the
incidence of SWCX cases with solar activity. We present a comprehensive study
of the majority of the suitable and publically available XMM-Newton Science
Archive to date, with respect to the occurrence of SWCX enhancements. We
present our SWCX-affected subset of this dataset. The mean exospheric-SWCX flux
observed within this SWCX-affected subset was 15.4 keV cm-2 s-1 sr-1 in the
energy band 0.25 to 2.5 keV. Exospheric SWCX is preferentially detected when
XMM-Newton observes through the subsolar region of the Earth's magnetosheath.
The model developed to estimate the expected emission returns fluxes within a
factor of a few of the observed values in the majority of cases, with a mean
value at 83 %.
