Context --- The classical method to infer microturbulent velocity in stellar
spectra requires that the abundances of the iron lines are not correlated with
the observed equivalent widths. An alternative method, requiring the use of the
expected line strength, is often used to by-pass the risk of spurious slopes
due to the correlation between the errors in abundance and equivalent width.
Aims --- To compare the two methods and identify pros and cons and
applicability to the typical practical cases. Methods --- I performed a test
with a grid of synthetic spectra, including instrumental broadening and
Poissonian noise. For all these spectra, microturbulent velocity has been
derived by using the two approaches and compared with the original value with
which the synthetic spectra have been generated. Results --- The two methods
provide similar results for spectra with SNR$ > 70, while for lower SNR both
approaches underestimate the true microturbulent velocity, depending of the SNR
and the possible selection of the lines based on the equivalent width errors.
Basically, the values inferred by using the observed equivalent widths better
agree with those of the synthetic spectra. In fact, the method based on the
expected line strength is not totally free from a bias that can heavily affect
the determination of microturbulent velocity. Finally, I recommend to use the
classical approach (based on the observed equivalent widths) to infer this
parameter. In cases of full spectroscopical determination of all the
atmospherical parameters, the difference between the two approaches is reduced,
leading to an absolute difference in the derived iron abundances of less than
0.1 dex.
