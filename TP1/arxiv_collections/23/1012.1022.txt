A brief review is first presented of attempts to predict stable multiquark
states within current models of hadron spectroscopy. Then a model combining
flip-flop and connected Steiner trees is introduced and shown to lead to stable
multiquarks, in particular for some configurations involving several heavy
quarks and bearing exotic quantum numbers.
