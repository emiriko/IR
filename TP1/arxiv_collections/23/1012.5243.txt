We develop a new method to determine oscillator strength values of atomic
absorption lines with state-of-the-art detailed spectral synthesis calculations
of the optical spectrum of the Sun and of standard spectral reference stars. We
update the log(gf)-values of 911 neutral lines observed in the KPNO-FTS flux
spectrum of the Sun and high-resolution echelle spectra (R=80,000) of Procyon
(F5 IV-V) and {\epsilon} Eri (K2 V) observed with large signal-to-noise (S/N)
ratios of ~2,000 using the new Mercator-Hermes spectrograph at La Palma
Observatory (Spain). We find for 483 Fe I, 85 Ni I, and 51 Si I absorption
lines in the sample a systematic over-estimation of the literature
log(gf)-values with central line depths below 15 %. We employ a curve-of-growth
analysis technique to test the accuracy of the new oscillator strength values
and compare calculated equivalent line widths to the Moore, Minnaert, &
Houtgast atlas of the Sun. The online SpectroWeb database at
http://spectra.freeshell.org interactively displays the observed and synthetic
spectra and provides the new log(gf)-values together with important atomic line
data. The graphical database is under development for stellar reference spectra
of every spectral sub-class observed with large spectral resolution and S/N
ratios.
