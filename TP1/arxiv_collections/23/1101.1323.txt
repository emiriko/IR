We address the physics of nematic liquid crystalline elastomers randomly
crosslinked in the isotropic state. To do this, we construct a phenomenological
effective replica Hamiltonian in terms of two order-parameter fields: one for
the vulcanization, the other for nematic alignment. Using a Gaussian
variational approach, we analyze both thermal and quenched fluctuations of the
local nematic order, and find that, even for low temperatures, the
macroscopically isotropic polydomain state is stabilized by the network
heterogeneity. For sufficiently strong disorder and low enough temperature, our
theory predicts unusual, short-range oscillatory structure in (i.e.,
anti-alignment of) the local nematic order. The present approach, which
naturally takes into account the compliant, thermally fluctuating and
heterogeneous features of elastomeric networks, can also be applied to other
types of randomly crosslinked solids.
