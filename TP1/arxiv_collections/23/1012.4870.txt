This article provides an alternative perspective for measuring author impact
by applying PageRank algorithm to a coauthorship network. A weighted PageRank
algorithm considering citation and coauthorship network topology is proposed.
We test this algorithm under different damping factors by evaluating author
impact in the informetrics research community. In addition, we also compare
this weighted PageRank with the h-index, citation, and program committee (PC)
membership of the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics
(ISSI) conferences. Findings show that this weighted PageRank algorithm
provides reliable results in measuring author impact.
