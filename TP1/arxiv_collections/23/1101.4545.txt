Contrary to classical physics, which was strongly objective i.e. could be
interpreted as a description of mind-independent reality, standard quantum
mechanics (SQM) is only weakly objective, that is to say, its statements,
though intersubjectively valid, still merely refer to operations of the mind.
Essentially, in fact, they are predictive of observations. On the view that SQM
is universal conventional realism is thereby refuted. It is shown however that
this does not rule out a broader form of realism, called here 'open realism',
restoring the notion of mind-independent reality.
