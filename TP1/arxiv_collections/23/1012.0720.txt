It is shown that the magnetic current-driven (`kink-type') instability
produces flow and field patterns with helicity and even with \alpha-effect but
only if the magnetic background field possesses non-vanishing current helicity
\bar{\vec{B}}\cdot curl \bar{\vec{B}} by itself. Fields with positive
large-scale current helicity lead to negative small-scale kinetic helicity. The
resulting \alpha-effect is positive. These results are very strict for
cylindric setups without <i>z/I>-dependence of the background fields. The sign
rules also hold for the more complicated cases in spheres where the toroidal
fields are the result of the action of differential rotation (induced from
fossil poloidal fields) at least for the case that the global rotation is
switched off after the onset of the instability.
