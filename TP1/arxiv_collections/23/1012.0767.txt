In 2009, the RHIC spin physics program completed the first data taking period
of polarized $\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 500$ GeV, accumulating
~12 pb$^{-1}$ with ~39% beam polarization. This opens a new era in the study of
the spin-flavor structure of the proton based on the production of $W^{-(+)}$
bosons. $W^{-(+)}$ bosons are produced in $\bar{u}+d (\bar{d}+u)$ collisions
and can be detected through their leptonic decays,
$e^-+\bar{\nu_e}(e^++\nu_e)$, where only the respective charged lepton is
measured. The discrimination of $\bar{u}+d$ and $\bar{d}+u$ quark combinations
requires distinguishing the charge sign of high $p_T$ electrons and positrons,
which in turn requires precise tracking information. At mid-rapidity, STAR
relies on the Time Projection Chamber. At forward rapidity, new tracking
capabilities will be provided by the Forward GEM Tracker, consisting of six
triple-GEM detectors which are under construction. The suppression of QCD
background over W boson signal events by several orders of magnitude is
accomplished by using the highly segmented STAR Electromagnetic Calorimeters to
impose isolation criteria suppressing jet events, and vetoing dijet events
based on the measured away side energy. The status of the STAR results on the
first measurements of the cross section and single spin asymmetry for
$W^{-(+)}$ boson production in polarized $\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ collisions will be
presented along with a discussion of prospects involving the STAR Forward GEM
Tracker.
