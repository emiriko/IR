The low energy spin excitations of La(2-x)Sr(x)NiO(4), x = 0.275 and 1/3,
have been investigated by unpolarized- and polarized-inelastic neutron
scattering from single crystals. A pattern of magnetic diffuse scattering is
observed in both compositions, and is consistent with quasi-one-dimensional AFM
spin correlations along the charge stripes. Analysis of the energy lineshape
for x = 1/3 indicates that the diffuse scattering is inelastic with a
characteristic energy of 1.40 +/- 0.07 meV. There is no discernible difference
between the diffuse scattering from x = 0.275 and x = 1/3, suggesting that it
is an intrinsic property of the charge stripes.
