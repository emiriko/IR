The context of this work is the design of a software, called MEMSALab,
dedicated to the automatic derivation of multiscale models of arrays of micro-
and nanosystems. In this domain a model is a partial differential equation.
Multiscale methods approximate it by another partial differential equation
which can be numerically simulated in a reasonable time. The challenge consists
in taking into account a wide range of geometries combining thin and periodic
structures with the possibility of multiple nested scales.
  In this paper we present a transformation language that will make the
development of MEMSALab more feasible. It is proposed as a Maple package for
rule-based programming, rewriting strategies and their combination with
standard Maple code. We illustrate the practical interest of this language by
using it to encode two examples of multiscale derivations, namely the two-scale
limit of the derivative operator and the two-scale model of the stationary heat
equation.
