We study the group of symplectic birational transformations of the plane. It
is proved that this group is generated by $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$, the
torus and a special map of order $5$, as it was conjectured by A. Usnich.
  Then we consider a special subgroup $H$, of finite type, defined over any
field which admits a surjective morphism to the Thompson group of piecewise
linear automorphisms of $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We prove that the presentation for this
group conjectured by Usnich is correct.
