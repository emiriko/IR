The approximate nature of the adaptive-optics time constant measurements with
MASS is examined. The calibration coefficient C derived from numerical
simulations of polychromatic scintillation shows dependence on the height of
the turbulence layer, wind speed, and seeing. The previously recommended value
of C=1.27 is a good match to typical conditions, while C can vary from 0.6 to
1.6 in other circumstances. For two nights, MASS was compared with the time
constant measured with adaptive optics, and the expected agreement was found.
We show that the single-layer approximation used in some AO systems to derive
the AO time constant can give wrong results. A better approach is to estimate
it from the speed of focus variation (the FADE method). The analysis of the
speed of scintillation developed recently by V.~Kornilov will lead to more
accurate measurements of the AO time constant with MASS.
