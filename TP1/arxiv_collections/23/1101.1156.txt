We investigate quantum state transfer in XY spin chains and propose a
recursive procedure to construct the nonuniform couplings of these chains with
arbitrary length to achieve perfect state transfer(PST). We show that this
method is capable of finding all possible coupling schemes for PST. These
schemes, without external control fields, only involve preengineered couplings
but not dynamical control of them, so they can be simply realized
experimentally. The analytical solutions provide all information for coupling
design.
