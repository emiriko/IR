In the present paper we construct a self-consistent theory, interpreting the
observational properties of RBS1774. It is well known that the distribution
function of relativistic particles is one-dimensional at the pulsar surface.
However, cyclotron instability causes an appearance of transverse momenta of
relativistic electrons, which as a result, start to radiate in the synchrotron
regime. We study the process of the quasi-linear diffusion developed by means
of the cyclotron instability on the basis of the Vlasov's kinetic equation.
This mechanism provides generation of measured optical and X-ray emission on
the light cylinder lengthscales. A different approach of the synchrotron theory
is considered, giving the spectral energy distribution that is in a good
agreement with the XMM-Newton observational data. We also provide the possible
explanation of the spectral feature at 0.7keV, in the framework of the model.
