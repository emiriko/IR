The many-body space fractional quantum system is studied using the density
matrix method. We give the new results of the Thomas-Fermi model, and obtain
the quantum pressure of the free electron gas. We also show the validity of the
Hohenberg-Kohn theory in the space fractional quantum mechanics and generalize
the density functional theory to the fractional quantum mechanics.
