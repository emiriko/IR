We demonstrate a scalable new ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) technique based
on the spin-orbit interaction. An alternating current drives FMR in uniform
ferromagnetic structures patterned from the dilute magnetic semiconductors
(Ga,Mn)As and (Ga,Mn)(As,P). This allows the direct measurement of magnetic
anisotropy coefficients and damping parameters for individual nano-bars. By
analysing the ferromagnetic resonance lineshape, we perform vector magnetometry
on the current-induced driving field, observing contributions with symmetries
of both the Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit interactions.
