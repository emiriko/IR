Our preferences depend on the circumstances in which we reveal them. We will
introduce a dependency which allows us to illustrate the relation between the
possibility of winning of particular candidates in a quantum election and the
type of preference. It occurs that if voters start to clearly prefer one of the
candidates, the significance of intransitive preferences in the quantum model
decreases. This dynamic change cannot be observed in the case of the classical
model.
