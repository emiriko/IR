The decoration or iteration transformation was widely applied to solve
exactly the magnetic spin models in one-dimensional and two-dimensional
lattice. The motif of this letter is to extend the decoration transformation
approach for models that describe interacting electron systems instead of spin
magnetic systems, one illustrative model to be studied, will be the spinless
fermion model on diamond chain. Using the decoration transformation, we are
able to solve this model exactly. The phase diagram of this model was explored
at zero temperature as well as the thermodynamics properties of the model for
any particle density. The particular case when particle-hole symmetry is
satisfied was also discussed.
