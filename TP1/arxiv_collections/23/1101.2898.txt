The CDF collaboration recently reported an upper limit on boosted top pair
production and noted a significant excess above the estimated background of
events with two ultra-massive boosted jets. We discuss the interpretation of
the measurement and its fundamental implications. In case new physics is
involved, the most naive contribution is from a new particle produced with a
cross section that is a few times higher than that of the top quark and a
sizable hadronic branching ratio. We quantify the resulting tension of a
possible larger top pair cross section with the absence of excess found in
events with one massive boosted jet and missing energy. The measured planar
flow distribution shows deviation from CDF's Pythia QCD prediction at high
planarity, while we find a somewhat smaller deviation when comparing with other
Monte Carlo tools. As a simple toy model, we analyze the case of a light gluino
with R-parity violation and show that it can be made consistent with the data.
