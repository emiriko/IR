Querying over XML elements using keyword search is steadily gaining
popularity. The traditional similarity measure is widely employed in order to
effectively retrieve various XML documents. A number of authors have already
proposed different similarity-measure methods that take advantage of the
structure and content of XML documents. They do not, however, consider the
similarity between latent semantic information of element texts and that of
keywords in a query. Although many algorithms on XML element search are
available, some of them have the high computational complexity due to searching
a huge number of elements. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that makes
use of the semantic similarity between elements instead of between entire XML
documents, considering not only the structure and content of an XML document,
but also semantic information of namespaces in elements. We compare our
algorithm with the three other algorithms by testing on the real datasets. The
experiments have demonstrated that our proposed method is able to improve the
query accuracy, as well as to reduce the running time.
