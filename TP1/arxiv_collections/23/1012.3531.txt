Noise-based logic, by utilizing its multidimensional logic hyperspace, has
significant potential for low-power parallel operations in beyond-Moore-chips.
However universal gates for Boolean logic thus far had to rely on either time
averaging to distinguish signals from each other or, alternatively, on squeezed
logic signals, where the logic-high was represented by a random process and the
logic-low was a zero signal. A major setback is that squeezed logic variables
are unable to work in the hyperspace, because the logic-low zero value sets the
hyperspace product vector to zero. This paper proposes Boolean universal logic
gates that alleviate such shortcomings. They are able to work with non-squeezed
logic values where both the high and low values are encoded into nonzero,
bipolar, independent random telegraph waves. Non-squeezed universal Boolean
logic gates for spike-based brain logic are also shown. The advantages vs.
disadvantages of the two logic types are compared.
