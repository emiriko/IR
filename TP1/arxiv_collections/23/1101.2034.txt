(abridged) We perform a detailed investigation of sources from the Cold Cores
Catalogue of Planck Objects (C3PO). Our goal is to probe the reliability of the
detections, validate the separation between warm and cold dust emission
components, provide the first glimpse at the nature, internal morphology and
physical characterictics of the Planck-detected sources. We focus on a
sub-sample of ten sources from the C3PO list, selected to sample different
environments, from high latitude cirrus to nearby (150pc) and remote (2kpc)
molecular complexes. We present Planck surface brightness maps and derive the
dust temperature, emissivity spectral index, and column densities of the
fields. With the help of higher resolution Herschel and AKARI continuum
observations and molecular line data, we investigate the morphology of the
sources and the properties of the substructures at scales below the Planck beam
size.
