We obtained new nonrelativistic expression for the dynamical van der Waals
atom -surface interaction energy of very convenient form for different
applications. It is shown that classical result (Ferrell and Ritchie, 1980)
holds only for a very slowly moving atom. In general case, the van der Waals
atom -surface interaction energy manifests strong nonlinear dependence on
velocity and distance. In close vicinity of metal and dielectric surfaces and
velocities from 1 to 10 Bohr units the dynamical van der Waals potential proves
to be significantly lower that in static case and goes to the static values
with increasing distance and (or) decreasing velocity.
