In standard textbooks of college physics, the Work Energy Theorem is usually
presented for inertial frames of references and it is clear that energy is
conserved when there is not net work of interaction forces. But what happens
when energy and work are calculated in a non inertial frame of reference? This
important issue is frequently avoided. Recently an extension of the theorem was
derived for reference systems in traslational motion. Here we address the
theorem for two observers in relative rotation showing explicitly the
differences for them. We illustrate the problem with practical examples.
