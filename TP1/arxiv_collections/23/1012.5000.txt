Basic questions concerning phononless resonant capture of monoenergetic
electron antineutrinos (M\"ossbauer antineutrinos) emitted in bound-state
beta-decay in the 3H - 3He system are discussed. It is shown that lattice
expansion and contraction after the transformation of the nucleus will
drastically reduce the probability of phononless transitions and that various
solid-state effects will cause large line broadening. As a possible
alternative, the rare-earth system 163Ho - 163Dy is favoured.
M\"ossbauer-antineutrino experiments could be used to gain new and deep
insights into several basic problems in neutrino physics.
