The double-peak structure observed in soft-hard dihadron correlations was
recently studied intensively in order to learn more about the jet-induced
medium excitation in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Experimental data
shows that the double-peak structure obtained for soft trigger particles
coalesces into one peak for harder trigger particles. We demonstrate that this
effect occurs when averaging over many jet events in a transversally expanding
background, while a hot spot scenario always leads to two distinct peaks. This
suggests to study soft-hard correlations induced by heavy-flavor jets with
those generated by light-flavor jets at RHIC and LHC in order to really
disentangle medium effects from jets.
