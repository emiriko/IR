The time-space evolution of the field is described by the transport equation
for the 2-dimensional wave energy spectrum density, S(x,t), spread in the
space, x, and time, t. This equation has the forcing named the source function,
F, depending on both the wave spectrum, S, and the external wave-making
factors: local wind, W(x, t), and local current, U(x, t). The source function
contains certain physical mechanisms responsible for a wave spectrum evolution.
It is used to distinguish three terms in function F: the wind-wave energy
exchange mechanism, In; the energy conservative mechanism of nonlinear
wave-wave interactions, Nl; and the wave energy loss mechanism, Dis.
Differences in mathematical representation of the source function terms
determine general differences between wave models. The problem is to derive
analytical representations for the source function terms said above from the
fundamental wave equations. Basing on publications of numerous authors and on
the last two decades studies of the author, the optimized versions of the all
principal terms for the source function, F, have been constructed. Detailed
description of these results is presented. The final version of the source
function is tested in academic test tasks and verified by implementing it into
numerical shells of the well known wind wave models: WAM and WAVEWATCH.
Procedures of testing and verification are presented and described in details.
The superiority of the proposed new source function in accuracy and speed of
calculations is shown. Finally, the directions of future developments in this
topic are proposed, and some possible applications of numerical wind wave
models are shown, aimed to study both the wind wave physics and global
wind-wave variability at the climate scale, including mechanical energy
exchange between wind, waves, and upper water layer.
