We review the observational evidence for extra mixing in stars on the red
giant branch (RGB) and discuss why thermohaline mixing is a strong candidate
mechanism. We recall the simple phenomenological description of thermohaline
mixing, and aspects of mixing in stars in general. We use observations of M3 to
constrain the form of the thermohaline diffusion coefficient and any associated
free parameters. This is done by matching [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] along the RGB of
M3. After taking into account a presumed initial primordial bimodality of
[C/Fe] in the CN-weak and CN-strong stars our thermohaline mixing models can
explain the full spread of [C/Fe]. Thermohaline mixing can produce a
significant change in [N/Fe] as a function of absolute magnitude on the RGB for
initially CN-weak stars, but not for initially CN-strong stars, which have so
much nitrogen to begin with that any extra mixing does not significantly affect
the surface nitrogen composition.
