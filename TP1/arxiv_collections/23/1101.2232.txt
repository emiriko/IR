We use sub-parsec resolution hydrodynamic resimulations of a Milky Way (MW)
like galaxy at high redshift to investigate the formation of the MW satellite
galaxies. More specifically, we assess the impact of supernova feedback on the
dwarf progenitors of these satellite, and the efficiency of a simple
instantaneous reionisation scenario in suppressing star formation at the
low-mass end of this dwarf distribution. Identifying galaxies in our high
redshift simulation and tracking them to z=0 using a dark matter halo merger
tree, we compare our results to present-day observations and determine the
epoch at which we deem satellite galaxy formation must be completed. We find
that only the low-mass end of the population of luminous subhalos of the
Milky-Way like galaxy is not complete before redshift 8, and that although
supernovae feedback reduces the stellar mass of the low-mass subhalos
(log(M/Msolar) < 9), the number of surviving satellites around the Milky-Way
like galaxy at z = 0 is the same in the run with or without supernova feedback.
If a luminous halo is able to avoid accretion by the Milky-Way progenitor
before redshift 3, then it is likely to survive as a MW satellite to redshift
0.
