PTF/M-dwarfs is a 100,000-target M-dwarf planetary transit survey, a Key
Project of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) collaboration. The survey is
sensitive to Jupiter-radius planets around all of the target stars, and has
sufficient precision to reach Neptunes and super-Earths for the best targets.
The Palomar Transient Factory is a fully-automated, wide-field survey aimed at
a systematic exploration of the optical transient sky. The survey is performed
using a new 7.26 square degree camera installed on the 48 inch Samuel Oschin
telescope at Palomar Observatory. Each 92-megapixel R-band exposure contains
about 3,000 M-dwarfs usable for planet detection. In each PTF observational
season PTF/M-dwarfs searches for Jupiter-radius planets around almost 30,000
M-dwarfs, Neptune-radius planets around approximately 500 M-dwarfs, and
super-Earths around 100 targets. The full survey is expected to cover more than
100,000 targets over the next several years. Photometric and spectroscopic
followup operations are performed on the Palomar 60-inch, LCOGT, Palomar
200-inch, MDM and Keck telescopes. The survey has been running since mid-2009.
We detail the survey design, the survey's data analysis pipeline and the
performance of the first year of operations.
