We report first multicolor polarimetric measurements (UBV bands) for the hot
Jupiters HD189733b and confirm our previously reported detection of
polarization in the B band (Berdyugina et al. 2008). The wavelength dependence
of polarization indicates the dominance of Rayleigh scattering with a peak in
the blue B and U bands of ~10^-4+/-10^-5 and at least a factor of two lower
signal in the V band. The Rayleigh-like wavelength dependence, detected also in
the transmitted light during transits, implies a rapid decrease of the
polarization signal toward longer wavelengths. Therefore, the nondetection by
Wiktorowicz (2009), based on a measurement integrated within a broad passband
covering the V band and partly B and R bands, is inconclusive and consistent
with our detection in B. We discuss possible sources of the polarization and
demonstrate that effects of incomplete cancellation of stellar limb
polarization due to starspots or tidal perturbations are negligible as compared
to scattering polarization in the planetary atmosphere. We compare the
observations with a Rayleigh-Lambert model and determine effective radii and
geometrical albedos for different wavelengths. We find a close similarity of
the wavelength dependent geometrical albedo with that of the Neptune
atmosphere, which is known to be strongly influenced by Rayleigh and Raman
scattering. Our result establishes polarimetry as a reliable means for directly
studying exoplanetary atmospheres.
