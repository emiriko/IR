The electronic structure and magnetic properties of the graphene/Fe/Ni(111)
system were investigated via combination of the density functional theory
calculations and electron-spectroscopy methods. This system was prepared via
intercalation of thin Fe layer (1 ML) underneath graphene on Ni(111) and its
inert properties were verified by means of photoelectron spectroscopy.
Intercalation of iron in the space between graphene and Ni(111) changes
drastically the magnetic response from the graphene layer that is explained by
the formation of the highly spin-polarized $3d_{z^2}$ quantum-well state in the
thin iron layer.
