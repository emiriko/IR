We use the Green's function formalism to discuss the role of strong
correlations to the spatial structure of acceptor states doped into a
two-dimensional Mott-Hubbard antiferromagnetic insulator. When the scattering
between doped carriers, at the nesting wave vector ${\bf Q}=(\pi,\pi)$, is
strong enough to produce a momentum dependent scattering rate, $\Gamma_{\bf
k}$, the corresponding acceptor states become spatially anisotropic. As an
example, we calculate the spatial structure of an acceptor state bound to an
attractive two-dimensional Dirac delta potential, for a simple form of
$\Gamma_{\bf k}$. We then discuss the role of such spatial anisotropy for the
understanding of an apparent discrepancy between low temperature transport data
and photoemission spectra in lightly doped La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO(4).
