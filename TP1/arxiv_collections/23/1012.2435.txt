We consider a recently proposed supersymmetric model based on the discrete Q6
family group.Because of the family symmetry and spontaneous CP violation the
electric dipole moment (EDM), the CP violation in the mixing of the neural
mesons and the dark matter mass m_DM are closely related. This triangle
relation is controlled by the size of the mu parameters. Loop effects can give
rise to large contributions to the soft mass insertions, and we find that the
model allows a large CP violation in the B0 system. Its size is comparable with
the recent experimental observations at D0 and CDF, and it could be observed at
LHCb in the first years. If the parameter space is constrained by the neutron
EDM, and flavor changing neutral currents and CP violations in K0 as well as B0
mixing, the triangle relation yields the following bound on the dark matter
candidate: 0.12 TeV < m_DM < 0.33 TeV, which is directly observable at LHC. We
also compute a_sl^s - a_sl^d, which is observable at LHCb, where a_sl^s(d) is
the semi-leptonic CP asymmetryfor the B_s(d) system.
