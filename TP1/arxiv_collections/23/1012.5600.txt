An effect that is an analogue to the Vavilov-Cherenkov effect in a uniform
space would be observed in a space with a boundary of well reflecting light
metal-dielectric. The main difference is in that quanta of some electron volt
would be excited by an electron of energy of some tens of electron volts. This
would become possible because the surface plasmon velocity is very small as
compared with the velocity of waves of a uniform space. Beetwen excited
plasmons there is a plasmon with a linear momentum as high as the doubled
initial momentum of the electron.
