In this work we investigate the phase diagram of heavy (4d and 5d) transition
metal oxides on the pyrochlore lattice, such as those of the form
$\mathrm{A_2M_2O_7}$, where A is a rare earth element and M is a transition
metal element. We focus on the competition between Coulomb interaction,
spin-orbit coupling, and lattice distortion when these energy scales are
comparable. Strong spin-orbit coupling entangles the spin and the $t_{2g}$
$d$-orbitals giving rise to doublet $j=1/2$ and quadruplet $j=3/2$ states. In
contrast to previous works which focused on the doublet manifold, we also
discuss the quadruplet manifold which is relevant for several pyrochlore
oxides. The Coulomb interaction is taken into account by use of the slave-rotor
mean field theory and different classes of lattice distortions which further
split the levels of the quadruplet $j=3/2$ manifold are studied. Various
topological phases are predicted, including exotic strong and weak topological
Mott insulating phases. We discuss the general structure of the phase diagram
for several values of $d$-shell filling and various symmetry classes of lattice
distortions. Our results are relevant to the search for exotic topological
insulators and quantum spin liquids in strongly correlated materials with
strong spin-orbit coupling.
