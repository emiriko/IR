We report a measurement of intergalactic magnetic fields using combined data
from Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes and Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope,
based on the spectral data alone. If blazars are assumed to produce both gamma
rays and cosmic rays, the observed spectra are not sensitive to the intrinsic
spectrum of the source, because, for a distant blazar, secondary photons
produced in line-of-sight cosmic-ray interactions dominate the signal. In this
case, we find 0.01 fG < B < 30 fG. If one excludes the cosmic-ray component,
the 0.01 fG lower limit remains, but the upper limit depends on the spectral
properties of the source. We present the allowed ranges for a variety of model
parameters.
