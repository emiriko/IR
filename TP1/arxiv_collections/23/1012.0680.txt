We have studied hydrogen-hydrogen-alkali three-body systems in the adiabatic
hyperspherical representation. For the spin-stretched case, there exists a
single $X$H molecular state when $X$ is one of the bosonic alkali atoms:
$^7$Li, $^{23}$Na, $^{39}$K, $^{87}$Rb and $^{133}$Cs. As a result, the {\em
only} recombination process is the one that leads to formation of $X$H
molecules, H+H+$X$$\rightarrow$$X$H+H, and such molecules will be stable
against vibrational relaxation. We have calculated the collision rates for
recombination and collision induced dissociation as well as the elastic
cross-sections for H+$X$H collisions up to a temperature of 0.5 K, including
the partial wave contributions from $J^\Pi$=$0^+$ to $5^-$. We have also found
that there is just one three-body bound state for such systems for
$J^\Pi$=$0^+$ and no bound states for higher angular momenta.
