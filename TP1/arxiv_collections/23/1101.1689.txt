We consider optical tomography of photon Fock state superpositions in
connection with recent experimental achievements. The emphasis is put on the
fact that it suffices to represent the measured tomogram as a main result of
the experiment. We suggest a test for checking the correctness of experimental
data. Explicit expressions for optical tomograms of Fock state superpositions
are given in terms of Hermite polynomials. Particular cases of vacuum and low
photon-number state superposition are considered as well as influence of
thermal noise on state purity is studied.
