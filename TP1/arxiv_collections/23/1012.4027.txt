Clusters of galaxies are known to be dynamically active systems, yet X-ray
studies of the low redshift population exhibit tight scaling laws. In this
work, we extend previous studies of this apparent paradox using numerical
simulations of two extreme merger cases, one is a high Mach number (above 2.5)
satellite merger similar to the "bullet cluster" and the other a merger of
nearly equal mass progenitors. Creating X-ray images densely sampled in time,
we construct TX, Mgas, and YX measures within R500 and compare to the
calibrations of Kravtsov et al. (2006). We find that these extreme merger cases
respect the scaling relations, for both intrinsic measures and for measures
derived from appropriately masked, synthetic Chandra X-ray images. The masking
procedure plays a critical role in the X-ray temperature calculation while it
is irrelevant in the X-ray gas mass derivation. Mis-centering up to 100 kpc
does not influence the result. The observationally determined radius R500 might
conduce to systematic shifts in Mgas, and YX which increase the total mass
scatter.
