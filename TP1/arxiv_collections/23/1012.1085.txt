I analyse the transport of particles of arbitrary statistics (Bose, Fermi and
fractional exclusion statistics) through one-dimensional (1D) channels.
Observing that the particle, energy, entropy and heat fluxes through the 1D
channel are similar to the particle, internal energy, entropy and heat capacity
of a quantum gas in a two-dimensional (2D) flat box, respectively, I write
analytical expressions for the fluxes at arbitrary temperatures. Using these
expressions, I show that the heat and entropy fluxes are independent of
statistics at any temperature, and not only in the low temperature limit, as it
was previously known. From this perspective, the quanta of heat conductivity
represents only the low temperature limit of the 1D channel heat conductance
and is equal (up to a multiplicative constant equal to the Plank constant times
the density of states at the Fermi energy) to the universal limit of the heat
capacity of quantum gases. In the end I also give a microscopic proof for the
universal temperature dependence of the entropy and heat fluxes through 1D
channels.
