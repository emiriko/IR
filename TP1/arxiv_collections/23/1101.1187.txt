The cubic kilometer IceCube neutrino telescope now operating at the South
Pole in a near complete configuration observes the neutrino sky with an
unprecedented sensitivity to galactic and extra-galactic cosmic ray
accelerators. Within the multi-messenger framework, IceCube offers unique
capabilities to correlate and contrast the neutrino sky with the gamma-ray sky
and ultra high energy cosmic rays and complements other indirect and direct
dark matter search programs. We review here the status of the experiment and
recent selected results. A discussion of the implications of the observations
will be followed by the prospects of future developments, substantially
extending the reach of the observatory at extremely high energies, in the GZK
region and at low energies enhancing capabilities to probe dark matter and
cosmic ray sources in the southern sky.
