This paper presents a novel design concept for spintronic nanoelectronics
that emphasizes a seamless integration of spin-based memory and logic circuits.
The building blocks are magneto-logic gates based on a hybrid
graphene/ferromagnet material system. We use network search engines as a
technology demonstration vehicle and present a spin-based circuit design with
smaller area, faster speed, and lower energy consumption than the
state-of-the-art CMOS counterparts. This design can also be applied in
applications such as data compression, coding and image recognition. In the
proposed scheme, over 100 spin-based logic operations are carried out before
any need for a spin-charge conversion. Consequently, supporting CMOS
electronics requires little power consumption. The spintronic-CMOS integrated
system can be implemented on a single 3-D chip. These nonvolatile logic
circuits hold potential for a paradigm shift in computing applications.
