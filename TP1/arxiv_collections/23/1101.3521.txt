We propose a new interpretation of objective deterministic chances in
statistical physics based on physical computational complexity. This notion
applies to a single physical system (be it an experimental set--up in the lab,
or a subsystem of the universe), and quantifies (1) the difficulty to realize a
physical state given another, (2) the `distance' (in terms of physical
resources) of a physical state from another, and (3) the size of the set of
time--complexity functions that are compatible with the physical resources
required to reach a physical state from another. This view (a) exorcises
"ignorance" from statistical physics, and (b) underlies a new interpretation to
non--relativistic quantum mechanics.
