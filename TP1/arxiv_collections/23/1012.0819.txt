In magnetic memory and logic devices, a magnet's magnetization is usually
flipped with a spin polarized current delivering a spin transfer torque (STT).
This mode of switching consumes too much energy and considerable energy saving
can accrue from using a multiferroic nanomagnet switched with a combination of
STT and mechanical stress generated with a voltage (VGS). The VGS mode consumes
less energy than STT, but cannot rotate magnetization by more than 90?, so that
a combination of the two modes is needed for energy-efficient switching.
