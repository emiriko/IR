The specific mechanism and astrophysical site for the production of half of
the elements heavier than iron via rapid neutron capture (r-process) remains to
be found. In order to reproduce the abundances of the solar system and of the
old halo stars, at least two components are required: the heavy r-process
nuclei (A>130) and the weak r-process which correspond to the lighter heavy
nuclei (A<130). In this work, we present nucleosynthesis studies based on
trajectories of hydrodynamical simulations for core-collapse supernovae and
their subsequent neutrino-driven winds. We show that the weak r-process
elements can be produced in neutrino-driven winds and we relate their
abundances to the neutrino emission from the nascent neutron star. Based on the
latest hydrodynamical simulations, heavy r-process elements cannot be
synthesized in the neutrino-driven winds. However, by artificially increasing
the wind entropy, elements up to A=195 can be made. In this way one can mimic
the general behavior of an ejecta where the r-process occurs. We use this to
study the impact of the nuclear physics input (nuclear masses, neutron capture
cross sections, and beta-delayed neutron emission) and of the long-time
dynamical evolution on the final abundances.
