We study type $A$ nilpotent Hessenberg varieties equipped with a natural
$S^1$-action using techniques introduced by Tymoczko, Harada-Tymoczko, and
Bayegan-Harada, with a particular emphasis on a special class of nilpotent
Springer varieties corresponding to the partition $\lambda= (n-2,2)$ for $n
\geq 4$. First we define the adjacent-pair matrix corresponding to any filling
of a Young diagram with $n$ boxes with the alphabet $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. Using
the adjacent-pair matrix we make more explicit and also extend some statements
concerning highest forms of linear operators in previous work of Tymoczko.
Second, for a nilpotent operator $N$ and Hessenberg function $h$, we construct
an explicit bijection between the $S^1$-fixed points of the nilpotent
Hessenberg variety $\Hess(N,h)$ and the set of $(h,\lambda_N)$-permissible
fillings of the Young diagram $\lambda_N$. Third, we use poset pinball, the
combinatorial game introduced by Harada and Tymoczko, to study the
$S^1$-equivariant cohomology of type $A$ Springer varieties
$\mathcal{S}_{(n-2,2)}$ associated to Young diagrams of shape $(n-2,2)$ for
$n\geq 4$. Specifically, we use the dimension pair algorithm for
Betti-acceptable pinball described by Bayegan and Harada to specify a subset of
the equivariant Schubert classes in the $T$-equivariant cohomology of the flag
variety $\mathcal{F}\ell ags(\C^n)$ which maps to a module basis of
$H^*_{S^1}(\mathcal{S}_{(n-2,2)})$ under the projection $H^*_T(\mathcal{F}\ell
ags(\C^n)) \to H^*_{S^1}(\mathcal{S}_{(n-2,2)})$. Our pinball module basis is
not poset-upper-triangular; this is the first concrete such example in the
literature. A consequence of our proof is that there exists a simple and
explicit change of basis which transforms our basis to a poset-upper-triangular
module basis for $H^*_{S^1}(\mathcal{S}_{(n-2,2)})$. We close with open
questions for future work.
