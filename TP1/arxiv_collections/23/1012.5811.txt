The far-ultraviolet (FUV) channel of the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) is
designed to operate between 1130{\AA} and 1850{\AA}, limited at shorter
wavelengths by the reflectivity of the MgF2 protected aluminum reflective
surfaces on the Optical Telescope Assembly and on the COS FUV diffraction
gratings. However, because the detector for the FUV channel is windowless, it
was recognized early in the design phase that there was the possibility that
COS would retain some sensitivity at shorter wavelengths due to the first
surface reflection from the MgF2 coated optics. Preflight testing of the flight
spare G140L grating revealed ~5% efficiency at 1066{\AA}, and early on-orbit
observations verified that the COS G140L/1230 mode was sensitive down to at
least the Lyman limit with 10-20 cm^2 effective area between 912{\AA} and
1070{\AA}, and rising rapidly to over 1000 cm2 beyond 1150{\AA}. Following this
initial work we explored the possibility of using the G130M grating out of band
to provide coverage down to 900{\AA}. We present calibration results and ray
trace simulations for these observing modes and explore additional
configurations that have the potential to increase spectroscopic resolution,
signal to noise, and observational efficiency below 1130{\AA}.
