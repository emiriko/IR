We present Babel-17, the first programming language for purely functional
structured programming (PFSP). Earlier work illustrated PFSP in the framework
of a toy research language. Babel-17 takes this earlier work to a new level by
showing how PFSP can be combined with pattern matching, object oriented
programming, and features like concurrency, lazy evaluation, memoization and
support for lenses.
