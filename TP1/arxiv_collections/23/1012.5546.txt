Mining association rules is a task of data mining, which extracts knowledge
in the form of significant implication relation of useful items (objects) from
a database. Mining multilevel association rules uses concept hierarchies, also
called taxonomies and defined as relations of type 'is-a' between objects, to
extract rules that items belong to different levels of abstraction. These rules
are more useful, more refined and more interpretable by the user. Several
algorithms have been proposed in the literature to discover the multilevel
association rules. In this article, we are interested in the problem of
discovering multi-level frequent itemsets under constraints, involving the user
in the research process. We proposed a technique for modeling and
interpretation of constraints in a context of use of concept hierarchies. Three
approaches for discovering multi-level frequent itemsets under constraints were
proposed and discussed: Basic approach, "Test and Generate" approach and
Pruning based Approach.
