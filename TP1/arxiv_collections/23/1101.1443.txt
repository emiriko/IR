Multi-wavelength observations are mandatory to understand the physical
properties of astrophysical sources. In this paper we use observations in the
far infrared to radio range to derive the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
the Carina nebula. To do this, we carefully subtract the irregularly varying
diffuse emission from the Galactic plane, which can be of the order of 10 of
the nebula flux at these wavelengths. We find that the far infrared SED can be
modeled as emission from a dust population with a single temperature
T_d=(34.5^{+2.0}_{-1.8}), and with a spectral index of emissivity
alpha=-1.37^{+0.09}_{-0.08}. We also find a total infrared luminosity of the
Nebula of (7.4^{+2.5}_{-1.4})x10^6 L_{\odot} and, assuming a single temperature
of the dust, a mass of the dust of (9500^{+4600}_{-3500})M_\odot.
