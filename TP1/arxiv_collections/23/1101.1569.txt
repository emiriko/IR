B037 is of interest because it is both the most luminous and the most highly
reddened cluster known in M31. Images of deep observations and of highly
spatial resolutions with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the {\sl HST}
firstly show that this cluster is crossed by a dust lane. Photometric data in
the F606W and F814W filters obtained in this paper provide that, colors of
($\rm {F606W-F814W}$) in the dust lane are redder $\sim 0.4$ mags than ones in
the other regions of B037. The {\sl HST} images show that, this dust lane seems
to be contained in B037, not from the M31 disk or the Milky Way. As we know,
the formation of dust requires gas with a rather high metallicity. However,
B037 has a low metallicity to be $\rm [Fe/H]=-1.07\pm 0.20$. So, it seems
improbable that the observed dust lane is physically associated with B037. It
is clear that the origin of this dust lane is worthy of future study. In
addition, based on these images, we present the precise variation of
ellipticity and position angle, and of surface brightness profile, and
determine the structural parameters of B037 by fitting a single-mass isotropic
King model. In the F606W filter, we derive the best-fitting scale radius,
$r_0=0.56\pm0.02\arcsec~(=2.16\pm0.08~\rm{pc})$, a tidal radius,
$r_t=8.6\pm0.4\arcsec~(=33.1\pm1.5~\rm{pc})$, and a concentration index $c=\log
(r_t/r_0)=1.19\pm0.02$. In the F814W filter, we derive
$r_0=0.56\pm0.01\arcsec~(=2.16\pm0.04~\rm{pc})$,
$r_t=8.9\pm0.3\arcsec~(=34.3\pm1.2~\rm{pc})$, and $c=\log
(r_t/r_0)=1.20\pm0.01$. The extinction-corrected central surface brightness is
$\mu_0=13.53\pm 0.03~{\rm mag~arcsec^{-2}}$ in the F606W filter, and $12.85\pm
0.03~{\rm mag~arcsec^{-2}}$ in the F814W filter, respectively.
