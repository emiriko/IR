We report a search for the rare decays B+ to D+ K0 and B+ to D+ K*0 in an
event sample of approximately 465 million BBbar pairs collected with the BaBar
detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e+e- collider at SLAC. We find no
significant evidence for either mode and we set 90% probability upper limits on
the branching fractions of BF(B+ to D+ K0) < 2.9x 10^-6 and BF(B+ to D+ K*0) <
3.0 x 10^-6.
