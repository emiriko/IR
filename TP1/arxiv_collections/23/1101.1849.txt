Aims.The abundances of Fe in the intracluster medium of nearby (z<0.08)
clusters were measured up to 0.3$\sim$ 0.5r$_{180}$. Methods.We analyzed 28
clusters of galaxies observed with XMM-Newton. We derived Fe abundances from
the flux ratios of Fe lines to the continuum within an energy range of 3.5--6
keV to minimize and evaluate systematic uncertainties. Results.The radial
profiles of the Fe abundances of relaxed clusters with a cD galaxy at their
X-ray peak have similar slopes. These clusters show similar enhancements in the
Fe abundance within 0.1$r_{180}$, and at 0.1--0.3$r_{180}$, they have flatter
Fe abundance profiles at 0.4$\sim$0.5 solar, with a small scatter. Most other
clusters, including merging clusters, also have similar Fe abundance profiles
beyond 0.1$r_{180}$. These clusters may have universal metal enrichment
histories,and a significant amount of Fe was synthesized at a very early stage
in cluster formation. Mergers of clusters can destroy the central Fe peak.
