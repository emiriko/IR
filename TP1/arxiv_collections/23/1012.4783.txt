Proving the existence of an operator that connects non-perturbed states to
perturbed states, an alternative derivation of the Dalgarno-Lewis method is
given. To illustrate that the Dalgarno-Lewis method is an apt tool for
algebraic Hamiltonians, the method is applied to one class of such systems,
namely deep three-dimensional potentials with positive parity.
