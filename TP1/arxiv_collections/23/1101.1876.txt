The purpose of the present paper is to study the influence of wall-echo on
pressure fluctuations $p'$, and on statistical correlations containing $p'$,
{\em viz} redistribution $\phi_{ij}$, pressure diffusion $d_{ij}^{(p)}$, and
velocity/pressure-gradient $\Pi_{ij}$. We extend the usual analysis of
turbulent correlations containing pressure fluctuations in wall-bounded
\tsc{dns} computations [Kim J.: {\em J. Fluid Mech.} {\bf 205} (1989)
421--451], separating $p'$ not only into rapid $p_{(\mathrm{r})}'$ and slow
$p_{(\mathrm{s})}'$ parts [Chou P.Y.: {\em Quart. Appl. Math.} {\bf 3} (1945)
38--54], but further into volume ($p'_{(\mathrm{r};\mathfrak{V})}$ and
$p'_{(\mathrm{s};\mathfrak{V})}$) and surface (wall-echo; $p'_{(\mathrm{r};w)}$
and $p'_{(\mathrm{s};w)}$) terms. An algorithm, based on a Green's function
approach, is developed to compute the above splittings for various correlations
containing pressure fluctuations (redistribution, pressure diffusion,
velocity/pressure-gradient), in fully developed turbulent plane channel flow.
This exact analysis confirms previous results based on a method-of-images
approximation [Manceau R., Wang M., Laurence D.: {\em J. Fluid Mech.} {\bf 438}
(2001) 307--338] showing that, at the wall, $p'_{(\mathfrak{V})}$ and
$p'_{(w)}$ are usually of the same sign and approximately equal. The above
results are then used to study the contribution of each mechanism on the
pressure correlations in low Reynolds-number plane channel flow, and to discuss
standard second-moment-closure modelling practices.
