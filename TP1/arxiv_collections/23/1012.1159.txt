An enhanced model, based on the Extended Boson Approximation, for the
lowest-lying states in odd-mass nuclei is presented. Our approach is built on
the Quasiparticle Phonon Model, extending it to take into account the ground
state correlations due to the action of the Pauli principle more accurately
than in the conventional theory. The derived interaction strengths between the
quasiparticles and the phonons in this model depend on the quasiparticle
occupation numbers explicitly coupling the odd-mass nucleus equations with
those of the even-even core. Within this model we calculated the transition
probabilities in several Te, Xe and Ba isotopes with A$\approx$130.
