The reactions that destroy 26Al in massive stars have significance in a
number of astrophysical contexts. We evaluate the reaction rates of
26Al(n,p)26Mg and 26Al(n,a)23Na using cross sections obtained from the codes
EMPIRE and TALYS. These have been compared to the published rates obtained from
the non-smoker code and to some experimental data. We show that the results
obtained from EMPIRE and TALYS are comparable to those from non-smoker. We also
show how the theoretical results vary with respect to changes in the input
parameters. Finally, we present recommended rates for these reactions using the
available experimental data and our new theoretical results.
