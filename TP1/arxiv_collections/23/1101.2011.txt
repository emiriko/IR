We introduce a new expression for the Z2 topological invariant of band
insulators using non- Abelian Berry's connection. Our expression can identify
the topological nature of a general band insulator without any of the gauge
fixing problems that plague the concrete implementation of previous invariants.
The new expression can be derived from the "partner switching" of the Wannier
function center during time reversal pumping and is thus equivalent to the Z2
topological invariant proposed by Kane and Mele.
