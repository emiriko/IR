We present results of two-hour non-interrupted observations of solar
granulation obtained under excellent seeing conditions with the largest
aperture ground-based solar telescope - the New Solar Telescope (NST) - of Big
Bear Solar Observatory. Observations were performed with adaptive optics
correction using a broad-band TiO filter in the 705.7 nm spectral line with a
time cadence of 10 s and a pixel size of 0.0375". Photospheric bright points
(BPs) were detected and tracked. We find that the BPs detected in NST images
are co-spatial with those visible in Hinode/SOT G-band images. In cases where
Hinode/SOT detects one large BP, NST detects several separated BPs. Extended
filigree features are clearly fragmented into separate BPs in NST images. The
distribution function of BP sizes extends to the diffraction limit of NST (77
km) without saturation and corresponds to a log-normal distribution. The
lifetime distribution function follows a log-normal approximation for all BPs
with lifetime exceeding 100 s. A majority of BPs are transient events
reflecting the strong dynamics of the quiet sun: 98.6% of BPs live less than
120 s. The longest registered life time was 44 minutes. The size and maximum
intensity of BPs were found to be proportional to their life times.
