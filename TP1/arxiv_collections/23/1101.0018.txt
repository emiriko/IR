We consider a system of $N$ individuals consisting of $S$ species that
interact pairwise: $x_m+x_\ell \rightarrow 2x_m\,\,$ with arbitrary
probabilities $p_m^\ell $. With no spatial structure, the master equation
yields a simple set of rate equations in a mean field approximation, the focus
of this note. Generalizing recent findings of cyclically competing three- and
four-species models, we cast these equations in an appealingly simple form. As
a result, many general properties of such systems are readily discovered, e.g.,
the major difference between even and odd $S$ cases. Further, we find the
criteria for the existence of (subspaces of) fixed points and collective
variables which evolve trivially (exponentially or invariant). These apparently
distinct aspects can be traced to the null space associated with the
interaction matrix, $p_m^\ell $. Related to the left- and right-
zero-eigenvectors, these appear to be "dual" facets of the dynamics. We also
remark on how the standard Lotka-Volterra equations (which include birth/death
terms) can be regarded as a special limit of a pairwise interacting system.
