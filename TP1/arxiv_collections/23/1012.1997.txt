We derive an algorithm to determine recursively the lap number (minimal
number of monotone pieces) of the iterates of unimodal maps of an interval with
free end-points. The algorithm is obtained by the sign analysis of the
itineraries of the critical point and of the boundary points of the interval
map. We apply this algorithm to the estimation of the growth number and the
topological entropy of maps with direct and reverse bifurcations.
