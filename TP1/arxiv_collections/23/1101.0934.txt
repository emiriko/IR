Leo Breiman was a unique character. There will not be another like him. I
consider it one of my great fortunes in life to have know and worked with him.
Along with John Tukey, Leo had the greatest influence on shaping my approach to
statistical problems. I did some of my best work collaborating with Leo, but
more importantly, we both had great fun doing it. I look back on those years
when we worked closely together with great fondness and regard them as among
the happiest and most fruitful of my professional career.
