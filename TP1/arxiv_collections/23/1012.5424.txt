We impose uniform electric fields both parallel and normal to 180^o
ferroelectric domain walls in PbTiO_3 and obtain the equilibrium structures
using the method of anharmonic lattice statics. In addition to Ti-centered and
Pb-centered perfect domain walls, we also consider Ti-centered domain walls
with oxygen vacancies. We observe that electric field can increase the
thickness of the domain wall considerably. We also observe that increasing the
magnitude of electric field we reach a critical electric field E^c; for E > E^c
there is no local equilibrium configuration. Therefore, E^c can be considered
as an estimate of the threshold field E_h for domain wall motion. Our numerical
results show that Oxygen vacancies decrease the value of E^c. As the defective
domain walls are thicker than perfect walls, this result is in agreement with
the recent experimental observations and continuum calculations that show
thicker domain walls have lower threshold fields.
