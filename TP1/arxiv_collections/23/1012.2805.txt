The local distribution of exciton levels in disordered cyanine-dye-based
molecular nano-aggregates has been elucidated using fluorescence line narrowing
spectroscopy. The observation of a Wigner-Dyson-type level spacing distribution
provides direct evidence of the existence of level repulsion of strongly
overlapping states in the molecular wires, which is important for the
understanding of the level statistics, and therefore the `functional
properties, of a large variety of nano-confined systems.
