We discuss a standard model of heavy ion collisions that has emerged both
from the experimental results of the RHIC program and associated theoretical
developments. We comment briefly on the impact of early results of the LHC
program on this picture. We consider how this standard model of heavy ion
collisions could be solidified or falsified in future experiments at RHIC, the
LHC and a future Electron-Ion Collider.
