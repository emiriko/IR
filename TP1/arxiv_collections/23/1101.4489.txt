The multichannel data acquisition system is intended to be used in the EMMA
experiment studying cosmic rays. The array will be in the Pihasalmi mine
(central Finland) at a depth of about 85 m. The scintillator counters (SC-1) of
the array are cast plastic scintillators with a wavelength of each SC-1
detector is 12.2{\times}12.2{\times}3.0 cm^3. 16 SC-1 detectors are placed in
the metal case of 50.0{\times}50.0{\times}13.0 cm^3 dimension. Each case,
called SC-16 detector, contains electronics of preliminary processing of
signals and operating mode stabilization. The whole of the array will contain
96 detectors SC-16. It will make 1536 channels placed in three planes (48+24+24
detectors). The array will allow us to measure the time of flight of particles
between SC-16 detectors and the coordinates of SC-1 fired detectors. This paper
presents the function diagram of data acquisition system that includes
electronic of detectors, the hodoscope pulse channels, the trigger block and
VME blocks.
