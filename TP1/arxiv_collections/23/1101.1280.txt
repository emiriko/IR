The time evolution of the quark gluon plasma created in gold-gold collisions
of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) can be described by
hydrodynamical models. Distribution of hadrons reflects the freeze-out state of
the matter. To investigate the time evolution one needs to analyze penetrating
probes, such as direct photon spectra. Distributions of low energy photons was
published in 2010 by PHENIX. In this paper we analyze a 3+1 dimensional
solution of relativistic hydrodynamics and calculate momentum distribution of
direct photons. Using earlier fits of this model to hadronic spectra, we
compare photon calculations to measurements and find that the initial
temperature of the center of the fireball is at least 519+-12 MeV, while for
the equation of state we get c_s= 0.36+-0.02.
