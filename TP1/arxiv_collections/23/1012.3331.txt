We report on the discovery of ETHOS 1 (PN G068.1+11.0), the first
spectroscopically confirmed planetary nebula (PN) from a survey of the
SuperCOSMOS Science Archive for high-latitude PNe. ETHOS 1 stands out as one of
the few PNe to have both polar outflows (jets) travelling at $120\pm10$ km/s
and a close binary central star. The lightcurve observed with the Mercator
telescope reveals an orbital period of 0.535 days and an extremely large
amplitude (0.816 mag) due to irradiation of the companion by a very hot
pre-white dwarf. ETHOS 1 further strengthens the long suspected link between
binary central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN) and jets. INT IDS and VLT FORS
spectroscopy of the CSPN reveals weak N III, C III and C IV emission lines seen
in other close binary CSPN and suggests many CSPN with these weak emission
lines are misclassified close binaries. We present VLT FORS imaging and
Manchester Echelle Spectrometer long slit observations from which a kinematic
model of the nebula is built. An unusual combination of bipolar outflows and a
spherical nebula conspire to produce an $X$-shaped appearance. The kinematic
age of the jets ($1750\pm250$ yrs/kpc) are found to be older than the inner
nebula ($900\pm100$ yrs/kpc) consistent with previous studies of similar PNe.
Emission line ratios of the jets are found to be consistent with reverse-shock
models for fast low-ionisation emitting regions (FLIERS) in PNe. Further
large-scale surveys for close binary CSPN will be required to securely
establish whether FLIERS are launched by close binaries.
