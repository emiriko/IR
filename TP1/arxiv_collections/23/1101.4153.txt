LS 5039 is one of the few X-ray binaries detected at VHE, and potentially
contains a young non-accreting pulsar. The outflow of accelerated particles
emitting synchrotron emission can be directly mapped with high resolution radio
observations. The morphology of the radio emission strongly depends on the
properties of the compact object and on the orbital parameters of the binary
system. We present VLBA observations of LS 5039 covering an orbital cycle,
which show morphological and astrometric variability at mas scales. On the
other hand, we discuss the possible association of LS 5039 with the supernova
remnant SNR G016.8-01.1.
