We provide a short review of the hydrodynamical properties of a class of
strongly coupled thermal gauge theories, coupled to massless fundamental flavor
fields, having a dual supergravity description. The analysis is valid for more
general classes of nearly conformal holographic plasmas, where the breaking of
conformality is driven by marginally (ir)relevant deformations.
