We investigate the existence of supersymmetric static dyonic black holes with
spherical horizon in the context of N= 2 U(1) gauged supergravity in four
dimensions. We analyze the conditions for their existence and provide the
general first-order flow equations driving the scalar fields and the metric
warp factors from the asymptotic AdS4 geometry to the horizon. We work in a
general duality-symmetric setup, which allows to describe both electric and
magnetic gaugings. We also discuss the attractor mechanism and the issue of
moduli (de-)stabilization.
