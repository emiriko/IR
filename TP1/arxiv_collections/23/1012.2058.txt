We present exact results for the ground-state and thermodynamic properties of
the spin-1/2 $XX$ chain with three-site interactions in a random (Lorentzian)
transverse field. We discuss the influence of randomness on the quantum
critical behavior known to be present in the nonrandom model. We find that at
zero temperature the characteristic features of the quantum phase transition,
such as kinks in the magnetization versus field curve, are smeared out by
randomness. However, at low but finite temperatures signatures of the quantum
critical behavior are preserved if the randomness is not too large. Even the
quantum critical region may be slightly enlarged for very weak randomness. In
addition to the exact results for Lorentzian randomness we present a more
general discussion of an arbitrarily random transverse magnetic field based on
the inspection of the moments of the density of states.
