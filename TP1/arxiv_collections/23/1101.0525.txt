Considerable attention has been focused on Verlinde's recent work, claiming
that Newton's gravity is not a fundamental force. In a recent work
(arXiv:1012.5858), we give further the logic basis and basic clues to derive
the Newton's gravity, inertia law and Einstein's weak equivalence principle. In
this work, we show that if the gravity is not a fundamental force, in special
case, it could be repulsive when quantum wavepacket effect is considered. This
quantum gravity effect leads to several physical effects: (1) It is consistent
with the universe with accelerating expansion, if the gravity and quantum
effect of the fluctuating 'vacuum' (dark energy) is considered. The role of the
cosmological constant is naturally interpreted when the gravity and quantum
effect of the whole 'vacuum' background is considered. (2) It leads to new idea
about black hole information paradox, no-hair theorem and Hawking radiation.
(3) With a sphere full of superfluid Helium, we propose a feasible experimental
scheme to test our idea with an atom interferometer placed in the sphere. Our
calculations show that the accuracy Delta g/g below 10^(-8) could be used to
test our idea, which satisfies the present experimental technique of atom
interferometer.
