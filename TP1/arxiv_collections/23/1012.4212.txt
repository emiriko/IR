In spite of the sweeping coherence effects in high energy hadron and nuclei
collisions, $k_T$-factorization can be recovered for the inclusive gluon
production in $pA$ collisions at the leading logarithmic order. In open charm
production at RHIC $k_T$-factorization holds numerically with about 10-20%
accuracy. This allows to extrapolate the cold nuclear matter effect observed in
light and charm meson production in $dA$ collisions to that in $AA$ ones.
Unlike the open charm, the breakdown of factorization in $J/\psi$ production is
severe. Indeed, already at the lowest order in gluon density the main
contribution to the inclusive cross section is proportional to the square of
gluon density in the nucleus. As a consequence, one cannot infer the cold
nuclear matter effect on $J/\psi$ production in $AA$ collisions from that in
$dA$. We present the calculation of $J/\psi$ multiplicity in the framework of
the CGC (color glass condensate)/saturation and show that it agrees with the
experimental data.
