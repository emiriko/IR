Recent experiments indicate room-temperature ferromagnetism in graphite-like
materials. This paper offers multiple spin state analysis applied to asymmetric
graphene molecule to find out mechanism of ferromagnetic nature. First
principle density functional theory is applied to calculate spin density,
energy and atom position depending on each spin state. Molecules with
dihydrogenated zigzag edges like C64H27, C56H24, C64H25, C56H22 and C64H23 show
that in every molecule the highest spin state is the most stable one with over
3000 K energy difference with next spin state. This result suggests a stability
of room temperature ferromagnetism in these molecules. In contrast, nitrogen
substituted molecules like C59N5H22, C52N4H20, C61N3H22, C54N2H20 and C63N1H22
show opposite result that the lowest spin state is the most stable. Magnetic
stability of graphene molecule can be explained by three key issues, that is,
edge specified localized spin density, parallel spins exchange interaction
inside of a molecule and atom position optimization depending on spin state.
Those results will be applied to design a carbon-base ferro-magnet, an ultra
high density 100 tera bit /inch2 class information storage and spintronic
devices.
