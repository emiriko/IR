Geant4 has an abundant set of physics models that handle the diverse
interaction of particles with matter across a wide energy range. However, there
are also many well established reaction codes currently used in the same fields
where Geant4 is applied. One such code is the Ultra-relativistic Quantum
Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model. In order to take advantage of the UrQMD code,
we create a tool to enable comparisons among UrQMD and Geant4 hadronic models.
This tool allows a user to process the output file of UrQMD through Geant4
toolkit, while at the same time, can choose among different Geant4 hadronic
model generators. As an example, the UrQMD model is compared with the HARP-CDP
experimental data and with the Binary and FRITIOF generators, in the framework
of Geant4. It is shown that the UrQMD model can better reproduce charged pion
production for p+Cu and Pb interactions at 3, 8 and 15 GeV/c, and is a good
candidate for Geant4 hadronic models.
