Stellar Kinematic Groups are kinematical coherent groups of stars which may
share a common origin. These groups spread through the Galaxy over time due to
tidal effects caused by galactic rotation and disk heating, however the
chemical information survives. The aim of chemical tagging is to show that
abundances of every element in the analysis must be homogeneous between
members. We have studied the case of the Hyades Supercluster in order to
compile a reliable list of members (FGK stars) based on chemical tagging
information and spectroscopic age determinations of this supercluster. This
information has been derived from high-resolution echelle spectra obtained
during our surveys of late-type stars. For a small subsample of the Hyades
Supercluster, stellar atmospheric parameters (T_eff, log g, xi and [Fe/H]) have
been determined using an automatic code which takes into account the
sensibility of iron EWs measured in the spectra. We have derived absolute
abundances consistent with galactic abundance trends reported in previous
studies. The chemical tagging method has been applied with a carefully
differential abundance analysis of each candidate member of the Hyades
Supercluster, using a well-known member of the Hyades cluster as reference. A
preliminary research has allowed us to find out which stars are members based
on their differential abundances and spectroscopic ages.
