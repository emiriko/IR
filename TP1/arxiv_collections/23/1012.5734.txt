We study the pseudoduality transformations in two dimensional N = (2, 2)
sigma models on K\"ahler manifolds. We show that structures on the target space
can be transformed into the pseudodual manifolds by means of (anti)holomorphic
preserving mapping. This map requires that torsions related to individual
spaces and riemann connection on pseudodual manifold must vanish. We also
consider holomorphic isometries which puts additional constraints on the
pseudoduality.
