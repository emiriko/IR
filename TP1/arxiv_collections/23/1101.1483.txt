We show that wandering domains can exist in the Fatou set of a polynomial
type quasiregular mapping of the plane. We also give an example of a
quasiregular mapping of the plane, with an essential singularity at infinity,
which has a sequence of wandering domains contained in a bounded part of the
plane. This contrasts with the situation in the analytic case, where wandering
domains are impossible for polynomials and, for transcendental entire
functions, the existence of wandering domains in a bounded part of the plane
has been an open problem for many years.
