Six-dimensional (2, 0) theory can be defined on a large class of
six-manifolds endowed with some additional topological and geometric data (i.e.
an orientation, a spin structure, a conformal structure, and an R-symmetry
bundle with connection). We discuss the nature of the object that generalizes
the partition function of a more conventional quantum theory. This object takes
its values in a certain complex vector space, which fits together into the
total space of a complex vector bundle (the `partition bundle') as the data on
the six-manifold is varied in its infinite-dimensional parameter space. In this
context, an important role is played by the middle-dimensional intermediate
Jacobian of the six-manifold endowed with some additional data (i.e. a
symplectic structure, a quadratic form, and a complex structure). We define a
certain hermitian vector bundle over this finite-dimensional parameter space.
The partition bundle is then given by the pullback of the latter bundle by the
map from the parameter space related to the six-manifold to the parameter space
related to the intermediate Jacobian.
