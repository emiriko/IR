Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) are mostly elliptical galaxies and very
rarely have prominent star formation. We found that five out of 8,812 BCGs are
E+A (i.e. post-starburst) galaxies, having the H$\delta$~absorption line with
an equivalent width $>2.5\AA$ and no distinct emission lines in [O II] and
H$\alpha$. The E+A features we identified from the BCGs for the first time are
not as significant as those in general galaxies, indicating that historically
the star formation were not very violent.
