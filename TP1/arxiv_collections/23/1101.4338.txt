The problem of phase space transport which is of interest both theoretically
and from the point of view of applications has been investigated extensively
using geometric and probabilistic methods. Two of the important tools for this
that emerged in the last decade are the Finite time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE)
and the Perron-Frobenius operator. The relationship between these approaches
has not been clearly understood so far. In this paper a methodology is
presented to compute the FTLE from the Perron-Frobenius operator, thus
providing a step towards combining both the methods into a common framework.
