We calculate perturbatively the multifractality spectrum of wave-functions in
critical random matrix ensembles in the regime of weak multifractality. We show
that in the leading order the spectrum is universal, while the higher order
corrections are model-specific. Explicit results for the anomalous dimensions
are derived in the power-law and ultrametric random matrix ensembles.
