We present here our results of the temporal and spectral analysis of a sample
of 52 bright and hard gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed with the Fermi Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (GBM) during its first year of operation (July 2008-July 2009).
Our sample was selected from a total of 253 GBM GRBs based on each event peak
count rate measured between 0.2 and 40MeV. The final sample comprised 34 long
and 18 short GRBs. These numbers show that the GBM sample contains a much
larger fraction of short GRBs, than the CGRO/BATSE data set, which we explain
as the result of our (different) selection criteria and the improved GBM
trigger algorithms, which favor collection of short, bright GRBs over BATSE. A
first by-product of our selection methodology is the determination of a
detection threshold from the GBM data alone, above which GRBs most likely will
be detected in the MeV/GeV range with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard
Fermi. This predictor will be very useful for future multiwavelength GRB follow
ups with ground and space based observatories. Further we have estimated the
burst durations up to 10MeV and for the first time expanded the duration-energy
relationship in the GRB light curves to high energies. We confirm that GRB
durations decline with energy as a power law with index approximately -0.4, as
was found earlier with the BATSE data and we also notice evidence of a possible
cutoff or break at higher energies. Finally, we performed time-integrated
spectral analysis of all 52 bursts and compared their spectral parameters with
those obtained with the larger data sample of the BATSE data. We find that the
two parameter data sets are similar and confirm that short GRBs are in general
harder than longer ones.
