The anomaly of the top quark forward-backward asymmetry $A^t_{FB}$ observed
at the Tevatron can be explained by the t-channel exchange of a neutral gauge
boson (Z') which has sizable flavor changing coupling for top and up quarks.
This gauge boson can also induce the top quark flavor-changing neutral-current
(FCNC) decays and the like-sign top pair production at the LHC. In this work we
focus on two models which predict such a Z', namely the left-right model and
the U(1)_X model, to investigate the correlated effects on $A^t_{FB}$, the FCNC
decays $t -> u V$ ($V=g,Z,\gamma$) and the like-sign top pair production at the
LHC. We also pay special attention to the most recently measured $A^t_{FB}$ in
the large top pair invariant mass region. We find that under the current
experimental constraints both models can alleviate the deviation of $A^t_{FB}$
and, meanwhile, enhance the like-sign top pair production to the detectable
level of the LHC. We also find that the two models give different predictions
for the observables and their correlations, and thus they may even be
distinguished by jointly studying these top quark observables.
