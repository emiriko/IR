We describe the processing of the 336 billion raw data samples from the High
Frequency Instrument (HFI) which we performed to produce six temperature maps
from the first 295 days of Planck-HFI survey data. These maps provide an
accurate rendition of the sky emission at 100, 143, 217, 353, 545 and 857 GHz
with an angular resolution ranging from 9.9 to 4.4^2. The white noise level is
around 1.5 {\mu}K degree or less in the 3 main CMB channels (100--217GHz). The
photometric accuracy is better than 2% at frequencies between 100 and 353 GHz
and around 7% at the two highest frequencies. The maps created by the HFI Data
Processing Centre reach our goals in terms of sensitivity, resolution, and
photometric accuracy. They are already sufficiently accurate and
well-characterised to allow scientific analyses which are presented in an
accompanying series of early papers. At this stage, HFI data appears to be of
high quality and we expect that with further refinements of the data processing
we should be able to achieve, or exceed, the science goals of the Planck
project.
