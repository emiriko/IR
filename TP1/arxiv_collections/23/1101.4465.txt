We consider a simple model of higher order, functional computation over the
booleans. Then, we enrich the model in order to encompass non-termination and
unrecoverable errors, taken separately or jointly. We show that the models so
defined form a lattice when ordered by the extensional collapse situation
relation, introduced in order to compare models with respect to the amount of
"intensional information" that they provide on computation. The proofs are
carried out by exhibiting suitable applied {\lambda}-calculi, and by exploiting
the fundamental lemma of logical relations.
