In this contribution we summarize recent progress in understanding the shear
viscosity of strongly correlated dilute Fermi gases. We discuss predictions
from kinetic theory, and show how these predictions can be tested using recent
experimental data on elliptic flow. We find agreement between theory and
experiments in the high temperature regime $T\gg T_F$, where $T_F$ is the the
temperature where quantum degeneracy effects become important. In the low
temperature regime, $T\sim T_F$, the strongest constraints on the shear
viscosity come from experimental studies of the damping of collective modes.
These experiments indicate that $\eta/s\lsim 0.5\hbar/k_B$, where $\eta$ is the
shear viscosity and $s$ is the entropy density.
