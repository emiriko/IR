Two groups [3,4] have confirmed the results of our paper concerning the
actual existence of low variance circles in the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) sky. They also point out that the effect does not contradict the LCDM
model - a matter which is not in dispute. We point out two discrepancies
between their treatment and ours, however, one technical, the other having to
do with the very understanding of what constitutes a Gaussian random signal.
Both groups simulate maps using the CMB power spectrum for LCDM, while we
simulate a pure Gaussian sky plus the WMAP's noise, which points out the
contradiction with a common statement [3] that "CMB signal is random noise of
Gaussian nature". For as it was shown in [5], the random component is a minor
one in the CMB signal, namely, about 0.2. Accordingly, the circles we saw are a
real structure of the CMB sky and they are not of a random Gaussian nature.
Although the structures studied certainly cannot contradict the power spectrum,
which is well fitted by LCDM model, we particularly emphasize that the low
variance circles occur in concentric families, and this key fact cannot be
explained as a purely random effect. It is, however a clear prediction of
conformal cyclic cosmology.
