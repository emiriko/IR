A generalization of the Cooper pairing mechanism is proposed which allows for
a triplet state of lower energy. This is achieved by incorporating spin into
the canonical commutation relations and by modifying the $\delta$ potential
contact interaction. The gap equation contain as solutions both singlet and
triplet states. It is shown that the triplet state is lower in energy than the
singlet state which may explain the spin-triplet superconductivity observed in
heavy fermion compound UPt3 and in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.
