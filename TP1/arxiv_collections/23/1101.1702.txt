This article aims to clarify the case and the mechanism where sanction or
punishment by institution can deliver the evolution of cooperation. Compared to
peer sanctioning, institutional sanctioning may be sensitive to players'
attitude toward players who do not pre-commit punishment. Departed from former
studies based on the punisher who always acts cooperatively, we assume that the
punishing player is skeptical in that she cooperates in proportion to how many
same types join in her team. Relying on stochastic adaptive dynamics, we show
that institutional sanctioning coupled with skeptical punisher can make
cooperation evolve for the case where peer sanctioning may not.
