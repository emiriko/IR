We discuss the properties of an object in the Subaru Deep Field (SDF)
classified as a galaxy in on-line data bases and revealed on the Subaru images
as a genuine polar-ring galaxy (PRG) candidate. We analyse available
photometric data and conclude that this object consists of a >5 Gyr old
early-type central body surrounded by a faint, narrow inner ring tilted at a
~25 deg angle relative to the polar axis of the host galaxy. The halo
surrounding the main stellar body exhibits a diversity of spatially extended
stellar features of low surface brightness, including a faint asymmetric
stellar cloud and two prominent loops. These faint features, together with the
unperturbed morphology of the central host, are clear signs of a recent
coalescence of two highly unequal mass galaxies, most likely a pre-existing
early-type galaxy and a close-by gas-rich dwarf galaxy. The presumed stellar
remnants observed near the edges of the ring, including possibly the surviving
captured companion itself, indicate that the merger is still taking place.
