Quantum phase transitions in the one-dimensional extended quantum compass
model in transverse field are studied by using the Jordan-Wigner
transformation. This model is always gapful except at the critical surfaces
where the energy gap disappears. We obtain the analytic expressions of all
critical fields which drive quantum phase transitions. This model shows a rich
phase diagram which includes spin-flop, strip antiferromagnetic and saturate
ferromagnetic phases in addition to the phase with anti parallel ordering of
spin $y$ component on odd bonds. However we study the universality and scaling
properties of the transverse susceptibility and nearest-neighbor correlation
functions derivatives in different regions to confirm the results obtained
using the energy gap analysis.
