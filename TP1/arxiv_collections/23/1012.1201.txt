In the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, CP-even Higgs bosons
can have masses in the range of 80-110 GeV in agreement with constraints from
LEP due to their sizeable singlet component. Nevertheless their branching ratio
into two photons can be 10 times larger than the one of a Standard Model Higgs
boson of similar mass due to a reduced coupling to b quarks. This can lead to a
spectacular enhancement of the Higgs signal rate in the di-photon channel at
hadron colliders by a factor 6. Corresponding scenarios can occur in the
Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model for a relatively low Susy
breaking scale.
