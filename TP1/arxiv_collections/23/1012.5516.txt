We have investigated charge dynamics and electronic structures for single
crystals of metallic layered nickelates, R2-xSrxNiO4 (R=Nd, Eu), isostructural
to La2-xSrxCuO4. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on the
barely-metallic Eu0.9Sr1.1NiO4 (R=Eu, x=1.1) has revealed a large hole surface
of x2-y2 character with a high-energy pseudogap of the same symmetry and
comparable magnitude with those of underdoped (x<0.1) cuprates, although the
antiferromagnetic interactions are one order of magnitude smaller. This finding
strongly indicates that the momentum-dependent pseudogap feature in the layered
nickelate arises from the real-space charge correlation.
