We review recent theoretical calculations of quantum entanglement in
photosynthetic light harvesting complexes. These works establish, for the first
time, a manifestation of this characteristically quantum mechanical phenomenon
in biologically functional structures. We begin by summarizing calculations on
model biomolecular systems that aim to reveal non-trivial characteristics of
quantum entanglement in non-equilibrium biological environments. We then
discuss and compare several calculations performed recently of excitonic
dynamics in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson light harvesting complex and of the
entanglement present in this widely studied pigment-protein structure. We point
out the commonalities between the derived results and also identify and explain
the differences. We also discuss recent work that examines entanglement in the
structurally more intricate light harvesting complex II (LHCII). During this
overview, we take the opportunity to clarify several subtle issues relating to
entanglement in such biomolecular systems, including the role of entanglement
in biological function, the complexity of dynamical modeling that is required
to capture the salient features of entanglement in such biomolecular systems,
and the relationship between entanglement and other quantum mechanical features
that are observed and predicted in light harvesting complexes. Finally, we
suggest possible extensions of the current work and also review the options for
experimental confirmation of the predicted entanglement phenomena in light
harvesting complexes.
