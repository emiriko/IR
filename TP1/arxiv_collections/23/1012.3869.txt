The thermodynamical phenomenological theory of magnetically active
superconducting materials and magnetic-superconducting heterostructures is
presented. The materials may exhibit arbitrarily strong anisotropy, parametric
or structural. Exact anisotropic similarity transformations are found for both
the continuum and layered hybrid systems.
