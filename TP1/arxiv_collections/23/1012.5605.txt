We propose a new model of a {\it gravastar} admitting conformal motion. While
retaining the framework of the Mazur-Mottola model, the gravastar is assumed to
be internally charged, with an exterior defined by a Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m
rather than a Schwarzschild line element. The solutions obtained involve (i)
the interior region, (ii) the shell, and (iii) the exterior region of the
sphere. Of these three cases the first case is of primary interest since the
total gravitational mass vanishes for vanishing charge and turns the total
gravitational mass into an {\it electromagnetic mass} under certain conditions.
This suggests that the interior de Sitter vacuum of a charged gravastar is
essentially an electromagnetic mass model that must generate the gravitational
mass. We have also analyzed various other aspects such as the stress energy
tensor in the thin shell and the entropy of the system.
