Focusing on four types of correlation plots, $R_{\rm AA}$ vs. $v_2$, $R_{\rm
AA}$ vs. $I_{\rm AA}$, $I_{\rm AA}$ vs. $v_2^{I_{\rm AA}}$ and $v_2$ vs.\
$v_2^{I_{\rm AA}}$, we demonstrate how the centrality dependence of
\emph{correlations} between multiple jet quenching observables provide valuable
insight into the energy loss mechanism in a quark-gluon plasma. In particular
we find that a qualitative energy loss model gives a good description of
$R_{\rm AA}$ vs.\ $v_2$ only when we take $\Delta E\sim l^3$ and a medium
geometry generated by a model of the Color Glass Condensate. This same $\Delta
E\sim l^3$ model also qualitatively describes the trigger $p_T$ dependence of
$R_{\rm AA}$ vs.\ $I_{\rm AA}$ data and makes novel predictions for the
centrality dependence for this $R_{\rm AA}$ vs.\ $I_{\rm AA}$ correlation.
Current data suggests, albeit with extremely large uncertainty, that
$v_2^{I_{\rm AA}}\gg v_2$, a correlation that is difficult to reproduce in
current energy loss models.
