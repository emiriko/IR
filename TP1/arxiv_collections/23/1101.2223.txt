Even though ideas of extracting future-related, or Faster-Than-Light (FTL)
information from hyperspace using quantum entanglement have generally been
refuted in the last ten years, in this paper we show that the original 'Delayed
Choice Quantum Eraser Experiment', 1st performed by Yoon-Ho Kim, R. Yu, S.P.
Kulik, Y.H. Shih, designed by Marlan O. Scully & Druhl in 1982-1999, still
features hidden topological properties that may have been overlooked by
previous analysis, and which prohibit, by principle, the extraction of
future-related or real-time information from the detection of the signal
particle on the delayed choice of its entangled idler twin(s). We show that
such properties can be removed, and quantum-level information from certain
hypersurfaces of past, present or future spacetime may be collected real-time,
without resulting in any paradox or violation of causality.
