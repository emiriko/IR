We calculate the O(alpha_s) corrections to the timelike, spacelike and double
deeply virtual Compton scattering amplitudes in the generalized Bjorken scaling
region. Special attention is devoted to studies of the difference between the
next to leading order timelike and spacelike coefficient functions, which plays
for this process a role analogous to the large K factor which was much
discussed in the analysis of inclusive Drell Yan cross sections. Also in the
present studies the timelike nature of the hard scale gives rise to new
absorptive part of the amplitude and to the presence of characteristic pi^2
terms, which can potentially lead to sizeable corrections.
