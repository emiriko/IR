This paper highlights the size-dependency of income distributions, i.e. the
income distribution curves versus the population of a country systematically.
By using the generalized Lotka-Volterra model to fit the empirical income data
in the United States during 1996-2007, we found an important parameter
$\lambda$ can scale with a $\beta$ power of the size (population) of U.S. in
that year. We pointed out that the size-dependency of the income distributions,
which is a very important property but seldom addressed by previous studies,
has two non-trivial implications: (1) the allometric growth pattern, i.e. the
power law relationship between population and GDP in different years, which can
be mathematically derived from the size-dependent income distributions and also
supported by the empirical data; (2) the connection with the anomalous scaling
for the probability density function in critical phenomena since the re-scaled
form of the income distributions has the exactly same mathematical expression
for the limit distribution of the sum of many correlated random variables
asymptotically.
