In the present work, we numerically explore the existence and stability
properties of different types of configurations of dark-bright solitons,
dark-bright soliton pairs and pairs of dark-bright and dark solitons in
discrete settings, starting from the anti-continuum limit. We find that while
single discrete dark-bright solitons have similar stability properties to
discrete dark solitons, their pairs may only be stable if the bright components
are in phase and are always unstable if the bright components are out of phase.
Pairs of dark-bright solitons with dark ones have similar stability properties
as individual dark or dark-bright ones. Lastly, we consider collisions between
dark-bright solitons and between a dark-bright one and a dark one. Especially
in the latter and in the regime where the underlying lattice structure matters,
we find a wide range of potential dynamical outcomes depending on the initial
soliton speed.
