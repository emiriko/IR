We investigate the interplay between the strong correlation and the
spin-orbital coupling in the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model and obtain the qualitative
phase diagram via the variational cluster approach. We identify, through an
increase of the Hubbard $U$, the transition from the topological band insulator
to either the spin liquid phase or the easy-plane antiferromagnetic insulating
phase, depending on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling. A nontrivial
evolution of the bulk bands in the topological quantum phase transition is also
demonstrated.
