A measurement of the cross section for the inclusive production of isolated
prompt photons in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy sqrt(s) = 7TeV is
presented. The measurement covers the pseudorapidity ranges |eta|<1.37 and
1.52<|eta|<1.81 in the transverse energy range 15 < E_T <100 GeV. The results
are based on an integrated luminosity of 880 nb-1, collected with the ATLAS
detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Photon candidates are identified by
combining information from the calorimeters and from the inner tracker.
Residual background in the selected sample is estimated from data based on the
observed distribution of the transverse isolation energy in a narrow cone
around the photon candidate. The results are compared to predictions from
next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations.
