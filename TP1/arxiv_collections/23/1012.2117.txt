In this paper we introduce a simple phenomenological model of the conduction
between a couple of serial or parallel quantum dots. This model is extended to
arbitrary of number and to a square array of quantum dots. The local potential
is computed taking into account the net charge at the quantum dot. Master
equation are presented for total current and charge number N taking considering
both the local potential and the local current. Interesting results are
reported, namely the Negative Differential Resistance for serial quantum dots
as well as resonant conductance. A paradoxical asymmetric current appears for
the parallel case due to the capacitive coupling.
