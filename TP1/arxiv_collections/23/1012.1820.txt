We apply a simple statistical mechanics cluster approximation for studying
clustering in the Kern and Frenkel model of Janus fluids. The approach is
motivated by recent Monte Carlo simulations work on the same model revealing
that the vapor coexisting with the liquid phase contains clusters of different
sizes and shapes whose equilibrium concentrations in general depend on the
interaction range as well as on thermodynamic parameters. The approximation
hinges on a separation between the intra- and inter-cluster contribution to
thermodynamics, where only the former is explicitly computed by Monte Carlo
simulations. Two levels of a simple liquid theory approximation are exploited
for the description of the latter. In the first we use the ideal-gas
expressions and obtain a qualitative agreement with extensive Monte Carlo bulk
simulations. This can be improved to a semi-quantitative agreement, by using a
hard-sphere description for the cluster-cluster correlations.
