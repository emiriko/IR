We show that every Weyl module for a current algebra has a filtration whose
successive quotients are isomorphic to Demazure modules, and that the path
model for a tensor product of level zero fundamental representations is
isomorphic to a disjoint union of Demazure crystals. Moreover, we show that the
Demazure modules appearing in these two objects coincide exactly. Though these
results have been previously known in the simply laced case, they are new in
the non-simply laced case.
