In early 2009, immediately following the end of the WR140 periastron campaign
(see these proceedings), I turned my telescope back to epsilon Aurigae in time
for the start of the eclipse. As well as being an interesting object in its own
right, the Pro-Am campaign being run on epsilon Aurigae during the current
eclipse is a good example of how amateur spectroscopists can make a useful
contribution. epsilon Aurigae is a naked eye magnitude 3 star and was first
noted to be variable by Johan Frisch in 1821. It was subsequently found to be
an eclipsing binary with a period of 27.1 years which undergoes an
approximately 2 year long flat-bottomed eclipse with approximately 0.8
magnitude drop in V.
