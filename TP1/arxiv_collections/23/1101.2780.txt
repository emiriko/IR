We report on new X-ray observations of the classical T Tauri star DG Tau. DG
Tau drives a collimated bi-polar jet known to be a source of X-ray emission
perhaps driven by internal shocks. The rather modest extinction permits study
of the jet system to distances very close to the star itself. Our initial
results presented here show that the spatially resolved X-ray jet has been
moving and fading during the past six years. In contrast, a stationary, very
soft source much closer (~ 0.15-0.2") to the star but apparently also related
to the jet has brightened during the same period. We report accurate
temperatures and absorption column densities toward this source, which is
probably associated with the jet base or the jet collimation region.
