We present the integrated chip-scale tuning of multiple photonic crystal
cavities. The optimized implementation allows effective and precise tuning of
multiple cavity resonances (up to ~1.60 nm/mW) and inter-cavity phase (~ 0.038
pi/mW) by direct local temperature tuning on silicon nanomembranes. Through
designing the serpentine metal electrodes and careful electron-beam alignment
to avoid cavity mode overlap, the coupled photonic crystal L3 cavities preserve
their high quality factors. The deterministic resonance and phase control
enables switching between the all-optical analogue of
electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT) to flat-top filter lineshapes,
with future applications of trapping photons/photonic transistors and
optoelectronic modulators.
