Approximation algorithms for classical constraint satisfaction problems are
one of the main research areas in theoretical computer science. Here we define
a natural approximation version of the QMA-complete local Hamiltonian problem
and initiate its study. We present two main results. The first shows that a
non-trivial approximation ratio can be obtained in the class NP using product
states. The second result (which builds on the first one), gives a polynomial
time (classical) algorithm providing a similar approximation ratio for dense
instances of the problem. The latter result is based on an adaptation of the
"exhaustive sampling method" by Arora et al. [J. Comp. Sys. Sci. 58, p.193
(1999)] to the quantum setting, and might be of independent interest.
