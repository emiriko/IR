The Majorana Collaboration is assembling an array of HPGe detectors to search
for neutrinoless double-beta decay in Ge-76. Initially, Majorana aims to
construct a prototype module to demonstrate the potential of a future 1-tonne
experiment. The design and potential reach of this prototype Demonstrator
module are presented.
