Using the Triple Helix model of university-industry-government relations, one
can measure the extent to which innovation has become systemic instead of
assuming the existence of national (or regional) systems of innovations on a
priori grounds. Systemness of innovation patterns, however, can be expected to
remain in transition because of integrating and differentiating forces.
Integration among the functions of wealth creation, knowledge production, and
normative control takes place at the interfaces in organizations, while
exchanges on the market, scholarly communication in knowledge production, and
political discourse tend to differentiate globally. The neo-institutional and
the neo-evolutionary versions of the Triple Helix model enable us to capture
this tension reflexively. Empirical studies inform us whether more than three
helices are needed for the explanation. The Triple Helix indicator can be
extended algorithmically, for example, with local-global as a fourth dimension
or, more generally, to an N-tuple of helices.
