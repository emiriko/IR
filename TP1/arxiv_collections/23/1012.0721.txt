In this paper we have studied the problem of photovoltaic power generation
near selected stars in the solar neighborhood. The nature of the optical
radiation from a star will depend on its luminosity,HR classification and
spectral characteristics. The solar celloperation in the habitable zones of the
stars is similar to AM1.0 operation near earth.Thecurrent space solar cell
technology can be adopted for power generation near G,K and Mtype stars.
Silicon solar cells with good near IR response are particularly suitable in
theenvironments of M type stars which are most abundant in the universe. .
Photovoltaicpower generation near binary stars like Sirius and Alpha Centauri
is also discussed.
