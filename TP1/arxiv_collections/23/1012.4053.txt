The main result of this note is a Giambelli formula for the Peterson Schubert
classes in the $S^1$-equivariant cohomology ring of a type $A$ Peterson
variety. Our results depend on the Monk formula for the equivariant structure
constants for the Peterson Schubert classes derived by Harada and Tymoczko. In
addition, we give proofs of two facts observed by H. Naruse: firstly, that some
constants which appear in the multiplicative structure of the $S^1$-equivariant
cohomology of Peterson varieties are Stirling numbers of the second kind, and
secondly, that the Peterson Schubert classes satisfy a stability property in a
sense analogous to the stability of the classical equivariant Schubert classes
in the $T$-equivariant cohomology of the flag variety.
