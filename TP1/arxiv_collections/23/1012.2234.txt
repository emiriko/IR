M dwarfs constitute more than 70% of the stars in the solar neighborhood.
They are cooler and smaller than Sun-like stars and have less-massive disks
which suggests that planets around these stars are more likely to be
Neptune-size or smaller. The transit depths and transit times of planets around
M stars are large and well-matched to the Kepler temporal resolution. As a
result, M stars have been of particular interest for searching for planets in
both radial velocity and transit photometry surveys. We have recently started a
project on searching for possible planet-hosting M stars in the publicly
available data from Kepler space telescope. We have used four criteria, namely,
the magnitude, proper motion, H-Ks and J-H colors, and searched for M stars in
Q0 and Q1 data sets. We have been able to find 108 M stars among which 54 had
not been previously identified among Kepler's targets. We discuss the details
of our selection process and present the results.
