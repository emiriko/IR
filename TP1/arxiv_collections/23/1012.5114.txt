The Exceptional Supersymmetric (SUSY) Standard Model predicts three families
of Higgs doublets plus three Higgs singlets, where one family develops vacuum
expectation values (VEVs), while the remaining two which do not are called
Inert. The model can account for the dark matter relic abundance if the two
lightest Inert neutralinos, identified as the (next-to) lightest SUSY particles
((N)LSPs), have masses close to half the Z mass. In this case we find that the
usual SM-like Higgs boson decays more than 95% of the time into either LSPs or
NLSPs. The latter case produces a final state containing two leptons l^{+}l^{-}
with an invariant mass less than or about 10 GeV. We illustrate this scenario
with a set of benchmark points satisfying phenomenological constraints and the
WMAP dark matter relic abundance. This scenario also predicts other light Inert
chargino and neutralino states below 200 GeV, and large LSP direct detection
cross-sections close to current limits and observable soon at XENON100.
