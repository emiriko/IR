We investigate the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) from a quantum chemical
perspective. Dynamical mean-field theory offers a formalism to extend quantum
chemical methods for finite systems to infinite periodic problems within a
local correlation approximation. In addition, quantum chemical techniques can
be used to construct new ab-initio Hamiltonians and impurity solvers for DMFT.
Here we explore some ways in which these things may be achieved. First, we
present an informal overview of dynamical mean-field theory to connect to
quantum chemical language. Next we describe an implementation of dynamical
mean-field theory where we start from an ab-initio Hartree- Fock Hamiltonian
that avoids double counting issues present in many applications of DMFT. We
then explore the use of the configuration interaction hierarchy in DMFT as an
approximate solver for the impurity problem. We also investigate some numerical
issues of convergence within DMFT. Our studies are carried out in the context
of the cubic hydrogen model, a simple but challenging test for correlation
methods. Finally we finish with some conclusions for future directions.
