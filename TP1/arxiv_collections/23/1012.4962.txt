Consider the following problem: given a set system (U,I) and an edge-weighted
graph G = (U, E) on the same universe U, find the set A in I such that the
Steiner tree cost with terminals A is as large as possible: "which set in I is
the most difficult to connect up?" This is an example of a max-min problem:
find the set A in I such that the value of some minimization (covering) problem
is as large as possible.
  In this paper, we show that for certain covering problems which admit good
deterministic online algorithms, we can give good algorithms for max-min
optimization when the set system I is given by a p-system or q-knapsacks or
both. This result is similar to results for constrained maximization of
submodular functions. Although many natural covering problems are not even
approximately submodular, we show that one can use properties of the online
algorithm as a surrogate for submodularity.
  Moreover, we give stronger connections between max-min optimization and
two-stage robust optimization, and hence give improved algorithms for robust
versions of various covering problems, for cases where the uncertainty sets are
given by p-systems and q-knapsacks.
