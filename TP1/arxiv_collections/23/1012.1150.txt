A disordered (glassy) state has been searched in solid 3He deformed in the
course of experiment employing precise measurements of pressure. The analysis
of the temperature dependence of the crystal pressure measured at a constant
volume shows that the main contribution to the pressure is made by the phonon
subsystem, the influence of the disordered phase being very weak. Annealing of
the deformed crystal does not affect this state. The results obtained differ
greatly from the corresponding data for solid 4He measured in the region of
supersolid effects where a pressure excessive in comparison to the phonon one
was registered. The excess pressure had a quadratic dependence on temperature,
which is typical of a disordered system. Absence of the excess pressure in
solid 3He is unclear yet, some speculative interpretations are suggested.
