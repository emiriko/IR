We study the possibilities to analyse the data on leading neutrons production
at first LHC runs. These data could be used to extract from it $\pi^+ p$ and
$\pi^+\pi^+$ cross-sections. In this note we estimate relative contributions of
$\pi$, $\rho$ and $a_2$ reggeons to charge exchanges and discuss related
problems of measurements.
