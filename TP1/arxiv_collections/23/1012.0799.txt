The differential cross section for the inclusive production of isolated
prompt photons has been measured as a function of the photon transverse energy
E_T-gamma in pp collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV using data recorded by the CMS
detector at the LHC. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of
2.9 inverse picobarns. Photons are required to have a pseudorapidity
|eta_gamma|<1.45 and E_T-gamma > 21 GeV, covering the kinematic region 0.006 <
x_T < 0.086. The measured cross section is found to be in agreement with
next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations.
