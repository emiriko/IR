We extend the generalized Langevin model, originally developed for the
Lagrangian fluid particle velocity in constant-density shear-driven turbulence,
to variable-density (VD) pressure-gradient-driven flows. VD effects due to
non-uniform mass concentrations (e.g. mixing of different species) are
considered. In the extended model large density fluctuations leading to large
differential fluid accelerations are accounted for. This is an essential
ingredient to represent the strong coupling between the density and velocity
fields in VD hydrodynamics driven by active scalar mixing. The small scale
anisotropy, a fundamentally "non-Kolmogorovian" feature of
pressure-gradient-driven flows, is captured by a tensorial stochastic diffusion
term. The extension is so constructed that it reduces to the original Langevin
model in the limit of constant density. We show that coupling a Lagrangian
mass-density particle model to the proposed extended velocity equation results
in a statistical representation of VD turbulence that has important benefits.
Namely, the effects of the mass flux and the specific volume, both essential in
the prediction of VD flows, are retained in closed form and require no explicit
closure assumptions. The paper seeks to describe a theoretical framework
necessary for subsequent applications. We derive the rigorous mathematical
consequences of assuming a particular functional form of the stochastic
momentum equation coupled to the stochastic density field in VD flows. A
previous article discussed VD mixing and developed a stochastic Lagrangian
model equation for the mass-density. Second in the series, this article
develops the momentum equation for VD hydrodynamics. A third, forthcoming paper
will combine these ideas on mixing and hydrodynamics into a comprehensive
framework: it will specify a model for the coupled problem and validate it by
computing a Rayleigh-Taylor flow.
