We pose the question of what effect the statistical fluctuation causes if it
induces a non-unitary evolution. We apply this idea to the BCS model and study
fluctuation around the mean-field average. We find that, dynamics of the
thermalization influences the equilibrium besides the non-unitary evolution,
and the resulting equilibrium state is no longer the canonical one. The
pseudogap phenomenon can exist in this model.
