Relationships between partial-wave amplitude parametrizations, in particular
the Chew-Mandelstam approach, and dynamical coupled-channel models are
established and investigated. A bare pole corresponding to the Delta(1232)
resonance, found in a recent dynamical-model fit to pion- and omega-meson
production reactions, compares closely to one found in a unitary multichannel
partial-wave amplitude parametrization of SAID. The model dependence of the
bare pole precludes a direct connection between the approaches but is
suggestive that the dynamical description and the phenomenological
parametrization are closely related.
