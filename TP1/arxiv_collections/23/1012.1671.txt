Direct-touch presentation devices such as touch-sensitive electronic
whiteboards have two serious problems. First, the presenter's hand movements
tend to distract the audience's attention from content. Second, the presenter'
s manipulation tends to obscure content. In this paper we describe a new
electronic whiteboard system that supports multi-touch gestures and employs a
special pie menu interface named "sPieMenu." This pie menu is displayed under
the presenter's palm and is thus invisible to the audience. A series of
experiments shows that the proposed system allows both novice and expert users
to efficiently manipulate the electronic whiteboard, and that the proposed
system decreases distraction to the audience compared to traditional
approaches.
