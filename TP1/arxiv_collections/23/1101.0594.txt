The standard model of cosmology LCDM assumes general relativity, flat space,
and the presence of a positive cosmological constant. We relax these
assumptions allowing spatial curvature, time-dependent effective dark energy
equation of state, as well as modifications of the Poisson equation for the
lensing potential, and modifications of the growth of linear matter density
perturbations in alternate combinations. Using six parameters characterizing
these relations, we check LCDM for consistency utilizing cosmic microwave
background anisotropies, cross correlations thereof with high-redshift galaxies
through the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, the Hubble constant, supernovae and
baryon acoustic oscillation distances, as well as the relation between weak
gravitational lensing and galaxy flows. In all scenarios, we find consistency
of the concordance model at the 95% confidence level. However, we emphasize
that constraining supplementary background parameters and parametrizations of
the growth of large-scale structure separately may lead to a priori exclusion
of viable departures from the concordance model.
