We investigate the effects of high-Q_c resonant cavity on macroscopic quantum
tunneling (MQT) of fluxon both from a metastable state to continuum and from
one degenerate ground-state of a double-well potential to the other. By using a
set of two coupled perturbed sine-Gordon equations, we describe the tunneling
processes in linear long Josephson junctions (LJJs) and find that MQT in the
resonant cavity increases due to potential renomalization, induced by the
interaction between the fluxon and cavity.Enhancement of the MQT rate in the
weak-coupling regime is estimated by using the experimantally accessible range
of the model parameters. The tunneling rate from the metastable state is found
to increase weakly with increasing junction-cavity interaction strength.
However, the energy splitting between the two degenerate ground-states of the
double-well potential increases significantly with increasing both the
interaction strength and frequency of the resonant cavity mode. Finally, we
discuss how the resonant cavity may be used to tune the property of Josephson
vortex quantum bits.
