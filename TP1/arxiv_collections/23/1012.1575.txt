A scheme is proposed for the preparation of a tagged highly polarized
antineutron beam, so far not available for experiments. Unpolarized antineutron
fluxes are expected to exceed previous intensities by more than an order of
magnitude. The method used is based on electropion production on a stored
antiproton beam.
