In wide enough systems, plane Couette flow, the flow established between two
parallel plates translating in opposite directions, displays alternatively
turbulent and laminar oblique bands in a given range of Reynolds numbers R. We
show that in periodic domains that contain a few bands, for given values of R
and size, the orientation and the wavelength of this pattern can fluctuate in
time. A procedure is defined to detect well-oriented episodes and to determine
the statistics of their lifetimes. The latter turn out to be distributed
according to exponentially decreasing laws. This statistics is interpreted in
terms of an activated process described by a Langevin equation whose
deterministic part is a standard Landau model for two interacting complex
amplitudes whereas the noise arises from the turbulent background.
