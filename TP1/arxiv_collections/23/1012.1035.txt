The LEP experiments give a lower bound on the neutralino mass of about 46 GeV
which, however, relies on a supersymmetric grand unification relation. Dropping
this assumption, the experimental lower bound on the neutralino mass vanishes
completely. Recent analyses suggest, however, that in the minimal
supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), a light neutralino dark matter candidate
has a lower bound on its mass of about 7 GeV. In light of this, we investigate
the mass sensitivity at the ILC for very light neutralinos. We study slepton
pair production, followed by the decay of the sleptons to a lepton and the
lightest neutralino. We find that the mass measurement accuracy for a few-GeV
neutralino is around 2 GeV, or even less if the relevant slepton is
sufficiently light. We thus conclude that the ILC can help verify or falsify
the MSSM neutralino cold dark matter model even for very light neutralinos.
