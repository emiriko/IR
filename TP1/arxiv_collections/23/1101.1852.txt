The workshop on "Hadron-Hadron and Cosmic-Ray Interactions at multi-TeV
Energies" held at the ECT* centre (Trento) in Nov.-Dec. 2010 gathered together
both theorists and experimentalists to discuss issues of the physics of
high-energy hadronic interactions of common interest for the particle, nuclear
and cosmic-ray communities. QCD results from collider experiments -- mostly
from the LHC but also from the Tevatron, RHIC and HERA -- were discussed and
compared to various hadronic Monte Carlo generators, aiming at an improvement
of our theoretical understanding of soft, semi-hard and hard parton dynamics.
The latest cosmic-ray results from various ground-based observatories were also
presented with an emphasis on the phenomenological modeling of the first
hadronic interactions of the extended air-showers generated in the Earth
atmosphere. These mini-proceedings consist of an introduction and short
summaries of the talks presented at the meeting.
