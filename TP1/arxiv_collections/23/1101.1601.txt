An inaccuracy of composite fermion model is identified for Landau level
fillings out of 1/p, p odd. The corrected version of hierarchy for fractional
quantum Hall effect is proposed by mapping onto integer effect within the
cyclotron braid approach. Flux-tubes and vortices for composite fermion
constructions are explained in terms of cyclotron braids. The even denominator
fractional lowest Landau level fillings, including Hall metal, are also
discussed in cyclotron braid terms.
