We construct a qubit algebra from field creation and annihilation operators
acting on a global vacuum state. Particles to be used as qubits are created
from the vacuum by a near-deterministic single particle source. Our formulation
makes the space-time dependence of the qubits explicit, preparing the way for
quantum computation within a field framework. The method can be generalized to
deal with interacting qubits whose wavepackets are not perfectly matched to
each other. We give an example of how to calculate the Heisenberg evolution of
a simple two-qubit circuit, taking expectation values in the field vacuum
state.
