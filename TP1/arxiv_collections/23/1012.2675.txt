Magnetic properties of a series of (La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrRuO3) superlattices,
where the SrRuO3 layer thickness is varying, are examined. A room-temperature
magnetocaloric effect is obtained owing to the finite size effect which reduces
the TC of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 layers. While the working temperature ranges are
enlarged,, -DeltaSmax values remains similar to the values in polycrystalline
La0.7Sr0.3MnO3. Consequently, the relative cooling powers are significantly
improved, the microscopic mechanism of which is related to the effect of the
interfaces at La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrRuO3 and higher nanostructural disorder. This
study indicates that artificial oxide superlattices/multilayers might provide
an alternative pathway in searching for efficient room-temperature magnetic
refrigerators for (nano)microscale systems.
