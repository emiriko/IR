Using the ab initio FLAPW-GGA method we examine the electronic band
structure, densities of states, and the Fermi surface topology for a very
recently synthesized ThCr2Si2-type potassium intercalated iron selenide
superconductor KxFe2Se2. We found that the electronic state of the
stoichiometric KFe2Se2 is far from that of the isostructural iron pnictide
superconductors. Thus the main factor responsible for experimentally observed
superconductivity for this material is the deficiency of potassium, i.e. the
hole doping effect. On the other hand, based on the results obtained, we
conclude that the tuning of the electronic system of the new KxFe2Se2
superconductor in the presence of K vacancies is achieved by joint effect owing
to structural relaxations and hole doping, where the structural factor is
responsible for the modification of the band topology, whereas the doping level
determines their filling.
