In this work the path integral formulation for rigid rotors, proposed by
M\"user and Berne [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 77}, 2638 (1996)], is described in
detail. It is shown how this formulation can be used to perform Monte Carlo
simulations of water. Our numerical results show that whereas some properties
of water can be accurately reproduced using classical simulations with an
empirical potential which, implicitly, includes quantum effects, other
properties can only be described quantitatively when quantum effects are
explicitly incorporated. In particular, quantum effects are extremely relevant
when it comes to describing the equation of state of the ice phases at low
temperatures, the structure of the ices at low temperatures, and the heat
capacity of both liquid water and the ice phases. They also play a minor role
in the relative stability of the ice phases.
