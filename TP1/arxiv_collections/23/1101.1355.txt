Radio-astronomy is about to embark on a new way of doing science. The
revolution that is about to take place is not due to the enormous sensitivity
of the Square Kilometre Array, which is still a decade away, but due to its
pathfinders, which are pioneering new ways of doing radio-astronomy. These new
ways include multi-pixel phased-array feeds, the goal of producing
science-ready images from a real-time pipeline processor, and from the vast
amounts of survey data that will be available in the public domain soon after
observing. Here I review the data challenges that need to be addressed if we
are to reap all the science that potentially resides in SKA Pathfinder data.
Some challenges are obvious, such as petabytes of data storage, and some are
less obvious, such as the techniques we have yet to develop to perform cross-
identifications on millions of galaxies.
