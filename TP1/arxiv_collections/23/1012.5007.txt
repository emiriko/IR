We investigate the prospects for Central Exclusive Diffractive (CED)
production of BSM Higgs bosons at the LHC using forward proton detectors
installed at 220 m and 420 m distance around ATLAS and / or CMS. We update a
previous analysis for the MSSM taking into account improvements in the
theoretical calculations and the most recent exclusion bounds from the
Tevatron. We extend the MSSM analysis to new benchmark scenarios that are in
agreement with the cold dark matter relic abundance and other precision
measurements. We analyse the exclusive production of Higgs bosons in a model
with a fourth generation of fermions. Finally, we comment on the determination
of Higgs spin-parity and coupling structures at the LHC and show that the
forward proton mode could provide crucial information on the CP properties of
the Higgs bosons.
