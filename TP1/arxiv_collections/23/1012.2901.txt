Visualisation and analysis of terabyte-scale datacubes, as will be produced
with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), will pose
challenges for existing astronomy software and the work practices of
astronomers. Focusing on the proposed outcomes of WALLABY (Widefield ASKAP
L-Band Legacy All-Sky Blind Survey), and using lessons learnt from HIPASS (HI
Parkes All Sky Survey), we identify issues that astronomers will face with
WALLABY data cubes. We comment on potential research directions and possible
solutions to these challenges.
