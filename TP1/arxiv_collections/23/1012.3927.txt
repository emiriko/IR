Near infrared pump-probe spectroscopy has been used to measure the ultrafast
dynamics of photoexcited charge carriers in monolayer and multilayer graphene.
We observe two decay processes occurring on 100 fs and 2 ps timescales. The
first is attributed to the rapid electron-phonon thermalisation in the system.
The second timescale is found to be due to the slow decay of hot phonons. Using
a simple theoretical model we calculate the hot phonon decay rate and show that
it is significantly faster in monolayer flakes than in multilayer ones. In
contrast to recent claims, we show that this enhanced decay rate is not due to
the coupling to substrate phonons, since we have also seen the same effect in
suspended flakes. Possible intrinsic decay mechanisms that could cause such an
effect are discussed.
