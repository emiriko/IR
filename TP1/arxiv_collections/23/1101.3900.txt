We evaluate the dispersion relation for massless fermions, described by the
Dirac equation, and for zero-spin bosons, described by the Klein-Gordon
equation, moving in two dimensions and in the presence of a one-dimensional
periodic potential. For massless fermions the dispersion relation shows a zero
gap for carriers with zero momentum in the direction parallel to the barriers
in agreement with the well-known "Klein paradox". Numerical results for the
energy spectrum and the density of states are presented. Those for fermions are
appropriate to graphene in which carriers behave relativistically with the
"light speed" replaced by the Fermi velocity. In addition, we evaluate the
transmission through a finite number of barriers for fermions and zero-spin
bosons and relate it with that through a superlattice.
