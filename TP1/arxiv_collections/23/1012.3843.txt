The width of a convex curve in the plane is the minimal distance between a
pair of parallel supporting lines of the curve. In this paper we study the
width of nodal lines of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on the standard flat
torus. We prove a variety of results on the width, some having stronger
versions assuming a conjecture of Cilleruelo and Granville asserting a uniform
bound for the number of lattice points on the circle lying in short arcs.
