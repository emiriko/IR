By an explicite calculation of Michelson interferometric output intensities
in the optomechanical scheme proposed by Marshall et al. (2003), an oscillatory
factor is obtained that may go down to zero just at the time a visibility
revival ought to be observed. Including a properly tuned phase shifter offers a
simple amendment to the situation. By using a Pockels phase shifter with fast
time-dependent modulation in one arm, one may obtain further possibilities to
enrich the quantum state preparation and reconstruction abilities of the
original scheme, thereby improving the chances to reliably detect genuine
quantum behaviour of a nanomechanical oscillator.
