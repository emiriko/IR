A new approach to describe comminution processes in general ball mills as a
macroscopic canonical ensemble is proposed. Using hamiltonian method, the model
is able to take simultaneously into account the internal dynamics from
mechanical motions inside the vial and external effects like electromagnetic
and gravitational forces. Relevant physical observables are extracted using
statistical mechanics approach through partition function at finite
temperature. The method enables numerical calculation using Monte Carlo
technique to obtain, for instance particle number evolution in term of system
temperature. It is argued that the method is experimentally more verifiable
than the conventional approaches based on geometrical displacements. An example
of simulation for typical spex mill is also given.
