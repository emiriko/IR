A theoretical model for the phonon-mediated off-resonant coupling between a
quantum dot and a cavity, under resonant excitation of the quantum dot, is
presented. We show that the coupling is caused by electron-phonon interaction
in the quantum dot and is enhanced by the cavity. We analyze recently observed
resonant quantum dot spectroscopic data by our theoretical model.
