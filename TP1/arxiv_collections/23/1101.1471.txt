A massive, charged, spherical central body can be neutralized by attracting
particles of opposite charge. We calculate the time it takes to neutralize
these central bodies using classical mechanics, special relativistic mechanics,
and finally, the "forced" trajectories of general relativity. While we can
compare the classical and (special) relativistic times, and find, predictably,
that the special relativistic neutralization time is longer, a comparison of
these times with the general relativistic result is not as directly possible.
We offer the final calculation as a demonstration of dynamics in a general
setting and in particular, the structural similarity of the (general)
relativistic problem to the other cases.
