We calculate the nonequilibrium dynamic evolution of a one-dimensional system
of two-component fermionic atoms after a strong local quench by using a
time-dependent spin-density-functional theory. The interaction quench is also
considered to see its influence on the spin-charge separation. It is shown that
the charge velocity is larger than the spin velocity for the system of on-site
repulsive interaction (Luttinger liquid), and vise versa for the system of
on-site attractive interaction (Luther-Emery liquid). We find that both the
interaction quench and polarization suppress the spin-charge separation.
