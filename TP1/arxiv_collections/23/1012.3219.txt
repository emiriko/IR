Let G be a reductive algebraic group over the complex field and O_h be a
closed adjoint orbit through a semisimple element h. By a result of Borho and
Kraft (1979), it is known that the asymptotic cone of the orbit O_h is the
closure of a Richardson nilpotent orbit corresponding to a parabolic subgroup
whose Levi component is the centralizer Z_G(h) in G.
  In this paper, we prove an analogue on a semisimple orbit for a symmetric
pair (G, K).
