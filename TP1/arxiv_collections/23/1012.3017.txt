We systematically measured the DC voltage V_ISH induced by spin pumping
together with the inverse spin Hall effect in ferromagnet/platinum bilayer
films. In all our samples, comprising ferromagnetic 3d transition metals,
Heusler compounds, ferrite spinel oxides, and magnetic semiconductors, V_ISH
invariably has the same polarity. V_ISH furthermore scales with the
magnetization precession cone angle with a universal prefactor, irrespective of
the magnetic properties, the charge carrier transport mechanism or type. These
findings quantitatively corroborate the present theoretical understanding of
spin pumping in combination with the inverse spin Hall effect.
