Soft gamma repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars are believed to be
magnetars, i.e. neutron stars powered by extreme magnetic fields,
B~10^(14)-10^(15) Gauss. The recent discovery of a soft gamma repeater with low
magnetic field (< 7.5x10^(12) Gauss), SGR 0418+5729, which shows bursts similar
to those of SGRs, implies that a high surface dipolar magnetic field might not
be necessary for magnetar-like activity. We show that the quiescent and
bursting properties of SGR 0418+5729 find natural explanations in the context
of low-magnetic field Quark-Nova (detonative transition from a neutron star to
a quark star) remnants, i.e. an old quark star surrounded by degenerate
(iron-rich) Keplerian ring/debris ejected during the Quark-Nova explosion. We
find that a 16 Myr old quark star surrounded by a ~ 10^(-10)xM_sun ring,
extending in radius from ~ 30 km to 60 km, reproduces many observed properties
of SGR 0418+5729. The SGR-like burst is caused by magnetic penetration of the
inner part of the ring and subsequent accretion. Radiation feedback results in
months-long accretion from the ring's non-degenerate atmosphere which matches
well the observed decay phase. We make specific predictions (such as an
accretion glitch of Delta P/P ~ - 2x10^(-11) during burst and a sub-keV proton
cyclotron line from the ring) that can be tested by sensitive observations.
