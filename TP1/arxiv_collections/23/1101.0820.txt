This study addresses the matter of reflexive control of the emotional states
by means of Reflexive Game Theory (RGT). It is shown how to build a bridge
between RGT and emotions. For this purpose the Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD)
model is adopted. The major advantages of RGT are its ability to predict human
behavior and unfold the entire spectra of reflexion in the human mind. On the
other hand, PAD provides ultimate approach to model emotions. It is illustrated
that emotions are reflexive processes and, consequently, RGT fused with PAD
model is natural solution to model emotional interactions between people. The
fusion of RGT and PAD, called Emotional Reflexive Games (ERG), inherits the key
features of both components. Using ERG, we show how reflexive control can be
successfully applied to model human emotional states. Up to date, EGR is a
unique methodology capable of modeling human reflexive processes and emotional
aspects simultaneously.
