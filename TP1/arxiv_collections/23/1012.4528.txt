We show a spin superconductor (SSC) in ferromagnetic graphene as the
counterpart to the charge superconductor, in which a spin-polarized
electron-hole pair plays the role of the spin $2 (\hbar/2)$ `Cooper pair' with
a neutral charge. We present a BCS-type theory for the SSC. With the
`London-type equations' of the super-spin-current density, we show the
existence of an electric `Meissner effect' against a spatial varying electric
field. We further study a SSC/normal conductor/SSC junction and predict a
spin-current Josephson effect.
