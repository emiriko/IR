The Schrodinger equation with the trigonometric Rosen-Morse potential in flat
three dimensional Euclidean space, E3, and its exact solutions are shown to be
also exactly transformable to momentum space, though the resulting equation is
purely algebraic and can not be cast into the canonical form of an integral
Lippmann-Schwinger equation. This is because the cotangent function does not
allow for an exact Fourier transform in E3. In addition we recall, that the
above potential can be also viewed as an angular function of the second polar
angle parametrizing the three dimensional spherical surface, S3, of a constant
radius, in which case the cotangent function would allow for an exact integral
transform to momentum space. On that basis, we obtain a momentum space
Lippmann-Schwinger-type equation, though the corresponding wavefunctions have
to be obtained numerically.
