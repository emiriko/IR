In the case of barotropic FRW cosmologies, the Hubble parameter in conformal
time is the solution of a simple Riccati equation of constant coefficients. We
consider these cosmologies in the framework of nonrelativistic supersymmetry
that has been effective in the area of supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
Recalling that Faraoni [Amer. J. Phys. 67 (1999), 732-734] showed how to reduce
the barotropic FRW system of differential equations to simple harmonic
oscillator differential equations, we set the latter equations in the
supersymmetric approach and divide their solutions into two classes of
'bosonic' (nonsingular) and 'fermionic' (singular) cosmological zero-mode
solutions. The fermionic equations can be considered as representing
cosmologies of Stephani type, i.e., inhomogeneous and curvature-changing in the
conformal time. We next apply the so-called shifted Riccati procedure by
introducing a constant additive parameter, denoted by S, in the common Riccati
solution of these supersymmetric partner cosmologies. This leads to barotropic
Stephani cosmologies with periodic singularities in their spatial curvature
indices that we call U and V cosmologies, the first being of bosonic type and
the latter of fermionic type. We solve completely these cyclic singular
cosmologies at the level of their zero modes showing that an acceptable shift
parameter should be purely imaginary, which in turn introduces a parity-time
(PT) property of the partner curvature indices.
