We have investigated the properties of a group of $\gamma$-ray emitting
globular clusters (GCs) which have recently been uncovered in our Galaxy. By
correlating the observed $\gamma$-ray luminosities $L_{\gamma}$ with various
cluster properties, we probe the origin of the high energy photons from these
GCs. We report $L_{\gamma}$ is positively correlated with the encounter rate
$\Gamma_{c}$ and the metalicity $\left[{\rm Fe/H}\right]$ which place an
intimate link between the gamma-ray emission and the millisecond pulsar
population. We also find a tendency that $L_{\gamma}$ increase with the energy
densities of the soft photon at the cluster location. Furthermore, the
two-dimensional regression analysis suggests that $L_{\gamma}$, soft photon
densities, and $\Gamma_{c}$/$\left[{\rm Fe/H}\right]$ possibly span fundamental
planes which potentially provide better predictions for the $\gamma$-ray
properties of GCs.
