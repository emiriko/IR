We study coordinate-invariance of some asymptotic invariants such as the ADM
mass or the Chru\'sciel-Herzlich momentum, given by an integral over a
"boundary at infinity". When changing the coordinates at infinity, some terms
in the change of integrand do not decay fast enough to have a vanishing
integral at infinity; but they may be gathered in a divergence, thus having
vanishing integral over any closed hypersurface. This fact could only be
checked after direct calculation (and was called a "curious cancellation"). We
give a conceptual explanation thereof.
