In the classical Higgsless $M^4\times S^3\times S^1$ Kaluza-Klein
gauge-theory vacuum, torsion-induced loss of the $SU(2)\times U(1)$
left-invariance generates a gauge-boson mass term, in co-existence with the
gauge-field kinetic term in the vacuum Hilbert-Einstein action. This is
compulsory in the sense that having one of these terms without the other would
mean violation of basic theorems on holonomy. The effect could be lost only at
the very high massless-EW energy scale, where the ground-state manifold
approach for the gauge-theory vacuum would be inapplicable. Created, as they
are, from and as part of pure geometry, these gauge-boson masses reproduce
precisely the spectum of the well-known experimental result. The apparently
exploitable geometric elegance and the ensuing fundamentally geometric origin
of mass may provide new theoretical and experimental perspectives around and
well above the EW scale.
