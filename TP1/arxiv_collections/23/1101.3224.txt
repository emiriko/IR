We extend our general relativistic analysis of galactic rotation curves with
galaxies NGC 2841, NGC 2903 and NGC 5033. As before, we employ the solution of
the Einstein field equations of general relativity with an expansion in Bessel
functions. As in our earlier studies, the fits to the data are found to be very
precise and the calculated baryonic masses are lower than those based upon
Newtonian gravity. Also as in our previous studies, the galactic radii at which
the optical luminosities terminate are seen to correlate with densities near
$10^{-21.75}$ kg$\cdot$m$^{-3}$. This concordance lends further support to the
correctness of the procedure as well as providing a potentially valuable piece
of information in the understanding of galactic evolution.
