We present a summary of the measurements of the CKM angle, alpha (phi2),
performed by the BaBar and Belle experiments which collect BBbar pairs at the
Y(4S) resonance produced in asymmetric e+ e- collisions. We discuss the
measurements of the branching fractions and CP asymmetries in the B --> pi pi,
rho pi and rho rho final states that lead to constraints on alpha (phi2).
