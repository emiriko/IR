In the same way as the Hilbert Program was a response to the foundational
crisis of mathematics, this article tries to formulate a research program for
the socio-economic sciences. The aim of this contribution is to stimulate
research in order to close serious knowledge gaps in mainstream economics that
the recent financial and economic crisis has revealed. By identifying weak
points of conventional approaches in economics, we identify the scientific
problems which need to be addressed. We expect that solving these questions
will bring scientists in a position to give better decision support and policy
advice. We also indicate, what kinds of insights can be contributed by
scientists from other research fields such as physics, biology, computer and
social science. In order to make a quick progress and gain a systemic
understanding of the whole interconnected socio-economic-environmental system,
using the data, information and computer systems available today and in the
near future, we suggest a multi-disciplinary collaboration as most promising
research approach.
