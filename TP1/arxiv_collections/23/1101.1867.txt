It is shown that the amplitude of elastic ed scattering beyond Born
approximation contains six generalized form factors, but only three linearly
independent combinations of them (generalized charge, quadrupole and magnetic
form factors) contribute to the reaction cross section in the second order
perturbation theory. We examine two-photon exchange and find that it includes
two types of diagrams, when two virtual photons interact with the same nucleon
and when the photons interact with different nucleons.We discuss contribution
of the two-photon exchange in reaction observables, generalized \mathcal A and
\mathcal B structure functions and tensor polarization of the deuteron.
