The huge optical brightness of GRB 080319B (the "Naked Eye Burst) makes this
event really challenging for models of the prompt GRB emission. In the
framework of the internal shock model, we investigate a scenario where the
dominant radiative process is synchrotron emission and the high optical flux is
due to the dynamical properties of the relativistic outflow: if the initial
Lorentz factor distribution in the jet is highly variable, many internal shocks
will form within the outflow at various radii. The most violent shocks will
produce the main gamma-ray component while the less violent ones will
contribute at lower energy, including the optical range.
