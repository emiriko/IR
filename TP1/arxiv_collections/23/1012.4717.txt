We present an investigation of the magnetic behavior of epitaxial MnAs films
grown on GaAs(100). We address the dependence of the magnetic moment,
ferromagnetic transition temperature ($T_c$) and magnetocrystalline anisotropy
constants on epitaxial conditions. From thorough structural and magnetic
investigations, our findings indicate a more complex relationship between
strain and magnetic properties in MnAs films than a simple stretch/compression
of the unit cell axes. While a small increase is seen in the anisotropy
constants the enhancement of the magnetic moment at saturation is significant.
X-ray magnetic circular dichroism results show a behavior of the spin- and
orbital-moment which is consistent with a structural transition at $T_c$. In
particular, we find that the ratio of the orbital to spin moment shows a marked
increase in the coexistence region of the ferromagnetic $\alpha$- and
paramagnetic $\beta$-phases, a result that is well in accord with the observed
increase of the $c/a$-ratio in the same temperature region. The \textit{ab
initio} density functional calculations reveal that the magnetic properties are
more sensitive towards change in in-plane axis as compared to a change of the
out-of-plane axis, which is explained by the analysis of band structures. The
effects of electron correlation in MnAs using \textit{ab initio} dynamical mean
field theory are also presented.
