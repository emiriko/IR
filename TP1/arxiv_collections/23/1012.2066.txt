The core-corona model describes quite successfully the centrality dependence
of multiplicity and $<p_t>$ of identified particles observed in heavy ion
reaction at beam energies between $\sqrt{s}$ = 17 GeV and 200 GeV. Also the
centrality dependence of the elliptic flow, $v_2$, for all charged and
identified particles could be explained in this model. Here we extend this
analysis and study the centrality dependence of single particle spectra of
identified particles. We concentrate here on protons, antiprotons, kaons and
pions which have all been measured by the PHENIX, STAR and BRAHMS
collaborations. We find that an analysis of the spectra in the core-corona
model suffers from differences in the data published by the different
experimental groups, notably for the pp collisions. For each experience the
data agree well with the prediction of the core-corona model but the value of
the two necessary parameters depends onthe experiments.
