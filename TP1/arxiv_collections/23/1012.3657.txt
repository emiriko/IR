The Spin Hall Effect (SHE) is a promising way for transforming charge
currents into spin currents in spintronic devices. Large values of the Spin
Hall Angle, the characteristic parameter of the yield of this transformation,
have been recently found in noble metals doped with nonmagnetic impurities. We
show that this can be explained by resonant scattering off impurity states
split by the spin-orbit interaction. We apply our calculation to the
interpretation of experiments on copper doped with 5d impurities and we
describe the conditions to obtain the largest effects.
