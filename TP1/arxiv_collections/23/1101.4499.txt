We report on wavelength-sized GaAs optomechanical disk resonators showing
ultra-strong optomechanical interaction. We observe optical transduction of a
disk mechanical breathing mode with 1.4 GHz frequency and effective mass of ~ 2
pg. The measured vacuum optomechanical coupling rate reaches 0.8 MHz, with a
related differential optomechanical coupling factor of 485 GHz/nm. The disk
Brownian motion is optically resolved with a sensitivity of 10-17 m/{\sqrt}Hz
at room temperature and pressure.
