The end conditions of piano strings can be approximated by the input
admittance at the bridge. Proper measurements of this value are therefore
required. A method of validation of admittance measurements on simple
structures is proposed in this paper. High resolution signal analysis performed
on string vibrations yields an estimate for the input admittance. This method
is implemented on a simplified device composed of a piano string coupled to a
thin steel beam.
