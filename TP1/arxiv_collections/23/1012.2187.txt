We study the cosmological inflation from the viewpoint of the moduli
stabilization. We study the scenario that the superpotential has a large value
during the inflation era enough to stabilize moduli, but it is small in the
true vacuum. This scenario is discussed by using a simple model, one type of
hybrid models.
