We investigate the effect of noise strength on the macroscopic ordering
dynamics of systems with symmetric absorbing states. Using an explicit
stochastic microscopic model, we present evidence for a phase transition in the
coarsening dynamics, from an Ising-like to a voter-like behavior, as the noise
strength is increased past a nontrivial critical value. By mapping to a thermal
diffusion process, we argue that the transition arises due to locally-absorbing
states being entered more readily in the high-noise regime, which in turn
prevents surface tension from driving the ordering process.
