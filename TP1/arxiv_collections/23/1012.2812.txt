Electrical conduction and relaxation phenomena in bismuth borate glasses in
the composition 2Bi2O3-B2O3 (Bi4B2O9) were investigated. Dielectric studies
carried out on these glasses revealed near constant loss (NCL) response in the
1 kHz to 1MHz frequency range at moderately high temperatures (300-450K)
associated with relatively low loss (D=0.006) and high dielectric constant
({\epsilon}r'=37) at 1kHz,300K. The variation in AC conductivity with
temperature at different frequencies showed a cross over from NCL response
characterized by local ion vibration within the potential well to universal
Joncher's power law dependence triggered by ion hopping between potential wells
or cages. Thermal activation energy for single potential well was found to be
0.48 \pm 0.05eV from cross over points. Ionic conduction and relaxation
processes were rationalized by modulus formalism. The promising dielectric
properties (relatively high {\epsilon}r' and low D) of the present glasses were
attributed to high density (93 % of its crystalline counterpart), high
polarizability and low mobility associated with heavy metal cations, Bi3+.
