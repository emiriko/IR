The scientific performance of the Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) after
one year of in-orbit operation is presented. We describe the main optical
parameters and discuss photometric calibration, white noise sensitivity, and
noise properties. A preliminary evaluation of the impact of the main systematic
effects is presented. For each of the performance parameters, we outline the
methods used to obtain them from the flight data and provide a comparison with
pre-launch ground assessments, which are essentially confirmed in flight.
