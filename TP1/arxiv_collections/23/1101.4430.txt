This paper presents a type theory with a form of equality reflection:
provable equalities can be used to coerce the type of a term. Coercions and
other annotations, including implicit arguments, are dropped during reduction
of terms. We develop the metatheory for an undecidable version of the system
with unannotated terms. We then devise a decidable system with annotated terms,
justified in terms of the unannotated system. Finally, we show how the approach
can be extended to account for large eliminations, using what we call
quasi-implicit products.
