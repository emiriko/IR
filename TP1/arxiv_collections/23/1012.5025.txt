HFOLD (Higgs Full One Loop Decays) is a Fortran program package for
calculating all MSSM Higgs two-body decay widths and the corresponding
branching ratios at full one-loop level. The package is done in the SUSY
Parameter Analysis convention and supports the SUSY Les Houches Accord input
and output format.
