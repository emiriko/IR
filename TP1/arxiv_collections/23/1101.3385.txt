The drag and diffusion coefficients of charm and bottom quarks propagating
through quark gluon plasma have been evaluated for conditions relevant to
nuclear collisions at Large Hadron Collider and Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider. Both the radiative and collisional processes of energy loss are
included in evaluating the {\it effective} drag and diffusion coefficients. The
Landau-Pomeronchuk-Migdal (LPM) and the dead cone effects on the radiative
energy loss of heavy quarks have been included. With the effective transport
coefficients the Fokker Plank (FP) equation has been solved for the evolution
of heavy quarks in QGP. The solution of the FP equation has been used to
evaluate the nuclear suppression factor, $R_{\mathrm AA}$ and the elliptic
flow, $v_2^{HF}$ for the non-photonic single electron spectra resulting from
the semi-leptonic decays of hadrons containing charm and bottom quarks. It is
observed that the experimental data from RHIC on $R_{\mathrm AA}$ and $v_2^{HF}
$ can be reproduced simultaneously within the pQCD framework for the same set
of inputs.
