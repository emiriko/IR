This volume contains the proceedings of the Workshop on Partiality and
Recursion in Interactive Theorem Provers (PAR 2010) which took place on July 15
in Edinburgh, UK. This workshop was held as a satellite workshop of the
International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP 2010), itself part
of the Federated Logic Conference 2010 (FLoC 2010).
  This workshop is a venue for researchers working on new approaches to cope
with partial functions and terminating general (co)recursion in theorem
provers.
