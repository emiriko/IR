We study how the Einstein relation between spontaneous fluctuations and the
response to an external perturbation holds in the absence of currents, for the
comb model and the elastic single-file, which are examples of systems with
subdiffusive transport properties. The relevance of non-equilibrium conditions
is investigated: when a stationary current (in the form of a drift or an energy
flux) is present, the Einstein relation breaks down, as is known to happen in
systems with standard diffusion. In the case of the comb model, a general
relation, which has appeared in the recent literature, between the response
function and an unperturbed suitable correlation function, allows us to explain
the observed results. This suggests that a relevant ingredient in breaking the
Einstein formula, for stationary regimes, is not the anomalous diffusion but
the presence of currents driving the system out of equilibrium.
