We derive the effective angular momentum operator to $1/m^2$ and one-loop
order in non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics (NRQED). In both dimensional
and three-momentum-cutoff regularization schemes, we obtain the
non-relativistic expansion for the spin and orbital angular momentum operators
of the electron and photon, respectively. Our result is useful in precision
calculations of the angular momentum properties for non-relativistic QED bound
states, such as atom systems.
