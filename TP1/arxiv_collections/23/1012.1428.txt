We quantize prisoners dilemma and chicken game by our generalized
quantization scheme to explore the role of quantum discord in quantum games. In
order to establish this connection we use Werner-like state as an initial state
of the game. In this quantization scheme measurement can be performed in
entangled as well as in product basis. For the measurement in entangled basis
the dilemma in both the games can be resolved by separable states with non-zero
quantum discord. Similarly for product basis measurement the payoffs are
quantum mechanical only for nonzero values of quantum discord.
