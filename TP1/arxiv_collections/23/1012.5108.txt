The modest aim of this short article is to provide some new results for a
screw dislocation in a functionally graded material within the theory of
gradient elasticity. These results, based on a displacement formulation and the
Fourier transform technique, extends earlier findings (Lazar, M., 2007. On a
screw dislocation in a functionally graded material, Mech. Res. Comm. 34,
305-311) obtained by the stress function method, to the case of the second
gradient elasticity. Rigorous and easy-to-use analytical expressions for the
displacements, the strains and the stresses are obtained which are free from
singularities at the dislocation line.
