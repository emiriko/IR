The methods developed by authors are applied to some reductions of BBGKY
hierarchy, namely, various examples of Vlasov-like systems which are important
both for fusion modeling and for particular physical problems related to
plasma/beam physics. We mostly concentrate on phenomena of localization and
pattern formation.
