We derive relations between transverse momentum dependent distribution
functions (TMDs) and the usual parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the 3D
covariant parton model, which follow from Lorentz invariance and the assumption
of a rotationally symmetric distribution of parton momenta in the nucleon rest
frame. Using the known PDFs f_1(x) and g_1(x) as input we predict the x- and
pT-dependence of all twist-2 T-even TMDs.
