When separated measurements on entangled quantum systems are performed, the
theory predicts correlations that cannot be explained by any classical
mechanism: communication is excluded because the signal should travel faster
than light; pre-established agreement is excluded because Bell inequalities are
violated. All optical demonstrations of such violations have involved discrete
degrees of freedom and are plagued by the detection-efficiency loophole. A
promising alternative is to use continuous variables combined with highly
efficient homodyne measurements. However, all the schemes proposed so far use
states or measurements that are extremely difficult to achieve, or produce very
weak violations. We present a simple method to generate large violations for
feasible states using both photon counting and homodyne detections. The present
scheme can also be used to obtain nonlocality from easy-to-prepare Gaussian
states (e.g. two-mode squeezed state).
