We report on some ideas concerning the nature of the X(3872) resonance and
the need for approximately equal charged and neutral components of $D \bar{D}^*
+cc$. Then we discuss how some hidden charm states are obtained from the
interaction between vector mesons with charm and can be associated to some of
the charmonium-like X,Y,Z states. Finally we discuss how the nature of these
states could be investigated through different types of radiative decay.
