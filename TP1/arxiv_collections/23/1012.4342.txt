We solve the eigenvalue problem of the $D_N$ type of Calogero model by
mapping it to a set of decoupled quantum harmonic oscillators through a
similarity transformation. In particular, we construct the eigenfunctions of
this Calogero model from those of bosonic harmonic oscillators having either
all even parity or all odd parity. It turns out that the eigenfunctions of this
model are orthogonal with respect to a nontrivial inner product, which can be
derived from the quasi-Hermiticity property of the corresponding conserved
quantities.
