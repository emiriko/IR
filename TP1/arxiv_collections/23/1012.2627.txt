We investigate the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for u and d quarks
in a proton in transverse and longitudinal position space using a recent
phenomenological parametrization. We take nonzero skewness \zeta and consider
the region x> \zeta. Impact parameter space representation of the GPD E is
found to depend sharply on the parameters used within the model, in particular
in the low x region. In longitudinal position space a diffraction pattern is
observed, as seen before in several other model
