Quantum computation and communication protocols require quantum resources
which are in the continuous variable regime squeezed and/or quadrature
entangled optical modes. To perform more and more complex and robust protocols,
one needs sources that can produce in a controlled way highly multimode quantum
states of light. One possibility is to mix different single mode quantum
resources. Another is to directly use a multimode device, either in the spatial
or in the frequency domain. We present here the first experimental
demonstration of a device capable of producing simultanuously several squeezed
transverse modes of the same frequency and which is potentially scalable. We
show that this device, which is an Optical Parametric Oscillator using a
self-imaging cavity, produces a multimode quantum resource made of three
squeezed transverse modes.
