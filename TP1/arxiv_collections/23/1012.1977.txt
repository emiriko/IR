The effective mass one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation for the generalized
Morse potential is solved by using Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Energy eigenvalues
and corresponding eigenfunctions are computed analytically. The results are
also reduced to the case of constant mass. Energy eigenvalues are computed
numerically for some diatomic molecules. The results are in agreement with the
ones obtained before.
