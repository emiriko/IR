For each pair of positive integers r,s, there is a so-called Kac
representation (r,s) associated with a Yang-Baxter integrable boundary
condition in the lattice approach to the logarithmic minimal model LM(1,p). We
propose a classification of these representations as finitely-generated
submodules of Feigin-Fuchs modules, and present a conjecture for their fusion
algebra which we call the Kac fusion algebra. The proposals are tested using a
combination of the lattice approach and applications of the
Nahm-Gaberdiel-Kausch algorithm. We also discuss how the fusion algebra may be
extended by inclusion of the modules contragredient to the Kac representations,
and determine polynomial fusion rings isomorphic to the conjectured Kac fusion
algebra and its contragredient extension.
