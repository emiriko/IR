We present results from Chandra observations of NGC 5813, the dominant
central galaxy in a nearby galaxy group. We focus on three main results. 1) The
diffuse gas shows clear signatures from three distinct outbursts of the central
AGN, with three pairs of roughly collinear cavities. The inner two cavity pairs
are associated with unambiguous elliptical shock fronts, with Mach numbers
M~1.7 and M~1.5 for the inner and outer shocks, respectively. 2) The mean power
of the two most recent outbursts differs by a factor of six, indicating that
the mean jet power varies over long (~10^7 yr) time scales. 3) The heating from
the shocks alone is sufficient to balance radiative cooling of the gas within
at least the central 10 kpc, allowing feedback to operate isotropically at
small radii.
