Structural investigations by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
on KFexSe2 with 1.5 \leq x \leq 1.8 have revealed a rich variety of
microstructure phenomena, the KFe1.5Se2 crystal often shows a superstructure
modulation along the [310] zone-axis direction, this superstructure can be well
interpreted by the Fe-vacancy order within the a-b plane. Increase of
Fe-concentration in the KFexSe2 materials could not only result in the
appearance of superconductivity but also yield clear alternations of
microstructure. Structural inhomogeneity, the complex superstructures and
defect structures in the superconducting KFe1.8Se2 sample have been
investigated based on the high-resolution TEM.
