Graphene oxide (GO) is one of chemically modified graphenes and has been
extensively studied worldwide. A monolayer sheet of GO which is chemically
produced in solution can be deposited on various substrates. We have proved
that use of graphite powder with a large grain size enables preparation of a
single layer GO film that is larger than 100 micrometers easily and
reproducibly. If it is possible to reduce the GO film completely, one can
obtain graphene without mechanical exfoliation. However, the reduction methods
employed so far have been insufficient to remove oxygen or to restore the long
range order in graphene lattice. In the present work we annealed the GO sheet
which was placed on Pt(111) in ultrahigh vacuum. The STM observation of the
annealed specimen reveals that a honeycomb lattice appears together with moire
structures of long range ordering. The XPS result indicated complete removal of
oxygen from the GO sheet. These results would open a new way to synthesize a
high quality graphene film, which replaces the conventional CVD method.
