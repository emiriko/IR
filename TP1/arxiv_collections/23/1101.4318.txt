We propose in this paper a framework dedicated to the construction of what we
call time elastic inner products that allows embedding sets of non-uniformly
sampled multivariate time series of varying lengths into vector space
structures. This framework is based on a recursive definition that covers the
case of multiple embedded time elastic dimensions. We prove that such inner
products exist in our framework and show how a simple instance of this inner
product class operates on some toy applications, while generalizing the
Euclidean inner product.
