We report the chiral quark model approach for the study of baryon resonances
in meson photoproduction and meson-nucleon scattering processes. Focussing on
the $\pi N$ and $K N$ scatterings, we show that the cross sections near
threshold can be well accounted for by the chiral quark model with only few
parameters. The $S$-wave dominance in both $\pi^- p\to \eta n$ and $K^- p\to
\Sigma^0\pi^0$ can be well understood in the quark model framework. In
particular, the quark model provides a constraint on the relative signs for
resonance coupling form factors, which seems to be consistent with results from
isobaric models.
