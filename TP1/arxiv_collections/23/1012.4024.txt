If the positron fraction and combined electron-positron flux excesses
recently observed by PAMELA, Fermi and HESS have a dark matter origin, final
state radiation (FSR) photons from dark matter annihilation into lepton-rich
final states may be detected with observations of satellite dwarf galaxies of
the Milky Way by ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (ACTs). We find
that current and near-future ACTs have excellent potential for such detection,
although a discovery cannot be guaranteed due to large uncertainties in the
distribution of dark matter within the dwarfs. We find that models predicting
dark matter annihilation into two-lepton final states and those favoring
four-lepton final states (as in, for example, "axion portal" models) can be
reliably distinguished using the FSR photon spectrum once measured, and the
dark matter particle mass can also be accurately determined.
