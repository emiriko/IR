We study on Weyl modules of cyclotomic $q$-Schur algebras. In particular, we
give the character formula of the Weyl modules by using the Kostka numbers and
some numbers which are computed by a generalization of Littlewood-Richardson
rule. We also study corresponding symmetric functions. Finally, we give some
simple applications to modular representations of cyclotomic $q$-Schur
algebras.
