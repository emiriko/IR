Spin-orbit coupling is an important ingredient in many recently discovered
phenomena such as the spin-Hall effect and topological insulators. Of
particular interest is topological superconductivity, with its potential
application in topological quantum computation. The absence of disorder in
ultra-cold atomic systems makes them ideal for quantum computation
applications, however, the spin-orbit (SO) coupling schemes proposed thus far
are experimentally impractical owing to large spontaneous emission rates in the
alkali fermions. In this paper, we develop a scheme to generate Rashba SO
coupling with a low spontaneous emission extension to a recent experiment. We
show that this scheme generates a Fermi surface spin texture for $^{40}\rm{K}$
atoms, which is observable in time-of-flight measurements. The chiral spin
texture, together with conventional $s$-wave interactions leads to topological
superconductivity and non-Abelian Majorana quasiparticles.
