We present the chromospheric activity (CA) levels, metallicities and full
space motions for 41 F, G, K and M dwarf stars in 36 wide binary systems.
Thirty-one of the binaries, contain a white dwarf component. In such binaries
the total age can be estimated by adding the cooling age of the white dwarf to
an estimate of the progenitor's main sequence lifetime. To better understand
how CA correlates to stellar age, 14 cluster member stars were also observed.
Our observations demonstrate for the first time that in general CA decays with
age from 50 Myr to at least 8 Gyr for stars with 1.0 < V-I < 2.4. However,
little change occurs in CA level for stars with V-I < 1.0 between 1 Gyr and 5
Gyr, consistent with the results of Pace et al. (2009). Our sample also
exhibits a negative correlation between stellar age and metallicity, a positive
correlation between stellar age and W space velocity component and the W
velocity dispersion increases with age. Finally, the population membership of
these wide binaries is examined based upon their U, V, W kinematics,
metallicity and CA. We conclude that wide binaries are similar to field and
cluster stars in these respects. More importantly, they span a much more
continuous range in age and metallicity than is afforded by nearby clusters.
