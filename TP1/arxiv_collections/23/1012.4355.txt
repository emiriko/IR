A measurement is presented of the inclusive neutral current e\pm p scattering
cross section using data collected by the H1 experiment at HERA during the
years 2003 to 2007 with proton beam energies Ep of 920, 575, and 460 GeV. The
kinematic range of the measurement covers low absolute four-momentum transfers
squared, 1.5 GeV2 < Q2 < 120 GeV2, small values of Bjorken x, 2.9 \cdot 10-5 <
x < 0.01, and extends to high inelasticity up to y = 0.85. The structure
function FL is measured by combining the new results with previously published
H1 data at Ep = 920 GeV and Ep = 820 GeV. The new measurements are used to test
several phenomenological and QCD models applicable in this low Q2 and low x
kinematic domain.
