The multiple scattering of coherent light is a problem of both fundamental
and applied importance. In optics, phase conjugation allows spatial focussing
and imaging through a multiply scattering medium; however, temporal control is
nonetheless elusive, and multiple scattering remains a challenge for
femtosecond science. Here, we report on the spatially and temporally resolved
measurement of a speckle field produced by the propagation of an ultrafast
optical pulse through a thick strongly scattering medium. Using spectral pulse
shaping, we demonstrate the spatially localized temporal recompression of the
output speckle to the Fourier-limit duration, offering an optical analogue to
time-reversal experiments in the acoustic regime. This approach shows that a
multiply scattering medium can be put to profit for light manipulation at the
femtosecond scale, and has a diverse range of potential applications that
includes quantum control, biological imaging and photonics.
