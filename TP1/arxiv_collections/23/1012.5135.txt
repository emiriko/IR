We analyze the data of purposeful rupture experiments with LOx and LH2 tanks,
the Hydrogen-Oxygen Vertical Impact (HOVI) tests that were performed to clarify
the ignition mechanisms, the explosive power of cryogenic H2/Ox mixtures under
different conditions, and to elucidate the puzzling source of the initial
formation of flames near the intertank section during the Challenger disaster.
We carry out a physics-based analysis of general explosions scenarios for
cryogenic gaseous H2/Ox mixtures and determine their realizability conditions,
using the well-established simplified models from the detonation and
deflagration theory. We study the features of aerosol H2/Ox mixture combustion
and show, in particular, that aerosols intensify the deflagration flames and
can induce detonation for any ignition mechanism. We propose a
cavitation-induced mechanism of self-ignition of cryogenic H2/Ox mixtures that
may be realized when gaseous H2 and Ox flows are mixed with a liquid Ox
turbulent stream, as occurred in all HOVI tests. We present an overview of the
HOVI tests to make conclusion on the risk of strong explosions in possible
liquid rocket incidents and provide a semi-quantitative interpretation of the
HOVI data based on aerosol combustion. We uncover the most dangerous situations
and discuss the foreseeable risks which can arise in space missions and lead to
tragic outcomes. Our analysis relates to only unconfined mixtures that are
likely to arise as a result of liquid propellant space vehicle incidents.
