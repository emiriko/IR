Neutrino-nucleon scattering, which produces the parity violating term,
xF3(x,Q2) the non-singlet hadron structure function in their weak interaction
has significant contribution towards the understanding of valence quark
distribution for low-Q2 and small-x region inside hadrons. Here x is the
fractional momentum of partons and Q2 is the four momentum transfer in a deep
inelastic scattering process. In this paper, the xF3(x,Q2) structure function
has been obtained by solving the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi
evolution equation in leading order and next-to-leading order at small-x limit
by using the method to get unique solution. The results are compared with
recent experimental data and parametrizations. Also a qualitative discussion of
nuclear effect in xF3(x,Q2) is done in this regards.
