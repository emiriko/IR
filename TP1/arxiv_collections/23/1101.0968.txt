Refinement types are a well-studied manner of performing in-depth analysis on
functional programs. The dependency pair method is a very powerful method used
to prove termination of rewrite systems; however its extension to higher order
rewrite systems is still the object of active research. We observe that a
variant of refinement types allow us to express a form of higher-order
dependency pair criterion that only uses information at the type level, and we
prove the correctness of this criterion.
