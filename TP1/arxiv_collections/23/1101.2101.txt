We investigate the dynamics of a quantum particle in disordered tight-binding
models in one and two dimensions which are exceptions to the common wisdom on
Anderson localization, in the sense that the localization length diverges at
some special energies. We provide a consistent picture for two well-known
one-dimensional examples: the chain with off-diagonal disorder and the
random-dimer model. In both cases the quantum motion exhibits a peculiar kind
of anomalous diffusion which can be referred to as bi-fractality. The
disorder-averaged density profile of the particle becomes critical in the
long-time regime. The $q$-th moment of the position of the particle diverges
with time whenever $q$ exceeds some $q_0$. We obtain $q_0=2$ for off-diagonal
disorder on the chain (and conjecturally on two-dimensional bipartite lattices
as well). For the random-dimer model, our result $q_0=1/2$ corroborates known
rigorous results.
