We study dynamic behavior of Potts model with invisible states near the
first-order phase transition temperature. We focus on melting process starting
from the perfect ordered state. This model is regarded as a standard model to
analyze nature of phase transition. We can control the energy barrier between
the ordered state and paramagnetic state without changing the symmetry which
breaks at the transition point. We calculate time-dependency of the order
parameter, density of invisible state, and internal energy. They show two-step
relaxation behavior. We also consider the relation between the characteristic
melting time and characteristic scale of the energy barrier by changing the
number of invisible states. We find that characteristic melting time increases
as the energy barrier enlarges in this model. Thus, this model is regarded as a
fundamental model to analyze dynamic behavior near the first-order phase
transition point.
