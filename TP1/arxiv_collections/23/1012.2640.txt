B cells receptor (BCR) signaling in response to membrane-bound antigen
increases with antigen affinity, a process known as affinity discrimination. We
use computational modeling to show that B cell affinity discrimination requires
that kinetic proofreading predominate over serial engagement. We find that if
BCR molecules become signaling-capable immediately upon binding antigen, the
loss in serial engagement as affinity increases results in weaker signaling
with increasing affinity. A threshold time for antigen to stay bound to BCR for
several seconds before the latter becomes signaling-capable, similar to kinetic
proofreading, is needed to overcome the loss in serial engagement due to
increasing antigen affinity, and replicate the monotonic increase in B cell
signaling with affinity observed in B cell activation experiments. This finding
matches well with the experimentally observed time (~ 20 seconds) required for
the BCR signaling domains to undergo antigen and lipid raft-mediated
conformational changes that lead to Src-family kinase recruitment. We
hypothesize that the physical basis of the threshold time of antigen binding
may lie in the formation timescale of BCR dimers. The latter decreases with
increasing affinity, resulting in shorter threshold antigen binding times as
affinity increases. Such an affinity-dependent kinetic proofreading requirement
results in affinity discrimination very similar to that observed in biological
experiments. B cell affinity discrimination is critical to the process of
affinity maturation and the production of high affinity antibodies, and thus
our results here have important implications in applications such as vaccine
design.
