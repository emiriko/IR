Holography provides a novel method to study the physics of Quark Gluon
Plasmas, complementary to the ordinary field theory and lattice approaches. In
this context, we analyze the informations that can be obtained for strongly
coupled Plasmas containing dynamical flavors, also in the presence of a finite
baryon chemical potential. In particular, we discuss the jet quenching and the
hydrodynamic transport coefficients.
