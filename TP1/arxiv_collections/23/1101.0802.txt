The cross section and double-helicity asymmetry for production of
non-identified positive and negative charged hadrons at midrapidity in p+p
collisions at sqrt(s) = 62.4 GeV have been measured by the PHENIX experiment at
the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a transverse momentum range of
0.5-4.5 GeV/c. The cross section measurements are compared to next-to-leading
order and next-to-leading log perturbative QCD calculations, providing
information on the applicability of these calculation techniques in the
measured kinematic range. The double-helicity asymmetry measurement at this
moderate energy provides sensitivity to Delta G, the gluon spin contribution to
the spin of the proton, up to modestly larger values of the gluon momentum
fraction than previous RHIC measurements at 200 GeV.
