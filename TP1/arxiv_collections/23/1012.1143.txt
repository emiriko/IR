We have obtained near-IR photometry for the 11 Praesepe white dwarfs, to
search for an excess indicative of a dusty debris disk. All the white dwarfs
are in the DAZ temperature regime, however we find no indications of a disk
around any white dwarf. We have, however determined that the radial velocity
variable white dwarf WD0837+185 could have an unresolved T8 dwarf companion
that would not be seen as a near-IR excess.
