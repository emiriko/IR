We derive the explicit action of the U-duality group of the STU model on both
BPS and non-BPS extremal multi-center solutions. As the class of known non-BPS
extremal solutions is not closed under U-duality, we generate in this way new
solutions. These should represent the most general class of extremal non-BPS
multi-center under-rotating solutions of the STU model.
