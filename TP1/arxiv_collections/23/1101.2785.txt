This paper proposes a form of MPC in which the control variables are moved
asynchronously. This contrasts with most MIMO control schemes, which assume
that all variables are updated simultaneously. MPC outperforms other control
strategies through its ability to deal with constraints. This requires on-line
optimization, hence computational complexity can become an issue when applying
MPC to complex systems with fast response times. The multiplexed MPC scheme
described in this paper solves the MPC problem for each subsystem sequentially,
and updates subsystem controls as soon as the solution is available, thus
distributing the control moves over a complete update cycle. The resulting
computational speed-up allows faster response to disturbances, which may result
in improved performance, despite finding sub-optimal solutions to the original
problem.
