Using low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy applied to the
Cs-induced two-dimensional electron system (2DES) on p-type InSb(110), we probe
electron-electron interaction effects in the quantum Hall regime. The 2DES is
decoupled from p-doped bulk states and exhibits spreading resistance within the
insulating quantum Hall phases. In quantitative agreement with calculations we
find an exchange enhancement of the spin splitting. Moreover, we observe that
both the spatially averaged as well as the local density of states feature a
characteristic Coulomb gap at the Fermi level. These results show that
electron-electron interaction effects can be probed down to a resolution below
all relevant length scales.
