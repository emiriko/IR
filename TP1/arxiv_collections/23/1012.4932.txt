The pressure-induced phase transition of bismuth telluride, Bi2Te3, has been
studied by synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements at room temperature using
a diamond-anvil cell (DAC) with loading pressures up to 29.8 GPa. We found a
high-pressure body-centered cubic (bcc) phase in Bi2Te3 at 25.2 GPa, which is
denoted as phase IV, and this phase apperars above 14.5 GPa. Upon releasing the
pressure from 29.8 GPa, the diffraction pattern changes with pressure
hysteresis. The original rhombohedral phase is recovered at 2.43 GPa. The bcc
structure can explain the phase IV peaks. We assumed that the structural model
of phase IV is analogous to a substitutional binary alloy; the Bi and Te atoms
are distributed in the bcc-lattice sites with space group Im-3m. The results of
Rietveld analysis based on this model agree well with both the experimental
data and calculated results. Therefore, the structure of phase IV in Bi2Te3 can
be explained by a solid solution with a bcc lattice in the Bi-Te (60 atomic%
tellurium) binary system.
