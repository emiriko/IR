An investigation is in progress to evaluate extensively and quantitatively
the possible benefits and drawbacks of new programming paradigms in a Monte
Carlo simulation environment, namely in the domain of physics modeling. The
prototype design and extensive benchmarks, including a variety of rigorous
quantitative metrics, are presented. The results of this research project allow
the evaluation of new software techniques for their possible adoption in Monte
Carlo simulation on objective, quantitative ground.
