Observation of some low-energy processes in the flavor physics regime may
require the existence of supersymmetry with two relatively large
R-parity-violating couplings of the LQD-type, together with reasonably light
superparticles. At the LHC, such interactions would be expected to give rise to
clear signals with convenient leptonic triggers, including some multileptons of
the same sign. We undertake a detailed investigation of these signals taking
care to correlate with low-energy requirements and taking proper account of the
Standard Model backgrounds as well as the R-parity-conserving sector of the
supersymmetric model. We find clear indications that R-parity violation as
envisaged in this scenario can be detected at the LHC - even, perhaps, in the
early runs.
