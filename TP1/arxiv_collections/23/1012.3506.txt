We prove that q-ary sparse codes with small bias are self-correctable and
locally testable. We generalize a result of Kaufman and Sudan that proves the
local testability and correctability of binary sparse codes with small bias. We
use properties of q-ary Krawtchouk polynomials and the McWilliams identity
-that relates the weight distribution of a code to the weight distribution of
its dual- to derive bounds on the error probability of the randomized tester
and self-corrector we are analyzing.
