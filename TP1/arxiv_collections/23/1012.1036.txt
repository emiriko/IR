The ATLAS experiment has successfully recorded over 300 nb^-1 of pp
collisions at 7 TeV provided by the Large Hadron Collider, with an efficiency
of 94%. We describe the data acquisition, trigger, reconstruction, calibration,
monitoring, and luminosity measurement infrastructure that have made this
possible.
