University courses in conceptual physics and astronomy typically serve as the
terminal science experience for non-science majors. Significant work has gone
into developing research-verified pedagogical methods for the algebra- and
calculus-based physics courses typically populated by natural and physical
science majors; however, there is significantly less volume in the literature
concerning the non-science population. This is quickly changing, and large,
repeatable gains on concept tests are being reported. However, we may be losing
sight of what is arguably the most important goal of such a course: development
of scientific reasoning. Are we teaching this population of students to think
like scientists?
