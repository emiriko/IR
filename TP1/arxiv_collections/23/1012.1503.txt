Spectropolarimetry results for the starburst galaxy M82 are presented. The
optical emission lines of the filaments in the energetic outflow ("superwind")
from the nuclear starburst region of M82 are substantially polarized. The
H-alpha polarization degrees and angles measured by our study are consistent
with previous narrowband imaging polarimetry data. The polarized emission lines
are redshifted with respect to the emission lines in the total light and
systemic motion of the galaxy. The emission line intensity ratios [NII]/H-alpha
and [SII]/H-alpha in the polarized light are similar to those of the nuclear
star-forming region. In addition, the electron density N_e derived from
the[SII]6731/6717 line ratio of the polarized light is 600 - 1000 cm^-3 at a
distance of more than 1 kpc from the nucleus, whereas the N_e derived from the
total light are less than 300 cm^-3. These facts strongly suggest that the
emission from the nuclear starburst of M82 is scattered by dust grains
entrained and transported outward by the superwind. A simple hollow biconical
outflow model shows that the velocity of the outflowing dust grains, v_d,
ranges from 100 to 200 km/s near the nucleus, decreases monotonically with the
distance from the nucleus, and reaches about 10 km/s at around 1 kpc. The
motion of the dust is substantially slower than that of both ionized gas (~600
km/s) and molecular gas (~200 km/s) at the same distance from the nucleus of
M82. This indicates that dust grains in the superwind are kinematically
decoupled from both gas components at large radii. Since the dust velocity v_d
is much less than the escape velocity of M82 (~170 km/s at 1.5 kpc from the
nucleus), most of the dust entrained by the superwind cannot escape to
intergalactic space, and may fall back into the galaxy disk without any
additional acceleration mechanisms (such as radiation pressure).
