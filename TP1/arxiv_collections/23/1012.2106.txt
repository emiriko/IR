We present results on the nucleon form factors and moments of generalized
parton distributions obtained within the twisted mass formulation of lattice
QCD. We include a discussion of lattice artifacts by examining results at
different volumes and lattice spacings. We compare our results with those
obtained using different discretization schemes and to experiment.
