We develop the theory of interaction of classical plasma with Kaluza-Klein
(KK) gravitons in the ADD model of TeV-scale gravity. Plasma is described
within the kinetic approach as the system of charged particles and Maxwell
field both confined on the brane. Interaction with multidimensional gravity
living in the bulk with $n$ compact extra dimensions is introduced within the
linearized theory. The KK gravitons emission rates are computed taking into
account plasma collective effects through the two-point correlation functions
of the fluctuations of the plasma energy-momentum tensor. Apart from known
mechanisms (such as bremsstrahlung and gravi-Primakoff effect) we find
essentially collective channels such as the coalescence of plasma waves into
gravitons which may be manifest in turbulent plasmas. Our results indicate that
commonly used rates of the KK gravitons production in stars and supernovae may
be underestimated.
