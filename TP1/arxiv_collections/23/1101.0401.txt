In this paper we treat the intersection of fixed point subgroups by the
involutive automorphisms of exceptional Lie group $G= F_4, E_6, E_7$. We shall
find involutive automorphisms of $G$ such that the connected component of the
intersection of those fixed point subgroups coincides with the maximal torus of
$G$.
