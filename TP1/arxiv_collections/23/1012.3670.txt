We show that solitons undergo a strong blue shift in fibers with a dispersion
landscape that varies along the direction of propagation. The experiments are
based on a small-core photonic crystal fiber, tapered to have a core diameter
that varies continuously along its length, resulting in a zero-dispersion
wavelength that moves from 731 nm to 640 nm over the transition. The central
wavelength of a soliton translates over 400 nm towards shorter wavelength. This
accompanied by strong emission of radiation into the UV and IR spectral region.
The experimental results are confirmed by numerical simulation.
