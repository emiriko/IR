This paper follows "The physics and identity of Dark Energy", which is the
acceleration energy of old photons. The present paper considers everything else
in the decay of our universe; it is an ensemble called "old protons, etc."; the
ensemble will be listed. The accelerated expansion of our universe brings the
decay debris into the inter-universal medium (IUM) of the multiverse, where it
is conserved during long times. Debris clouds eventually accrete from the IUM
and grow into proto-universes. The protons, etc. are involved as much as are
the photons; they are the receivers of the kinetic energy of photon
acceleration. Dark matter is therefore the matter of "old protons,etc."
mentioned before.
