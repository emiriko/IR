I calculate the fidelity of a [7,1,3] CSS quantum error correction code
logical zero state constructed in a non-equiprobable Pauli operator error
environment for two methods of encoding. The first method is to apply fault
tolerant error correction to an arbitrary state of 7 qubits utilizing Shor
states for syndrome measurement. The Shor states are themselves constructed in
the non-equiprobable Pauli operator error environment and their fidelity
depends on the number of verifications done to ensure multiple errors will not
propagate into the encoded quantum information. Surprisingly, performing these
verifications may lower the fidelity of the constructed Shor states. The second
encoding method is to simply implement the $[7,1,3]$ encoding gate sequence
also in the non-equiprobable Pauli operator error environment. Perfect error
correction is applied after both methods to determine the correctability of the
implemented errors. I find that which method attains a higher fidelity depends
on the which of Pauli operator errors is dominant. Nevertheless, perfect error
correction supresses errors to at least first order for both methods.
