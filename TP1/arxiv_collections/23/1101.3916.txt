Having a priori knowledge of the force acting on a noisy system it is
possible to solve the issue relative to the interpretation of multiplicative
noise terms (aka Ito-Stratonovich dilemma). We experimentally show that for a
Brownian particle the anti-Ito convention is correct. This permits us to
reconcile force measurements based on the equilibrium distribution and on the
drift velocity of a Brownian particle in a diffusion gradient.
