The search for solar axions produced by Compton ($\gamma+e^-\rightarrow
e^-+A$) and bremsstrahlung-like ($e^-+Z \rightarrow Z+e^-+A$) processes has
been performed. The axion flux in the both cases depends on the axion-electron
coupling constant. The resonant excitation of low-lying nuclear level of
$^{169}\rm{Tm}$ was looked for: $A+^{169}$Tm $\rightarrow ^{169}$Tm$^*$
$\rightarrow ^{169}$Tm $+ \gamma$ (8.41 keV). The Si(Li) detector and
$^{169}$Tm target installed inside the low-background setup were used to detect
8.41 keV $\gamma$-rays. As a result, a new model independent restriction on the
axion-electron and the axion-nucleon couplings was obtained:
$g_{Ae}\times|g^0_{AN}+ g^3_{AN}|\leq 2.1\times10^{-14}$. In model of hadronic
axion this restriction corresponds to the upper limit on the axion-electron
coupling and on the axion mass $g_{Ae}\times m_A\leq3.1\times10^{-7}$ eV (90%
c.l.). The limits on axion mass are $m_A\leq$ 105 eV and $m_A\leq$ 1.3 keV for
DFSZ- and KSVZ-axion models, correspondingly (90% c.l.).
