The renormalization of general gauge theories on flat and curved space-time
backgrounds is considered within the Sp(2)-covariant quantization method. We
assume the existence of a gauge-invariant and diffeomorphism invariant
regularization. Using the Sp(2)-covariant formalism one can show that the
theory possesses gauge invariant and diffeomorphism invariant renormalizability
to all orders in the loop expansion and the extended BRST symmetry after
renormalization is preserved. The advantage of the Sp(2)-method compared to the
standard Batalin-Vilkovisky approach is that, in reducible theories, the
structure of ghosts and ghosts for ghosts and auxiliary fields is described in
terms of irreducible representations of the Sp(2) group. This makes the
presentation of solutions to the master equations in more simple and systematic
way because they are Sp(2)- scalars.
