We report the observation of prominent Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in a
Topological Insulator, Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se, with large bulk resistivity (6
$\Omega$cm at 4 K). By fitting the SdH oscillations, we infer a large
metallicity parameter $k_F\ell$ = 41, with a surface mobility ($\mu_s\sim$
2,800 cm$^2$/Vs) much larger than the bulk mobility ($\mu_b\sim$ 50 cm$^2$/Vs).
The plot of the index fields $B_{\nu}$ vs. filling factor $\nu$ shows a
$\frac12$-shift, consistent with massless, Dirac states. Evidence for
fractional-filling states is seen in an 11-T field.
