Analytical formula for multiplicity distribution is derived in the QO
approach, where chaotic and coherent fields are contained. Observed charged
multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ AGeV and in pp
collisions at $\sqrt{s}=900$ GeV are analyzed by the formula. Chaoticity
parameters in the inclusive events estimated from the analysis of multiplicity
distributions are compared with those estimated from the analysis of observed
two-particle inclusive identical particle correlations.
