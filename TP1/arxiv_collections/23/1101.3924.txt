Cn2 profile monitoring usually makes use of wavefront slope correlations or
of scintillation pattern correlations. Wavefront slope correlations provide
sensitivity to layers close to the receiving plane. In addition, scintillation
correlations allow a better sensitivity to high turbulence layers. Wavefront
slope and scintillation correlations are therefore complementary. Slopes and
scintillation being recorded simultaneously with a Shack-Hartmann wavefront
sensor (SHWFS), we propose here to exploit their correlation to retrieve the
Cn2 profile. The measurement method named COupled SLodar scIDAR (CO-SLIDAR)
uses correlations of SHWFS data from two separated stars. A maximum-likelihood
method is developed to estimate precisely the positions and intensities
corresponding to each SHWFS spot, which are used as inputs for CO-SLIDAR. First
results are presented using SHWFS real data from a binary star.
