We review recent research on Zitterbewegung (ZB, trembling motion) of
electrons in semiconductors. A brief history of the subject is presented, the
trembling motion in semirelativistic and spin systems is considered and its
main features are emphasized. Zitterbewegung of charge carriers in monolayer
and bilayer graphene as well as in carbon nanotubes is elaborated in some
detail. We describe effects of an external magnetic field on ZB using monolayer
graphene as an example. Nature of electron ZB in crystalline solids is
explained. We also review various simulations of the trembling motion in a
vacuum and in semiconductors, and mention ZB-like wave phenomena in sonic and
photonic periodic structures. An attempt is made to quote all the relevant
literature on the subject.
