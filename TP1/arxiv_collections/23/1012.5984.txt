In this work we show theoretically that it is possible to design a large band
gap in the infrared range using a one-dimensional Photonic Crystal
heterostructure made of porous silicon. Stacking together multiple photonic
crystal substructures of the same contrast index, but of different lattice
periods, it is possible to broad the narrow forbidden band gap that can be
reached by the low contrast index of the porous silicon multilayers. The main
idea in this work is that we can construct a Giant Photonic Band Gap -as large
as desired- by combining a tandem of photonic crystals substructures by using a
simple analytical rule to determine the period of each substructure.
