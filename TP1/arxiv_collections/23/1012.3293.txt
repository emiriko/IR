After considering a solitonic string moving in the Poincare $AdS$ and
two-dimensional sphere, we calculate the two-point correlation function of
magnon and spike in the semi-classical limit without any explicit solution. We
also calculate the three-point correlation functions between two heavy and one
light operators. We find that the coupling between two heavy and one light
operators in the string side is the exactly same as one obtained from the gauge
theory by using the RG analysis.
