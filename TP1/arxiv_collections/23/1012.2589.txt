The work is divided into three sections: the first one describes the
historical evolution of the main arguments presented about the plurality of
inhabited worlds, from the presocratics to the birth of modern science. The
second section analyzes the race to define the search for life beyond Earth as
a scientific activity under a specific name. Finally, the third part presents a
brief description of the social history of science that allowed the early
development of astrobiology in Iberoamerica.
