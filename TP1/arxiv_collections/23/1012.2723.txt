Generation of terahertz harmonics by frequency multiplication with a
semiconductor superlattice due to an excitation of relaxation oscillations by
incident waves is investigated theoretically. It is shown that the relaxation
oscillations excitation becomes feasible if the superlattice dc resistance is
low enough in comparison with a characteristic radiation impedance of the
external waveguide system. The power of the generated harmonics as a function
of the incident wave power demonstrates a threshold-like behavior at a specific
input power level dependent on the superlattice peak current. We demonstrate
that for typical superlattice parameters the roll-of frequency of the generated
harmonics is mostly specified by the plasma frequency of electrons in a
superlattice miniband. We argue that an increase of the superlattice miniband
widths could essentially enhance both the efficiency and the spectral range of
the generated terahertz harmonics.
