Low ionisation nuclear emission-line region (LINER) nuclei have been claimed
to be different than other active galactic nuclei (AGN) due to the presence of
complex absorbing structures along the line-of-sight and/or an inefficient mode
of accretion onto the supermassive black hole. However, this issue is still
open. We have investigated the broad band X-ray spectrum of NGC 4102, one of
the most luminous LINERs in the Swift/BAT survey. We studied a 80 ksec Suzaku
spectrum of NGC 4102, together with archival Chandra and Swift/BAT
observations. We also studied the optical (3.5m/TWIN at Calar Alto observatory)
and near-infrared (WHT/LIRIS at Observatorio Roque los Muchachos) spectra that
were taken contemporaneous to the Suzaku data. There is strong evidence that
NGC 4102 is a Compton-thick AGN, as suggested by the Swift/BAT detected
intrinsic continuum and the presence of a strong narrow, neutral FeKa emission
line. We have also detected ionised FeXXV emission lines in the Suzaku spectrum
of the source. NGC 4102 shows a variable soft excess found at a significantly
higher flux state by the time of Suzaku observations when compared to Chandra
observations. Finally, a complex structure of absorbers is seen with at least
two absorbers apart from the Compton-thick one, derived from the X-ray spectral
analysis and the optical extinction.
