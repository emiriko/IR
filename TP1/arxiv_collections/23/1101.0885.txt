Software correlation, where a correlation algorithm written in a high-level
language such as C++ is run on commodity computer hardware, has become
increasingly attractive for small to medium sized and/or bandwidth constrained
radio interferometers. In particular, many long baseline arrays (which
typically have fewer than 20 elements and are restricted in observing bandwidth
by costly recording hardware and media) have utilized software correlators for
rapid, cost-effective correlator upgrades to allow compatibility with new,
wider bandwidth recording systems and improve correlator flexibility. The DiFX
correlator, made publicly available in 2007, has been a popular choice in such
upgrades and is now used for production correlation by a number of
observatories and research groups worldwide. Here we describe the evolution in
the capabilities of the DiFX correlator over the past three years, including a
number of new capabilities, substantial performance improvements, and a large
amount of supporting infrastructure to ease use of the code. New capabilities
include the ability to correlate a large number of phase centers in a single
correlation pass, the extraction of phase calibration tones, correlation of
disparate but overlapping sub-bands, the production of rapidly sampled
filterbank and kurtosis data at minimal cost, and many more. The latest version
of the code is at least 15% faster than the original, and in certain situations
many times this value. Finally, we also present detailed test results
validating the correctness of the new code.
