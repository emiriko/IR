Bearing in mind the application to the outer crust of the neutron stars
(NSs), we investigate the magnetic field decay by means of the fully
relativistic Particle-In-Cell simulations. Numerical computations are carried
out in 2-dimensions, in which the initial magnetic fields are set to be
composed both of the uniform magnetic fields that model the global fields
penetrating the NS and of the turbulent magnetic fields that would be
originated from the Hall cascade of the large-scale turbulence. Our results
show that the whistler cascade of the turbulence transports the magnetic energy
preferentially in the direction perpendicular to the uniform magnetic fields.
It is also found that the distribution function of electrons becomes
anisotropic because electrons with lower energies are predominantly heated in
the direction parallel to the uniform magnetic fields due to the Landau
resonance, while electrons with higher energies are heated mainly by the
cyclotron resonance that makes the distribution function isotropic for the high
energy tails. Furthermore we point out that the degree of anisotropy takes
maximum as a function of the initial turbulent magnetic energy. As an
alternative to the conventional ohmic dissipation, we propose that the magnetic
fields in the outer crust of NSs, cascading down to the electron inertial scale
via the whistler turbulence, would decay predominantly by the dissipation
processes through the Landau damping and the cyclotron resonance.
