We present all order results for the heavy top corrections to the \rho
parameter in the complex mass scheme. We derive translation formulas between
the complex mass and the on-shell scheme and show that they are ultimately
equivalent. We show that a naive treatment with a fixed width for the top quark
cannot give even approximately correct results.
