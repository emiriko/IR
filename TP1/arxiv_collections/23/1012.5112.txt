Quasi-periodic propagating disturbances are frequently observed in coronal
intensity image sequences. These disturbances have historically been
interpreted as being the signature of slow-mode magnetoacoustic waves
propagating into the corona. The detailed analysis of Hinode EUV Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS) timeseries observations of an active region (known to
contain propagating disturbances) shows strongly correlated, quasi-periodic,
oscillations in intensity, Doppler shift, and line width. No frequency doubling
is visible in the latter. The enhancements in the moments of the line profile
are generally accompanied by a faint, quasi-periodically occurring, excess
emission at ~100 km/s in the blue wing of coronal emission lines. The
correspondence of quasi-periodic excess wing emission and the moments of the
line profile indicates that repetitive high-velocity upflows are responsible
for the oscillatory behavior observed. Furthermore, we show that the same
quasi-periodic upflows can be directly identified in a simultaneous image
sequence obtained by the Hinode X-Ray Telescope (XRT). These results are
consistent with the recent assertion of De Pontieu & McIntosh (2010) that the
wave interpretation of the data is not unique. Indeed, given that several
instances are seen to propagate along the direction of the EIS slit that
clearly show in-phase, quasi-periodic variations of intensity, velocity, width
(without frequency doubling), and blue wing enhanced emission this dataset
would appear to provide a compelling example that upflows are more likely to be
the main cause of the quasi-periodicities observed here, as such
correspondences are hard to reconcile in the wave paradigm.
