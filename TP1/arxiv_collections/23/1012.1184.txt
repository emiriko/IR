As a powerful statistical image modeling technique, sparse representation has
been successfully used in various image restoration applications. The success
of sparse representation owes to the development of l1-norm optimization
techniques, and the fact that natural images are intrinsically sparse in some
domain. The image restoration quality largely depends on whether the employed
sparse domain can represent well the underlying image. Considering that the
contents can vary significantly across different images or different patches in
a single image, we propose to learn various sets of bases from a pre-collected
dataset of example image patches, and then for a given patch to be processed,
one set of bases are adaptively selected to characterize the local sparse
domain. We further introduce two adaptive regularization terms into the sparse
representation framework. First, a set of autoregressive (AR) models are
learned from the dataset of example image patches. The best fitted AR models to
a given patch are adaptively selected to regularize the image local structures.
Second, the image non-local self-similarity is introduced as another
regularization term. In addition, the sparsity regularization parameter is
adaptively estimated for better image restoration performance. Extensive
experiments on image deblurring and super-resolution validate that by using
adaptive sparse domain selection and adaptive regularization, the proposed
method achieves much better results than many state-of-the-art algorithms in
terms of both PSNR and visual perception.
