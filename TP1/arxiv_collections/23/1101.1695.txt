In conventional molecular simulation, metastable structures often survive
over considerable computational time, resulting in difficulties in simulating
equilibrium states. In order to overcome this difficulty, here we propose a
newly devised method, molecular Monte Carlo simulation of systems connected to
three reservoirs: chemical potential, pressure, and temperature. Gibbs-Duhem
equation thermodynamically limits the number of reservoirs to 2 for single
component systems. However, in conventional simulations utilizing 2 or fewer
reservoirs, the system tends to be trapped in metastable states. Even if the
system is allowed to escape from such metastable states in conventional
simulations, the fixed system size and/or the fixed number of particles result
in creation of defects in ordered structures. This situation breaks global
anisotropy of ordered structures and forces the periodicity of the structure to
be commensurate to the system size. Here we connect the such three reservoirs
to overcome these difficulties. A method of adjusting the three reservoirs and
obtaining thermodynamically stable states is also designed, based on
Gibbs-Duhem equation. Unlike the other conventional simulation techniques
utilizing no more than 2 reservoirs, our method allows the system itself to
simultaneously tune the system size and the number of particles to periodicity
and anisotropy of ordered structures. Our method requires fewer efforts for
preliminary simulations prior to production runs, compared with the other
advanced simulation techniques such as multicanonical method. A free energy
measurement method, suitable for the system with the three reservoirs, is also
discussed, based on Euler equation of thermodynamics. This measurement method
needs fewer computational efforts than other free energy measurement methods
do.
