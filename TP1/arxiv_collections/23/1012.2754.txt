There is an intriguing connection between the dynamics of the horocycle flow
in the modular surface $SL_{2}(\pmb{Z}) \backslash SL_{2}(\pmb{R})$ and the
Riemann hypothesis. It appears in the error term for the asymptotic of the
horocycle average of a modular function of rapid decay. We study whether
similar results occur for a broader class of modular functions, including
functions of polynomial growth, and of exponential growth at the cusp. Hints on
their long horocycle average are derived by translating the horocycle flow
dynamical problem in string theory language. Results are then proved by
designing an unfolding trick involving a Theta series, related to the spectral
Eisenstein series by Mellin integral transform. We discuss how the string
theory point of view leads to an interesting open question, regarding the
behavior of long horocycle averages of a certain class of automorphic forms of
exponential growth at the cusp.
