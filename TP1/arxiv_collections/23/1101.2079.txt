We report a first principles study of the coupled evolution of energetic
ions, background majority ions, electrons and electromagnetic fields in
magnetised plasma during the linear phase of the lower hybrid drift
instability. A particle-in-cell code, with one spatial and three velocity space
co-ordinates, is used to analyse the evolving distribution of a drifting
ring-beam population of energetic protons in physical space and gyrophase
angle. This analysis is carried out for plasma parameters that approximate to
edge conditions in large tokamaks, in a scenario that is motivated by
observations of ion cyclotron emission and may be relevant to alpha
channelling. Resonant energy transfer occurs at the two gyrophase angles at
which the instantaneous speed of an energetic proton on its cyclotron orbit
precisely matches the phase velocity of the lower hybrid wave along the
simulation domain. Electron space-charge oscillations determine the wavelength
of the propagating lower hybrid wave, and thereby govern the spatial
distribution of gyrobunching of the energetic protons that drive the
instability.
