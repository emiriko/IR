For suspensions of permeable particles, the short-time translational and
rotational self-diffusion coefficients, and collective diffusion and
sedimentation coefficients are evaluated theoretically. An individual particle
is modeled as a uniformly permeable sphere of a given permeability, with the
internal solvent flow described by the Debye-Bueche-Brinkman equation. The
particles are assumed to interact non-hydrodynamically by their excluded
volumes. The virial expansion of the transport properties in powers of the
volume fraction is performed up to the two-particle level. The first-order
virial coefficients corresponding to two-body hydrodynamic interactions are
evaluated with very high accuracy by the series expansion in inverse powers of
the inter-particle distance. Results are obtained and discussed for a wide
range of the ratio, x, of the particle radius to the hydrodynamic screening
length inside a permeable sphere. It is shown that for x >= 10, the virial
coefficients of the transport properties are well-approximated by the
hydrodynamic radius (annulus) model developed by us earlier for the effective
viscosity of porous-particle suspensions.
