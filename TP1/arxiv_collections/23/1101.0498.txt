We investigate chiral symmetry breaking in strong magnetic fields at finite
temperature and densities in a 3 flavor Nambu Jona Lasinio (NJL) model
including the Kobayashi Maskawa t-Hooft (KMT) determinant term, using an
explicit structure for the ground state in terms of quark antiquark
condensates. The mass gap equations are solved self consistently and are used
to compute the thermodynamic potential. We also derive the equation of state
for strange quark matter in the presence of strong magnetic fields which could
be relevant for proto-neutron stars. ~
