Recent spacecraft observations exploring solar system properties impact
standard paradigms of the formation of stars, planets and comets. We stress the
unexpected cloud of microscopic dust resulting from the DEEP IMPACT mission,
and the existence of molten nodules in STARDUST samples. And the theory of star
formation does not explain the common occurrence of binary and multiple star
systems in the standard gas fragmentation scenario. No current theory of planet
formation can explain the iron core of the earth, under oceans of water.
  These difficulties are avoided in a scenario where the planet mass objects
form primordially and are today the baryonic dark matter. They have been
detected in quasar microlensing and anomalous quasar radio brightening bursts.
The primordial planets often concentrate together to form a star, with residual
matter seen in pre-stellar accretion discs around the youngest stars.
  These primordial planet mass bodies were formed of hydrogen-helium,
aggregated in dense clumps of a trillion at the time of plasma neutralization
380,000 years after the big bang. Most have been frozen and invisible, but are
now manifesting themselves in numerous ways as sensitive modern space
telescopes become operational. Their key detection signature is their thermal
emission spectrum, pegged at the 13.8 degrees Kelvin triple point of hydrogen,
the baryonic dark matter (Staplefeldt et al. 1999).
