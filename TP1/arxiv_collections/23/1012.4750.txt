We consider how the measurement of top polarization at the Tevatron can be
used to characterise and discriminate among different new physics models that
have been suggested to explain the anomalous top forward-backward asymmetry
reported at the Tevatron. This has the advantage of catching the essence of the
parity violating effect characteristic to the different suggested new physics
models. Other observables constructed from these asymmetries are shown to be
useful in discriminating between the models, even after taking into account the
statistical errors. Finally, we discuss some signals at the 7 TeV LHC.
