We consider a set of fully connected spins models that display first- or
second-order transitions and for which we compute the ground-state entanglement
in the thermodynamical limit. We analyze several entanglement measures
(concurrence, R\'enyi entropy, and negativity), and show that, in general,
discontinuous transitions lead to a jump of these quantities at the transition
point. Interestingly, we also find examples where this is not the case.
