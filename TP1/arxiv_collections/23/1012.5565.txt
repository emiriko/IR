We study the impurity effects on the transition temperature Tc with use of
the T-matrix approximation. We propose a way to visualize the multi-orbital
effect by introducing the hybridization function characterizing the
multi-orbital effect for the impurity scattering. Characterizing function does
not depend on the superconducting pairing symmetry, since this function is
defined by the eigenvectors in normal states. The result indicates that an
impurity-robust superconductivity does not necessarily imply a sign- preserving
pairing. Visualizing the hybridization effect in the effective five-band model
for LaFeAsO, we show that the impurity effect on Tc is relatively weaker than
that in single-band models.
