We show that the assumption of a nontrivial zero band gap for a graphene
sheet within an effective relativistic field theoretical model description of
interacting Dirac electrons on the surface of graphene describes the
experimental band gap of graphene nanoribbons for a wide range of widths. The
graphene band gap is dynamically generated, corresponding to a nontrivial
gapless solution, found in the limit of an infinitely wide graphene ribbon. The
nanoribbon band gap is determined by the experimental graphene work function.
