We analyze more than 5000 days of Sun-as-a-star radial velocity GOLF and
intensity VIRGO observations to measure the visibilities of the l=0, 1, 2, and
3 modes and the m-amplitude ratios of the l=2 and 3 modes in the solar acoustic
spectrum. We provide observational values that we compare to theoretical
predictions.
