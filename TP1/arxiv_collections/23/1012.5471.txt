The motion of a domain wall in a two dimensional medium is studied taking
into account the internal elastic degrees of freedom of the wall and
geometrical pinning produced both by holes and sample boundaries. This study is
used to analyze the geometrical conditions needed for optimizing crossed
ratchet effects in periodic rectangular arrays of asymmetric holes, recently
observed experimentally in patterned ferromagnetic films. Geometrical
calculations and numerical simulations have been used to obtain the anisotropic
critical fields for depinning flat and kinked walls in rectangular arrays of
triangles. The aim is to show with a generic elastic model for interfaces how
to build a rectifier able to display crossed ratchet effects or effective
potential landscapes for controlling the motion of interfaces or invasion
fronts.
