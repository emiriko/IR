We report on a simple novel trapping scheme for the generation of
Bose-Einstein condensates of $^{87}$Rb atoms. This scheme employs a
near-infrared single beam optical dipole trap combined with a weak magnetic
quadrupole field as used for magneto-optical trapping to enhance the
confinement in axial direction. Efficient forced evaporative cooling to the
phase transition is achieved in this weak hybrid trap via reduction of the
laser intensity of the optical dipole trap at constant magnetic field gradient.
