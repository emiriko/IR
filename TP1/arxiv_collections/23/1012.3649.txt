We recently determined the mass of the most massive star known to the date,
R136a1 with a mass at birth 320 times the mass of our sun, as well as the mass
of several other stars that are more massive than 150 M. Such massive stars
(~150-300 M) may end their life as pair-instability supernovae (PISN) if they
retain enough mass until they die. We have calculated a grid of stellar
evolution models in order to investigate the impact of mass loss and rotation
on the evolution and fate of these very massive stars. As mass loss is very
strong at solar metallicity, our models predict that most of the very massive
stars will die as type Ic SNe. Only slowly and non-rotating stars at
metallicities below that of the LMC might retain enough mass to produce a PISN.
This would mean that the first stellar generations might have produced PISN
although their chemical signature is not observed in extremely metal poor stars
in the halo of our galaxy.
