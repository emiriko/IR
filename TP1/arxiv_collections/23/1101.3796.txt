We study the possibility of the existence of extra fermion families and an
extra Higgs doublet. We find that requiring the extra Higgs doublet to be inert
leaves space for three extra families, allowing for mirror fermion families and
a dark matter candidate at the same time. The emerging scenario is very
predictive: it consists of a Standard Model Higgs boson, with mass above
400\,\GeV, heavy new quarks between 340 and 500\,\GeV, light extra neutral
leptons, and an inert scalar with a mass below $M_Z$.
