We develop a timeout based extension of propositional linear temporal logic
(which we call TLTL) to specify timing properties of timeout based models of
real time systems. TLTL formulas explicitly refer to a running global clock
together with static timing variables as well as a dynamic variable abstracting
the timeout behavior. We extend LTL with the capability to express timeout
constraints. From the expressiveness view point, TLTL is not comparable with
important known clock based real-time logics including TPTL, XCTL, and MTL,
i.e., TLTL can specify certain properties, which cannot be specified in these
logics (also vice-versa). We define a corresponding timeout tableau for
satisfiability checking of the TLTL formulas. Also a model checking algorithm
over timeout Kripke structure is presented. Further we prove that the validity
checking for such an extended logic remains PSPACE-complete even in the
presence of timeout constraints and infinite state models. Under discrete time
semantics, with bounded timeout increments, the model-checking problem that if
a TLTL-formula holds in a timeout Kripke structure is also PSPACE complete. We
further prove that when TLTL is interpreted over discrete time, it can be
embedded in the monadic second order logic with time, and when TLTL is
interpreted over dense time without the condition of non-zenoness, the
resulting logic becomes $\Sigma_1^1$-complete.
