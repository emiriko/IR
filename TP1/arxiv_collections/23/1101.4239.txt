We investigate the parity-broken phase structure for staggered and naive
fermions in the Gross-Neveu model as a toy model of QCD. We consider a
generalized staggered Gross-Neveu model including two types of four-point
interactions. We use generalized mass terms to split the doublers for both
staggered and naive fermions. The phase boundaries derived from the gap
equations show that the mass splitting of tastes results in an Aoki phase both
in the staggered and naive cases. We also discuss the continuum limit of these
models and explore taking the chirally-symmetric limit by fine-tuning a mass
parameter and two coupling constants. This supports the idea that in lattice
QCD we can derive one- or two-flavor staggered fermions by tuning the mass
parameter, which are likely to be less expensive than Wilson fermions in QCD
simulation.
