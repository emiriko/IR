Long-lived quasistationary states, associated with stationary stable
solutions of the Vlasov equation, are found in systems with long-range
interactions. Studies of the relaxation time in a model of $N$ globally coupled
particles moving on a ring, the Hamiltonian Mean Field model (HMF), have shown
that it diverges as $N^\gamma$ for large $N$, with $\gamma \simeq 1.7$ for some
initial conditions with homogeneously distributed particles. We propose a
method for identifying exact inhomogeneous steady states in the thermodynamic
limit, based on analysing models of uncoupled particles moving in an external
field. For the HMF model, we show numerically that the relaxation time of these
states diverges with $N$ with the exponent $\gamma \simeq 1$. The method,
applicable to other models with globally coupled particles, also allows an
exact evaluation of the stability limit of homogeneous steady states. In some
cases it provides a good approximation for the correspondence between the
initial condition and the final steady state.
