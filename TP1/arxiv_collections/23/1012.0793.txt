We study the properties of a heterogeneous, chiral granular rotor that is
capable of performing useful work when immersed in a bath of thermalized
particles. The dynamics can be obtained in general from a numerical solution of
the Boltzmann-Lorentz equation. We show that a mechanical approach gives the
exact mean angular velocity in the limit of an infinitely massive rotor. We
examine the dependence of the mean angular velocity on the coefficients of
restitution of the two materials composing the motor. We compute the power and
efficiency and compare with numerical simulations. We also perform a realistic
numerical simulation of a granular rotor which shows that the presence of non
uniformity of the bath density within the region where the motor rotates, and
that the ratchet effect is slightly weakened, but qualitatively sustained.
Finally we discuss the results in connection with recent experiments.
