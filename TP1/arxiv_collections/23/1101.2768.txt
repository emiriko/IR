Using monolayer graphene as a model system for a purely two-dimensional (2D)
electron gas, we show by energy electron loss spectroscopy, highly resolved
both in energy and momentum, that there is a significant probability for the
excitation of not only one but two dispersing losses. The appearance of both
losses is independent of the substrate (we tested graphene on the Si face of
6H-SiC(0001), and on Ir(111) without and with intercalated Na layer), and the
ratio of the slope in the dispersion curves varies between 1.4 (SiC) and 2.
While the lower dispersion curve can be attributed to the excitation of the
monopole plasmon, in agreement with theoretical model calculations, the upper
dispersion branch has not been identified before for plasmonic excitations in a
2D electron gas, and we assign it to the excitation of a multipole sheet
plasmon.
