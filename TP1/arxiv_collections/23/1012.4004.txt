Aspects of the D=4, N=4 superconformal symmetry relevant to the AdS/CFT
duality and integrability are reviewed. These include the Lie superalgebra
psu(2,2|4), its representations, conformal transformations and correlation
functions in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory as well as an illustration of the
AdS5xS5 superspace on which the dual string theory is formulated.
