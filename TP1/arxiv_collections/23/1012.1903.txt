The recently proposed first-order parent formalism at the level of equations
of motion is specialized to the case of Lagrangian systems. It is shown that
for diffeomorphism-invariant theories the parent formulation takes the form of
an AKSZ-type sigma model. The proposed formulation can be also seen as a
Lagrangian version of the BV-BRST extension of the Vasiliev unfolded approach.
We also discuss its possible interpretation as a multidimensional
generalization of the Hamiltonian BFV--BRST formalism. The general construction
is illustrated by examples of (parametrized) mechanics, relativistic particle,
Yang--Mills theory, and gravity.
