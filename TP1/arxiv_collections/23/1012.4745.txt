We study photodetection in graphene near a local electrostatic gate, which
enables active control of the potential landscape and carrier polarity. We find
that a strong photoresponse only appears when and where a p-n junction is
formed, allowing on-off control of photodetection. Photocurrents generated near
p-n junctions do not require biasing and can be realized using submicron gates.
Locally modulated photoresponse enables a new range of applications for
graphene-based photodetectors including, for example, pixilated infrared
imaging with control of response on subwavelength dimensions.
