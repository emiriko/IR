Unlike most of the research on the Mpemba effect which has focused on
verifying the observation that warm water freezes faster than cold water, our
work quantitatively investigates the rates at which hot and cold water cool and
the point at which hot water reaches a lower temperature than cold water under
a set of external conditions. Using a vacuum pump to cool samples of water
initially at different temperatures, we measured reproducible temperature
values at which hot and cold water equilibrate. We have confirmed that warmer
water indeed cools at a faster rate than colder water and that, surprisingly,
this trend continues past the point where the temperatures of the two samples
are the same. Our results show that when using optimal initial temperature
conditions, the crossover temperature is found to be 2.7 oC whereas our other
set of initial conditions gave a crossover temperature of -0.07 oC. These data
taken together provide a definite quantitative evidence of the Mpemba effect.
