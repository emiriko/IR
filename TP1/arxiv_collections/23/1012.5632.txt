Optomechanical systems are a promising candidate for the implementation of
quantum interfaces for storing and redistributing quantum information. Here we
focus on the case of a high-finesse optical cavity with a thin vibrating
semitransparent membrane in the middle. We show that robust and stationary
optomechanical entanglement could be achieved in the system, even in the
presence of nonnegligible optical absorption in the membrane. We also present
some preliminary experimental data showing radiation-pressure induced optical
bistability.
