We investigate population dynamics in N-level systems driven beyond the
linear regime by a strong external field, which couples to the system through
an operator with nonzero diagonal elements. As concrete example we consider the
case of dipolar molecular systems. We identify limiting cases of the
Hamiltonian leading to wavefunctions that can be written in terms of ordinary
exponentials, and focus on the limits of slowly and rapidly varying fields of
arbitrary strength. For rapidly varying fields we prove for arbitrary $N$ that
the population dynamics is independent of the sign of the projection of the
field onto the dipole coupling. In the opposite limit of slowly varying fields
the population of the target level is optimized by a dipole resonance
condition. As a result population transfer is maximized for one sign of the
field and suppressed for the other one, so that a switch based on flopping the
field polarization can be devised. For significant sign dependence the
resonance linewidth with respect to the field strength is small. In the
intermediate regime of moderate field variation, the integral of lowest order
in the coupling can be rewritten as a sum of terms resembling the two limiting
cases, plus correction terms for N>2, so that a less pronounced sign-dependence
still exists.
