It has been researched the kinetics of the thermal equilibrium's
establishment in an early Universe under the assumption of the recovery of
interaction scaling of elementary particles in range of superhigh energies. The
case of the thermal equilibrium's weak initial violation and basic cosmological
consequences of the thermal equilibrium's violation have been researched.
