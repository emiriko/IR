We propose a notion of hyperbolic system of conservation laws invariant for
the Galileo group of transformations. We show that with natural physical and
mathematical hypotheses, such a system conducts to the gas dynamics equations
or to exotic systems that are detailed in this contribution to Cemracs 99.
