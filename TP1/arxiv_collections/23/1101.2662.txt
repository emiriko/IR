In these proceedings, we briefly review how jets can be reconstructed in
heavy-ion collisions. The main point we address is the subtraction of the large
contamination from the underlying event background. We first present the main
ingredients needed to define the jets and perform the background subtraction
and then discuss the efficiency of the subtraction for different jet algorithms
and background-estimation methods.
