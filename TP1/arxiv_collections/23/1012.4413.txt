The contemporary controversy about the fundamental obscurity in quantum
mechanics keeps on the old one about the aim of science, which was between the
founders of the quantum theory. The orthodox quantum mechanics could be created
only at the cost of renunciation of reality as the aim of natural science. The
description only of phenomena, i.e. results of observation, should not be
universal if no one believes that these phenomena are manifestation of a unique
reality. Such belief concerning quantum mechanics is quite unacceptable because
of irremediably conflict with special relativity. Nevertheless the quantum
mechanics was developed and apprehended by most physicists as a universal
theory of a quantum world. This fundamental discrepancy between the essence of
the orthodox quantum mechanics and its history of development and studying has
resulted both to an illusion about the aim of its description among most
physicists and to the consideration of its fundamental obscurity as a universal
problem among experts in quantum foundation. The aim of this paper is to show
that quantum phenomena can not be described universally. It is indicated that
rather the Schrodinger's than Born's interpretation of the wave function is
valid for description of many quantum phenomena. The fundamental obscurity with
which we are faced at the description, for example, macroscopic quantum
phenomena differs fundamentally from the one with which the founders of the
quantum theory were faced on atomic level.
