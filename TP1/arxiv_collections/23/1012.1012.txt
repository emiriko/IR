We investigate the necessary condition for the existence of classical
Euclidean wormholes in a conformally non-invariant gravitational model
minimally coupled to an scalar field. It is shown that while the original Ricci
tensor with positive eigenvalues does not allow the Euclidean wormholes to
occur, under dynamical conformal transformations the Ricci tensor, with respect
to the original metric, is dynamically coupled with the conformal field and its
eigenvalues may become negative allowing the Euclidean wormholes to occur.
Therefore, it is conjectured that dynamical conformal transformations may
provide us with {\it effective} forms of matter sources leading to Euclidean
wormholes in conformally non-invariant systems.
