In his recent paper published in the European Journal of Scientific Research
44, 4, 610-611 (2010), the author, Arthur Boltcho, claims to have found a
mathematical disproof of relative time dilatation of Special Relativity Theory
(SRT). In this letter we show that the supposed mathematical disproof of
relative time dilatation of SRT is totally wrong and that Arthur Boltcho
demonstrated nothing. The errors by Boltcho arise from a strong
misunderstanding and confusing the concept of "moments" and time intervals in
the framework of SRT.
