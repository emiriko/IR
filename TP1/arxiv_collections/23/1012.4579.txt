Distributions of nonthermal surface brightness of supernova remnants (SNRs)
contain important information about the properties of magnetic field and
acceleration of charged particles. In the present paper, the synchrotron radio,
X-ray, and inverse-Compton (IC) gamma-ray maps of adiabatic SNRs in uniform
interstellar medium and interstellar magnetic field are modeled and their
morphology is analyzed, with particular emphasis to comparison of azimuthal and
radial variations of brightness in radio, X-rays, and gamma-rays. Approximate
analytical formulae for the azimuthal and radial profiles of the synchrotron
radio and X-ray as well as the IC gamma-ray brightness are derived. They reveal
the main factors which influence the pattern of the surface brightness
distribution due to leptonic emission processes in shells of SNRs and can
account for some non-linear effects of acceleration if necessary. These
approximations provide observers and theorists with a set of simple diagnostic
tools for quick analysis of the non-thermal maps of SNRs.
