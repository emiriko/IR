The three sphere partition function, Z, of three dimensional theories with
four supercharges and an R-symmetry is computed using localization, resulting
in a matrix integral over the Cartan of the gauge group. There is a family of
couplings to the curved background, parameterized by a choice of R-charge, such
that supersymmetry is preserved; Z is a function of those parameters. The
magnitude of the result is shown to be extremized for the superconformal
R-charge of the infrared conformal field theory, in the absence of mixing of
the R-symmetry with accidental symmetries. This exactly determines the IR
superconformal R-charge.
