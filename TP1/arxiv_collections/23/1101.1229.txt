The phenomenon of superconductivity was explained as a consequence of
ordering of zero-point oscillations. Superfluidity are related phenomenon. The
consideration of interaction zero-point oscillations in liquid helium permit to
obtain quantitative estimations of main characteristic of superfluid helium
which are in a good agreement with measuring data. So both related phenomena,
superconductivity and superfluidity, get explanation which is based on the same
physical mechanism - they both are consequences of the ordering of zero-point
oscillations.
