The electron-positron pair production by an electron in a strong magnetic
field near the process threshold is considered. The process is shown to be more
probable if the spin of the initial electron is oriented along the field. In
this case, the probability of the process is $\sim10^{13} s^{-1}$ when the
magnetic field strength is $H=4\cdot 10^{12}$ G.
