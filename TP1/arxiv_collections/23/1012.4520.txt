We develop an analytical theory for diffusive random lasers by coupling the
transport theory of the disordered medium to the semiclassical laser rate
equations, accounting for (coherent) stimulated and (incoherent) spontaneous
emission. From the causality of wave propagation in an amplifying, diffusive
medium we derive a novel length scale which we identify with the average mode
radius of the lasing quasi-modes. We show further that loss at the surface of
the laser-active medium is crucial in order to stabilize a stationary lasing
state. The solution of the transport theory of random lasers for a layer
geometry with appropriate surface boundary conditions yields the spatial
profile of the light intensity and of the population inversion. The dependence
of the intensity correlation length on the pump rate is in qualitative
agreement with experimental and numerical findings.
