In terms of fundamental principles of quantum theory of interacting particles
and relativistic kinetic theory there was carried out an analysis of the main
principle of standard cosmological scenario - the initial existence of local
thermodynamical equilibrium. It has been shown, that condition of the existence
of local thermodynamical equilibrium in Universe is determined essentially by
means of function of total cross-section of particles' interaction from the
kinematic invariant and in case of scaling's recovery in range of superhigh
energies it is initially broken.
