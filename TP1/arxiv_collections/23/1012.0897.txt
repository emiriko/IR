For selecting the properly magnetic alloy (MA) material to load the RF
compression cavity, the measurement of the MA cores which is produced by Liyuan
Company has been carried out at IMP. We measured 4 kinds of MA core materials,
type V1, V2, A1 and A2. And we mainly focus on the permeability, quality factor
(Q value) and shunt impedance of the MA core. The MA cores which have higher
permeability, lower Q value and higher shunt impedance will be selected to load
RF compression cavity. According to the results of measurement, the type V1, V2
and A2 material will be chosen as candidate to load RF cavity.
