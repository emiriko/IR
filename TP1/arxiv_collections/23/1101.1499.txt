We describe and refine the masked moment method used to suppress noise in
Galactic and extragalactic spectral line surveys. By applying the refined
technique to an essentially noise-free CO molecular cloud survey with Gaussian
noise added, we determine the optimum masking parameters for typical CO surveys
such as those presented in Dame et al. (2001, ApJ, 547, 792)
