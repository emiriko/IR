Absorption spectra of Ni$^{2+}$ ions in 22WO$_3$--78TeO$_2$
tungstate-tellurite glass were studied and Ni$^{2+}$ extinction coefficient
spectral dependence was derived in the 450 -- 2700 nm wavelength range.
Computer modeling of the glass structure proved Ni$^{2+}$ ions to be in
trigonal-distorted octahedral environment in the tungstate-tellurite glass.
Tanabe-Sugano diagram for such an environment was calculated and good
description of the observed spectrum of Ni$^{2+}$ ion was obtained. Basing on
both absorption spectral range width and the extinction coefficient, nickel
should be considered among the most strongly absorbing impurities in the
tellurite glasses.
