The cluster statistics of BTW automata in the SOC states are obtained by
extensive computer simulation. Various moments of the clusters are calculated
and few results are compared with earlier available numerical estimates and
exact results. Reasonably good agreement is observed. An extended statistical
analysis has been made.
