The expressions for the differential cross section and of the polarization
observables for the reaction $\bar p+p\rightarrow e^++e^-$ are given in terms
of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors in the laboratory system. Radiative
corrections due to the emission of virtual and real soft photons from the
leptons are also calculated. Unlike the center-of- mass system case, they
depend on the scattering angle. Polarization effects are derived in the case
when the antiproton beam, the target and the electron in the final state are
polarized. Numerical estimations have been done for all observables for the
PANDA experimental conditions using models for the nucleon electromagnetic form
factors in the time-like region. The radiative corrections to the differential
cross section are calculated as function of the beam energy and of the electron
angle.
