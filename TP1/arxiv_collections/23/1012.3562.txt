The cumulative contribution of odd (Bo) and even (BE) parity zonal magnetic
multipoles to the solar magnetic fields is calculated using spherical harmonic
coefficients of the photospheric magnetic field for the years 1959-1985. The
dominant parity of the solar magnetic field is shown to change from odd to even
during every sunspot cycle. The association of variations of Bo and BE with
different astrophysical phenomena such as magnetic reversal of solar polar
magnetic fields, north-south asymmetry in sunspot activity and strength of the
interplanetary magnetic field will be also discussed. Using solar observations
we could infer that dominant parity of the solar magnetic field is changing
from even to odd during the past 12 solar cycles when the solar activity is
showing an increasing trend during this period.
