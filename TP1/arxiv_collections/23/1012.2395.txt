In this paper we consider first order differential models of collective
behaviors of groups of agents based on the mass conservation equation. Models
are formulated taking the spatial distribution of the agents as the main
unknown, expressed in terms of a probability measure evolving in time. We
develop an existence and approximation theory of the solutions to such models
and we show that some recently proposed models of crowd and swarm dynamics fit
our theoretic paradigm.
