A spin interaction Hamiltonian for topological basis is constructed in this
paper. When we select proper parameters, this Hamiltonian system can be
simulated by a quantum double well potential system. If the parameter
$\Delta=0$, the topological system is equivalent to two independent quantum
wells. If the parameter $\Delta\neq 0$, the system is equivalent to a double
well potential with finite potential barrier. The quantum tunneling effect and
quantum Zeno effect for this topological system are investigated in detail.
