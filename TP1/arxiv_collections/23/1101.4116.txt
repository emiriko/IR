This paper describes the design and implementation of GridCertLib, a Java
library leveraging a Shibboleth-based authentication infrastructure and the
SLCS online certificate signing service, to provide short-lived X.509
certificates and Grid proxies. The main use case envisioned for GridCertLib, is
to provide seamless and secure access to Grid/X.509 certificates and proxies in
web applications and portals: when a user logs in to the portal using
Shibboleth authentication, GridCertLib can automatically obtain a Grid/X.509
certificate from the SLCS service and generate a VOMS proxy from it. We give an
overview of the architecture of GridCertLib and briefly describe its
programming model. Its application to some deployment scenarios is outlined, as
well as a report on practical experience integrating GridCertLib into portals
for Bioinformatics and Computational Chemistry applications, based on the
popular P-GRADE and Django softwares.
