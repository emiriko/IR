All-loop Finite Unified Theories (FUTs) are very interesting N=1
supersymmetric Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) realising an old field theory
dream, and moreover have a remarkable predictive power due to the required
reduction of couplings. The reduction of the dimensionless couplings in N=1
GUTs is achieved by searching for renormalization group invariant (RGI)
relations among them holding beyond the unification scale. Finiteness results
from the fact that there exist RGI relations among dimensional couplings that
guarantee the vanishing of all beta-functions in certain N=1 GUTs even to all
orders. Furthermore developments in the soft supersymmetry breaking sector of
N=1 GUTs and FUTs lead to exact RGI relations, i.e. reduction of couplings, in
this dimensionful sector of the theory, too. Based on the above theoretical
framework phenomenologically consistent FUTs have been constructed. Here we
review FUT models based on the SU(5) and SU(3)^3 gauge groups and their
predictions. Of particular interest is the Higgs mass prediction of the models
which is expected to be tested at the LHC.
