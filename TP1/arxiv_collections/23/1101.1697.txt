We revisit the problem of a mechanism that generates the mass spectrum of
elementary particles. This has vexed physicists for several decades now. In
this connection we deduce a formula that gives the masses of all known
elementary particles, even though other quantum numbers are suppressed. These
considerations become important in view of the LHC which is expected to attain
14 TeV by 2013.
