During the last few years our knowledge about the X-ray emission from bodies
within the solar system has significantly improved. Several new solar system
objects are now known to shine in X-rays at energies below 2 keV. Apart from
the Sun, the known X-ray emitters now include planets (Venus, Earth, Mars,
Jupiter, and Saturn), planetary satellites (Moon, Io, Europa, and Ganymede),
all active comets, the Io plasma torus (IPT), the rings of Saturn, the coronae
(exospheres) of Earth and Mars, and the heliosphere. The advent of
higher-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with the Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray
observatories has been of great benefit in advancing the field of planetary
X-ray astronomy. Progress in modeling X-ray emission, laboratory studies of
X-ray production, and theoretical calculations of cross-sections, have all
contributed to our understanding of processes that produce X-rays from the
solar system bodies. At Jupiter and Earth, both auroral and non-auroral disk
X-ray emissions have been observed. X-rays have been detected from Saturn's
disk, but no convincing evidence of an X-ray aurora has been observed. The
first soft (0.1- 2 keV) X-ray observation of Earth's aurora by Chandra shows
that it is highly variable. The non-auroral X-ray emissions from Jupiter,
Saturn, and Earth, those from the disk of Mars, Venus, and Moon, and from the
rings of Saturn, are mainly produced by scattering of solar X-rays. The
spectral characteristics of X-ray emission from comets, the heliosphere, the
geocorona, and the Martian halo are quite similar, but they appear to be quite
different from those of Jovian auroral X-rays. X-rays from the Galilean
satellites and the IPT are mostly driven by impact of Jovian magnetospheric
particles. This paper reviews studies of the soft X-ray emission from the solar
system bodies, excluding the Sun.
