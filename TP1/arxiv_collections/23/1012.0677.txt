Using classical density functional theory (DFT) in a modified mean-field
approximation we investigate the fluid phase behavior of quasi-two dimensional
dipolar fluids confined to a plane. The particles carry three-dimensional
dipole moments and interact via a combination of hard-sphere, van-der-Waals,
and dipolar interactions. The DFT predicts complex phase behavior involving
first- and second-order isotropic-to-ferroelectric transitions, where the
ferroelectric ordering is characterized by global polarization within the
plane. We compare this phase behavior, particularly the onset of ferroelectric
ordering and the related tricritical points, with corresponding
three-dimensional systems, slab-like systems (with finite extension into the
third direction), and true two-dimensional systems with two-dimensional dipole
moments.
