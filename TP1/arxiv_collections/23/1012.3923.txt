The growing number of extragalactic high-energy (HE, E > 100 MeV) and
very-high-energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray sources that do not belong to the
blazar class suggests that VHE gamma-ray production may be a common property of
most radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). In a previous paper, we have
investigated the signatures of Compton-supported pair cascades initiated by VHE
gamma-ray absorption in monochromatic radiation fields, dominated by Ly-alpha
line emission from the Broad Line Region. In this paper, we investigate the
interaction of nuclear VHE gamma-rays with the thermal infrared radiation field
from a circumnuclear dust torus. Our code follows the spatial development of
the cascade in full 3-dimensional geometry. We provide a model fit to the
broadband SED of the dust-rich, gamma-ray loud radio galaxy Cen A and show that
typical blazar-like jet parameters may be used to model the broadband SED, if
one allows for an additional cascade contribution to the Fermi gamma-ray
emission.
