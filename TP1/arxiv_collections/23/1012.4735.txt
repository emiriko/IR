We present results for the phase diagram of QCD with two massless quark
flavours as obtained from a first-principles functional renormalisation group
approach. In particular we compute order parameters for chiral symmetry
breaking and quark confinement at vanishing and non-zero imaginary chemical
potential. Our analytical and numerical results suggest a close relation
between the chiral and the deconfinement phase transition. We discuss the
properties of dual order parameters at imaginary and real chemical potential.
