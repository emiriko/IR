We have performed an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of the
new iron-based superconductor K0.8Fe1.7Se2 (Tc ~ 30 K). Clear band dispersion
is observed with the overall bandwidth renormalized by a factor of 2.5 compared
to our local density approximation calculations, indicating relatively strong
correlation effects. Only an electronlike band crosses the Fermi energy,
forming a nearly circular Fermi surface (FS) at M ({\pi}, 0). The holelike band
at {\Gamma} sinks ~ 90 meV below the Fermi energy, with an indirect band gap of
30 meV to the bottom of the electronlike band. The observed FS topology in this
superconductor favors ({\pi}, {\pi}) inter-FS scattering between the
electronlike FSs at the M points, in sharp contrast with other iron-based
superconductors which favor ({\pi}, 0) inter-FS scattering between holelike and
electronlike FSs.
