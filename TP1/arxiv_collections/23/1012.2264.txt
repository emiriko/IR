In quantum optics and its applications, there is an urgent demand for
photon-number resolving detectors. Recently, there appeared multi-pixel
detectors (MPPC) that are able to distinguish between 1,2,..10 photons. At the
same time, strong coupling between different pixels (cross-talk) hinders their
photon-number resolution. In this work, we suggest a method for `filtering out'
the cross-talk effect in the measurement of intensity correlation functions.
