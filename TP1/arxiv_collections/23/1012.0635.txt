We observe that Clay-Rolfsen's obstruction of bi-orderability, which uses the
classical Alexander polynomial, is not strengthened by using the twisted
Alexander polynomials for finite representations unlike many known applications
of the Alexander polynomial. This is shown by studying the maximal ordered
abelian quotient of bi-ordered groups.
