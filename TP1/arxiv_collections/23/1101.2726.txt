Lattice QCD can contribute to the search for new physics in b -> s decays by
providing first-principle calculations of B -> K(*) form factors. Preliminary
results are presented here which complement sum rule determinations by being
done at large q^2 and which improve upon previous lattice calculations by
working directly in the physical b sector on unquenched gauge field
configurations.
