We consider a simple deterministic model which describes an asymmetric
competition between an immune system with a specific and powerful response, and
a virus with a broad toxicity and fast mutations. Interest in this model relies
on the fact that in spite of it simplicity, it reproduces some of the features
of the asymptomatic phase of the infection by HIV-1. In particular, there is a
domain of parameters in which the dynamics is characterized by the apparition
of \blips", associated here to an instability which develops at high virus
reproduction rate. Various possible extensions of this simple model are
discussed, in particular in view of its applications in the context of HAART
therapy.
