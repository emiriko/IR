A proposal for the realization of Santilli's comparative test of the gravity
of electrons and positrons via a horizontal supercooled vacuum tube is
described. Principle and requirements are described concerning the sources,
vacuum chamber electromagnetic shielding and pressure and position sensitive
detector. It is concluded that with current technology the experiment is
perfectly feasible.
