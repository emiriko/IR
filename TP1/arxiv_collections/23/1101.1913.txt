Cool M dwarfs outnumber sun-like G stars by ten to one in the solar
neighborhood. Due to their proximity, small size, and low mass, M-dwarf stars
are becoming attractive targets for exoplanet searches via almost all current
search methods. But what planetary systems can form around M dwarfs? Following
up on the Cool Stars~16 Splinter Session "Planet Formation Around M Dwarfs", we
summarize here our knowledge of protoplanetary disks around cool stars, how
they disperse, what planetary systems might form and can be detected with
current and future instruments.
