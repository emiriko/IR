We have studied X-ray spectral state transitions that can be seen in the
long- term monitoring light curves of bright X-ray binaries from the All-Sky
Monitor (ASM) on board the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the Burst
Alert Telescope (BAT) on board Swift during a period of five years from 2005 to
2010. We have applied a program to automatically identify the hard-to-soft
(H-S) spectral state transitions in the bright X- ray binaries monitored by the
ASM and the BAT. In total we identified 128 hard-to-soft transitions, of which
59 occurred after 2008. We also determined the transition fluxes and the peak
fluxes of the following soft states, updated the measurements of the luminosity
corresponding to the H-S transition and the peak luminosity of the following
soft state in about 30 bright persistent and transient black hole and neutron
star binaries following Yu & Yan (2009), and found the luminosity correlation
and the luminosity range of spectral transitions in data between 2008-2010 are
about the same as those derived from the data before 2008. This further
strengthen the idea that the luminosity at which the H-S spectral transition
occurs in the Galactic X-ray binaries is determined by non-stationary accretion
parameters such as the rate-of-change of the mass accretion rate rather than
the mass accretion rate itself. The correlation is also found to hold in data
of individual sources 4U 1608-52 and 4U 1636-53.
