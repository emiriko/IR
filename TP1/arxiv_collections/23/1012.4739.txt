This project "Software Oriented Data Monitoring System" deals with real time
monitoring of patients' parameters like body temperature, heart rate etc. The
parameters are checked at regular intervals and Short Messaging Service (SMS)
is sent to concerned doctor regarding the measured values. If the obtained
parameters are above or below critical values, an alert SMS is also sent to the
concerned doctor. This system is very much useful in hospitals, which saves the
valuable time of the doctor who otherwise will have to monitor the patients
throughout the day. Here the analog data from the sensors is first converted
into digital form and is fed to the parallel port of the computer. This data
obtained is converted into useful parameters, which is monitored and checked
for safe limits. Appropriate SMS is sent to the doctor depending on whether the
request is from an alert or routine signal. This is possible by interfacing a
mobile phone (Siemens c35i) to the serial port of the computer. The SMS is sent
from the computer using proper AT commands.
