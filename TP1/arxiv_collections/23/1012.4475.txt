We study the properties of a parity- and time-reversal- (PT) symmetric
tight-binding chain of size N with position-dependent hopping amplitude. In
contrast to the fragile PT-symmetric phase of a chain with constant hopping and
imaginary impurity potentials, we show that, under very general conditions, our
model is {\it always} in the PT-symmetric phase. We numerically obtain the
energy spectrum and the density of states of such a chain, and show that they
are widely tunable. By studying the size-dependence of inverse participation
ratios, we show that although the chain is not translationally invariant, most
of its eigenstates are extended. Our results indicate that tight-binding models
with non-Hermitian PT-symmetric hopping have a robust PT-symmetric phase and
rich dynamics which may be explored in coupled waveguides.
