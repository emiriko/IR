Memristive systems were proposed in 1976 by Leon Chua and Sung Mo Kang as a
model for 2-terminal passive nonlinear dynamical systems which exhibit memory
effects. Such systems were originally shown to be relevant to the modeling of
action potentials in neurons in regards to the Hodgkin-Huxley model and, more
recently, to the modeling of thin film materials such as TiO2-x proposed for
non-volatile resistive memory. However, over the past 50 years a variety of
3-terminal non-passive dynamical devices have also been shown to exhibit memory
effects similar to that predicted by the memristive system model. This article
extends the original memristive systems framework to incorporate 3-terminal,
non-passive devices and explains the applicability of such dynamic systems
models to 1) the Widrow-Hoff memistor, 2) floating gate memory cells, and 3)
nano-ionic FETs.
