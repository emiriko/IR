We study QCD with twelve light flavors at intermediate values of the bare
lattice coupling. We contrast the results for the order parameter with
different theoretical models motivated by the physics of the Goldstone phase
and of the symmetric phase, and we perform a model independent analysis of the
meson spectrum inspired by universal properties of chiral symmetry. Our
analysis favors chiral symmetry restoration.
