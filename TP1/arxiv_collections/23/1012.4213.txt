We discuss azimuthal correlations in double inclusive hadron production in
high energy $dA$ collisions at RHIC. We argue that the leading logarithmic
approximation is inadequate for description of experimental data. Realistic
shape of the azimuthal correlation function is obtain only if we keep terms
that are finite in the rapidity difference between the produced hadrons.
Likewise, transverse momentum dependence of parton distribution functions in
both deuteron and nucleus must be retained. We observe depletion of the
back-to-back correlations in central $dAu$ collisions in the forward direction
consistent with the Color Glass Condensate predictions.
