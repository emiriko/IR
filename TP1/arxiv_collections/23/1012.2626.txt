The contact ${\cal I}$, introduced by Tan, has emerged as a key parameter
characterizing universal properties of strongly interacting Fermi gases. For
ultracold Fermi gases near a Feshbach resonance, the contact depends upon two
quantities: the interaction parameter $1/(k_F a)$, where $k_F$ is the Fermi
wave-vector and $a$ is the $s$-wave scattering length, and the temperature
$T/T_F$, where $T_F$ is the Fermi temperature. We present the first
measurements of the temperature dependence of the contact in a unitary Fermi
gas using Bragg spectroscopy. The contact is seen to follow the predicted decay
with temperature and shows how pair-correlations at high momentum persist well
above the superfluid transition temperature.
