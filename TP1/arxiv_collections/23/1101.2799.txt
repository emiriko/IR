We numerically investigate the ground-state phase diagram of an S=2 quantum
spin chain with the $XXZ$ and on-site anisotropies described by ${\mathcal
H}=\sum_j (S_j^x S_{j+1}^x+S_j^y S_{j+1}^y+\Delta S_j^z S_{j+1}^z) + D \sum_j
(S_j^z)^2$, where $\Delta$ denotes the XXZ anisotropy parameter of the
nearest-neighbor interactions and $D$ the on-site anisotropy parameter. We
restrict ourselves to the $\Delta>0$ and $D>0$ case for simplicity. Our main
purpose is to obtain the definite conclusion whether there exists or not the
intermediate-$D$ (ID) phase, which was proposed by Oshikawa in 1992 and has
been believed to be absent since the DMRG studies in the latter half of 1990's.
In the phase diagram with $\Delta>0$ and $D>0$ there appear the XY state, the
Haldane state, the ID state, the large-$D$ (LD) state and the N\'eel state. In
the analysis of the numerical data it is important to distinguish three gapped
states; the Haldane state, the ID state and the LD state. We give a physical
and intuitive explanation for our level spectroscopy method how to distinguish
these three phases.
