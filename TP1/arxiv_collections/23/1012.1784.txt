In the present work, we have considered tachyonic field, phantom field and
scalar field in both interacting and non-interacting situations and
investigated the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics in a
flat FRW universe. We found that in all cases, excepting the phantom field
dominated universe, the derivative of the entropy is remaining at negative
level and is increasing with the decrease in the redshift.
