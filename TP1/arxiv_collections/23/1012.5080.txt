We present a method of chromospheric flux simulation for 13 late-type
main-sequence stars. These Sun-like stars have well-determined cyclic flux
variations similar to 11 yr solar activity cycle. Our flux prediction is based
on chromospheric HK emission time series measurements from Mount Wilson
Observatory and comparable solar data. We show that solar three - component
modeling explains well the stellar observations. We find that the 10 - 20% of K
- stars disc surfaces are occupied by bright active regions.
