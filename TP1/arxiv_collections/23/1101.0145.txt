Do there exist circular and spherical copulas in $R^d$? That is, do there
exist circularly symmetric distributions on the unit disk in $R^2$ and
spherically symmetric distributions on the unit ball in $R^d$, $d\ge3$, whose
one-dimensional marginal distributions are uniform? The answer is yes for $d=2$
and 3, where the circular and spherical copulas are unique and can be
determined explicitly, but no for $d\ge4$. A one-parameter family of elliptical
bivariate copulas is obtained from the unique circular copula in $R^2$ by
oblique coordinate transformations. Copulas obtained by a non-linear
transformation of a uniform distribution on the unit ball in $R^d$ are also
described, and determined explicitly for $d=2$.
