A complete next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation in $\alpha_s$ for the
$\jpsi$ and $\psip$ prompt production at the Tevatron, LHC, and RHIC in
nonrelativistic QCD is presented. We argue that the next-to-next-to-leading
order (NNLO) color-singlet contribution may not be so important as to resolve
the large discrepancy between theory and experiment in $\jpsi$ large $p_T$
production cross sections. Therefore, a complete NLO calculation, including
both color-singlet and color-octet contribution, is necessary and essential to
give a good description for $\jpsi$ and $\psip$ production. We also study the
methods to fit the long-distance matrix elements using either two linear
combined matrix elements or three matrix elements, and find these two methods
can give consistent results. Compared with the measurements at the LHC and RHIC
for prompt $\jpsi$ and $\psip$ production, our predictions are found to agree
with all data. In particular, the recently released large $p_T$ data (up to
60-70 GeV) at the LHC are in good agreement with our predictions. Our results
imply that the universality of color-octet matrix elements holds approximately
in charmonium hadroproduction, when one uses fixed order perturbative
calculation to describe data (the data in small $p_T$ region are not included).
Our work may provide a new test for the universality of color-octet matrix
elements, and the color-octet mechanism in general.
