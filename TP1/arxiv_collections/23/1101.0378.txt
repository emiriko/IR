The occurrence of a new limit cycle in few-body physics, expressing a
universal scaling function relating the binding energies of two consecutive
tetramer states, is revealed, considering a renormalized zero-range two-body
interaction applied to four identical bosons. The tetramer energy spectrum is
obtained when adding a boson to an Efimov bound state with energy $B_3$ in the
unitary limit (for zero two-body binding, or infinite two-body scattering
length). Each excited $N-$th tetramer energy $B_4^{(N)}$ is shown to slide
along a scaling function as a short-range four-body scale is changed, emerging
from the 3+1 threshold for a universal ratio $B_4^ {(N)}/B_3 \simeq 4.6$, which
does not depend on $N$. The new scale can also be revealed by a resonance in
the atom-trimer recombination process.
