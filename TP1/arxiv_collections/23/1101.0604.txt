A pair of counter-propagating Majorana edge modes appears in chiral p-wave
superconductors and in other superconducting systems belonging to the same
universality class. These modes can be described by an Ising conformal field
theory. We show how a superconducting flux qubit attached to such a system
couples to the two chiral edge modes via the disorder field of the Ising model.
Due to this coupling, measuring the back-action of the edge states on the qubit
allows to probe the properties of Majorana edge modes.
