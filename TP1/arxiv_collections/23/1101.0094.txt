We show that one-dimensional electron systems in proximity of a
superconductor that support Majorana edge states are extremely susceptible to
electron-electron interactions. Strong interactions generically destroy the
induced superconducting gap that stabilizes the Majorana edge states. For weak
interactions, the renormalization of the gap is nonuniversal and allows for a
regime, in which the Majorana edge states persist. We present strategies how
this regime can be reached.
