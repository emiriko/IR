We emphasize that the electroweak interactions without a Higgs boson are very
similar to quantum general relativity. The Higgs field could just be a dressing
field and might not exist as a propagating particle. In that interpretation,
the electroweak interactions without a Higgs boson could be renormalizable at
the non-perturbative level because of a non-trivial fixed point. Tree-level
unitarity in electroweak bosons scattering is restored by the running of the
weak scale.
