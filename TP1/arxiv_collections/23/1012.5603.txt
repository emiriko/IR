The electric Aharonov-Bohm effect is a special case of the general Ab effect.
However, when inserting a gravitational potential in the place of the time
dependent potential, a different understanding of the phase shift could be
gained. The usual topological phase is replaced by a phase with origin in the
red shift of the particle at one of the paths taken relative to the other path.
In this case, the change in the geometrical measure is the source of the phase
shift, which therefore has a local interpretation along with the non-local
topological explanation.
