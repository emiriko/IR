Three-body model fits to Arecibo and Goldstone radar data reveal the nature
of two near-Earth asteroid triples. Triple-asteroid system 2001 SN263 is
characterized by a primary of ~10^13 kg, an inner satellite ~1% as massive
orbiting at ~3 primary radii in ~0.7 days, and an outer satellite ~2.5% as
massive orbiting at ~13 primary radii in ~6.2 days. 1994 CC is a smaller system
with a primary of mass ~2.6 \times 10^11 kg and two satellites ~2% and ~1% as
massive orbiting at distances of ~5.5 and ~19.5 primary radii. Their orbital
periods are ~1.2 and ~8.4 days. Examination of resonant arguments shows that
the satellites are not currently in a mean-motion resonance. Precession of the
apses and nodes are detected in both systems (2001 SN263 inner body:
d{\varpi}/dt ~1.1 deg/day, 1994 CC inner body: d{\varpi}/dt ~ -0.2 deg/day),
which is in agreement with analytical predictions of the secular evolution due
to mutually interacting orbits and primary oblateness. Nonzero mutual
inclinations between the orbital planes of the satellites provide the best fits
to the data in both systems (2001 SN263: ~14 degrees, 1994 CC: ~16 degrees).
Our best-fit orbits are consistent with nearly circular motion, except for 1994
CC's outer satellite which has an eccentric orbit of e ~ 0.19. We examine
several processes that can generate the observed eccentricity and inclinations,
including the Kozai and evection resonances, past mean-motion resonance
crossings, and close encounters with terrestrial planets. In particular, we
find that close planetary encounters can easily excite the eccentricities and
mutual inclinations of the satellites' orbits to the currently observed values.
