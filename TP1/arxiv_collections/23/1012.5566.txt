The structural inversion asymmetry-induced spin-orbit interaction of
conduction band electrons in zinc-blende and wurtzite semiconductor structures
is analysed allowing for a three-dimensional (3D) character of the external
electric field and variation of the chemical composition. The interaction,
taking into account all remote bands perturbatively, is presented with two
contributions: a heterointerface term and a term caused by the external
electric field. They have generally comparable strength and can be written in a
unified manner only for 2D systems, where they can partially cancel each other.
For quantum wires and dots composed of wurtzite semiconductors new terms
appear, absent in zinc-blende structures, which acquire the standard Rashba
form in 2D systems.
