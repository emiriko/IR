We employ the DAVE (differential affine velocity estimator, Schuck 2005;
2006) tracking technique on a time series of MDI/1m high spatial resolution
line- of-sight magnetograms to measure the photospheric flow velocity for three
newly emerging bipolar active regions. We separately calculate the magnetic
helicity injection rate of the leading and following polarities to confirm or
refute the magnetic helicity asymmetry, found by Tian & Alexander (2009) using
MDI/96m low spatial resolution magnetograms. Our results demonstrate that the
magnetic helicity asymmetry is robust being present in the three active regions
studied, two of which have an observed balance of the magnetic flux. The
magnetic helicity injection rate measured is found to depend little on the
window size selected, but does depend on the time interval used between the two
successive magnetograms tracked. It is found that the measurement of the
magnetic helicity injection rate performs well for a window size between 12x10
and 18x15 pixels, and at a time interval {\Delta}t=10 minutes. Moreover, the
short-lived magnetic structures, 10-60 minutes, are found to contribute 30-50%
of the magnetic helicity injection rate. Comparing with the results calculated
by MDI/96m data, we find that the MDI/96m data, in general, can outline the
main trend of the magnetic properties, but they significantly underestimate the
magnetic flux in strong field region and are not appropriate for quantitative
tracking studies, so provide a poor estimate of the amount of magnetic helicity
injected into the corona.
