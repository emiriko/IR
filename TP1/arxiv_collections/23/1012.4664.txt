We measure the magnetic susceptibility of a Fermi gas with tunable
interactions in the low-temperature limit and compare it to quantum Monte Carlo
calculations. Experiment and theory are in excellent agreement and fully
compatible with the Landau theory of Fermi liquids. We show that these measure-
ments shed new light on the nature of the excitations of the normal phase of a
strongly interacting Fermi gas.
