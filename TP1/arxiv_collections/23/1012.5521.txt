Both cosmology and astrophysics suggest the possible existence of sterile
neutrino which is a dark matter candidate. The interaction of sterile neutrinos
with matter in keV energy scale has been studied in the literature. In this
paper we study the interaction of sterile neutrinos with atoms and their role
on ionization of atoms in MeV and GeV energy scale. We also study the
interaction of sterile neutrinos with nuclei in the MeV and GeV energy scale.
We obtain the relevant cross sections for both these two interactions. Finally
we compare our results with the results of keV energy range.
