A review is given of the relation between pairing, quasi-spin algebras and
seniority. The former two concepts are closely connected, the relation being
that the quasi-spin formalism allows an efficient solution of the pairing
problem. Seniority is of much wider applicability than either pairing or
quasi-spin and applications can even be extended to encompass the notion of
partial symmetry. A recent application of partial conservation of seniority and
its importance for nuclear isomers is discussed.
