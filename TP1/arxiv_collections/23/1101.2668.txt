The dependence of the dynamics of open quantum systems upon initial
correlations between the system and environment is an utterly important yet
poorly understood subject. For technical convenience most prior studies assume
factorizable initial states where the system and its environments are
uncorrelated, but these conditions are not very realistic and give rise to
peculiar behaviors. One distinct feature is the rapid build up or a sudden jolt
of physical quantities immediately after the system is brought in contact with
its environments. The ultimate cause of this is an initial imbalance between
system-environment correlations and coupling. In this note we demonstrate
explicitly how to avoid these unphysical behaviors by proper adjustments of
correlations and/or the coupling, for setups of both theoretical and
experimental interest. We provide simple analytical results in terms of
quantities that appear in linear (as opposed to affine) master equations
derived for factorized initial states.
