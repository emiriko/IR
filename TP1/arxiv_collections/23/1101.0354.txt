We theoretically study the measurement-induced dephasing caused by back
action noise in quantum nondemolition measurements of a superconducting flux
qubit which is coupled to a superconducting quantum interference device
(SQUID). Our analytical results indicate that information on qubit flows from
qubit to detector, while quantum fluctuations which may cause dephasing of the
qubit also inject to qubit. Furthermore, the measurement probability is
frequency dependent in a short time scale and has a close relationship with the
measurement-induced dephasing. When the detuning between driven and bare
resonator equals coupling strength, we will access the state of qubit more
easily. In other words, we obtain the maximum measurement rate. Finally, we
analyzed mixed effect caused by coupling between non-diagonal term and external
variable. We found that the initial information of qubit is destroyed due to
quantum tunneling between the qubit states.
