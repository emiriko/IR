We report on the status of an ALPHA Collaboration project to extract
quantities for B physics phenomenology from Nf=2 lattice simulations. The
framework is Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) expanded up to the first order
of the inverse b-quark mass. The couplings of the effective theory are
determined by imposing matching conditions of observables computed in HQET with
their counterpart computed in QCD. That program, based on Nf=2 simulations in a
small physical volume with SF boundary conditions, is now almost finished. On
the other side the analysis of configurations selected from the CLS ensembles,
in order to measure HQET hadronic matrix elements, has just started recently so
that only results obtained at a single lattice spacing, a=0.07 fm, will be
discussed. We give our first results for the b-quark mass and for the B meson
decay constant.
