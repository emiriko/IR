We implemented a GPU based parallel code to perform Monte Carlo simulations
of the two dimensional q-state Potts model. The algorithm is based on a
checkerboard update scheme and assigns independent random numbers generators to
each thread. The implementation allows to simulate systems up to ~10^9 spins
with an average time per spin flip of 0.147ns on the fastest GPU card tested,
representing a speedup up to 155x, compared with an optimized serial code
running on a high-end CPU. The possibility of performing high speed simulations
at large enough system sizes allowed us to provide a positive numerical
evidence about the existence of metastability on very large systems based on
Binder's criterion, namely, on the existence or not of specific heat
singularities at spinodal temperatures different of the transition one.
