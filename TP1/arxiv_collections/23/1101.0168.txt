The time-dependent Schroedinger equation with time-independent Hamiltonian
matrix is a homogeneous linear oscillatory system in canonical form. We
investigate whether any classical system that itself is linear, homogeneous,
oscillatory and conservative is guaranteed to linearly map into a Schroedinger
equation. Such oscillatory classical systems can be analyzed into their normal
modes, which are mutually independent, uncoupled simple harmonic oscillators,
and the equation of motion of such a system linearly maps into a Schroedinger
equation whose Hamiltonian matrix is diagonal, with h times the individual
simple harmonic oscillator frequencies as its diagonal entries. Therefore if
the coupling-strength matrix of such an oscillatory system is presented in
symmetric, positive-definite form, the Hamiltonian matrix of the Schroedinger
equation it maps into is h times the square root of that coupling-strength
matrix. We obtain a general expression for mapping this type of oscillatory
classical equation of motion into a Schroedinger equation, and apply it to the
real-valued classical Klein-Gordon equation and the source-free Maxwell
equations, which results in relativistic Hamiltonian operators that are
strictly compatible with the correspondence principle. Once such an oscillatory
classical system has been mapped into a Schroedinger equation, it is
automatically in canonical form, making second quantization of that
Schroedinger equation a technically simple as well as a physically very
interpretable way to quantize the original classical system.
