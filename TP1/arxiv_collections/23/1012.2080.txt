Since photospheric bright points (BPs) were first observed, there has been a
question as to how are they structured. Are they just single flux tubes or a
bundle of the flux-tubes? Surface photometry of the quiet Sun (QS) has achieved
resolution close to 0.1" with the New Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar
Observatory. This resolution allowed us to detect a richer spectrum of BPs in
the QS. The smallest BPs we observed with TiO 705.68 nm were 0.13", and we were
able to resolve individual components in some of the BPs clusters and ribbons
observed in the QS, showing that they are composed of the individual BPs.
Average size of observed BPs was 0.22".
