We investigate a connection between generalized Fibonacci numbers and renewal
theory for stochastic processes. Using Blackwell's renewal theorem we find an
approximation to the generalized Fibonacci numbers. With the help of error
estimates in the renewal theorem we figure out an explicit representation.
