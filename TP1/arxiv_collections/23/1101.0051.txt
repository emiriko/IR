We present LDA band structure of novel hole doped high temperature
superconductors (Tc~30K) KxFe2Se2 and CsxFe2Se2 and compare it with previously
studied electronic structure of isostructural FeAs superconductor BaFe2As2
(Ba122). We show that stoichiometric KFe2Se2 and CsFe2Se2 have rather different
Fermi surfaces as compared with Ba122. However at about 60% of hole doping
Fermi surfaces of novel materials closely resemble those of Ba122. In between
these dopings we observe a number of topological Fermi surface transitions near
the G point in the Brillouin zone. Superconducting transition temperature Tc of
new systems is apparently governed by the value of the total density of states
(DOS) at the Fermi level.
