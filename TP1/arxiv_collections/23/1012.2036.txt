The phase diagram of one-dimensional earth-alkaline fermionic atoms and
ytterbium 171 atoms is investigated by means of a low-energy approach and
density-matrix renormalization group calculations. For incommensurate filling,
four gapless phases with a spin gap are found and consist of two
superconducting instabilities and two coexisting bond and charge density-waves
instabilities. In the half-filled case, seven Mott-insulating phases arise with
the emergence of four non-degenerate phases with exotic hidden orderings.
