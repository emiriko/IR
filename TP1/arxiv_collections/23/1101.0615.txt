We present results from a radial-velocity survey of 373 giant stars at Lick
Observatory, which started in 1999. The previously announced planets iota Dra b
and Pollux b are confirmed by continued monitoring. The frequency of detected
planetary companions appears to increase with metallicity. The star nu Oph is
orbited by two brown dwarf companions with masses of 22.3 M_Jup and 24.5 M_Jup
in orbits with a period ratio close to 6:1. It is likely that the two
companions to nu Oph formed in a disk around the star.
