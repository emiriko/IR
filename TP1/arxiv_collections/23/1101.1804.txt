A local magnetization measurement was performed with a Magnetic Force
Microscope (MFM) to determine magnetization in domains of an exchange coupled
[Co/Pt]/Co/Ru multilayer with predominant perpendicular anisotropy. The
quantitative MFM measurements were conducted with an iron filled carbon
nanotube tip, which is shown to behave like a monopole. As a result we
determined an additional in-plane magnetization component of the multilayer,
which is explained by estimating the effective permeability of the sample
within the \mu*-method.
