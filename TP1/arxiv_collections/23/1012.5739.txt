Outsourcing, the passing on of tasks by organizations to other organizations,
often including the personnel and means to perform these tasks, has become an
important IT-business strategy over the past decades.
  We investigate imaginative definitions for outsourcing relations and
outsourcing transformations. Abstract models of an extreme and unrealistic
simplicity are considered in order to investigate possible definitions of
outsourcing. Rather than covering all relevant practical cases an imaginative
definition of a concept provides obvious cases of its instantiation from which
more refined or liberal definitions may be derived.
  A definition of outsourcing induces to a complementary definition of
insourcing. Outsourcing and insourcing have more complex variations in which
multiple parties are involved. All of these terms both refer to state
transformations and to state descriptions pertaining to the state obtained
after such transformations. We make an attempt to disambiguate the terminology
in that respect and we make an attempt to characterize the general concept of
sourcing which captures some representative cases.
  Because mereology is the most general theory of parthood relations we coin
business mereology as the general theory in business studies which concerns the
full variety of sourcing relations and transformations.
