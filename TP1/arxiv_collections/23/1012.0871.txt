We report the first direct photon velocity measurements for extragalactic
objects. A fiber-optic, photon time-of-flight instrument, optimized for
relatively dim sources ($m 12$), is used to measure the velocity of visible
photons emanating from galaxies and quasars. Lightspeed is found to be
$3.00\pm0.03\times10^{8} \mathrm{m s}^{-1}$, and is invariant, within
experimental error, over the range of redshifts measured ($0\leq z\leq1.33$).
This measurement provides additional validation of Einstein's theory of General
Relativity (GR) and is consistent with the
Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metricl, as well as several
alternative cosmological models, notably the hyperbolic anti-de Sitter metric,
though not with the pseudo-Euclidean de Sitter metric.
