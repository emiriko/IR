The method based on microscopic theory of nuclear reactions has been applied
for the analysis of parity violating effects in a few-body systems. Different
parity violating and parity conserving asymmetries and their dependence on
neutron energy have been estimated for $n + ^3He \rightarrow ^3H + p$ reaction.
The estimated effects are in a good agreement with available exact
calculations.
