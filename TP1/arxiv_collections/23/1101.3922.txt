We consider the distribution of a graph invariant of central similarity
proximity catch digraphs (PCDs) based on one dimensional data. The central
similarity PCDs are also a special type of parameterized random digraph family
defined with two parameters, a centrality parameter and an expansion parameter,
and for one dimensional data, central similarity PCDs can also be viewed as a
type of interval catch digraphs. The graph invariant we consider is the
relative density of central similarity PCDs. We prove that relative density of
central similarity PCDs is a U-statistic and obtain the asymptotic normality
under mild regularity conditions using the central limit theory of
U-statistics. For one dimensional uniform data, we provide the asymptotic
distribution of the relative density of the central similarity PCDs for the
entire ranges of centrality and expansion parameters. Consequently, we
determine the optimal parameter values at which the rate of convergence (to
normality) is fastest. We also provide the connection with class cover catch
digraphs and the extension of central similarity PCDs to higher dimensions.
