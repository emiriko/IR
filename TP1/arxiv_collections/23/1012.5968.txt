This paper presents a quantitative assessment of the performance of the
upcoming LISA Pathfinder geodesic explorer mission. The findings are based on
the results of extensive ground testing and simulation campaigns using flight
hardware and flight control and operations algorithms. The results show that,
for the central experiment of measuring the stray differential acceleration
between the LISA test masses, LISA Pathfinder will be able to verify the
overall acceleration noise to within a factor two of the LISA requirement at 1
mHz and within a factor 6 at 0.1 mHz. We also discuss the key elements of the
physical model of disturbances, coming from LISA Pathfinder and ground
measurement, that will guarantee the LISA performance.
