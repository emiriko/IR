The Kondo effect, one of the oldest correlation phenomena known in condensed
matter physics, has regained attention due to scanning tunneling spectroscopy
(STS) experiments performed on single magnetic impurities. Despite the
sub-nanometer resolution capability of local probe techniques one of the
fundamental aspects of Kondo physics, its spatial extension, is still subject
to discussion. Up to now all STS studies on single adsorbed atoms have shown
that observable Kondo features rapidly vanish with increasing distance from the
impurity. Here we report on a hitherto unobserved long range Kondo signature
for single magnetic atoms of Fe and Co buried under a Cu(100) surface. We
present a theoretical interpretation of the measured signatures using a
combined approach of band structure and many-body numerical renormalization
group (NRG) calculations. These are in excellent agreement with the rich
spatially and spectroscopically resolved experimental data.
