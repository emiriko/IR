Metamaterial homogenization is often based on implicit assumptions inspired
to natural material models. Retrieved effective permittivity and permeability,
however, are often non-physical, especially near the array resonances, of most
interest for metamaterial applications. We explain here the nature of typical
homogenization artifacts, relating them to an inherent form of magneto-electric
coupling associated with the finite phase velocity along metamaterial arrays.
Our findings allow restoring the proper definition and physical meaning of
local constitutive parameters for metamaterials.
