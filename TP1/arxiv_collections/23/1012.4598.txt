Spatial distribution of the longitudinal field component of a circularly
polarized optical beam depends on the polarization handedness, which causes the
lateral shift of the beam "center of gravity" when its polarization toggles. We
present the generalized theory of this effect, which demonstrates its relation
with the angular irradiance moments of the beam. The theory is applicable to
arbitrary paraxial beams and shows that the lateral shift is the same for all
cross sections of the beam.
