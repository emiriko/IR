We discuss the possible interpretation of X(3872) as a $DD^{\ast}$ hadronic
molecule with $J^{PC} = 2^{-+}$. Using the phenomenological Lagrangian
approach, we studied its radiative and strong decay properties. We find that
our model with about 97.6% isospin zero component explains the existing data
nicely. We predict the partial widths of the radiative and strong decays of
X(3872) and show that the measurement of the ratio $\mathcal{B}(X(3872) \to
\chi_{c0}\pi^0)/\mathcal{B}(X(3872) \to \chi_{c1}\pi^0)$ may signal the nature
of X(3872).
