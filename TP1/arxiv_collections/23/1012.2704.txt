We examine the implementation of an arbitrary U(4) gate consisting of CNOT
gates and single qubit unitary gates for the Hilbert space of photon spin
polarization and two states of photon orbital angular momentum. Our scheme
improves over a recently proposed one that uses q-plates because the fidelity
is limited only by losses thus in principle it could be used to achieve a
perfect transformation.
