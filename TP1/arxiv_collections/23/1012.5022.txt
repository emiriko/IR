Evaluation of pfaffians arises in a number of physics applications, and for
some of them a direct method is preferable to using the determinantal formula.
We discuss two methods for the numerical evaluation of pfaffians. The first is
tridiagonalization based on Householder transformations. The main advantage of
this method is its numerical stability that makes unnecessary the
implementation of a pivoting strategy. The second method considered is based on
Aitken's block diagonalization formula. It yields to a kind of LU (similar to
Cholesky's factorization) decomposition (under congruence) of arbitrary
skew-symmetric matrices that is well suited both for the numeric and symbolic
evaluations of the pfaffian. Fortran subroutines (FORTRAN 77 and 90)
implementing both methods are given. We also provide simple implementations in
Python and Mathematica for purpose of testing, or for exploratory studies of
methods that make use of pfaffians.
