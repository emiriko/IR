The discovery of superconductivity of about 30 K in iron selenides with very
large magnetic moments simulates the examination of completing orders. Here we
report a finding of pressure- induced suppression of the superconducting
transition temperature Tc and enhancement of the temperature of the resistance
hump TH through charge transfer between two iron sites with different
occupancies. The activation energy for the electric transport of the
high-temperature resistance is observed to go to zero at a critical pressure of
8.7 GPa, at which superconductivity tends to disappear and the
semiconductor-to-metal transition takes place. Beyond the critical point, the
resistance exhibits a metallic behavior over the whole temperature range
studied. All these features indicate the existence of quantum criticality in
iron-selenide superconductors.
