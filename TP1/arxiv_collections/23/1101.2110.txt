We study the connection, at the quantum level, between d=2+1 dimensional
self-dual models with actions of growing (from first to fourth) order,
governing the dynamics of helicity +2 (or -2) massive excitations. We obtain
identities between generating functionals of the different models using the
path-integral framework, this allowing to establish dual maps among relevant
vacuum expectation values. We check consistency of these v.e.v.'s with the
gauge invariance gained in each mapping.
