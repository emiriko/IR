We present high-speed photometry covering one eclipse of the cataclysmic
variable system 1RXS J180834.7+101041. The data are modelled as arising from a
close binary system containing a low-mass stars filling its Roche lobe plus a
white dwarf with an accretion disc. We find an orbital inclination of 77.07 +/-
0.47 degrees and a mass ratio of 0.168 +/- 0.016. The relatively low
inclination means that only the accretion disc and not the white dwarf are
eclipsed by the low-mass star in this system.
