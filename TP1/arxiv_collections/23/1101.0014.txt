Ising model with quenched random magnetic fields is examined for single
Gaussian, bimodal and double Gaussian random field distributions by introducing
an effective field approximation that takes into account the correlations
between different spins that emerge when expanding the identities. Random field
distribution shape dependence of the phase diagrams, magnetization and internal
energy is investigated for a honeycomb lattice with a coordination number q=3.
The conditions for the occurrence of reentrant behavior and tricritical points
on the system are also discussed in detail.
