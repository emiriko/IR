We investigate the prospects for the discovery of massive hyper-gluons using
data from the early runs of the CERN Large Hadron Collider with $\sqrt{s} = 7$
TeV and assuming an integrated luminosity of 1 fb$^{-1}$. A phenomenological
Lagrangian is adopted to evaluate the cross section of a pair of colored vector
bosons (coloron, $\tilde{\rho}$) decaying into four colored scalar resonances
(hyper-pion, $\tilde{\pi}$), which then decay into eight gluons. We include the
dominant physics background from the production of $8g$, $7g1q$, $6g2q$, and
$5g3q$. We find an abundance of signal events and that realistic cuts reduce
the background enough to establish a $5\sigma$ signal for $m_{\tilde{\pi}} \alt
220$ GeV or $m_{\tilde{\rho}} \alt 733$ GeV.
