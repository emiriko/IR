The lack of FeVII lines in PG1159 stars had led to the conclusion that in
some objects iron must be strongly depleted. We have now detected FeX lines in
FUSE spectra of the very hottest PG1159 stars Teff=150,000 - 200,000 K;
RXJ2117.1+3412, K1-16, NGC 246, Longmore 4). Surprisingly, we derive a solar
iron abundance. It is conspicuous that they are among the most massive PG1159
stars (0.71-0.82 Msun), in contrast to those objects for which strongest
Fe-deficiency was claimed (0.53-0.56 Msun). Based on new FeVIII line
identifications in SOHO/SUMER UV spectra of the Sun, we were able to detect
these lines in FUSE spectra of several "cooler" (Teff<150,000 K) objects, among
them is the prototype PG1159-035. An abundance analysis is in progress.
