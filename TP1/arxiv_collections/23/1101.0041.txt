The catalytic conversion of ATP and AMP to ADP by adenylate kinase (ADK)
involves large amplitude, ligand induced domain motions, involving the opening
and the closing of LID and NMP domains, during the repeated catalytic cycle. We
discover and analyze an interesting dynamical coupling between the motions of
the two domains during the opening, using large scale atomistic molecular
dynamics trajectory analysis, covariance analysis and multi-dimensional free
energy calculations with explicit water. Initially, the LID domain must open by
a certain amount before the NMP domain can begin to open. Dynamical correlation
map shows interesting cross-peak between LID and NMP domain which suggests the
presence of correlated motion between them. This is also reflected in our
calculated two dimensional free energy surface contour diagram which has an
interesting elliptic shape, revealing a strong correlation between the opening
of the LID domain and that of the NMP domain. Our free energy surface of the
LID domain motion is rugged due to interaction with water and the signature of
ruggedness is evident in the observed RMSD variation and its fluctuation time
correlation functions. We develop a correlated dynamical disorder type
theoretical model to explain the observed dynamic coupling between the motions
of the two domains in ADK. Our model correctly reproduces several features of
the cross-correlation observed in simulations.
