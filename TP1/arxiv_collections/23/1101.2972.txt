Electron fully spin-polarized edge states in graphene emerged at the
interfaces of a nonuniform magnetic field are studied numerically in a
tight-binding model, with both the orbital and Zeeman-splitting effects of
magnetic field considered. We show that the fully spin-polarized currents can
be manipulated by a gate voltage. In order to make use of the fully
spin-polarized currents in the spin related transport, a three-terminal
experiment is designed and expected to export the fully spin-polarized
currents. This may have important applications in spin based nanodevices.
