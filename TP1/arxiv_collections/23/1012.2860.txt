In this paper we report on our re-engineering effort to refactor and unify
two somewhat disjoint Java distributed middleware technologies -- Jini and JMS
-- used in the implementation of the Demand Migration System (DMS). In doing
so, we refactor their parent Demand Migration Framework (DMF), within the
General Intensional Programming System (GIPSY). The complex Java-based GIPSY
project is used to investigate on the intensional and hybrid programming
paradigms.
