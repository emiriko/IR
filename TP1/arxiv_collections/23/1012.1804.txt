Recent progress in full jet reconstruction in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC
makes it a promising tool for the quantitative study of the QCD at high energy
density. Measurements in d+Au collisions are important to disentangle initial
state nuclear effects from medium-induced k_T broadening and jet quenching.
Furthermore, comparison to measurements in p+p gives access to cold nuclear
matter effects. Inclusive jet p_T spectra and di-jet correlations (k_T) in 200
GeV p+p and d+Au collisions from the 2007-2008 RHIC run are presented.
