The relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations for the anisotropic
magnetoactive plasma are obtained and accurately integrated in the plane
gravitational wave metrics. The dependence of the induction mechanism of the
gravimagnetic shock waves on the degree of the magnetoactive plasma anisotropy
is analyzed.
