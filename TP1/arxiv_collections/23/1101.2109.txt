We discuss the dynamic behavior of a tagged particle close to a classical
localization transition in the framework of the mode-coupling theory of the
glass transition. Asymptotic results are derived for the order parameter as
well as the dynamic correlation functions and the mean-squared displacement
close to the transition. The influence of an infrared cutoff is discussed.
