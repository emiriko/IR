We study the mean field equation of motion for driven domain walls in random
media. We discuss the two cases of an external constant as well as an
oscillating driving force. Our main focus lies on the critical dynamics close
to the depinning transition, which we study by analytical and numerical
methods. We find power-law scaling for the velocity as well as the hysteresis
loop area.
