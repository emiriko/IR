Entanglement is nowadays considered as a key quantity for the understanding
of correlations, transport properties, and phase transitions in composite
quantum systems, and thus receives interest beyond the engineered applications
in the focus of quantum information science. We review recent experimental and
theoretical progress in the study of quantum correlations under that wider
perspective, with an emphasis on rigorous definitions of the entanglement of
identical particles, and on entanglement studies in atoms and molecules.
