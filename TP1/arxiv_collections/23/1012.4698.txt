Various aspects of Morita theory of deformed algebras and in particular of
star product algebras on general Poisson manifolds are discussed. We relate the
three flavours ring-theoretic Morita equivalence, $^*$-Morita equivalence, and
strong Morita equivalence and exemplify their properties for star product
algebras. The complete classification of Morita equivalent star products on
general Poisson manifolds is discussed as well as the complete classification
of covariantly Morita equivalent star products on a symplectic manifold with
respect to some Lie algebra action preserving a connection.
