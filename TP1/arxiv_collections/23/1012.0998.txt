An extended XMM-Newton observation of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 has
revealed a rich absorption line spectrum indicating the presence of a
photoionized outflow with a wide range of velocities and ionization parameter.
At low continuum fluxes an emission line spectrum is well defined with both
narrow and broad components of several abundant metal ions. The absorption line
velocity structure and a broad correlation of velocity and ionization parameter
are consistent with an outflow scenario where a highly ionized, high velocity
wind, perhaps launched during intermittent super-Eddington accretion, runs into
the interstellar medium or previous ejecta, losing much of its kinetic energy
in the resultant strong shock. We explore the possibility that a quasi-constant
soft X-ray emission component may be evidence of this post-shock cooling. This
revised view of AGN outflows is consistent with multiple minor Eddington
accretion episodes creating a momentum-driven feedback linking black hole and
host galaxy growth.
