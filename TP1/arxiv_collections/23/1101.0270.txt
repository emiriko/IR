In this paper, by way of three examples - a fourth order low pass active RC
filter, a rudimentary BJT amplifier, and an LC ladder - we show, how the
algebraic capabilities of modern computer algebra systems can, or in the last
example, might be brought to use in the task of designing analog circuits.
