The scaling properties of the free energy, the diamagnetic moment, and the
diamagnetic susceptibility above the phase transition from the ferromagnetic
phase to the phase of coexistence of ferromagnetic order and superconductivity
in unconventional ferromagnetic superconductors with spin-triplet (p-wave)
electron paring are considered. The crossover from weak to strong magnetic
induction is described for both quasi-2D (thin films) and 3D (bulk)
superconductors. The singularities of diamagnetic moment and diamagnetic
susceptibility are dumped for large variations of the pressure and, hence, such
singularities could hardly be observed in experiments. The results are obtained
within Gaussian approximation on the basis of general theory of ferromagnetic
superconductors with p-wave electron pairing.
