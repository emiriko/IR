High-frequency ESR results on the S=1/2 Heisenberg hexagonal antiferromagnet
InCu2/3V1/3O3 are reported. This compound appears to be a rare model substance
for the honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet with very weak interlayer couplings.
The high-temperature magnetic susceptibility can be interpreted by the S=1/2
honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet, and it shows a magnetic-order-like anomaly
at TN=38 K. Although, the resonance field of our high-frequency ESR shows the
typical behavior of the antiferromagnetic resonance, the linewidth of our
high-frequency ESR continues to increase below TN, while it tends to decrease
as the temperature in a conventional three-dimensional antiferromagnet
decreases. In general, a honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet is expected to show
a simple antiferromagnetic order similar to that of a square lattice
antiferromagnet theoretically because both antiferromagnets are bipartite
lattices. However, we suggest that the observed anomalous spin dynamics below
TN is the peculiar feature of the honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet that is not
observed in the square lattice antiferromagnet.
