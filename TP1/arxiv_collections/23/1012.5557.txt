In this work we discuss if fermionic sources could be responsible for
accelerated periods in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spatially flat universe,
including a usual self-interaction potential of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type
together with a fermion-scalar interaction potential of the Yukawa type. The
results show that the combination of these potentials could promote an
initially accelerated period, going through a middle decelerated era, with a
final eternal accelerated period, where the self-interaction contribution
dominates.
