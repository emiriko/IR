Experimental observations recently reported in Nature are in accord with the
concept that spin orientation is a permanent feature of the spin carrier. It
follows that magnetization is realized by rearrangement of the crystal
structure. The rearrangement occurs by the general contact
nucleation-and-growth mechanism.
