In this paper we analyze high time resolution single pulse data of PSR
B0809+74 at 820 MHz. We compare the subpulse phase behavior, undocumented at
820 MHz, with previously published results. The subpulse period changes over
time and we measure a subpulse phase jump, when visible, that ranges from 95 to
147 degrees. We find a correlation between the subpulse modulation, subpulse
phase, and orthogonal polarization modes. This variety of complicated behavior
is not well understood and is not easily explained within the framework of
existing models, most of which are founded on the drifting spark model of
Ruderman & Sutherland (1975). We quantitatively fit our data with a non-radial
oscillation model (Clemens & Rosen 2008) and show that the model can accurately
reproduce the drifting subpulses, orthogonal polarization modes, subpulse phase
jump, and can explain the correlation between all these features.
