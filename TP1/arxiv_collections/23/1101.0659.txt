The results of our investigation of ion implantation of PLGA show that the
PLGA films undergo crosslinking, carbonization and etching. The PLGA coating
degrades in water by a hydrolysis reaction. The dewetting of PLGA coating under
water is observed on silicon wafer, metal and carbon surfaces. As the result,
the coating is ruptured up to separate drops of PLGA on the surface. The
dewetting process can be eliminated by an ion beam implantation treatment, when
the ions penetrate through the whole PLGA coating. The dewetting process in the
modified layer can be eliminated even with low fluence (10^14 ions/cm2)
modification. The amount of degradable PLGA in the modified layer depends on
the fluence of ion implantation and can equal up to 80% of the film at low
fluence of 10^14 ions/cm2.
