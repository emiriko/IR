Rigorous estimates for the total - (kinetic) energy plus pressure - flux in
R^3 are obtained from the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. The bounds
are used to establish a condition - involving Taylor length scale and the size
of the domain - sufficient for existence of the inertial range and the energy
cascade in decaying turbulence (zero driving force, non-increasing global
energy). Several manifestations of the locality of the flux under this
condition are obtained. All the scales involved are actual physical scales in
R^3 and no regularity or homogeneity/scaling assumptions are made.
