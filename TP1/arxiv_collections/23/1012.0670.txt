We examine the optical conductivity in antiferromagnetic (AFM) iron pnictides
by mean-field calculation in a five-band Hubbard model. The calculated spectra
are well consistent with the in-plane anisotropy observed in the measurements,
where the optical conductivity along the direction with the AFM alignment of
neighboring spins is larger than that along the ferromagnetic (FM) direction in
the low-energy region; however, that along the FM direction becomes larger in
the higher-energy region. The difference between the two directions is
explained by taking account of orbital characters in both occupied and
unoccupied states as well as of the nature of Dirac-type linear dispersions
near the Fermi level.
