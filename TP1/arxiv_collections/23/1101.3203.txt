Different physical phenomena are discussed which should help to comprehend
and interpret the concept of localized superconductive pairs; these include
behavior of highly resistive granular materials with superconducting grains,
parity effect and the Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless transition.
Experimental arguments in support of localized pairs existence are presented
and conditions which promote their appearance are analyzed.
