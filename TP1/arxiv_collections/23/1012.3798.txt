We calculate the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to the $J/\psi
+W$ production at the LHC, and provide the theoretical distribution of the
$J/\psi$ transverse momentum. Our results show that the differential cross
section $\frac{d\sigma}{dp_T^{J/\psi}}$ at the LO is significantly enhanced by
the NLO QCD corrections. We believe that the comparison between the theoretical
predictions for the $J/\psi+W$ production and the experimental data at the LHC
can provide a verification for the colour-octet mechanism of non-relativistic
QCD in the description of the processes involving heavy quarkonium.
