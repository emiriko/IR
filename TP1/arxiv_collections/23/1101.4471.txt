Differential cross section of processes with high energy $p(\bar p)p$
collisions in frames of QED: creation of scalar, pseudoscalar and lepton pair -
are considered in Weizs\"acker - Williams approximation. In frames of QCD
processes with conversion of initial proton (antiproton) to fermionic jets
accompanied with one gluon jet as well as the state of two gluons and
quark-antiquark pair (with out rapidity gap) are considered in frames of
effective Reggion action of theory of Lipatov. Process of creation of a Higgs
boson accompanied with two fermionic jets is considered. The azimuthal
correlation in process of two gluon jet separated by rapidity gap is
investigated. Effects of gluon reggeization are taken into account. Some
distributions are illustrated by numerical calculations.
