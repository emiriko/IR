Fe K-edge and Se K-edge x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES)
measurements are used to study FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ electronic structure of
chalcogenides. An intense Fe K-edge pre-edge peak due to Fe 1s$\to$3d (and
admixed Se/Te $p$ states) is observed, showing substantial change with the Te
substitution and X-ray polarization. The main white line peak in the Se K-edge
XANES due to Se 1s $\to$ 4p transition appear similar to the one expected for
Se$^{2-}$ systems and changes with the Te substitution. Polarization dependence
reveals that unoccupied Se orbitals near the Fermi level have predominant
$p_{x,y}$ character. The results provide key information on the hybridization
of Fe $3d$ and chalcogen $p$ states in the Fe-based chalcogenide
superconductors.
