We investigate with a microscopic model anharmonic K-cation oscillation
observed by neutron experiments in beta-pyrochlore superconductor KOs2O6, which
also shows a mysterious first-order structural transition at Tp=7.5 K. We have
identified a set of microscopic model parameters that successfully reproduce
the observed temperature dependence and the superconducting transition
temperature. Considering changes in the parameters at Tp, we can explain
puzzling experimental results about electron-phonon coupling and neutron data.
Our analysis demonstrates that the first-order transition is multipolar
transition driven by the octupolar component of K-cation oscillations. The
octupole moment does not change the symmetry and is characteristic to
noncentrosymmetric K-cation potential.
