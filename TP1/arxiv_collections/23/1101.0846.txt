The Hong-Ou-Mandel interference dip is caused by an entangled state, a
delocalized bi-photon state. We propose a method of detecting this entanglement
by utilizing inverse Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, while taking into account
vacuum and multi-photon contaminations, phase noise, and other imperfections.
The method uses just linear optics and photodetectors, and for single-mode
photodetectors we find a lower bound on the amount of entanglement.
