We discuss how the angular distribution of lepton pairs from decays of vector
mesons depends on the choice of reference frame, and provide a geometrical
description of the transformations of the coefficients of the angular
distribution. Invariant expressions involving all coefficients are discussed,
together with bounds and consistency relations.
