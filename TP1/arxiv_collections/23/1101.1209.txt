Based on phase-space structures of quantum states, we propose a novel measure
to quantify macroscopic quantum superpositions. Our measure simultaneously
quantifies two different kinds of essential information for a given quantum
state in a harmonious manner: the degree of quantum coherence and the effective
size of the physical system that involves the superposition. It enjoys
remarkably good analytical and algebraic properties. It turns out to be the
most general and inclusive measure ever proposed that it can be applied to any
types of multipartite states and mixed states represented in phase space.
