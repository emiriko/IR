We have realized real-time steering of the directed transport in a Brownian
motor based on cold atoms in optical lattices, and demonstrate drifts along
pre-designed paths. The transport is induced by spatiotemporal asymmetries in
the system, where we can control the spatial part, and we show that the
response to changes in asymmetry is very fast. In addition to the directional
steering, a real-time control of the magnitude of the average drift velocity
and an on/off switching of the motor are also demonstrated. We use a
non-invasive real-time detection of the transport, enabling a feedback control
of the system.
