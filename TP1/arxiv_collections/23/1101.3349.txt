Self-annihilating or decaying dark matter in the Galactic halo might produce
high energy neutrinos detectable with neutrino telescopes. We have conducted a
search for such a signal using 276 days of data from the IceCube 22-string
configuration detector acquired during 2007 and 2008. The effect of halo model
choice in the extracted limit is reduced by performing a search that considers
the outer halo region and not the Galactic Center. We constrain any large scale
neutrino anisotropy and are able to set a limit on the dark matter
self-annihilation cross section of <\sigma_{A}v> \simeq 10^{-22} cm^3/s for
WIMP masses above 1 TeV, assuming a monochromatic neutrino line spectrum.
