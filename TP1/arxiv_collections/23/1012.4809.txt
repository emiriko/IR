We consider patterns generated by adding large number of sand grains at a
single site in an abelian sandpile model with a periodic initial configuration,
and relaxing. The patterns show proportionate growth. We study the robustness
of these patterns against different types of noise, \textit{viz.}, randomness
in the point of addition, disorder in the initial periodic configuration, and
disorder in the connectivity of the underlying lattice. We find that the
patterns show a varying degree of robustness to addition of a small amount of
noise in each case. However, introducing stochasticity in the toppling rules
seems to destroy the asymptotic patterns completely, even for a weak noise. We
also discuss a variational formulation of the pattern selection problem in
growing abelian sandpiles.
