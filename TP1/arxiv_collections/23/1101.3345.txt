We present multi-satellite observations indicating a strong correlation
between large amplitude radiation belt whistler-mode waves and relativistic
electron precipitation. On separate occasions during the Wind petal orbits and
STEREO phasing orbits, Wind and STEREO recorded intense whistler-mode waves in
the outer nightside equatorial radiation belt with peak-to-peak amplitudes
exceeding 300 mV/m. During these intervals of intense wave activity, SAMPEX
recorded relativistic electron microbursts in near magnetic conjunction with
Wind and STEREO. The microburst precipitation exhibits a bursty temporal
structure similar to that of the observed large amplitude wave packets,
suggesting a connection between the two phenomena. Simulation studies
corroborate this idea, showing that nonlinear wave--particle interactions may
result in rapid energization and scattering on timescales comparable to those
of the impulsive relativistic electron precipitation.
