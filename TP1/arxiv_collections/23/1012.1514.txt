Within the framework of generalized factorization of higher-twist
contributions, including modification to splitting functions of both quark and
gluon, we get and numerically resolve the medium-modified DGLAP (mDGLAP)
evolution equations. With Woods-Saxon nuclear geometry and Hirano 3D ideal
hydrodynamic simulations of hot medium, we study the medium modified
fragmentation functions (mFF) in DIS and Au+Au collisions in RHIC. Our
calculation imply that the parton density in hot medium produced in RHIC is
about 30 times larger than cold nucleon.
