In this paper, we study the vanishing viscosity limit for a coupled
Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn system in a bounded domain. We first show the local
existence of smooth solutions of the Euler/Allen-Cahn equations by modified
Galerkin method. Then using the boundary layer function to deal with the
mismatch of the boundary conditions between Navier-Stokes and Euler equations,
and assuming that the energy dissipation for Navier-Stokes equation in the
boundary layer goes to zero as the viscosity tends to zero, we prove that the
solutions of the Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn system converge to that of the
Euler/Allen-Cahn system in a proper small time interval. In addition, for
strong solutions of the Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn system in 2D, the convergence
rate is c\nu^{1/2}.
