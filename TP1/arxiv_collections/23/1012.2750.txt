Neutrino Deep Inelastic Scattering on nuclei is an essential process to
constrain the strange quark parton distribution functions in the proton. The
critical component on the way to using the neutrino DIS data in a proton PDF
analysis is understanding the nuclear effects in parton distribution functions.
We parametrize these effects by nuclear parton distribution functions. Here we
compare results from two analysis of NPDF both done at next-to-leading order in
QCD. The first uses neutral current charged-lepton lA Deeply Inelastic
Scattering and Drell-Yan data for several nuclear targets and the second uses
neutrino-nucleon DIS data. We compare the nuclear corrections factors
F_2^Fe/F_2^D for the charged-lepton data with other results from the
literature. In particular, we compare and contrast fits based upon the
charged-lepton DIS data with those using neutrino-nucleon DIS data.
