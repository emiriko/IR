In the littlest Higgs model with T-parity, the new interactions between the
mirror leptons and the Standard Model leptons can induce some lepton flavor
violation (LFV) processes at loop level. We study the possibility of the ILC to
probe the LFV production processes $e^+e^-(\gamma\gamma)\rightarrow
l_{i}\bar{l}_{j}$. Our results show that the rates of $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow
l_{i}\bar{l}_{j}$ can reach 1 fb in optimal cases after reasonable kinematical
cuts, which implies that these processes may be observed at the ILC.
