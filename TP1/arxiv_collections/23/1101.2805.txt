The temperature dependence of phonon excitations and the presence of spin
phonon coupling in polycrystalline Pr2NiMnO6 samples were studied using
micro-Raman spectroscopy and magnetometry. Magnetic properties show a single
ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic transition at 228 K and a saturation
magnetization close to 4.95 \muB/f.u.. Three distinct Raman modes at 657, 642,
and 511 cm-1 are observed. The phonon excitations show a clear hardening due to
anharmonicity from 300 K down to 10 K. Further, temperature dependence of the
657 cm-1 mode shows only a small softening. This reflects the presence of a
relatively weak spin-phonon coupling in Pr2NiMnO6 contrary to other double
perovskites previously studied.
