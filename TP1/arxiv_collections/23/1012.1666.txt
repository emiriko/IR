SPARQL query composition is difficult for the lay-person or even the
experienced bioinformatician in cases where the data model is unfamiliar.
Established best-practices and internationalization concerns dictate that
semantic web ontologies should use terms with opaque identifiers, further
complicating the task. We present SPARQL Assist: a web application that
addresses these issues by providing context-sensitive type-ahead completion to
existing web forms. Ontological terms are suggested using their labels and
descriptions, leveraging existing XML support for internationalization and
language-neutrality.
