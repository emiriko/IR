On the space of bounded analytic functions and the Bloch space on the unit
disk, we study the compact intertwining relations for composition operators,
whose intertwining operators are Volterra type operators. Further, we consider
the compact intertwining relations, which are between the whole collection of
composition operators and some Volterra operator, and the whole collection of
bounded Volterra operators and some composition operator.
