We place limits on the population of non-recycled pulsars originating in
globular clusters through Monte Carlo simulations and frequentist statistical
techniques. We set upper limits on the birth rates of non-recycled cluster
pulsars and predict how many may remain in the clusters, and how many may
escape the cluster potentials and enter the field of the Galaxy.
