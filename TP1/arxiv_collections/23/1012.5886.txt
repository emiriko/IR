Context. The nearby multiple system delta Velorum contains a widely detached
eclipsing binary and a third component.
  Aims. We take advantage of this system offering the opportunity to determine
the set of fundamental parameters (masses, luminosities, and radii) of three
coeval stars with sufficient precision to test models of stellar evolution.
  Methods. Extensive high-resolution spectroscopy is analyzed by the broadening
function technique to provide the first spectroscopic orbit of the eclipsing
pair. Simultaneous analysis of the spectroscopic data and the SMEI satellite
light curve is performed to provide astrophysical parameters for the
components. We use a modified Roche model assuming an eccentric orbit and
asynchronous rotation.
  Results. The observations show that components of the eclipsing pair rotate
at about two-thirds of the break-up velocity, which excludes any chemical
peculiarity and results in a non-uniform surface brightness. Although the inner
orbit is eccentric, no apsidal motion is seen during the SMEI photometric
observations. For the inner orbit, the orbital parameters are eccentricity e =
0.29, longitude of the periastron passage omega = 109 degrees, and inclination
89.0 degrees.
  Conclusions. Component's masses MAa = 2.53+/-0.11 Msun, MAb = 2.37+/-0.10
Msun and MB = 1.5 Msun combined with inferred radii of Aa and Ab components
indicate that the eclipsing pair has already left the Main sequence and the
estimated age of the system is about 400 Myr.
