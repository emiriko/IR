In an effort to simplify the complexity in the studies of consciousness, the
author suggests to divide the conscious experiences into a fundamental state,
the intrinsic awareness (IA), and functions of this fundamental state. IA does
not depend on external environment, our sense organs, and our cognitions. This
ground state of consciousness is timeless and irreducible to sub-constituents;
therefore reductionism can apply neither to the analysis nor to the new theory
of IA. The methodology for investigating IA is proposed and the relation
between IA and the hard problem in consciousness proposed by Chalmers is
discussed.
