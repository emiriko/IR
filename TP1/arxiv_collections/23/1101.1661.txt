We study the collapse transition of the lattice homopolymer on a square
lattice by calculating the exact partition function zeros. The exact partition
function is obtained by enumerating the number of possible conformations for
each energy value, and the exact distributions of the partition function zeros
are found in the complex temperature plane by solving a polynomial equation. We
observe that the locus of zeros closes in on the positive real axis as the
chain length increases, providing the evidence for the onset of the collapse
transition. By analyzing the scaling behavior of the first zero with the
polymer length, we estimate the transition temperature and the crossover
exponent.
