Our main aim in this paper is to promote the coframe variational method as a
unified approach to derive field equations for any given gravitational action
containing the algebraic functions of the scalars constructed from the Riemann
curvature tensor and its contractions. We are able to derive a master equation
which expresses the variational derivatives of the generalized gravitational
actions in terms of the variational derivatives of its constituent curvature
scalars. Using the Lagrange multiplier method relative to an orthonormal
coframe, we investigate the variational procedures for modified gravitational
Lagrangian densities in spacetime dimensions $n\geqslant 3$. We study
well-known gravitational actions such as those involving the Gauss-Bonnet and
Ricci-squared, Kretchmann scalar, Weyl-squared terms and their algebraic
generalizations similar to generic $f(R)$ theories and the algebraic
generalization of sixth order gravitational Lagrangians. We put forth a new
model involving the gravitational Chern-Simons term and also give three
dimensional New massive gravity equations in a new form in terms of the Cotton
2-form.
