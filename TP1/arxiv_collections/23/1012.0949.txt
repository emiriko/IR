Generalized quantum measurements are an important extension of projective or
von Neumann measurements, in that they can be used to describe any measurement
that can be implemented on a quantum system. We describe how to realize two
non-standard quantum measurements using cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED).
The first measurement optimally and unabmiguously distinguishes between two
non-orthogonal quantum states. The second example is a measurement that
demonstrates superadditive quantum coding gain. The experimental tools used are
single-atom unitary operations effected by Ramsey pulses and two-atom
Tavis-Cummings interactions. We show how the superadditive quantum coding gain
is affected by errors in the field-ionisation detection of atoms, and that even
with rather high levels of experimental imperfections, a reasonable amount of
superadditivity can still be seen. To date, these types of measurement have
only been realized on photons. It would be of great interest to have
realizations using other physical systems. This is for fundamental reasons, but
also since quantum coding gain in general increases with code word length, and
a realization using atoms could be more easily scaled than existing
realizations using photons.
