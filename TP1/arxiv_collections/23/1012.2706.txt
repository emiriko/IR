In this paper we investigate electromagnetic interactions for simplest
massive mixed symmetry field. Using frame-like gauge invariant formulation we
extend Fradkin-Vasiliev procedure, initially proposed for investigation of
gravitational interactions for massless particles in AdS space, to the case of
electromagnetic interactions for massive particles leaving in (A)dS space with
arbitrary value of cosmological constant including flat Minkowski space. At
first, as an illustration of general procedure, we re-derive our previous
results on massive spin 2 electromagnetic interactions and then we apply this
procedure to massive mixed symmetry field. These two cases are just the
simplest representatives of two general class of fields, namely completely
symmetric and mixed symmetry ones, and it is clear that the results obtained
admit straightforward generalization to higher spins as well.
