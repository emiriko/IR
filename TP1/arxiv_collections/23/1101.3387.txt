We investigate dynamics of deformable self-propelled particles with a
repulsive interaction whose magnitude depends on the relative direction of
elongation of a pair of particles. A collective motion of the particles appears
in two dimensions. However this ordered state becomes unstable when the
particle density exceeds a certain critical threshold and the dynamics becomes
disorder. We show by a mean field analysis that this novel transition
characteristic to deformability occurs due to a saddle-node bifurcation.
