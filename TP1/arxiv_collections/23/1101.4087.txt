In this paper we use an exact method to impose unitarity on moduli of
neutrino PMNS matrix recently determined, and show how one could obtain
information on CP nonconservation from a limited experimental information. One
suggests a novel type of global fit by expressing all theoretical quantities in
terms of convention independent parameters: the Jarlskog invariant $J$ and the
moduli $|U_{\alpha i}|$, able to resolve the positivity problem of $|U_{e 3}|$.
In this way the fit will directly provide a value for $J$, and if it is
different from zero it will prove the existence of CP violation in the
available experimental data. If the best fit result, $|U_{e3}|^2<0$, from M.
Maltoni {\em et al}, [New J.Phys. {\bf 6} (2004) 122] is confirmed, it will
imply a new physics in the leptonic sector.
