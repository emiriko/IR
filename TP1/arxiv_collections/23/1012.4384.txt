In recent years there has been a considerable increase in the publishing of
textbooks and monographs covering what was formerly known as random or
irregular deterministic motion, now named by the more fashionable term of
deterministic chaos. There is still substantial interest in a matter that is
included in many graduate and even undergraduate courses on classical
mechanics. Based on the Hamiltonian formalism, the main objective of this
article is to provide, from the physicist's point of view, an overall and
intuitive review of this broad subject (with some emphasis on the KAM theorem
and the stability of planetary motions) which may be useful to both students
and instructors.
