A new three-dimensional model of the solar photosphere is presented in this
paper and made publicly available to the community. This model has the
peculiarity that it has been obtained by inverting spectro-polarimetric
observations, rather than from numerical radiation hydrodynamical simulations.
The data used here are from the spectro-polarimeter onboard the Hinode
satellite, which routinely delivers Stokes I, Q, U and V profiles in the 6302 A
spectral region with excellent quality, stability and spatial resolution
(approximately 0.3"). With such spatial resolution, the major granular
components are well resolved, which implies that the derived model needs no
micro- or macro-turbulence to properly fit the widths of the observed spectral
lines. Not only this model fits the observed data used for its construction,
but it can also fit previous solar atlas observations satisfactorily.
