We study one parameter families $D_t$, $0<t<1$ of non-commutative analogs of
the d-bar operator $D_0 = \frac{\d}{\d\bar{z}}$ on disks and annuli in complex
plane and show that, under suitable conditions, they converge in the classical
limit to their commutative counterpart. More precisely, we endow the
corresponding families of Hilbert spaces with the structures of continuous
fields over the interval $[0,1)$ and we show that the inverses of the operators
$D_t$ subject to APS boundary conditions form morphisms of those continuous
fields of Hilbert spaces.
