We experimentally generate and tomographically characterize a mixed,
genuinely non-Gaussian bipartite continuous-variable entangled state. By
testing entanglement in 2$\times$2-dimensional two-qubit subspaces, entangled
qubits are localized within the density matrix, which, firstly, proves the
distillability of the state and, secondly, is useful to estimate the efficiency
and test the applicability of distillation protocols. In our example, the
entangled qubits are arranged in the density matrix in an asymmetric way, i.e.
entanglement is found between diverse qubits composed of different photon
number states, although the entangled state is symmetric under exchanging the
modes.
