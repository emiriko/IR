Transport of fermions is central in many fields of physics. Electron
transport runs modern technology, defining states of matter such as
superconductors and insulators, and electron spin, rather than charge, is being
explored as a new carrier of information [1]. Neutrino transport energizes
supernova explosions following the collapse of a dying star [2], and
hydrodynamic transport of the quark-gluon plasma governed the expansion of the
early Universe [3]. However, our understanding of non-equilibrium dynamics in
such strongly interacting fermionic matter is still limited. Ultracold gases of
fermionic atoms realize a pristine model for such systems and can be studied in
real time with the precision of atomic physics [4, 5]. It has been established
that even above the superfluid transition such gases flow as an almost perfect
fluid with very low viscosity [3, 6] when interactions are tuned to a
scattering resonance. However, here we show that spin currents, as opposed to
mass currents, are maximally damped, and that interactions can be strong enough
to reverse spin currents, with opposite spin components reflecting off each
other. We determine the spin drag coeffcient, the spin diffusivity, and the
spin susceptibility, as a function of temperature on resonance and show that
they obey universal laws at high temperatures. At low temperatures, the spin
diffusivity approaches a minimum value set by the ratio of the reduced Planck's
constant to the atomic mass. For repulsive interactions, our measurements
appear to exclude a metastable ferromagnetic state [7-9].
