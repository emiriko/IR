The distribution, recycling and storage of carbon in the Earth are of
fundamental importance to understand the global carbon cycle between the deep
Earth and near surface reservoirs. Degassing of CO2 at mid-ocean ridges may
give information on the source region but the very low solubility of CO2 in
tholeitic basalts has for consequence that near all Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalts
glasses exsolve their CO2 rich vapor at shallow depth as they approach the
ocean floor. Hence their CO2 contents mostly represent the pressure at eruption
and not the source region. Recent petrological investigations have shown that
the presence of carbonates at depth in the upper mantle has a large effect on
the solidus of carbonated silicates by inducing incipient melting at much lower
temperature. So the role of carbon-rich melts at great depth is now becoming a
credible scenario to explain the extraction of CO2 from the source region to
the surface. During the last three decades many studies have been devoted to
measure the solubility of CO2 in silicate melts of various composition. But due
to experimental difficulties these studies were generally restricted to low and
moderate pressures (below ~20 kbar). By performing a series of molecular
dynamics simulation where a supercritical CO2 phase is in contact with a
silicate melt of various composition (from felsic to ultrabasic) at different
temperatures (1473-2273K) and pressures (20-150kbar), we have been able to
evaluate the solubility of CO2, the population of molecular and carbonate
species, their diffusivity through the melt and the local structure. We show
that this kind of molecular simulation is a useful theoretical guide to better
understand the behavior of CO2 in magmas at depth.
