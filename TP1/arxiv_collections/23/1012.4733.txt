The beta+ decay of very neutron deficient 43Cr has been studied by means of
an imaging time projection chamber which allowed recording tracks of charged
particles. Events of beta-delayed emission of one-, two-, and three protons
were clearly identified. The absolute branching ratios for these channels were
determined to be 81(4)%, 7.1(4)%, and 0.08(3)%, respectively. The 43Cr is thus
established as the second case in which the beta-3p decay occurs. Although the
feeding to the proton-bound states in 43V is expected to be negligible, the
large branching ratio of 12(4)% for decays without proton emission is found.
