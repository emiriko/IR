For integers k>0 and r>0, a conditional (k,r)-coloring of a graph G is a
proper k-coloring of the vertices of G such that every vertex v of degree d(v)
in G is adjacent to vertices with at least min{r,d(v)} different colors. The
smallest integer k for which a graph G has a conditional (k,r)-coloring is
called the rth order conditional chromatic number, denoted by $\chi_r(G)$. For
different values of r we obtain $\chi_r(G)$ of certain parameterized graphs

graph, middle graph of a cycle, line graph of Friendship graph, middle graph of
complete k-partite graph and middle graph of a bipartite graph.
