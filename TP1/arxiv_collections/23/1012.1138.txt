We address the problem of ambiguity of a function determined by an asymptotic
perturbation expansion. Using a modified form of the Watson lemma recently
proved elsewhere, we discuss a large class of functions determined by the same
asymptotic power expansion and represented by various forms of integrals of the
Laplace-Borel type along a general contour in the Borel complex plane. Some
remarks on possible applications in QCD are made.
