Millisecond radio pulsars have long been proposed to form from a spin-up
recycling process in a binary system. In this paper we demonstrate that the
accretion-induced field-decay and spin-up model for recycled pulsars can indeed
produce those millisecond pulsars with relatively weak magnetic fields of
$10^8-10^9$ G and short spin periods of a few milliseconds. Our results also
suggest that the value of the currently observed highest spin frequency of
millisecond pulsars may simply be constrained by the amount of mass available
for accretion.
