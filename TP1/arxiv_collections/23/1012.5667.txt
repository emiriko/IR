We show in this paper the results on the phase transition of the so-called
fully frustrated simple cubic lattice with the Ising spin model. We use here
the Monte Carlo method with the flat energy-histogram Wang-Landau technique
which is very powerful to detect weak first-order phase transition. We show
that the phase transition is clearly of first order, providing a definite
answer to a question raised 25 years ago.
