In this work SVG will be translated into VML or HTML by using Javascript
based on Backbase Client Framework. The target of this project is to implement
SVG to be viewed in Internet Explorer without any plug-in and work together
with other Backbase Client Framework languages. The result of this project will
be added as an extension to the current Backbase Client Framework.
