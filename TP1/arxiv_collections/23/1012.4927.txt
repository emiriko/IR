We discuss the unitary equivalence of generators $G_{A,R}$ associated with
abstract damped wave equations of the type $\ddot{u} + R \dot{u} + A^*A u = 0$
in some Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_1$ and certain non-self-adjoint Dirac-type
operators $Q_{A,R}$ (away from the nullspace of the latter) in $\mathcal{H}_1
\oplus \mathcal{H}_2$. The operator $Q_{A,R}$ represents a non-self-adjoint
perturbation of a supersymmetric self-adjoint Dirac-type operator. Special
emphasis is devoted to the case where 0 belongs to the continuous spectrum of
$A^*A$.
  In addition to the unitary equivalence results concerning $G_{A,R}$ and
$Q_{A,R}$, we provide a detailed study of the domain of the generator
$G_{A,R}$, consider spectral properties of the underlying quadratic operator
pencil $M(z) = |A|^2 - iz R - z^2 I_{\mathcal{H}_1}$, $z\in\mathbb{C}$, derive
a family of conserved quantities for abstract wave equations in the absence of
damping, and prove equipartition of energy for supersymmetric self-adjoint
Dirac-type operators.
  The special example where $R$ represents an appropriate function of $|A|$ is
treated in depth and the semigroup growth bound for this example is explicitly
computed and shown to coincide with the corresponding spectral bound for the
underlying generator and also with that of the corresponding Dirac-type
operator.
  The cases of undamped (R=0) and damped ($R \neq 0$) abstract wave equations
as well as the cases $A^* A \geq \epsilon I_{\mathcal{H}_1}$ for some $\epsilon
> 0$ and $0 \in \sigma (A^* A)$ (but 0 not an eigenvalue of $A^*A$) are
separately studied in detail.
