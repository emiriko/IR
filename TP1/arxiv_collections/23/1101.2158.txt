We pick up the thread of $B\to K\pi$ direct CPV (DCPV) difference, linking to
the 4th generation prediction (and current quest) of $t$-dependent CPV (TCPV)
in $B_s \to J/\psi\,\phi$. We then soar up to the heavens with possible source
of CPV for the Universe (CPV-4-U); for the "cauldron" that stirs strong phase
transitions, we raise the possible link between electroweak symmetry breaking
and large Yukawa couplings (4-EWSB). With the prognosis for 2011, 2012 and
beyond, we stress these as preview for the possible 4th generation to come:
CPV-4-U and the \emph{raison d'\^etre} for our Universe (and ourselves); 4-EWSB
and the \emph{raison d'\^etre} for the LHC itself.
