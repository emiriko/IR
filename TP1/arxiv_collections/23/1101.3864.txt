We review the recent literature on modified theories of gravity in the
Palatini approach. After discussing the motivations that lead to consider
alternatives to Einstein's theory and to treat the metric and the connection as
independent objects, we review several topics that have been recently studied
within this framework. In particular, we provide an in-depth analysis of the
cosmic speedup problem, laboratory and solar systems tests, the structure of
stellar objects, the Cauchy problem, and bouncing cosmologies. We also discuss
the importance of going beyond the f(R) models to capture other
phenomenological aspects related with dark matter/energy and quantum gravity.
