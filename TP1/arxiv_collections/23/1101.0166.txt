Given a Hopf algebra H and an H-module algebra A, we explicitly describe the
Arens-Michael envelope of the smash product A#H in terms of the Arens-Michael
envelope of H and a certain completion of A. We also give an example (Manin's
quantum plane) showing that the result fails for non-Hopf bialgebras.
