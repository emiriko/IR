The asymptotic behavior of the integrated density of states for a randomly
perturbed lattice at the infimum of the spectrum is investigated. The leading
term is determined when the decay of the single site potential is slow. The
leading term depends only on the classical effect from the scalar potential. To
the contrary, the quantum effect appears when the decay of the single site
potential is fast. The corresponding leading term is estimated and the leading
order is determined. In the multidimensional cases, the leading order varies in
different ways from the known results in the Poisson case. The same problem is
considered for the negative potential. These estimates are applied to
investigate the long time asymptotics of Wiener integrals associated with the
random potentials.
