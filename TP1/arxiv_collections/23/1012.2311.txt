The role of Poincar\'e covariant space-time translations is investigated in
the case of the pseudoscalar-meson charge form factors calculated within a
relativistic quantum mechanics framework. It is shown that this role extends
beyond the standard energy-momentum conservation, which is accounted for in all
works based on this general approach. It implies constraints that have been
largely ignored until now but should be nevertheless fulfilled to ensure the
full Poincar\'e covariance. The violation of these constraints, which is more
or less important depending on the form of relativistic quantum mechanics that
is employed, points to the validity of using a single-particle current, which
is generally assumed in calculations of form factors. In short, these
constraints concern the relation of the momentum transferred to the
constituents to the one transferred to the system, which most often differ in
relativistic quantum mechanics while they are equal in field theory. How to
account for the constraints, as well as restoring the equivalence of different
relativistic quantum mechanics approaches in estimating form factors, is
discussed. It is mentioned that the result so obtained can be identified to a
dispersion-relation one. A short conclusion relative to the underlying dynamics
is given in the pion case.
