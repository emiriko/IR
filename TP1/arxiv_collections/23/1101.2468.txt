We present spectra of 32 previously unpublished confirmed and candidate
Wolf-Rayet ([WR]) and weak emission-line (WELS) central stars of planetary
nebulae (CSPNe). Eighteen stars have been discovered in the
Macquarie/AAO/Strasbourg H-Alpha (MASH) PN survey sample, and we have also
uncovered 14 confirmed and candidate [WR]s and WELS among the CSPNe of
previously known PNe. Spectral classifications have been undertaken using both
the Acker & Neiner and Crowther, De Marco & Barlow schemes. Twenty-two members
in this sample are identified as probable [WR]s; the remaining 10 appear to be
WELS. Observations undertaken as part of the MASH spectroscopic survey have now
increased the number of known [WR]s by ~30 per cent. This will permit a better
analysis of [WR] subclass distribution, metallicity effects, and evolutionary
sequences in these uncommon objects.
