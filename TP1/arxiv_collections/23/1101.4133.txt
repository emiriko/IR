We present the foundations of a new emerging interpretation of quantum theory
bearing wide-range implications. Physical basis of the interpretation is
non-questionable yet relatively new--it relies on the different structures
(decompositions into parts, subsystems) of the quantum Universe. We compare the
mutually irreducible structures of the Universe and recognize them as the
different facets of the one and the same quantum Universe. Physical picture is
interesting and non-reducible to the existing interpretations. As a
particularly interesting topic in this context appears the 'free will' topic of
current interest in the interpretation of quantum theory. To this end, we
arrive at the following interesting observation. The freely chosen actions
(e.g. quantum measurements) performed by a (conscious) agent that are still
locally observable in the alternate Worlds could seem physically unexplainable
('non-physical', 'ghostly').
