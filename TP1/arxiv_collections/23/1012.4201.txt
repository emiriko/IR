In 2009, it was shown that, with an original approach to hydrodynamic
cavitation, a phenomenological model was realized in order to compute some of
the physical parameters needed for the design of the most common technological
applications (turbo-machinery, etc.) with an economical saving in planning
because this analysis could allow engineers to reduce the experimental tests
and the consequent costs in the design process. Here the same approach has been
used to obtain range of some physical quantity for jet engine optimization.
