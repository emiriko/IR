In this article, we perform an systematic study of the radiative transitions
among the bottomonium states based on the heavy quarkonium effective theory,
and make predictions for the ratios among the radiative decay widths of a
special multiplet to another multiplet. The predictions can be confronted with
the experimental data in the future.
