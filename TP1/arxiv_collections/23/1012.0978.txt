We report the first experimental demonstration of chaotic phase
synchronization (CPS) in unidirectionally coupled time-delay systems using
electronic circuits. We have also implemented experimentally an efficient
methodology for characterizing CPS, namely the localized sets. Snapshots of the
evolution of coupled systems and the sets as observed from the oscilloscope
confirming CPS are shown experimentally. Numerical results from different
approaches, namely phase differences, localized sets, changes in the largest
Lyapunov exponents and the correlation of probability of recurrence
($C_{CPR}$), corroborate the experimental observations.
