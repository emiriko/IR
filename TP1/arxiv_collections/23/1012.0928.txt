We propose a scheme for realizing two-qubit quantum phase gates with two
nonidentical quantum dots trapped in two coupled photonic crystal cavities and
driven by classical laser fields. During the gate operation, neither the cavity
modes nor the quantum dots are excited, so the decoherence can be suppressed.
The system can acquire a phase conditional upon the states of the quantum dots,
which can be used to realize the controlled phase gate.
