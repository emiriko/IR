We consider the energy dependence of the local ${\cal P}$ and ${\cal CP}$
violation in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions over a large energy range within a
simple phenomenological model. It is expected that at LHC the chiral magnetic
effect will be about 20 times weaker than at RHIC. At lower energy range this
effect should vanish sharply at energy somewhere above the top SPS one. To
elucidate CME background effects a transport model including magnetic field
evolution is put forward.
