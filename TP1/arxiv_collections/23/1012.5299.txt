We describe a novel approach to accelerating Monte Carlo Markov Chains. Our
focus is cosmological parameter estimation, but the algorithm is applicable to
any problem for which the likelihood surface is a smooth function of the free
parameters and computationally expensive to evaluate. We generate a high-order
interpolating polynomial for the log-likelihood using the first points gathered
by the Markov chains as a training set. This polynomial then accurately
computes the majority of the likelihoods needed in the latter parts of the
chains. We implement a simple version of this algorithm as a patch (InterpMC)
to CosmoMC and show that it accelerates parameter estimatation by a factor of
between two and four for well-converged chains. The current code is primarily
intended as a "proof of concept", and we argue that there is considerable room
for further performance gains. Unlike other approaches to accelerating
parameter fits, we make no use of precomputed training sets or special choices
of variables, and InterpMC is almost entirely transparent to the user.
