The detailed workings of the central engines of powerful quasars remain a
mystery. This is primarily due to the fact that, at their cosmological
distances, the inner regions of these quasars are spatially unresolvable.
Reverberation mapping is now beginning to unlock the physics of the Broad
Emission Line Region (BELR) in nearby, low-luminosity quasars, however it is
still unknown whether this gas is dominated by virial motion, by outflows, or
infall. The challenge is greater for more distant, powerful sources due to the
very long response time of the BELR to changes in the continuum. We present a
new technique for probing the kinematic properties of the BELR and accretion
disk of high-z quasars using differential microlensing, and show how
substantial information can be gained through a single observation of a
strongly-lensed quasar using integral field spectroscopy. We apply this
technique to GMOS IFU observations of the multiply-imaged quasar Q2237+0305,
and find that the observed microlensing signature in the CIII] broad emission
line favours gravitationally-dominated dynamics over an accelerating outflow.
