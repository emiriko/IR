We have carried out calculations of the triple-differential cross section for
one-photon double ionization of molecular hydrogen for a central photon energy
of $75$~eV, using a fully {\it ab initio}, nonperturbative approach to solve
the time-dependent \Schro equation in prolate spheroidal coordinates. The
spatial coordinates $\xi$ and $\eta$ are discretized in a finite-element
discrete-variable representation. The wave packet of the laser-driven
two-electron system is propagated in time through an effective short iterative
Lanczos method to simulate the double ionization of the hydrogen molecule. For
both symmetric and asymmetric energy sharing, the present results agree to a
satisfactory level with most earlier predictions for the absolute magnitude and
the shape of the angular distributions. A notable exception, however, concerns
the predictions of the recent time-independent calculations based on the
exterior complex scaling method in prolate spheroidal coordinates
[Phys.~Rev.~A~{\bf 82}, 023423 (2010)]. Extensive tests of the numerical
implementation were performed, including the effect of truncating the Neumann
expansion for the dielectronic interaction on the description of the initial
bound state and the predicted cross sections. We observe that the dominant
escape mode of the two photoelectrons dramatically depends upon the energy
sharing. In the parallel geometry, when the ejected electrons are collected
along the direction of the laser polarization axis, back-to-back escape is the
dominant channel for strongly asymmetric energy sharing, while it is completely
forbidden if the two electrons share the excess energy equally.
