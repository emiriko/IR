This paper brings space weather prediction close to earthquake (EQ)
prediction research. The results of this paper support conclusions of
previously presented statistical studies that solar activity influences the
seismic activity, this influence is mediated through rapid geomagnetic
disturbances and the geomagnetic disturbances are related with increases of
solar wind speed. Our study concern an example of 40 days with direct response
of a series of 7 strong-to-giant (M=6.8-9.3) EQs (including the Andaman-Sumatra
EQ) to solar wind speed increases and subsequent geomagnetic fast disturbances.
Our analysis for 10 M>6 EQs from November 23 to December 28, 2004 suggests a
mean time response delay of EQs to fast geomagnetic disturbances of ~1.5 days.
The two giant EQs during this period occurred after the two fastest geomagnetic
variations, as revealed by the ratio of the daily Kp index variation over a day
{\Delta}Kp/{\Delta}t (12 and 15, respectively). It suggests that the fast
disturbance of the magnetosphere, as a result of the solar wind speed increase,
is a key parameter in a related space weather-earthquake prediction research.
The Solar-magnetosphere-lithosphere coupling and their possible special
characteristics during the period examined needs further investigation, since
it could provide significant information on the underlying physical relation
processes of strong earthquakes.
