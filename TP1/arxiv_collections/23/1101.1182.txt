Opacity calculations are basic ingredients of stellar modelling. They play a
crucial role in the interpretation of acoustic modes detected by SoHO, COROT
and KEPLER. In this review we present our activities on both theoretical and
experimental sides. We show new calculations of opacity spectra and comparisons
between eight groups who produce opacity spectra calculations in the domain
where experiments are scheduled. Real differences are noticed with real
astrophysical consequences when one extends helioseismology to cluster studies
of different compositions. Two cases are considered presently: (1) the solar
radiative zone and (2) the beta Cephei envelops. We describe how our
experiments are performed and new preliminary results on nickel obtained in the
campaign 2010 at LULI 2000 at Polytechnique.
