The measurement of the single top-quark production cross section in hadron
collisions at the Tevatron and the LHC can be used to determine the absolute
value of the CKM matrix element V_tb without assuming the unitarity of the CKM
matrix. By measuring the branching ratio of the decay t -> W + b one can relate
V_tb to the matrix elements V_ts and V_td. The current experimental status and
future prospects of these measurements are reviewed.
