We present the results from the spectroscopic follow-up of WR140 (WC7 + O4-5)
during its last periastron passage in January 2009. This object is known as the
archetype of colliding wind binaries and has a relatively large period (~ 8
years) and eccentricity (~ 0.89). We provide updated values for the orbital
parameters, new estimates for the WR and O star masses and new constraints on
the mass-loss rates.
