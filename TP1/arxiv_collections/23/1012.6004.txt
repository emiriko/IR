Benchmark of dimensionless data correlations pertinent to batch bubble
columns (BC) with suspended solids has been performed by the pressure transform
approach (PTA). The main efforts have addressed the correct definition of
dimensionless groups referring to the fact that solids dynamics and the bubble
dynamics have different velocity and length scales. The correct definition of
the initial set of variable in the classical dimensional analysis depends
mainly on the experience of the investigator while the pressure transform
approach (PTA) avoids errors at this initial stage. PTA addresses the physics
of the phenomena occurring in complex systems involving many phases and allows
straightforward definitions of dimensionless numbers.
