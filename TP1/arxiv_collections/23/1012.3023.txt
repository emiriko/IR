The generation of random graphs using edge swaps provides a reliable method
to draw uniformly random samples of sets of graphs respecting some simple
constraints, e.g. degree distributions. However, in general, it is not
necessarily possible to access all graphs obeying some given con- straints
through a classical switching procedure calling on pairs of edges. We therefore
propose to get round this issue by generalizing this classical approach through
the use of higher-order edge switches. This method, which we denote by "k-edge
switching", makes it possible to progres- sively improve the covered portion of
a set of constrained graphs, thereby providing an increasing, asymptotically
certain confidence on the statistical representativeness of the obtained
sample.
