The startup of the LHC opens many new frontiers in precision flavour physics,
in particular expanding the field of precision time-dependent CP violation
measurements to the $B^0_s$ system. This contribution reviews the status of
time-dependent measurements of the CKM angle $\gamma$ at the LHC's dedicated
flavour physics experiment, LHCb. Particular attention is given to the
measurement of $\gamma$ from the decay mode \DsK, a theoretically clean and
precise method which is unique to LHCb. The performance of the LHCb detector
for this and related modes is reviewed in light of early data taking and found
to be close to the nominal simulation performance, and the outlook for these
measurements in 2011 is briefly touched on.
