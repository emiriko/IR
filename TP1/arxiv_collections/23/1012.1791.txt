We consider an extension of the Standard Model in which the symmetry is
enlarged by a global flavour factor A4 and the scalar sector accounts for three
copies of the Standard Model Higgs, transforming as a triplet of A4. In this
context, we study the most general scalar potential and its minima, performing
for each of them a model independent analysis on the related phenomenology. We
study the scalar spectrum, the new contributions to the oblique corrections,
the decays of the Z and W, the new sources of flavour violation, which all are
affected by the introduction of multiple Higgses transforming under A4. We find
that this model independent approach discriminates the different minima allowed
by the scalar potential.
