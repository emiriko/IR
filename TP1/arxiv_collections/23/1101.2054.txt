We study the real-time evolution of a charge-excited state in a
one-dimensional $e_{\rm g}$-orbital degenerate Hubbard model, by a
time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group method. Considering a chain
along the $z$ direction, electrons hop between adjacent $3z^2-r^2$ orbitals,
while $x^2-y^2$ orbitals are localized. For the charge-excited state, a
holon-doublon pair is introduced into the ground state at quarter filling. At
initial time, there is no electron in a holon site, while a pair of electrons
occupies $3z^2-r^2$ orbital in a doublon site. As the time evolves, the holon
motion is governed by the nearest-neighbor hopping, but the electron pair can
transfer between $3z^2-r^2$ orbital and $x^2-y^2$ orbital through the pair
hopping in addition to the nearest-neighbor hopping. Thus holon and doublon
propagate at different speed due to the pair hopping that is characteristic of
multi-orbital systems.
