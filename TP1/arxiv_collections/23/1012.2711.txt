We explore the non-equilibrium escape dynamics of long-range interacting ions
in one-dimensional traps. The phase space of the few ion setup and its impact
on the escape properties are studied. As a main result we show that an
instantaneous reduction of the trap's potential depth leads to the synchronized
emission of a sequence of ion pairs if the initial configurations are close to
the crystalline ionic configuration. The corresponding time-intervals of the
consecutive pair emission as well as the number of emitted pairs can be tuned
by changing the final trap depth. Correlations between the escape times and
kinetic energies of the ions are observed and analyzed.
