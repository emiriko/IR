We consider the spin polarized fermions for the filling fraction 5/2 in a
bi-layer quantum well system. Since the kinetic energy of the system in
fractional quantum Hall states (FQHS) is totally quenched, the Hamiltonian
describing the system comprises of the electron correlation and tunneling
terms. The correlations are captured by the 'so-called' Haldane
pseudo-potentials(HPP). We employ the finite-temperature formalism involving
Matsubara propagators to deal with this Hamiltonian. We show that the system
undergoes a zero-order quantum phase transition (QPT), at fixed charge
imbalance regulatory(CIR) parameter and constant layer separation as the
inter-layer tunneling (ILT)strength is increased, from the effective
two-component state (two independent layers) to an effective single-component
state (practically a single layer). At finite and constant ILT strength, a
transition from the latter state to the former state is also possible upon
increasing CIR parameter. We identify the order parameter to describe this QPT
as a pseudo-spin component and calculate the order parameter with the aid of
the Matsubara propagators. The clear finger-print of this QPT is obtained up to
temperature equal to 100 K.
