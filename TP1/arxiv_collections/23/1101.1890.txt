Unsupervised clustering, also known as natural clustering, stands for the
classification of data according to their similarities. Here we study this
problem from the perspective of complex networks. Mapping the description of
data similarities to graphs, we propose to extend two multiresolution
modularity based algorithms to the finding of modules (clusters) in general
data sets producing a multiscales' solution. We show the performance of these
reported algorithms to the classification of a standard benchmark of data
clustering and compare their performance.
