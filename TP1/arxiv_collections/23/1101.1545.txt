Using long-term monitoring data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE),
we have selected 23 active galactic nuclei (AGN) with sufficient brightness and
overall observation time to derive broadband X-ray spectra from 3 to >100 keV.
Our sample includes mainly radio-quiet Seyferts, as well as seven radio-loud
sources. Given the longevity of the RXTE mission, the greater part of our data
is spread out over more than a decade, providing truly long-term average
spectra and eliminating inconsistencies arising from variability. We present
long-term average values of absorption, Fe line parameters, Compton reflection
strengths and photon indices, as well as fluxes and luminosities for the hard
and very hard energy bands, 2-10 keV and 20-100 keV respectively. We find
tentative evidence for high-energy rollovers in three of our objects. We
improve upon previous surveys of the very hard X-ray energy band in terms of
accuracy and sensitivity, particularly with respect to confirming and
quantifying the Compton reflection component. This survey is meant to provide a
baseline for future analysis with respect to the long-term averages for these
sources and to cement the legacy of RXTE, and especially its High Energy X-ray
Timing Experiment, as a contributor to AGN spectral science.
