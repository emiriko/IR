In this paper, we provide a matrix-analytic solution for randomized load
balancing models (also known as \emph{supermarket models}) with phase-type (PH)
service times. Generalizing the service times to the phase-type distribution
makes the analysis of the supermarket models more difficult and challenging
than that of the exponential service time case which has been extensively
discussed in the literature. We first describe the supermarket model as a
system of differential vector equations, and provide a doubly exponential
solution to the fixed point of the system of differential vector equations.
Then we analyze the exponential convergence of the current location of the
supermarket model to its fixed point. Finally, we present numerical examples to
illustrate our approach and show its effectiveness in analyzing the randomized
load balancing schemes with non-exponential service requirements.
