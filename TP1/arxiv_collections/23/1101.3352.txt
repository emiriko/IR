We develop an information-theoretic perspective on some questions in convex
geometry, providing for instance a new equipartition property for log-concave
probability measures, some Gaussian comparison results for log-concave
measures, an entropic formulation of the hyperplane conjecture, and a new
reverse entropy power inequality for log-concave measures analogous to V.
Milman's reverse Brunn-Minkowski inequality.
