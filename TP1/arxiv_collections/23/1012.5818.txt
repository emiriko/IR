Mineral dust aerosols impact Earth's radiation budget through interactions
with clouds, ecosystems, and radiation, which constitutes a substantial
uncertainty in understanding past and predicting future climate changes. One of
the causes of this large uncertainty is that the size distribution of emitted
dust aerosols is poorly understood. The present study shows that regional and
global circulation models (GCMs) overestimate the emitted fraction of clay
aerosols (< 2 {\mu}m diameter) by a factor of ~2 - 8 relative to measurements.
This discrepancy is resolved by deriving a simple theoretical expression of the
emitted dust size distribution that is in excellent agreement with
measurements. This expression is based on the physics of the scale-invariant
fragmentation of brittle materials, which is shown to be applicable to dust
emission. Because clay aerosols produce a strong radiative cooling, the
overestimation of the clay fraction causes GCMs to also overestimate the
radiative cooling of a given quantity of emitted dust. On local and regional
scales, this affects the magnitude and possibly the sign of the dust radiative
forcing, with implications for numerical weather forecasting and regional
climate predictions in dusty regions. On a global scale, the dust cycle in most
GCMs is tuned to match radiative measurements, such that the overestimation of
the radiative cooling of a given quantity of emitted dust has likely caused
GCMs to underestimate the global dust emission rate. This implies that the
deposition flux of dust and its fertilizing effects on ecosystems may be
substantially larger than thought.
