The anomalous Hall effect in metal-insulator-semiconductor structures having
thin (Ga,Mn)As layers as a channel has been studied in a wide range of Mn and
hole densities changed by the gate electric field. Strong and unanticipated
temperature dependence, including a change of sign, of the anomalous Hall
conductance $\sigma_{xy}$ has been found in samples with the highest Curie
temperatures. For more disordered channels, the scaling relation between
$\sigma_{xy}$ and $\sigma_{xx}$, similar to the one observed previously for
thicker samples, is recovered.
