Thin films composed of Ge nanocrystals embedded in amorphous SiO2 matrix
(Ge-NCs TFs) were prepared using a low temperature in-situ growth method.
Unexpected high p-type conductivity was observed in the intrinsic Ge-NCs TFs.
Unintentional doping from shallow dopants was excluded as a candidate mechanism
of hole generation. Instead, the p-type characteristic was attributed to
surface state induced hole accumulation in NCs, and the hole conduction was
found to be a thermally activated process involving charge hopping from one NC
to its nearest neighbor. Theoretical analysis has shown that the density of
surface states in Ge-NCs is sufficient to induce adequate holes for measured
conductivity. The film conductivity can be improved significantly by
post-growth rapid thermal annealing and this effect is explained by a simple
thermodynamic model. The impact of impurities on the conduction properties was
also studied. Neither compensation nor enhancement in conduction was observed
in the Sb and Ga doped Ge-NCs TFs, respectively. This could be attributed to
the fact that these impurities are no longer shallow dopants in NCs and are
much less likely to be effectively activated. Finally, the photovoltaic effect
of heterojunction diodes employing such Ge-NCs TFs was characterized in order
to demonstrate its functionality in device implementation.
