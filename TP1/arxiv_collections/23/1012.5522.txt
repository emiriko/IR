From hydro-gravitational cosmology, hydrogen-helium gas planets fragmented at
the plasma to gas transition 300,000 years after the big bang in
million-star-mass clumps. Stars may form in the clumps by mergers of the
planets to make globular star clusters. Star-less clumps persist as the dark
matter of galaxies as observed by Schild in 1996 using quasar microlensing, and
as predicted by Gibson in 1996 using fluid mechanics. Massive plasma
structures, at 10^46 kg proto-galaxy-cluster-mass, fragment at 30,000 years
when photon-viscous forces match gravitational fragmentation forces at the
horizon scale ct of the expanding universe, where c is the speed of light and t
is the time. Spinning proto-super-cluster-void and proto-galaxy-void boundaries
expand at sound speeds c/3^1/2 producing weak turbulence and linear-clusters of
gas-proto-galaxies that are fossils of turbulent-plasma vortex lines.
Hubble-space-telescope images of the most distant galaxies support this Gamov
1951 prediction. Vortex spin axes inferred from microwave background
anisotropies are interpreted as evidence of a turbulent big bang. A cosmic
distribution of life is attributed to hot water oceans of the interacting
hydrogen planets seeded by the first chemicals.
