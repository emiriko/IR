A muon collider would open new frontiers of investigation in high energy
particle physics, allowing precision measurements to be made at the TeV energy
frontier. One of the greatest challenges to constructing a muon collider is the
preparation of a beam of muons on a timescale comparable to the lifetime of the
muon. Frictional cooling is a potential solution to this problem. In this
paper, we briefly describe frictional cooling and detail the Frictional Cooling
Demonstration (FCD) experiment at the Max Planck Institute for Physics, Munich.
The FCD experiment, which aims to verify the working principles behind
frictional cooling, is at the end of the commissioning phase and will soon
begin data taking.
