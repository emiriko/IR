We present the necessary and sufficient conditions for the unity absorbance
of thin planar layers. With a simple structure comprising a double-layer grid,
it is shown that zero transmission and reflection is feasible only if the
second sheet is a perfectly conducting wall. The operational frequencies can be
varied by tuning the grid impedance. Explicit conditions are given at the large
wavelength limit; these underline the fundamental of ultra-thin perfect
antennae and absorbers.
