Cluster media are dynamical, not static; observational evidence suggests they
are turbulent. High-resolution simulations of the intracluster media (ICMs) and
of idealized, similar media help us understand the complex physics and
astrophysics involved. We present a brief overview of the physics behind ICM
turbulence and outline the processes that control its development.
High-resolution, compressible, isothermal MHD simulations are used to
illustrate important dynamical properties of turbulence that develops in media
with initially very weak magnetic fields. The simulations follow the growth of
magnetic fields and reproduce the characteristics of turbulence. These results
are also compared with full cluster simulations that have examined the
properties of ICM turbulence.
