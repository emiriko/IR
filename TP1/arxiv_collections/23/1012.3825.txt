When W is a finite reflection group, the noncrossing partition lattice NCP_W
of type W is a rich combinatorial object, extending the notion of noncrossing
partitions of an n-gon. A formula (for which the only known proofs are
case-by-case) expresses the number of multichains of a given length in NCP_W as
a generalised Fuss-Catalan number, depending on the invariant degrees of W. We
describe how to understand some specifications of this formula in a case-free
way, using an interpretation of the chains of NCP_W as fibers of a
Lyashko-Looijenga covering (LL), constructed from the geometry of the
discriminant hypersurface of W. We study algebraically the map LL, describing
the factorisations of its discriminant and its Jacobian. As byproducts, we
generalise a formula stated by K. Saito for real reflection groups, and we
deduce new enumeration formulas for certain factorisations of a Coxeter element
of W.
