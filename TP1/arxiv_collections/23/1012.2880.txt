We discuss how D=5 maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (MSYM) might be
used to study or even to define the (2,0) theory in six dimensions. It is known
that the compactification of (2,0) theory on a circle leads to D=5 MSYM. A
variety of arguments suggest that the relation can be reversed, and that all of
the degrees of freedom of (2,0) theory are already present in D=5 MSYM. If so,
this relation should have consequences for D=5 SYM perturbation theory. We
explore whether it might imply all orders finiteness, or else an unusual
relation between the cutoff and the gauge coupling. S-duality of the reduction
to D=4 may provide nonperturbative constraints or tests of these options.
