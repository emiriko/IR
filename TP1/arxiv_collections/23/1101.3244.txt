We review recent results on the dependence of various galaxy properties on
environment at low redshift. As environmental indicators, we use group mass,
group-centric radius, and the distinction between centrals and satellites;
examined galaxy properties include star formation rate, colour, AGN fraction,
age, metallicity and concentration. In general, satellite galaxies diverge more
markedly from their central counterparts if they reside in more massive haloes.
We show that these results are consistent with starvation being the main
environmental effect, if one takes into account that satellites that reside in
more massive haloes and at smaller halo-centric radii on average have been
accreted a longer time ago. Nevertheless, environmental effects are not fully
understood yet. In particular, it is puzzling that the impact of environment on
a galaxy seems independent of its stellar mass. This may indicate that the
stripping of the extended gas reservoir of satellite galaxies predominantly
occurs via tidal forces rather than ram-pressure.
