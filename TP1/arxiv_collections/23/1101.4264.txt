We study the practical effectiveness of privacy amplification for classical
key-distribution schemes. We find that in contrast to quantum key distribution
schemes, the high fidelity of the raw key generated in classical systems allow
the users to always sift a secure shorter key if they have an upper bound on
the eavesdropper probability to correctly guess the exchanged key-bits. The
number of privacy amplification iterations needed to achieve information leak
of 10^-8 in existing classical communicators is 2 or 3 resulting in a
corresponding slowdown 4 to 8. We analyze the inherent tradeoff between the
number of iterations and the security of the raw key. This property which is
unique to classical key distribution systems render them highly useful for
practical, especially for noisy channels where sufficiently low quantum bit
error ratios are difficult to achieve.
