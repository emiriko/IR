In close eclipsing binaries, measurements of the variations in binary's
eclipse timing may be used to infer information about the existence of
circumbinary objects. To determine the possibility of the detection of such
variations with CoRoT and Kepler space telescopes, we have carried out an
extensive study of the dynamics of a binary star system with a circumbinary
planet, and calculated its eclipse timing variations (ETV) for different values
of the mass-ratio and orbital elements of the binary and the perturbing body.
Here, we present the results of our study and assess the detectability of the
planet by comparing the resulting values of ETVs with the temporal sensitivity
of CoRoT and Kepler. Results point to extended regions in the parameter-space
where the perturbation of a planet may become large enough to create measurable
variations in the eclipse timing of the secondary star. Many of these
variations point to potentially detectable ETVs and the possible existence of
Jovian-type planets.
