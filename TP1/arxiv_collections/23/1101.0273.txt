Ultra High Cosmic Rays (UHECR) should be tracing their sources, making a new
astronomy. Their events counting are finally growing, by Auger experiment, into
cosmic sky. Their map should follow the mass distribution in a narrow cosmic
volume (the GZK cut off region, correlated with Super Galactic Plane (SPG) or
Local Group) if they were protons, as most expected. Recently the last 69 UHECR
did not longer follow the SGP map, opening the way to very different
correlations, and extreme bending connection; we reconfirm here our Lightest
Nuclei interpretation, while showing here the last event over different radio,
X, Gamma and tens TeV CR maps. The Virgo Cluster absence, the persistence of
UHECR clustering along Cen A, the first triplet along Vela seem to confirm
light nuclei UHECR understanding, implying a very narrow Universe view, even
partially of galactic origin. UHECR fragments might follow (at half, fourth of
the energy) the same UHECR map with a tail or a crown clustering around main
UHECR group. Also secondary gamma and UHE neutrino might trace partially those
maps. Tau neutrinos at EeV or PeVs may play a role in correlating UHECR map and
disentangling nucleon from nuclei nature, possibly in Auger Fluorescence
Telescopes, by night horizontal up-going tau airshowers.
