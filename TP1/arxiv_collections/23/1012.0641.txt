We present the results of an analysis of the prompt gamma-ray emission from
GRB 090618 using the RT-2 Experiment onboard the Coronas-Photon satellite. GRB
090618 shows multiple peaks and a detailed study of the temporal structure as a
function of energy is carried out. As the GRB was incident at an angle of 77
degree to the detector axis, we have generated appropriate response functions
of the detectors to derive the spectrum of this GRB. We have augmented these
results using the publicly available data from the Swift BAT detector and show
that a combined spectral analysis can measure the spectral parameters quite
accurately. We also attempt a spectral and timing analysis of individual peaks
and find evidence for a systematic change in the pulse emission characteristics
for the successive pulses. In particular, we find that the peak energy of the
spectrum, E_p, is found to monotonically decrease with time, for the successive
pulses of this GRB.
