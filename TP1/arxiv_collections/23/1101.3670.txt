A search for a diffuse flux of astrophysical muon neutrinos, using data
collected by the ANTARES neutrino telescope from December 2007 to December 2009
is presented. A $(0.83\times 2\pi)$ sr sky was monitored for a total of 334
days of equivalent live time. The searched signal corresponds to an excess of
events, produced by astrophysical sources, over the expected atmospheric
neutrino background without any particular assumption on the source direction.
Since the number of detected events is compatible with the number of expected
background events, a 90% c.l. upper limit on the diffuse $\nu_\mu$ flux with a
$E^{-2}$ spectrum is set at $E^2\Phi_{90%} = 5.3 \times 10^{-8} \ \mathrm{GeV\
cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}\ sr^{-1}}$ in the energy range 20 TeV -- 2.5 PeV. Other signal
models with different energy shape were also tested and some rejected.
