Quantum metrology studies the use of entanglement and other quantum resources
to improve precision measurement. An interferometer using N independent
particles to measure a parameter X can achieve at best the "standard quantum
limit" (SQL) of sensitivity {\delta}X \propto N^{-1/2}. The same interferometer
using N entangled particles can achieve in principle the "Heisenberg limit"
{\delta}X \propto N^{-1}, using exotic states. Recent theoretical work argues
that interactions among particles may be a valuable resource for quantum
metrology, allowing scaling beyond the Heisenberg limit. Specifically, a
k-particle interaction will produce sensitivity {\delta}X \propto N^{-k} with
appropriate entangled states and {\delta}X \propto N^{-(k-1/2)} even without
entanglement. Here we demonstrate this "super-Heisenberg" scaling in a
nonlinear, non-destructive measurement of the magnetisation of an atomic
ensemble. We use fast optical nonlinearities to generate a pairwise
photon-photon interaction (k = 2) while preserving quantum-noise-limited
performance, to produce {\delta}X \propto N^{-3/2}. We observe super-Heisenberg
scaling over two orders of magnitude in N, limited at large N by higher-order
nonlinear effects, in good agreement with theory. For a measurement of limited
duration, super-Heisenberg scaling allows the nonlinear measurement to overtake
in sensitivity a comparable linear measurement with the same number of photons.
In other scenarios, however, higher-order nonlinearities prevent this crossover
from occurring, reflecting the subtle relationship of scaling to sensitivity in
nonlinear systems. This work shows that inter-particle interactions can improve
sensitivity in a quantum-limited measurement, and introduces a fundamentally
new resource for quantum metrology.
