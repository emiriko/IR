The standard assumption is that all three neutrino mass states are either
Dirac or Majorana. However, it was recently suggested by Allaverdi, Dutta and
one of the authors (R.N.M.) that mixed, or bimodal, flavor neutrino scenarios
are conceivable and are consistent with all known observations (these were
called "schizophrenic" in the ADM paper). In that case each individual mass
eigenstate can be either Dirac or Majorana, so that the flavor eigenstates are
"large" admixtures of both. An example of this "bimodal" situation is to
consider one mass state as a Dirac particle (with a sterile partner), while the
other two are of Majorana type. Since only Majorana particles contribute to
neutrinoless double beta decay, the usual dependence of this observable on the
neutrino mass is modified within this scenario. We study this in detail and, in
particular, generalize the idea for all possible bimodal combinations.
Inevitably, radiative corrections will induce a pseudo-Dirac nature to the
Dirac states at the one-loop level, and the effects of the pseudo-Dirac mass
splitting will show up in the flavor ratios of neutrinos from distant
cosmological sources. Comparison of the effective mass in neutrinoless double
beta decay as well as flavor ratios at neutrino telescopes, for different
pseudo-Dirac cases and with their usual phenomenology, can distinguish the
different bimodal possibilities.
