We study the Casimir energy of a scalar field for a regular polygon with N
sides. The scalar field obeys Dirichlet boundary conditions at the perimeter of
the polygon. The polygon eigenvalues $\lambda_N$ are expressed in terms of the
Dirichlet circle eigenvalues $\lambda_C$ as an expansion in $\frac{1}{N}$ of
the form, $\lambda_N = \lambda_C (1 + \frac{4\zeta(2)}{N^2} +
\frac{4\zeta(3)}{N^3} + \frac{28\zeta(4)}{N^4}+...)$. A comparison follows
between the Casimir energy on the polygon with N=4 found with our method and
the Casimir energy of the scalar field on a square. We generalize the result to
spaces of the form $R^d\times P_N$, with $P_N$ a N-polygon. By the same token,
we find the electric field energy for a "cylinder" of infinite length with
polygonal section. With the method we use and in view of the results, it stands
to reason to assume that the Casimir energy of $D$-balls has the same sign with
the Casimir energy of regular shapes homeomorphic to the $D$-ball. We sum up
and discuss our results at the end of the article.
