We systematically investigated the in-plane resistivity anisotropy of
electron-underdoped $EuFe_{2-x}Co_xAs_2$ and $BaFe_{2-x}Co_xAs_2$, and
hole-underdoped $Ba_{1-x}K_xFe_2As_2$. Large in-plane resistivity anisotropy
was found in the former samples, while {\it tiny} in-plane resistivity
anisotropy was detected in the latter ones. When it is detected, the anisotropy
starts above the structural transition temperature and increases smoothly
through it. As the temperature is lowered further, the anisotropy takes a
dramatic enhancement through the magnetic transition temperature. We found that
the anisotropy is universally tied to the presence of non-Fermi liquid T-linear
behavior of resistivity. Our results demonstrate that the nematic state is
caused by electronic degrees of freedom, and the microscopic orbital
involvement in magnetically ordered state must be fundamentally different
between the hole and electron doped materials.
