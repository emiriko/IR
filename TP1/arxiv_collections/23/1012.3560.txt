The MAYA detector is a Time-Charge Projection Chamber based on the concept of
active target. These type of devices use a part of the detection system, the
filling gas in this case, in the role of reaction target. The MAYA detector
performs three-dimensional tracking, in order to determine physical observables
of the reactions occurring inside the detector. The reconstruction algorithms
of the tracking use the information from a two-dimensional projection on the
segmented cathode, and, in general, they need to be adapted for the different
experimental settings of the detector. This work presents some of the most
relevant solutions developed for the MAYA detector.
