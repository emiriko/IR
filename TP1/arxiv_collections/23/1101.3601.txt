We revisit the Higgs sector of the left-right supersymmetric model. We study
the scalar potential in a version of the model in which the minimum is the
charge conserving vacuum state, without R-parity violation or additional
non-renormalizable terms in the Lagrangian. We analyze the dependence of the
potential and of the Higgs mass spectrum on the various parameters of the
model, pinpointing the most sensitive ones. We also show that, contrary to
previous expectations, the model can predict light neutral flavor-conserving
Higgs bosons, while the flavor-violating ones are heavy, and within the limits
from K0-K0bar, D0-D0bar and B0-B0bar mixings. We study variants of the model in
which at least one pair of doubly-charged Higgs bosons is light, and show that
the parameter space for such Higgs masses and mixings is very restrictive, thus
making the model more predictive.
