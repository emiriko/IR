We study the optical variability of the peculiar Galactic source SS 433 using
the observations made with the Russian Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150). A
simple technique which allows to obtain high-quality photometric measurements
with 0.3-1 s time resolution using ordinary CCD is described in detail. Using
the test observations of nonvariable stars, we show that the atmospheric
turbulence introduces no significant distortions into the measured light
curves. Therefore, the data obtained in this way are well suited for studying
the aperiodic variability of various objects.
  The large amount of SS 433 optical light curve measurements obtained in this
way allowed us to obtain the power spectra of its flux variability with a
record sensitivity up to frequencies of ~0.5 Hz and to detect its break at
frequency =~2.4e-3 Hz. We suggest that this break in the power spectrum results
from the smoothing of the optical flux variability due to a finite size of the
emitting region. Based on our measurement of the break frequency in the power
spectrum, we estimated the size of the accretion-disk photosphere as 2e12 cm.
We show that the amplitude of the variability in SS 433 decreases sharply
during accretion-disk eclipses, but it does not disappear completely. This
suggests that the size of the variable optical emission source is comparable to
that of the normal star whose size is therefore R_O \approx 2e12 cm \approx 30
R_sun. The decrease in flux variability amplitude during eclipses suggests the
presence of a nonvariable optical emission component with a magnitude
m_R=~13.2.
