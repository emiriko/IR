We present highly efficient emission of twin-atom beams into a single
transversal mode of a waveguide potential. The source is a one-dimensional
degenerate Bose gas in the first radially excited state. We directly measure a
suppression of fluctuations in the atom number difference between the beams to
0.37(3) with respect to the classical expectation, equivalent to 0.11(2) after
correcting for detection noise. Our results underline the high potential of
ultracold atomic gases as sources for quantum matter wave optics and will
enable the implementation of schemes previously unattainable with massive
particles
