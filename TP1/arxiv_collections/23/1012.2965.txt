Most of the well known algorithms for watermarking of digital images involve
transformation of the image data to Fourier or singular vector space. In this
paper, we introduce watermarking in Hilbert transform domain for digital media.
Generally, if the image is a matrix of order $m$ by $n$, then the transformed
space is also an image of the same order. However, with Hilbert transforms, the
transformed space is of order $2m$ by $2n$. This allows for more latitude in
storing the watermark in the host image. Based on this idea, we propose an
algorithm for embedding and extracting watermark in a host image and
analytically obtain a parameter related to this procedure. Using extensive
simulations, we show that the algorithm performs well even if the host image is
corrupted by various attacks.
