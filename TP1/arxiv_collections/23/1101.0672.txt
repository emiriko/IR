Canonical coupling between classical and quantum systems cannot result in
reversible equations, rather it leads to irreversible master equations.
Coupling of quantized non-relativistic matter to gravity is illustrated by a
simplistic example. The heuristic derivation yields the theory of
gravity-related decoherence proposed longtime ago by Penrose and the author.
