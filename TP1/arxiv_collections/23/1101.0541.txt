We consider single and multiply charged quantized vortex dipole in an oblate
dipolar Bose Einstein condensate in the Thomas-Fermi (TF) regime. We calculate
the critical velocity for the formation of a pair of vortices of opposite
charge. We find that dipolar interactions decrease the critical velocity for a
vortex dipole nucleation.
