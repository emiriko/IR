These proceedings show the preliminary results of the dijet cross sections
and the dijet longitudinal double spin asymmetries A_LL in polarized
proton-proton collisions at \sqrt{s} = 200 GeV at the mid-rapidity |eta| < 0.8.
The integrated luminosity of 5.39 pb^{-1} collected during RHIC Run-6 was used
in the measurements. The preliminary results are presented as functions of the
dijet invariant mass M_jj. The dijet cross sections are in agreement with
next-to-leading-order pQCD predictions. The A_LL is compared with theoretical
predictions based on various parameterizations of polarized parton
distributions of the proton. Projected precision of data analyzed to date from
Run-9 are shown.
