We compute the mass spectrum for strange/charmed baryons in the partially
quenched approach using N_f=2 twisted mass QCD configurations. We investigate
two main issues: the size of lattice artefacts using three values of the
lattice spacing (the smallest of which is approximately 0.05 fm) and the
dependence of baryon masses on meson (or quark) masses. We thus perform a
global fit in order to extrapolate simultaneously to the continuum limit and to
the physical point. We estimate the masses of Omega_{sss}, Xi_{dss},
Lambda_{uds}, Omega_{ccc}, Xi_{dcc}, Lambda_{udc}.
