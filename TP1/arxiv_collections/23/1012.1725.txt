We present experimental evidence of statistical conformal invariance in
isocontours of fluid thickness in experiments of two-dimensional turbulence
using soap films. A Schlieren technique is used to visualize regions of the
flow with constant film thickness, and association of isocontours with
Schramm-L\"owner evolution (SLE) is used to identify conformal invariance. In
experiments where an inverse energy cascade develops, statistical evidence is
consistent with such an association. The diffusivity of the associated
one-dimensional Brownian process is close to 8/3, a value previously identified
in isocontours of vorticity in high-resolution numerical simulations of
two-dimensional turbulence (D. Bernard et al., Nature Phys. 2, 124, 2006). In
experiments where the inverse energy cascade is not sufficiently developed, no
statistical evidence of conformal invariance is found.
