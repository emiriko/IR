Calibration of acoustic neutrino telescopes with neutrino-like signals is an
essential aspect to evaluate the feasibility of the technique and to know the
efficiency of the detectors. However, it is not straightforward to have
acoustic transmitters that, on one hand, are able to mimic the signature of a
UHE neutrino interaction, that is, a bipolar acoustic pulse with the 'pancake'
directivity, and, on the other hand, fulfill practical issues such as ease of
deployment and operation. This is a non-trivial problem since it requires
directive transducer with cylindrical symmetry for a broadband frequency range.
Classical solutions using linear arrays of acoustic transducers result in long
arrays with many elements, which increase the cost and the complexity for
deployment and operation. In this paper we present the extension of our
previous R&D studies using the parametric acoustic source technique by dealing
with the cylindrical symmetry, and demonstrating that it is possible to use
this technique for having a compact solution that could be much more easily
included in neutrino telescope infrastructures or used in specific sea
campaigns for calibration.
