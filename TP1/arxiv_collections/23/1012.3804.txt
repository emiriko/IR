We study theoretically the role of quenched magnetic disorder at the surface
of a topological insulator by numerical simulation and scaling analysis. It is
found that all the surface states are localized while the transverse
conductivity is quantized to be $\pm {{e^2} \over {2 h}}$ as long as the Fermi
energy is within the bulk gap. This greatly facilitates the realization of the
topological magnetoelectric effect proposed by Qi {\it et al.} (Phys. Rev.
B\textbf{78}, 195424 (2008)) with the surface magnetization direction being
controlled by the simultaneous application of magnetic and electric fields .
