In this paper, we reviewed of several portable parallel programming paradigms
for use in a distributed programming environment. The Techniques reviewed here
are portable. These are mainly distributing computing using MPI pure java
based, MPI native java based (JNI) and PVM. We will discuss architecture and
utilities of each technique based on our literature review. We explored these
portable distributed techniques in four important characteristics scalability,
fault tolerance, load balancing and performance. We have identified the various
factors and issues for improving these four important characteristics.
