In recent years, Fractal Inspired Models of quark and gluon densities at
small x have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate longitudinal
structure function F-L (x, Q2) within this approach. We make predictions using
the QCD based approximate relation between the longitudinal structure function
and the gluon density. As the Altarelli-Martinelli equation for the
longitudinal structure function cannot be applied to Model I due to the
presence of a singularity in the Bjorken x-space we consider Model II only. The
qualitative feature of the prediction of Model II is found to be compatible
with the QCD expectation.
