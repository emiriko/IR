At the present work we propose a new method for studying the processes of
thermodynamic equilibrium setting in the adsorbed 3He film in a porous media.
By this method we have studied the thermalization of the adsorbed 3He on the
silica aerogel surface at the temperature 1.5 K. The process of the
thermodynamic equilibrium setting was controlled by measuring of the pressure
in the experimental cell, the amplitude of the NMR signal and the time of the
nuclear spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxation times of an adsorbed 3He. The
thermodynamic equilibrium setting in the system "adsorbed helium-3 - aerogel"
has the characteristic time 26 min.
