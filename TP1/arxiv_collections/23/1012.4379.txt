We show that the equations of motion in one partial integrable case of
Goryachev in the rigid body dynamics can be separated by the appropriate change
of variables, the new variables x, y being hyperelliptic functions of time. The
natural phase variables (components of coordinates and momenta) are expressed
via x,y explicitly in elementary algebraic functions.
