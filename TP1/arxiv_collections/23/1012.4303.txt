We study the effect of a random perturbation on a one-parameter family of
dynamical systems whose behavior in the absence of perturbation is ill
understood. We provide conditions under which the perturbed system is ergodic
and admits a positive Lyapunov exponent, with an explicit lower bound, for a
large and controlled set of parameter values.
