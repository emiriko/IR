The theoretical description of strongly correlated quantum systems out of
equilibrium presents several challenges and a number of open questions persist.
In this paper we focus on nonlinear electronic transport through an interacting
quantum dot maintained at finite bias using a concept introduced by Hershfield
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 2134 (1993)] whereby one can express such nonequilibrium
quantum impurity models in terms of the system's Lippmann-Schwinger operators.
These scattering operators allow one to reformulate the nonequilibrium problem
as an effective equilibrium problem associated with a modified Hamiltonian. In
this paper we provide a pedagogical analysis of the core concepts of the
effective equilibrium theory. First, we demonstrate the equivalence between
observables computed using the Schwinger-Keldysh framework and the effective
equilibrium approach, and relate the Green's functions in the two theoretical
frameworks. Second, we expound some applications of this method in the context
of interacting quantum impurity models. We introduce a novel framework to treat
effects of interactions perturbatively while capturing the entire dependence on
the bias voltage. For the sake of concreteness, we employ the Anderson model as
a prototype for this scheme. Working at the particle-hole symmetric point, we
investigate the fate of the Abrikosov-Suhl resonance as a function of bias
voltage and magnetic field.
