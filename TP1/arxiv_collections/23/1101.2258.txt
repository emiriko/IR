The optical variability of 29 flat spectrum radio quasars in SDSS Stripe 82
region are investigated by using DR7 released multi-epoch data. All FSRQs show
variations with overall amplitude ranging from 0.24 mag to 3.46 mag in
different sources. About half of FSRQs show a bluer-when-brighter trend, which
is commonly observed for blazars. However, only one source shows a
redder-when-brighter trend, which implies it is rare in FSRQs. In this source,
the thermal emission may likely be responsible for the spectral behavior.
