An analogue of Serre's theorem is established for finite dimensional simple
Lie superalgebras, which describes presentations in terms of Chevalley
generators and Serre type relations relative to all possible choices of Borel
subalgebras. The proof of the theorem is conceptually transparent; it also
provides an alternative approach to Serre's theorem for ordinary Lie algebras.
