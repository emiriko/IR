Using an exact Vaidya-type null-dust solution, we study the area and entropy
laws for dynamical black holes defined by a future outer trapping horizon in
(2+1)-dimensional Bergshoeff-Hohm-Townsend (BHT) massive gravity. We consider
the theory admitting a degenerate (anti-)de Sitter vacuum and pure BHT gravity.
It is shown that, while the area of a black hole decreases by the injection of
a null dust with positive energy density in several cases, the Wald-Kodama
dynamical entropy always increases.
