Four-wave mixing near resonance in an atomic vapor can produce relative
intensity squeezed light suitable for precision measurements beyond the
shot-noise limit. We develop an analytic distributed gain/loss model to
describe the competition of mixing and absorption through the non-linear
medium. Using a novel matrix calculus, we present closed-form expressions for
the degree of relative intensity squeezing produced by this system. We use
these theoretical results to analyze experimentally measured squeezing from a
$^{85}$Rb vapor and demonstrate the analytic model's utility as an experimental
diagnostic.
