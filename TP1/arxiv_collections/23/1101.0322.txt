We summarize the contribution of the HATNet project to extrasolar planet
science, highlighting published planets (HAT-P-1b through HAT-P-26b). We also
briefly discuss the operations, data analysis, candidate selection and
confirmation procedures, and we summarize what HATNet provides to the exoplanet
community with each discovery.
