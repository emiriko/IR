We present release 2.0 of the ALPS (Algorithms and Libraries for Physics
Simulations) project, an open source software project to develop libraries and
application programs for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum lattice
models such as quantum magnets, lattice bosons, and strongly correlated fermion
systems. The code development is centered on common XML and HDF5 data formats,
libraries to simplify and speed up code development, common evaluation and
plotting tools, and simulation programs. The programs enable non-experts to
start carrying out serial or parallel numerical simulations by providing basic
implementations of the important algorithms for quantum lattice models:
classical and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) using non-local updates, extended
ensemble simulations, exact and full diagonalization (ED), the density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) both in a static version and a dynamic
time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) code, and quantum Monte Carlo solvers for
dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The ALPS libraries provide a powerful
framework for programers to develop their own applications, which, for
instance, greatly simplify the steps of porting a serial code onto a parallel,
distributed memory machine. Major changes in release 2.0 include the use of
HDF5 for binary data, evaluation tools in Python, support for the Windows
operating system, the use of CMake as build system and binary installation
packages for Mac OS X and Windows, and integration with the VisTrails workflow
provenance tool. The software is available from our web server at
