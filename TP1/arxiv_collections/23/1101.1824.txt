Extensive optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations of the type IIb
supernova 2008ax are presented, covering the first year after the explosion.
The light curve is mostly similar in shape to that of the prototypical type IIb
SN 1993J, but shows a slightly faster decline rate at late phases and lacks the
prominent narrow early-time peak of SN 1993J. From the bolometric light curve
and ejecta expansion velocities, we estimate that about 0.07-0.15 solar masses
of 56Ni were produced during the explosion and that the total ejecta mass was
between 2 and 5 solar masses, with a kinetic energy of at least 10^51 erg. The
spectral evolution of SN 2008ax is similar to that of the type Ib SN 2007Y,
exhibiting high-velocity Ca II features at early phases and signs of
ejecta-wind interaction from H-alpha observations at late times. NIR spectra
show strong He I lines similar to the type Ib SN 1999ex, and a large number of
emission features at late times. Particularly interesting are the strong,
double-peaked He I lines in late NIR spectra, which - together with
double-peaked [O I] emission in late optical spectra - provide clues for
asymmetry and large-scale Ni mixing in the ejecta.
