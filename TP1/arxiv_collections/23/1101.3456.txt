We gauge the experimentally observed flavor (family) index of chiral lepton
and quark fields and argue that the resulting non-vectorial SU(3)_F dynamics
completely self-breaks. This breakdown generates fermion masses, which in turn
trigger electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). Suggested asymptotically free
dynamics with an assumed non-perturbative infrared fixed point has just one
free parameter and is therefore either right or plainly wrong. Weak point of
field theories strongly coupled in the infrared, unfortunately, is that there
is no reliable way of computing their spectrum. Because of its rigidity the
model provides, however, rather firm theoretically safe experimental
predictions without knowing the spectrum: First, anomaly freedom fixes the
neutrino sector which contains almost sterile neutrino states. Second, global
symmetries of the model, spontaneously broken by fermion masses imply the
existence of a fixed pattern of (pseudo-)axions and (pseudo-)majorons. It is
gratifying that the predicted both sterile neutrinos and the
pseudo-Nambu--Goldstone bosons are the viable candidates for dark matter.
