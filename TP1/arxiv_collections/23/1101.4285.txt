In this paper we theoretically and empirically study the degree and
connectivity of the Internet's scale-free topology at the autonomous system
(AS) level. The basic features of the scale-free network have influence on the
normalization constant of the degree distribution p(k). We develop a
mathematics model of the Internet's scale-free topology. On this model we
theoretically get the formulas of the average degree, the ratios of the
kmin-degree (minimum degree) nodes and the kmax-degree (maximum degree) nodes,
the fraction of the degrees (or links) in the hands of the richer (top
best-connected) nodes. We find the average degree is larger for smaller
power-law exponent {\lambda} and larger minimum or maximum degree. The ratio of
the kmin-degree nodes is larger for larger {\lambda} and smaller kmin or kmax.
The ratio of the kmax-degree ones is larger for smaller {\lambda} and kmax or
larger kmin. The richer nodes hold most of the total degrees of the AS-level
Internet topology. In addition, we reveal the ratio of the kmin-degree nodes or
the rate of the increase of the average degree has power-law decay with the
increase of the kmin. The ratio of the kmax-degree nodes has power-law decay
with the increase of the kmax, and the fraction of the degrees in the hands of
the richer 27% nodes is about 73% (the '73/27 rule'). At last, we empirically
calculate, based on empirical data extracted from BGP, the average degree and
the ratio and fraction using our method and other methods, and find that our
method is rigorous and effective for the AS-level Internet topology.
