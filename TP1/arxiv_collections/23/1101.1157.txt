In contrast to the claim by Yanagi et al. in Ref. [1], the development of
orbital fluctuations at $q ~ 0$ due to the "orthorhombic phonon" is unable to
explain the high-Tc superconductivity in iron pnictides. The reason is that the
orthorhombic-phonon is acoustic with the energy $\omega_q \propto q$, although
the authors in Ref. [1] treated it as optical phonon ($\omega_o=0.02 eV$)
inconsistently.
