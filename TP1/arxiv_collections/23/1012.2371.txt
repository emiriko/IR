Oscillations were observed across the whole solar disk using the Doppler
shift and line depth of spectral lines from the CO molecule near 4666~nm with
the National Solar Observatory's McMath/Pierce solar telescope. Power,
coherence, and phase spectra were examined, and diagnostic diagrams reveal
power ridges at the solar global mode frequencies to show that these
oscillations are solar p-modes. The phase was used to determine the height of
formation of the CO lines by comparison with the IR continuum intensity phase
shifts as measured in Kopp et al., 1992; we find the CO line formation height
varies from 425 < z < 560 km as we move from disk center towards the solar limb
1.0 > mu > 0.5. The velocity power spectra show that while the sum of the
background and p-mode power increases with height in the solar atmosphere as
seen in previous work, the power in the p-modes only (background subtracted)
decreases with height, consistent with evanescent waves. The CO line depth
weakens in regions of stronger magnetic fields, as does the p-mode oscillation
power. Across most of the solar surface the phase shift is larger than the
expected value of 90 degrees for an adiabatic atmosphere. We fit the phase
spectra at different disk positions with a simple atmospheric model to
determine that the acoustic cutoff frequency is about 4.5 mHz with only small
variations, but that the thermal relaxation frequency drops significantly from
2.7 to 0 mHz at these heights in the solar atmosphere.
