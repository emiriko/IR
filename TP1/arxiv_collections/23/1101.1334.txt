The formation of ridges induced by semihard scattering in nuclear collisions
is included in the description of single-particle distributions for both pion
and proton at low transverse momenta. The ridge component is characterized by
an azimuthal dependent factor that is derived in the study of the ridge
structure in two-particle correlation distributions involving triggers. It is
shown that the inclusive ridge can reproduce the observed data on $v_2(p_T)$ if
the base component underlying the ridge has no azimuthal dependence. A common
description of pion and proton spectra is given in the recombination model that
can smoothly join the low- and intermediate-$p_T$ regions. All the important
properties of single-particle distributions in those regions can be
satisfactorily described in this approach.
