The asynchronous systems are the non-deterministic real time-binary models of
the asynchronous circuits from electrical engineering. Autonomy means that the
circuits and their models have no input. Regularity means analogies with the
dynamical systems, thus such systems may be considered to be the real time
dynamical systems with a 'vector field' {\Phi}:{0,1}^2 \rightarrow {0,1}^2.
Universality refers to the case when the state space of the system is the
greatest possible in the sense of the inclusion. The purpose of the paper is
that of defining, by analogy with the dynamical systems theory, the
{\omega}-limit sets, the invariance and the basins of attraction of the
universal regular autonomous asynchronous systems.
