We present results of atomistic empirical pseudopotential calculations and
configuration interaction for excitons, positive and negative trions (X\pm),
positive and negative quartons (X2\pm) and biexcitons. The structure
investigated are laterally aligned InGaAs quantum dot molecules embedded in
GaAs under a lateral electric field. The rather simple energetic of excitons
becomes more complex in the case of charged quasiparticles but remains
tractable. The negative trion spectrum shows four anticrossings in the
presently available range of fields while the positive trion shows two. The
magnitude of the anticrossings reveals many-body effects in the carrier
tunneling process that should be experimentally accessible.
