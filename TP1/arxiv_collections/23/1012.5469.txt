We study the magnetic soliton dynamics of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates in
an optical lattice which results in an effective Hamiltonian of anisotropic
pseudospin chain. An equation of nonlinear Schr\"odinger type is derived and
exact magnetic soliton solutions are obtained analytically by means of Hirota
method. Our results show that the critical external field is needed for
creating the magnetic soliton in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. The soliton
size, velocity and shape frequency can be controlled in practical experiment by
adjusting the magnetic field. Moreover, the elastic collision of two solitons
is investigated in detail.
