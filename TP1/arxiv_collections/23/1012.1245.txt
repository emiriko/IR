We systematize and extend the description of vesicle growth and shape change
using linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics. By restricting the study to shape
changes from spheres to axisymmetric ellipsoids, we are able to give a
consistent formulation which includes the lateral tension of the vesicle
membrane. This allows us to generalize and correct a previous calculation. Our
present calculations suggest that, for small growing vesicles, a prolate
ellipsoidal shape should be favored over oblate ellipsoids, whereas for large
growing vesicles oblates should be favored over prolates. The validity of this
prediction is examined in the light of the various assumptions made in its
derivation.
