This paper examines the validity of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) on
the Ugandan stock market using monthly stock returns from 10 of the 11
companies listed on the Uganda Stock Exchange (USE), for the period 1st March
2007 to 10th November 2009. Due to the absence of readily available Uganda
Stock Exchange(USE) data, and the placement of daily price lists in pdf only,
on the USE website: http://www.use.or.ug, the article also discusses the
procedures taken to mine the data needed. The securities were all put in one
portfolio in order to diversify away the firm-specific part of returns thereby
enhancing the precision of the beta estimates. This paper should be of interest
to both Ugandan and non-Ugandan investors and market researchers. While many
developing countries have legal restrictions against foreign participation in
capital and money markets, this is not so in Uganda, where it has become part
of government policy to encourage foreign capital in flow, inorder to stimulate
the development of the small and underdeveloped markets.
  The Black, Jensen, and Scholes (1972) CAPM version is examined in this
article. This version predicts a non zero-beta rate, along with the relation of
higher returns to higher risk. The estimated zero-beta rate obtained is not
statistically different from zero, and the estimated portfolio beta coefficient
is statistically significant, providing evidence that the traditional form of
CAPM holds on the USE, albeit having a beta coefficient that is not good at
explaining the relationship between risk and return.
