We present a study on lookahead hierarchies for restarting automata with
auxiliary symbols and small lookahead. In particular, we show that there are
just two different classes of languages recognised RRWW automata, through the
restriction of lookahead size. We also show that the respective (left-)
monotone restarting automaton models characterise the context-free languages
and that the respective right-left-monotone restarting automata characterise
the linear languages both with just lookahead length 2.
