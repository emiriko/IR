This year, 2010, is the 40th anniversary of Physical Review C as a separate
section of the Physical Review. We write here with a double purpose: first, to
describe how PRC has evolved and to explore how this evolution has reflected
changes in the research style and interests of scientists working in nuclear
physics; and second, to solicit suggestions for improvements that will help
guide PRC's future evolution.
