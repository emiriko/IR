We use near-infrared data obtained with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the
Hubble Space Telescope to identify objects having the colors of brown dwarfs
(BDs) in the field of the massive galactic cluster NGC 3603. These are
identified through use of a combination of narrow and medium band filters
spanning the J and H bands, and which are particularly sensitive to the
presence of the 1.3-1.5{\mu}m H2O molecular band - unique to BDs. We provide a
calibration of the relationship between effective temperature and color for
both field stars and for BDs. This photometric method provides effective
temperatures for BDs to an accuracy of {\pm}350K relative to spectroscopic
techniques. This accuracy is shown to be not significantly affected by either
stellar surface gravity or uncertainties in the interstellar extinction. We
identify nine objects having effective temperature between 1700 and 2200 K,
typical of BDs, observed J-band magnitudes in the range 19.5-21.5, and that are
strongly clustered towards the luminous core of NGC 3603. However, if these are
located at the distance of the cluster, they are far too luminous to be normal
BDs. We argue that it is unlikely that these objects are either artifacts of
our dataset, normal field BDs/M-type giants or extra-galactic contaminants and,
therefore, might represent a new class of stars having the effective
temperatures of BDs but with luminosities of more massive stars. We explore the
interesting scenario in which these objects would be normal stars that have
recently tidally ingested a Hot Jupiter, the remnants of which are providing a
short-lived extended photosphere to the central star. In this case, we would
expect them to show the signature of fast rotation.
