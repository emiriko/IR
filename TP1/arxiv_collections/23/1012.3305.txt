A scientometric analysis of Monte Carlo simulation and Monte Carlo codes has
been performed over a set of representative scholarly journals related to
radiation physics. The results of this study are reported and discussed. They
document and quantitatively appraise the role of Monte Carlo methods and codes
in scientific research and engineering applications.
