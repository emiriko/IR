We present a detailed analysis of the first very long baseline interferometry
(VLBI) detection of the radio remnant of supernova 1987A. The VLBI data taken
in 2007 and 2008 at 1.4 and 1.7 GHz, respectively, provide images sensitive to
angular scales from 0.1" to 0.7", the highest resolution to date at radio
frequencies. The results reveal two extended lobes with an overall morphology
consistent with observations at lower resolutions. We find evidence of
small-scale features in the radio shell, which possibly consist of compact
clumps near the inner surface of the shell. These features have angular extent
smaller than 0.2" and contribute less than 13% of the total remnant flux
density. No central source is detected in the VLBI images. We place a 3-sigma
flux density limit of 0.3 mJy on any pulsar or pulsar wind nebula at 1.7 GHz.
