The EMC- and Cronin-effects are explained by a unitarized evolution equation,
where the shadowing and antishadowing corrections are dynamically produced by
gluon fusions. For this sake, an alternative form of the GLR-MQ-ZRS equation is
derived. The resulting integrated and unintegrated gluon distributions in
proton and nuclei are used to analyze the contributions of the initial parton
distributions to the nuclear suppression factor in heavy ion collisions. A
simulation of the fractional energy loss is extracted from the RHIC and LHC
data, where the contributions of the nuclear shadowing and antishadowing
effects are considered. We find a rapid crossover from week energy loss to
strong energy loss at a universal critical energy of gluon jet $E_c\sim 10
GeV$.
