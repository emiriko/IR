In the recent work of Vanne and Saenz [Phys. Rev. A 75, 063403 (2007)] the
quasistatic limit of the velocity gauge strong-field approximation describing
the ionization rate of atomic or molecular systems exposed to linearly
polarized laser fields was derived. It was shown that in the low-frequency
limit the ionization rate is proportional to the laser frequency (for a
constant intensity of the laser field). In the present work I show that for
circularly polarized laser fields the ionization rate is proportional to higher
powers of the laser frequency for hydrogenic atoms. The new analytical
expressions for asymptotic ionization rates (which become accurate in the
quasistatic limit) contain no summations over multiphoton contributions. For
very low laser frequencies (optical or infrared), these expressions usually
remain with an order-of-magnitude agreement with the velocity gauge
strong-field approximation.
