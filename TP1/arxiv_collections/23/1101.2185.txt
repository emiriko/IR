Measurements of luminosity obtained using the ATLAS detector during early
running of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV are presented.
The luminosity is independently determined using several detectors and multiple
algorithms, each having different acceptances, systematic uncertainties and
sensitivity to background. The ratios of the luminosities obtained from these
methods are monitored as a function of time and of mu, the average number of
inelastic interactions per bunch crossing. Residual time- and mu-dependence
between the methods is less than 2% for 0<mu<2.5. Absolute luminosity
calibrations, performed using beam separation scans, have a common systematic
uncertainty of +/-11, dominated by the measurement of the LHC beam currents.
After calibration, the luminosities obtained from the different methods differ
by at most +/-2%. The visible cross sections measured using the beam scans are
compared to predictions obtained with the PYTHIA and PHOJET event generators
and the ATLAS detector simulation.
