Using samples of 2.25*10^8 J/psi events and 1.06*10^8 psi' events collected
with the BES III detector, we study the f0(980) to a0(980) and a0(980) to
f0(980) transitions in the processes J/psi --> phi f0(980) --> phi a0(980) and
chi_c1 --> pi^0 a0(980) --> pi^0 f0(980), respectively. Evidence for f0(980)
--> a0(980) is found with a significance of 3.4 sigma, while in the case of
a0(980) --> f0(980) transition, the significance is 1.9 sigma. Measurements and
upper limits of both branching ratios and mixing intensities are determined.
