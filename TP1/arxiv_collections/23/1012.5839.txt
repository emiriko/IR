In the recent paper of Hooper & Goodenough (1010.2752) it was reported that
gamma-ray emission from the Galactic Center region contains an excess compared
to the contributions from the large-scale diffuse emission and known point
sources. This excess was argued to be consistent with a signal from
annihilation of Dark Matter with a power law density profile. We reanalyze the
Fermi data and find instead that it is consistent with the "standard model" of
diffuse emission and of known point sources. The main reason for the
discrepancy with the interpretation of 1010.2752 is different (as compared to
the previous works) spectrum of the point source at the Galactic Center assumed
in 1010.2752. We discuss possible reasons for such an interpretation.
