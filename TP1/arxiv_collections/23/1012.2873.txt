We propose a Lie-algebraic duality approach to analyze non-equilibrium
evolution of closed dynamical systems and thermodynamics of interacting quantum
lattice models (formulated in terms of Hubbard-Stratonovich dynamical systems).
The first part of the paper utilizes a geometric Hilbert-space-invariant
formulation of unitary time-evolution, where a quantum Hamiltonian is viewed as
a trajectory in an abstract Lie algebra, while the sought-after evolution
operator is a trajectory in a dynamic group, generated by the algebra via
exponentiation. The evolution operator is uniquely determined by the
time-dependent dual generators that satisfy a system of differential equations,
dubbed here dual Schrodinger-Bloch equations, which represent a viable
alternative to the conventional Schrodinger formulation. These dual
Schrodinger-Bloch equations are derived and analyzed on a number of specific
examples. It is shown that deterministic dynamics of a closed classical
dynamical system occurs as action of a symmetry group on a classical manifold
and is driven by the same dual generators as in the corresponding quantum
problem. This represents quantum-to-classical correspondence. In the second
part of the paper, we further extend the Lie algebraic approach to a wide class
of interacting many-particle lattice models. A generalized Hubbard-Stratonovich
transform is proposed and it is used to show that the thermodynamic partition
function of a generic many-body quantum lattice model can be expressed in terms
of traces of single-particle evolution operators governed by the dynamic
Hubbard-Stratonovich fields. Finally, we derive Hubbard-Stratonovich dynamical
systems for the Bose-Hubbard model and a quantum spin model and use the
Lie-algebraic approach to obtain new non-perturbative dual descriptions of
these theories.
