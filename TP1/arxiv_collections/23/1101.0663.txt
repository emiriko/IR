We discuss a topic on the role of computer graphics in the production of
documentaries, which is often ignored in favor of other topics. Typically,
except for some rare occasions, documentary producers and computer scientists
or digital artists that do computer graphics are relatively far apart in their
domains and rarely intercommunicate to have a joint production; yet it happens,
and perhaps more so in the present and the future.
  We attempt to classify the documentaries on the amount and techniques of
computer graphics used for documentaries. We come up with the initial
categories such as "plain" (no graphics), "in-between", "all-out" -- nearly
100% of the documentary consisting of computer-generated imagery. Computer
graphics can be used to enhance the scenery, fill in the gaps in the missing
storyline pieces, or animate between scenes. It can incorporate stereoscopic
effects for higher viewer impression as well as interactivity aspects. It can
also be used simply in old archived image and film restoration.
