In the framework of the General Relativity we show that from three
generalizations of Killing vector fields, namely f-symbols, symmetric
St\"{a}ckel-Killing and antisymmetric Killing-Yano tensors, some conserved
currents can be obtained through adequate contractions of the above mentioned
objects with rank four tensors having the properties of Bel or Bel-Robinson
tensors in Einstein spaces.
