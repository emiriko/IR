Motivated by recent high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
experiments in the quantum Hall regime both on massive two-dimensional electron
gas and on graphene, we consider theoretically the disorder averaged nonlocal
correlations of the local density of states (LDoS) for electrons moving in a
smooth disordered potential in the presence of a high magnetic field. The
intersection of two quantum cyclotron rings around the two different positions
of the STM tip, correlated by the local disorder, provides peaks in the spatial
dispersion of the LDoS-LDoS correlations when the intertip distance matches the
sum of the two quantum Larmor radii. The energy dependence displays also
complex behavior: for the local LDoS-LDoS average (i.e., at coinciding tip
positions), sharp positive correlations are obtained for tip voltages near
Landau level, and weak anticorrelations otherwise.
