We have studied the extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit. The
Hamiltonian analyzed consists of the effective on-site interaction U and the
intersite density-density interactions Wij (both: nearest-neighbour and
next-nearest-neighbour). The model can be considered as a simple effective
model of charge ordered insulators. The phase diagrams and thermodynamic
properties of this system have been determined within the variational approach,
which treats the on-site interaction term exactly and the intersite
interactions within the mean-field approximation. Our investigation of the
general case taking into account for the first time the effects of
longer-ranged density-density interaction (repulsive and attractive) as well as
possible phase separations shows that, depending on the values of the
interaction parameters and the electron concentration, the system can exhibit
not only several homogeneous charge ordered (CO) phases, but also various phase
separated states (CO-CO and CO-nonordered). One finds that the model considered
exhibits very interesting multicritical behaviours and features, including
among others bicritical, tricritical, critical-end and isolated critical
points.
