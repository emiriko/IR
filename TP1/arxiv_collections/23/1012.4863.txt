Many biological and physical systems exhibit population-density dependent
transitions to synchronized oscillations in a process often termed "dynamical
quorum sensing". Synchronization frequently arises through chemical
communication via signaling molecules distributed through an external media. We
study a simple theoretical model for dynamical quorum sensing: a heterogenous
population of limit-cycle oscillators diffusively coupled through a common
media. We show that this model exhibits a rich phase diagram with four
qualitatively distinct mechanisms fueling population-dependent transitions to
global oscillations, including a new type of transition we term "dynamic
death". We derive a single pair of analytic equations that allows us to
calculate all phase boundaries as a function of population density and show
that the model reproduces many of the qualitative features of recent
experiments of BZ catalytic particles as well as synthetically engineered
bacteria.
