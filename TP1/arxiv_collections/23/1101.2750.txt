Directional detection is a promising Dark Matter search strategy. Indeed,
WIMP-induced recoils present a direction dependence toward the Cygnus
constellation, while background-induced recoils exhibit an isotropic
distribution in the galactic rest frame. Taking advantage on these
characteristic features and even in the presence of a sizeable background, we
show for the first time the possibility to constrain the WIMP properties, both
from particle and galactic halo physics, leading to an identification of
non-baryonic Dark Matter. However, such results need highly accurate track
reconstruction which should be reachable by the MIMAC detector using a
dedicated readout combined with a likelihood analysis of recoiling nuclei.
