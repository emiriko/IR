We consider the gravitational effect of quantum wave packets when quantum
mechanics, gravity, and thermodynamics are simultaneously considered. Under the
assumption of a thermodynamic origin of gravity, we propose a general equation
to describe the gravitational effect of quantum wave packets. In the classical
limit, this equation agrees with Newton's law of gravitation. For quantum wave
packets, however, it predicts a repulsive gravitational effect. We propose an
experimental scheme using superfluid helium to test this repulsive
gravitational effect. Our studies show that, with present technology such as
superconducting gravimetry and cold atom interferometry, tests of the repulsive
gravitational effect for superfluid helium are within experimental reach.
