Various dispersions of attractive particles are known to aggregate into
patterns of vorticity-aligned stripes when sheared in confined geometries. We
report a thorough experimental investigation of such shear-induced vorticity
alignment through direct visualization of carbon black gels in both simple
plane shear and rotational shear cells. Control parameters such as the gap
width, the strain rate, and the gel concentration are systematically varied. It
is shown that in steady states the wavelength of the striped pattern depends
linearly on the gap width $h$ while being insensitive to both the gel
concentration $C$ and the shear rate $\gp$. The width of the vorticity-aligned
flocs coincides with the gap width and is also independent of $C$ and $\gp$,
which hints to a simple picture in terms of compressible cylindrical flocs.
Finally, we show that there exists a critical shear rate $\gp_c$ above which
structuration does not occur and that $\gp_c$ scales as $h^{-\alpha}$ with
$\alpha=1.4\pm 0.1$ independently of $C$. This extensive data set should open
the way to quantitative modelling of the vorticity alignment phenomenon in
attractive colloidal systems.
