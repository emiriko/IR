We generate a new complete equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter for a
wide range of temperatures, densities, and proton fractions ready for use in
astrophysical simulations of supernovae and neutron star mergers. Our previous
two papers tabulated the EOS at over 180,000 grid points in the temperature
range $T$ = 0 to 80 MeV, the density range $n_B$ = 10$^{-8}$ to 1.6 fm$^{-3}$,
and the proton fraction range $Y_P$ = 0 to 0.56. In this paper we combine these
data points using a suitable interpolation scheme to generate a single equation
of state table on a finer grid. This table is thermodynamically consistent and
conserves entropy during adiabatic compression tests. We present various
thermodynamic quantities and the composition of matter in the new EOS, along
with several comparisons with existing EOS tables. Our equation of state table
is available for download.
