The structure of a relativistically hot, strongly magnetized jet is
investigated at large distances from the source. Asymptotic equations are
derived describing collimation and acceleration of the externally confined jet.
Conditions are found for the transformation of the thermal energy into the
fluid kinetic energy or into the Poynting flux. Simple scalings are presented
for the jet collimation angle and Lorentz factors.
