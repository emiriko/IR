Diamond photonics provides an attractive architecture to explore room
temperature cavity quantum electrodynamics and to realize scalable multi-qubit
computing. Here we review the present state of diamond photonic technology. The
design, fabrication and characterization of a novel triangular cross section
nanobeam cavity produced in a single crystal diamond is demonstrated. The
present cavity design, based on a triangular cross section allows vertical
confinement and better signal collection efficiency than that of slab-based
nanocavities, and eliminates the need for a pre-existing membrane. The nanobeam
is fabricated by Focused-Ion-Beam (FIB) patterning. The cavity is characterized
by a confocal photoluminescence. The modes display quality factors of Q ~220
and are deviated in wavelength by only ~1.7nm from the NV- color center zero
phonon line (ZPL). The measured results are found in good agreement with 3D
Finite-Difference-Time-Domain (FDTD) calculations. A more advanced cavity
design with Q=22,000 is modeled, showing the potential for high-Q
implementations using the triangular cavity design. The prospects of this
concept and its application to spin non-demolition measurement and quantum
computing are discussed.
