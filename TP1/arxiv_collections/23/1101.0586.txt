The recent discovery of a Higgs boson at the electroweak scale appears to
point toward supersymmetry, as the most likely mechanism for protecting a
scalar boson mass from enormous radiative corrections. The earlier discovery of
neutrino masses similarly appears to point toward grand unification of
nongravitational forces, which permits (for neutrinos) Majorana masses, Dirac
masses, and a seesaw mechanism to drive the observed masses down to low values.
A third major discovery, cosmic acceleration suggesting a relatively tiny
cosmological constant, appears to point toward truly revolutionary new physics.
Many other problems and mysteries also indicate a need for fresh ideas at the
most fundamental level. Here a picture is proposed in which standard physics
and its extensions are obtained (through a nontrivial set of arguments) from
statistical counting and the local geography of our universe. The unavoidable
qualitative predictions include supersymmetry, $SO(N)$ grand unification, and a
drastic diminishing of the usual cosmological constant. Some additional new
predictions are more quantitative and should be testable in the near future.
For example, the theory predicts new fundamental spin $1/2$ particles which can
be produced in pairs through their couplings to vector bosons. The
lowest-energy of these should have a mass $m_{1/2}$ comparable to the Higgs
mass $m_h$ (with $m_{1/2} = m_h$ in the simplest model). These particles should
therefore be detectable in collider experiments, and they are also dark matter
candidates.
