We investigate a game-theoretic model of a social system where both the rules
of the game and the interaction structure are shaped by the behavior of the
agents. We call this type of model, with several types of feedback couplings
from the behavior of the agents to their environment, a multiadaptive game. Our
model has a complex behavior with several regimes of different dynamic behavior
accompanied by different network topological properties. Some of these regimes
are characterized by heterogeneous, hierarchical interaction networks, where
cooperation and network topology coemerge from the dynamics.
