Electromagnetic properties of quark-like particles are examined in a
classical field model involving extended dual electromagnetic fields. These can
have fractional charges and a confining potential that derives essentially
completely from a short-range weaker potential. The combined potentials exhibit
an asymptotically free spherical surface and contribute to the masses of the
particles. The quarks are shown to have an intrinsic symmetry that describes
their structures in hadrons. Multi- quark solutions are easily obtained for
both stable and unstable particles. Each quark can undergo simple harmonic
motion in a range of frequencies.
