This is an expanded version of a series of lectures delivered by the second
author in June, 2009. It describes the results of three of the authors' papers
on ASEP, from the derivation of exact formulas for configuration probabilities,
through Fredholm determinant representation, to asymptotics for ASEP with step
initial condition establishing KPZ universality. Although complete proofs are
in general not given, at least the main elements of them are.
