We analyze the elliptic flow parameter v_2 in Pb+Pb collisions at
sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76 TeV and in Au+Au collisions at sqrt{s_{NN}} =200 GeV using
a hybrid model in which the evolution of the quark gluon plasma is described by
ideal hydrodynamics with a state-of-the-art lattice QCD equation of state, and
the subsequent hadronic stage by a hadron cascade model. For initial
conditions, we employ Monte-Carlo versions of the Glauber and the
Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi models and compare results with each other. We demonstrate
that the differential elliptic flow v_2(p_T) hardly changes when the collision
energy increases, whereas the integrated v_2 increases due to the enhancement
of mean transverse momentum. The amount of increase of both v_2 and mean p_T
depends significantly on the model of initialization.
