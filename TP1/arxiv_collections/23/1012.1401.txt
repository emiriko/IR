Bound entangled states are the exotic objects in the entangled world. They
require entanglement to create them, but once they are formed, it is not
possible to locally distill any free entanglement from them. It is only until
recently that a few bound entangled states were realized in the laboratory.
Motivated by these experiments, we propose schemes for creating various classes
of bound entangled states with photon polarization. These include
Acin-Bruss-Lewenstein-Sanpara states, Dur's states, Lee-Lee-Kim bound entangled
states, and an unextendible-product-basis bound entangled state.
