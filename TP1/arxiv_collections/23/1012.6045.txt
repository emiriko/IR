Columns of d^2 x N matrices are shown to create different sets of N operators
acting on $d$-dimensional Hilbert space. This construction corresponds to a
formalism of the star-product of operator symbols. The known bases are shown to
be partial cases of generic formulas derived by using d^2 x N matrices as a
source for constructing arbitrary bases. The known examples of the SIC-POVM,
MUBs, and the phase-space description of qubit states are considered from the
viewpoint of the developed unified approach. Star-product schemes are
classified with respect to associated d^2 x N matrices. In particular, unitary
matrices correspond to self-dual schemes. Such self-dual star-product schemes
are shown to be determined by dequantizers which do not form POVM.
