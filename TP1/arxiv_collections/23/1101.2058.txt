In this paper, the generalized coherent state for quantum systems with
degenerate spectra is introduced. Then, the nonclassicality features and
number-phase entropic uncertainty relation of two particular degenerate quantum
systems are studied. Finally, using the Gazeau-Klauder coherent states
approach, time evolution of some of the nonclassical properties of the coherent
states corresponding to the considered physical systems are discussed.
