We propose a way for implementing quantum information transfer with two
superconducting flux qubits, by coupling them to a resonator. This proposal
does not require adjustment of the level spacings or uniformity in the device
parameters. Moreover, neither adiabatic passage nor a second-order detuning is
needed by this proposal, thus the operation can be performed much faster when
compared with the previous proposals.
