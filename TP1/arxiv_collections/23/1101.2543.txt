We explore the evolution of the emissions by accelerated electrons in shocked
shells driven by jets in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Focusing on powerful
sources which host luminous quasars, we evaluated the broadband emission
spectra by properly taking into account adiabatic and radiative cooling effects
on the electron distribution. The synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton
(IC) scattering of various photons that are mainly produced in the accretion
disc and dusty torus are considered as radiation processes. We show that the
resultant radiation is dominated by the IC emission for compact sources (<
10kpc), whereas the synchrotron radiation is more important for larger sources.
We also compare the shell emissions with those expected from the lobe under the
assumption that a fractions of the energy deposited in the shell and lobe
carried by the non-thermal electrons are $\epsilon_e \sim 0.01$ and
$\epsilon_{e, lobe} \sim 1$, respectively. Then, we find that the shell
emissions are brighter than the lobe ones at infra-red and optical bands when
the source size is > 10kpc, and the IC emissions from the shell at > 10 GeV can
be observed with the absence of contamination from the lobe irrespective of the
source size. In particular, it is predicted that, for most powerful nearby
sources ($L_j \sim 10^{47} ergs s^{-1}$), TeV gamma-rays produced via the IC
emissions can be detected by the modern Cherenkov telescopes such as MAGIC,
HESS and VERITAS.
