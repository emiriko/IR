Recent simulations of classical novae on oxygen-neon white-dwarf stars
indicate that the isotopic ratio 32S/33S has the potential to be a remarkable
indicator of presolar grains of nova origin. The 33S(p,\gamma)34Cl reaction
influences this ratio directly by destroying 33S in novae. Additionally,
\beta-delayed \gamma-rays from the metastable state of 34Cl (t_{1/2} = 32 min)
have been suggested to be potential nova observables. We have measured the
branches for known 33S(p,\gamma)34Cl resonances that are activated at
temperatures relevant to oxygen-neon novae. We provide the first reliable
uncertainties on these branches and the first upper limits for several
previously unmeasured branches.
