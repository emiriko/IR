We study the detection of the $t^\prime$ of a fourth family during the early
running of LHC with 7 TeV collision energy and 1 fb$^{-1}$ integrated
luminosity. By use of a neural network we show that it is feasible to search
for the $t'$ even with a mass close to the unitarity upper bound, which is in
the 500 to 600 GeV range. We also present results for the Tevatron with $10
\,\, \textrm{fb}^{-1}$. In both cases the search for a fourth family quark
doublet can be significantly enhanced if one incorporates the contribution that
the $b'$ can make to a $t'$-like signal. Thus the bound on the mass of a
degenerate quark doublet should be stronger than the bounds obtained by
treating $t'$ and $b'$ in isolation.
