The KLOE-2 detector is a powerful tool to study the temporal evolution of
quantum entangled pairs of kaons. The accuracy of such studies may in principle
be limited by the interaction of neutral kaons with thermal photons present
inside the detector. Therefore, it is crucial to estimate the probability of
this effect and its influence on the interference patterns. In this paper we
introduce the phenomenology of the interaction of photons with neutral kaons
and present and discuss the obtained quantitative results.
