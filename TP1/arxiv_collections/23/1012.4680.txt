We have explored properties of an extension of the Inert Doublet Model by the
addition of an extra non-inert scalar doublet. The model offers a possibility
of CP violation in the scalar sector and a candidate for the Dark Matter.
Allowed regions in the plane spanned by the mass of the Dark-Matter particle
and the lightest neutral Higgs particle have been identified, and constraints
from direct and indirect-detection experiments have been studied. For favorable
parameter regions one may observe long-lived charged particles produced at the
LHC.
