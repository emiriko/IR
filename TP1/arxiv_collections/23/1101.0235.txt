In this work we investigate whether browser-native technologies can be used
to perform photo manipulation tasks e.g cropping, resizing or rotating an image
within the current mainstream browser. By the use of a case study we will
analyze problems that have occurred during the implementation of a prototype
web application that utilizes browser-native web technology in order to create
an online version of a real world photo scrapbook. Implementation of a
prototype will allows us to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of current web
technology when it comes to browser-based image manipulation. Furthermore we
explore the possibilities of the Ajax in combination Canvas, SVG and VML to
provide a more interactive graphical user interface to perform image
manipulation tasks on the web.
