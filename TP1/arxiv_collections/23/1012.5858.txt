Following Verlinde's recent work on the origin of gravity and the laws of
Newton, we consider further the origin of the starting point of Verlinde's work
and Unruh effect. Simple derivations are given for this starting point and
Unruh effect with the standard theory about quantum mechanics, special
relativity and 'vacuum' background based on the gauge field theory. Our studies
give the physical origin of the Planck length. The present work supports
further the idea that gravity is not a fundamental force. In the present work,
the concept of holographic screen is not absolutely necessary to derive the
universal gravity and the laws of Newton.
