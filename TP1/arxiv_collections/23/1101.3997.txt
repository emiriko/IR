We extend the formalism of integrable operators a' la
Its-Izergin-Korepin-Slavnov to matrix-valued convolution operators on a
semi-infinite interval and to matrix integral operators with a kernel of the
form E_1^T(x) E_2(y)/(x+y) thus proving that their resolvent operators can be
expressed in terms of solutions of some specific Riemann-Hilbert problems. We
also describe some applications, mainly to a noncommutative version of
Painleve' II (recently introduced by Retakh and Rubtsov), a related
noncommutative equation of Painleve' type. We construct a particular family of
solutions of the noncommutative Painleve' II that are pole-free (for real
values of the variables) and hence analogous to the Hastings-McLeod solution of
(commutative) Painleve' II. Such a solution plays the same role as its
commutative counterpart relative to the Tracy-Widom theorem, but for the
computation of the Fredholm determinant of a matrix version of the Airy kernel.
