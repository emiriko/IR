We present a possible construction of coherent states on the unit circle as
configuration space. In our approach the phase space is the product Z x S^1.
Because of the duality of canonical coordinates and momenta, i.e. the angular
variable and the integers, this formulation can also be interpreted as coherent
states over an infinite periodic chain. For the construction we use the analogy
with our quantization over a finite periodic chain where the phase space was
Z_M x Z_M. Properties of the coherent states constructed in this way are
studied and the coherent states are shown to satisfy the resolution of unity.
