We study the influence of the environment on the evolution of galaxies by
investigating the luminosity function (LF) of galaxies of different
morphological types and colours at different environmental density levels.
  We construct the LFs separately for galaxies of different morphology (spiral
and elliptical) and of different colours (red and blue) using data from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), correcting the luminosities for the intrinsic
absorption. We use the global luminosity density field to define different
environments, and analyse the environmental dependence of galaxy morphology and
colour. The smoothed bootstrap method is used to calculate confidence regions
of the derived luminosity functions.
  We find a strong environmental dependency for the LF of elliptical galaxies.
The LF of spiral galaxies is almost environment independent, suggesting that
spiral galaxy formation mechanisms are similar in different environments.
Absorption by the intrinsic dust influences the bright-end of the LF of spiral
galaxies. After attenuation correction, the brightest spiral galaxies are still
about 0.5 mag less luminous than the brightest elliptical galaxies, except in
the least dense environment, where spiral galaxies dominate the LF at every
luminosity. Despite the extent of the SDSS survey, the influence of single rich
superclusters is present in the galactic LF of the densest environment.
