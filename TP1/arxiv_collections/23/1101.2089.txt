A strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) of heavy constituent
quasi-particles is studied by a path-integral Monte-Carlo method. This approach
is a quantum generalization of the model developed by Gelman, Shuryak and
Zahed. It is shown that this method is able to reproduce the QCD lattice
equation of state and also yields valuable insight into the internal structure
of the QGP. The results indicate that the QGP reveals liquid-like rather than
gas-like properties. At temperatures just above the critical one it was found
that bound quark-antiquark states still survive. These states are bound by
effective string-like forces and turns out to be colorless. At the temperature
as large as twice the critical one no bound states are observed. Quantum
effects turned out to be of prime importance in these simulations.
