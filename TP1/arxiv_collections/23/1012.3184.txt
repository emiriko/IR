During the last decade, the CDF and D\O\ experiments at the Tevatron have
been pursuing an extensive heavy flavor spectroscopy program that provides
significant advancements in the understanding of masses of ground state and
orbitally excited b-hadrons, and phenomenology of exotic XYZ states. It also
yields a breakthrough in our knowledge of bottom baryons with the first
observation of the Sigma_b^{+-(*)}, Xi_b^-, and Omega_b^- families. After
briefly reviewing previous results, I will focus on the latest CDF measurements
of Sigma_b^{+-(*)} baryons and exotic J/psiphi states, both updated to 6
fb^{-1} of data, and on a new analysis of charmed baryons
