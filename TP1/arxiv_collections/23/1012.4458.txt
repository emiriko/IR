We explore the model-independent constraints from cosmology on a dark-matter
particle with no prominent standard model interactions that interacts and
thermalizes with other particles in a hidden sector. Without specifying
detailed hidden-sector particle physics, we characterize the relevant physics
by the annihilation cross section, mass, and temperature ratio of the hidden to
visible sectors. While encompassing the standard cold WIMP scenario, we do not
require the freeze-out process to be nonrelativistic. Rather, freeze-out may
also occur when dark matter particles are semirelativistic or relativistic. We
solve the Boltzmann equation to find the conditions that hidden-sector dark
matter accounts for the observed dark-matter density, satisfies the
Tremaine-Gunn bound on dark-matter phase space density, and has a
free-streaming length consistent with cosmological constraints on the matter
power spectrum. We show that for masses <1.5 keV no region of parameter space
satisfies all these constraints. This is a gravitationally-mediated lower bound
on the dark-matter mass for any model in which the primary component of dark
matter once had efficient interactions -- even if it has never been in
equilibrium with the standard model.
