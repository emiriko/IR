Context. HC3N is a molecule that is mainly associated with Galactic
star-forming regions, but it has also been detected in extragalactic
environments. Aims. To present the first extragalactic survey of HC3N, when
combining earlier data from the literature with six new single-dish detections,
and to compare HC3N with other molecular tracers (HCN, HNC), as well as other
properties (silicate absorption strength, IR flux density ratios, C II flux,
and megamaser activity). Methods. We present mm IRAM 30 m, OSO 20 m, and SEST
observations of HC3N rotational lines (mainly the J = 10-9 transition) and of
the J = 1-0 transitions of HCN and HNC. Our combined HC3N data account for 13
galaxies (excluding the upper limits reported for the non-detections), while we
have HCN and HNC data for more than 20 galaxies. Results. A preliminary
definition "HC3N-luminous galaxy" is made based upon the HC3N/HCN ratio. Most
(~80 %) HC3N-luminous galaxies seem to be deeply obscured galaxies and
(U)LIRGs. A majority (~60 % or more) of the HC3N-luminous galaxies in the
sample present OH mega- or strong kilomaser activity. A possible explanation is
that both HC3N and OH megamasers need warm dust for their excitation.
Alternatively, the dust that excites the OH megamaser offers protection against
UV destruction of HC3N. A high silicate absorption strength is also found in
several of the HC3N-luminous objects, which may help the HC3N to survive.
Finally, we find that a high HC3N/HCN ratio is related to a high dust
temperature and a low C II flux.
