We study the deformed conformal-Poincare symmetries consistent with the
Snyder--de Sitter space. A relativistic particle model invariant under these
deformed symmetries is given. This model is used to provide a gauge independent
derivation of the Snyder--de Sitter algebra. Our results are valid in the
leading order in the parameters appearing in the model.
