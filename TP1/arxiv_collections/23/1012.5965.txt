The set of quantum Gaussian channels acting on one bosonic mode can be
classified according to the action of the group of Gaussian unitaries. We look
for bounds on the classical capacity for channels belonging to such a
classification. Lower bounds can be efficiently calculated by restricting to
Gaussian encodings, for which we provide analytical expressions.
