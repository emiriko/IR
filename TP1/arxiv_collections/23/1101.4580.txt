We report on our progress in calculating the B-meson decay constants and
B^0-bar B^0 mixing parameters using domain-wall light quarks and relativistic
b-quarks. We present our computational method and show some preliminary results
obtained on the coarser (a approx 0.11fm) 24^3 lattices. This work is presented
on behalf of the RBC and UKQCD collaborations.
