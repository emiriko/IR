Some real functions f induce mean of positive numbers and the matrix
monotonicity gives a possibility for means of positive definite matrices.
Moreover, such a function f can define linear mapping beta on matrices (which
is basic in the constructions of monotone metrics). The present subject is to
check the complete positivity of beta in the case of a few concrete functions
f. This problem has been motivated by applications in quantum information.
