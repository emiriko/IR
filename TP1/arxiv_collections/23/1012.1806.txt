We present the total cross sections at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)
in the strong coupling for single and double charged Higgs production via weak
boson fusion. Results are obtained via the structure function approach, which
builds upon the approximate, though very accurate, factorization of the QCD
corrections between the two quark lines. The theoretical uncertainty on the
total cross sections at the LHC from higher order corrections and the parton
distribution uncertainties are estimated at the 2% level each for a wide range
of Higgs boson masses.
