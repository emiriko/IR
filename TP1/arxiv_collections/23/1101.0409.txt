We have imaged spontaneously created arrays of vortices (magnetic flux
quanta), generated in a superconducting film quenched through its transition
temperature at rates around $10^9 K/s$. From these images, we calculated the
positional correlation functions for two vortices and for 3 vortices. We
compared our results with simulations of the time dependent Ginzburg Landau
equation in 2D. The results are in agreement with the Kibble-Zurek scenario of
spontaneous vortex creation. In addition, the correlation functions are
insensitive to the presence of a gauge field.
