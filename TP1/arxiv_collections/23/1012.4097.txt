For a fixed d-regular graph H, a random n-lift is obtained by replacing each
vertex v of H by a "fibre" containing n vertices, then placing a uniformly
random matching between fibres corresponding to adjacent vertices of H. We show
that with extremely high probability, all eigenvalues of the lift that are not
eigenvalues of H, have order O(sqrt(d)). In particular, if H is Ramanujan then
its n-lift is with high probability nearly Ramanujan. We also show that any
exceptionally large eigenvalues of the n-lift that are not eigenvalues of H,
are overwhelmingly likely to have been caused by a dense subgraph of size
O(|E(H)|).
