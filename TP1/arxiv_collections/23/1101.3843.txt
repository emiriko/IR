In this paper, we show that there are non-properly embedded minimal surfaces
with finite topology in a simply connected Riemannian 3-manifold with
nonpositive curvature. We show this result by constructing a non-properly
embedded minimal plane in hyperbolic 3-space. Hence, this gives a
counterexample to Calabi-Yau conjecture for embedded minimal surfaces in the
negative curvature case.
