The effect of chemical doping of graphene films on the photovoltaic
properties of the graphene/silicon Schottky junction solar cells was
investigated. Thionyl chloride modification greatly enhanced the conductivity
of graphene film, resulting in a significant improvement in cell performance
with a 3-fold increase in conversion efficiency (up to 3.9%) and good
short-term stability.
