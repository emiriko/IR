We present a general classification of the perturbations to the Kitaev model
on the basis of their effect on it's spin correlation functions. We derive a
necessary and sufficient condition for the spin correlators to exhibit a long
ranged power-law behavior in the presence of such perturbations. We
substantiate our result by a study of the phase diagram of the Kitaev model
augmented by a loop term and perturbed by an Ising term, within a RVB
mean-field theory. We estimate the stability of the spin-liquid phase against
such perturbations and show that this model exhibits both
confinement-deconfinement transitions from spin liquid to
antiferromagnetic/spin-chain/ferromagnetic phases as well as topological
quantum phase transitions between gapped and gapless spin liquid phases.
