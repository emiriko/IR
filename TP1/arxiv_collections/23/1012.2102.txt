The caloric effect in Gd5Si2Ge2 compound is studied experimentally and
theoretically. The first-order phase transition is sensitive to both magnetic
field and pressure. It indicates that the influences of magnetic field and
pressure on the phase transition are virtually equivalent. Moreover, the
theoretical analyses reveal that the total entropy change is almost definite at
a certain Curie temperature whether the applied external field is magnetic
field or pressure. On the basis of theoretical analyses, the entropy change
simultaneously induced by magnetic field and hydrostatic pressure can be
obtained experimentally. As for Gd5Si2Ge2 compound, the entropy change curve is
broadened dramatically, and the refrigerant capacity is improved from 284.7 to
447.0 J/kg. Additionally, the required magnetic field in magnetic refrigeration
technique may be reduced by the application of hydrostatic pressure.
