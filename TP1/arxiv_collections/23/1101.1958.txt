The discipline of parallelization in the manifold of all possible measurement
results is shown to be responsible for the existence of all quantum
correlations, with the upper bound on their strength stemming from the maximum
of possible torsion within all norm-composing parallelizable manifolds. A
profound interplay is thus uncovered between the existence and strength of
quantum correlations and the parallelizability of the spheres S^0, S^1, S^3,
and S^7 necessitated by the four real division algebras. In particular,
parallelization within a unit 3-sphere is shown to be responsible for the
existence of EPR and Hardy type correlations, whereas that within a unit
7-sphere is shown to be responsible for the existence of all GHZ type
correlations. Moreover, parallelizability in general is shown to be equivalent
to the completeness criterion of EPR, in addition to necessitating the locality
condition of Bell. It is therefore shown to predetermine both the local
outcomes as well as the quantum correlations among the remote outcomes,
dictated by the infinite factorizability of points within the spheres S^3 and
S^7. The twin illusions of quantum entanglement and non-locality are thus shown
to stem from the topologically incomplete accountings of the measurement
results.
