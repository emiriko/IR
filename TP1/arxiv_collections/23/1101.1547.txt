The Parikh finite word automaton (PA) was introduced and studied by Klaedtke
and Ruess in 2003. Natural variants of the PA arise from viewing a PA
equivalently as an automaton that keeps a count of its transitions and
semilinearly constrains their numbers. Here we adopt this view and define the
affine PA (APA), that extends the PA by having each transition induce an affine
transformation on the PA registers, and the PA on letters (LPA), that restricts
the PA by forcing any two transitions on same letter to affect the registers
equally. Then we report on the expressiveness, closure, and decidability
properties of such PA variants. We note that deterministic PA are strictly
weaker than deterministic reversal-bounded counter machines. We develop
pumping-style lemmas and identify an explicit PA language recognized by no
deterministic PA.
