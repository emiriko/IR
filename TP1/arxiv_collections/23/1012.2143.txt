We examine the toroidal oscillations on the slowly rotating relativistic
stars in tensor-vector-scalar (TeVeS) theory with the Cowling approximation. As
a result, we find that perturbation equations describing the toroidal
oscillations are same equation form as in general relativity (GR). Although the
frequencies of toroidal oscillations in TeVeS are not so different from those
in GR, the momentum inertia depends strongly on the gravitational theory. Thus,
observing the frequencies of toroidal oscillations and momentum inertia with
high accuracy might reveal the gravitational theory in the strong-field regime.
