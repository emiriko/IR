We study a process termed "agglomerative percolation" (AP) in two dimensions.
Instead of adding sites or bonds at random, in AP randomly chosen clusters are
linked to all their neighbors. As a result the growth process involves a
diverging length scale near a critical point. Picking target clusters with
probability proportional to their mass leads to a runaway compact cluster.
Choosing all clusters equally leads to a continuous transition in a new
universality class for the square lattice, while the transition on the
triangular lattice has the same critical exponents as ordinary percolation.
