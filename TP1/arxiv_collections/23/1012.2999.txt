Data from E772 and E866 experiments on the Drell-Yan process exhibit a
significant nuclear suppression at large Feynman xF. We show that a
corresponding kinematic region does not allow to interpret this as a
manifestation of coherence or a Color Glass Condensate. We demonstrate,
however, that this suppression can be treated alternatively as an effective
energy loss proportional to initial energy. To eliminate suppression coming
from the coherence, we perform predictions for nuclear effects also at large
dilepton masses. Our calculations are in a good agreement with available data.
Since the kinematic limit can be also approached in transverse momenta pT, we
present in the RHIC energy range corresponding predictions for expected
large-pT suppression as well. Since a new experiment E906 planned at FNAL will
provide us with more precise data soon, we present also predictions for
expected large-xF nuclear suppression in this kinematic region.
