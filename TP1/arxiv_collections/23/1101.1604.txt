We present preliminary results of an optical-UV survey of the North Celestial
Cap (NCCS) based on ~5% areal coverage. The NCCS will provide good photometric
and astrometric data for the North Celestial Cap region (80 < DEC < 90). This
region, at galactic latitudes 17 < b < 37, is poorly covered by modern
CCD-based surveys. The expected number of detected objects in NCCS is
~1,500,000. We discuss issues of galactic structure, extinction, and the galaxy
clustering in the colour-colour diagrams.
