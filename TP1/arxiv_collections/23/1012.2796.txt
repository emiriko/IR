The Common Muon Proton Apparatus for Structure and Spectroscopy (COMPASS) at
CERN with its use of beams of naturally polarized muons scattered of a
polarized deuteron target, provides an environment of hard scattering between
quasi-real photons and partons. Hard hadron quasi-real photo-production with
polarized initial states is sensitive to the polarized gluon distribution
$\Delta$G through $\gamma$-gluon($g$) direct channels as well as $q$-$g$
resolved processes. Comparisons of unpolarized differential cross section
measurements to next-to-leading order (NLO) pQCD calculations are essential to
develop our understanding of proton-proton and lepton-nucleon scattering at
varying center of mass energies. These measurements are important to asses the
applicability of NLO pQCD in interpreting polarized processes. In this talk we
will discuss unidentified charged separated hadron production at low $Q^{2}$
(Q$^{2}<0.1 GeV^{2}/c^{2}$) and high transverse momenta (p$_{T}>1.0\,GeV/c$).
$<p_{T}^2>$ spectra of charged hadrons at $Q^{2}>1 GeV^{2}/c^{2}$ will also be
discussed.
