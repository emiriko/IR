Hadronic event shape distributions from e+e- annihilation measured by the
OPAL experiment at centre-of-mass energies between 91 GeV and 209 GeV are used
to determine the strong coupling {\alpha}S. The results are based on QCD
predictions complete to the next-to- next-to-leading order (NNLO), and on NNLO
calculations matched to the resummed next-to-leading-log-approximation terms
(NNLO+NLLA). The combined NNLO result from all variables and centre-of-mass
energies is {\alpha}S(mZ0) = 0.1201 {\pm} 0.0008(stat.) {\pm} 0.0013(exp.)
{\pm} 0.0010(had.) {\pm} 0.0024(theo.). while the combined NNLO+NLLA result is
{\alpha}S(mZ0) = 0.1189 {\pm} 0.0008(stat.) {\pm} 0.0016(exp.) {\pm}
0.0010(had.) {\pm} 0.0036(theo.). The completeness of the NNLO and NNLO+NLLA
results with respect to missing higher order contributions, studied by varying
the renormalization scale, is improved compared to previous results based on
NLO or NLO+NLLA predictions only. The observed energy dependence of {\alpha}S
agrees with the QCD prediction of asymptotic freedom and excludes the absence
of running.
