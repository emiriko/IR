We investigate the dynamics of the majority-rule opinion formation model when
voters experience differential latencies. With this extension, voters that just
adopted an opinion go into a latent state during which they are excluded from
the opinion formation process. The duration of the latent state depends on the
opinion adopted by the voter. The net result is a bias towards consensus on the
opinion that is associated with the shorter latency. We determine the exit
probability and time to consensus for systems of $N$ voters. Additionally, we
derive an asymptotic characterisation of the time to consensus by means of a
continuum model.
