We study effects of independent white noise on synchronization phenomena in
ensembles of coupled limit cycle oscillators with different native frequencies.
We consider a simple model where the ensemble consists of two inter-connected
clusters with own native frequencies and mean-field couplings are introduced
between intra- and inter-clusters. Taking advantage of nonlinear mean-field
coupling concept together with the law of large numbers valid in the
thermodynamic limit, we employ a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation approach that
turns out to be noise level-free analysis, to analytically derive the time
evolution of the order parameters. Showing the occurrence of bifurcations from
chaotic attractors in the deterministic limit to limit cycle ones with
increasing noise intensity, we confirm the occurrence of nonequilibrium phase
transitions including inter-cluster synchronization induced by external noise.
