Some of the Wolf-Rayet stars are found to have very high bolometric
luminosities (more than 1000000 solar). We employ the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR)
model atmospheres for their spectral analysis, which yields the bolometric
corrections. Distance and interstellar reddening also enter the luminosity
estimates. Among the Galactic stars, there is a group of very luminous WNL
stars (i.e. WR stars of late subtype from nitrogen sequence with hydrogen being
depleted in their atmospheres, but not absent). Their distances are often the
major source of uncertainty. From K-band spectroscopy we found a very luminous
star ($\log L/L_\odot = 6.5$) in the Galactic center region, which we termed
the Peony Star because of the form of its surrounding dusty nebula. A similar
group of very luminous WNL stars is found in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).
In the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) the majority of WR stars resides in binary
systems. The single WNL stars in the SMC are not very luminous. We conclude
that a significant number of very luminous WNL stars exist in the Galaxy and
the LMC. With initial masses above 60$M_\odot$, they apparently evolved
directly to the WNL stage without a prior excursion to the red side of the HRD.
At the low metallicity of the SMC, the binary channel may be dominant for the
formation of WR stars.
