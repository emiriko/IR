This work faces the problem of the origin of the logarithmic character of the
Gompertzian growth. We show that the macroscopic, deterministic Gompertz
equation describes the evolution from the initial state to the final stationary
value of the median of a log-normally distributed, stochastic process.
Moreover, by exploiting a stochastic variational principle, we account for
self-regulating feature of Gompertzian growths provided by self-consistent
feedback of relative density variations. This well defined conceptual framework
shows its usefulness by allowing a reliable control of the growth by external
actions.
