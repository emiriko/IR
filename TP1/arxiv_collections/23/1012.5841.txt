The asynchronous systems are non-deterministic real time, binary valued
models of the asynchronous circuits from electronics. Autonomy means that there
is no input and regularity means analogies with the (real) dynamical systems.
We introduce the concepts of dependence on the initial states and of
transitivity for these systems.
