In this work a collective of interacting stateless automata in a discrete
geometric $n$-dimenstional environment is considered as an integral
automaton-like computational dynamic object. For such distributed on the
environment object different approaches to definition of the measure of state
transition are possible. We propose an approach for defining what a state is.
The approach is based on the concept of relativity in Poincar\'e's
interpretation.
