A search for microscopic black hole production and decay in pp collisions at
a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV has been conducted by the CMS Collaboration at
the LHC, using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35
inverse picobarns. Events with large total transverse energy are analyzed for
the presence of multiple high-energy jets, leptons, and photons, typical of a
signal expected from a microscopic black hole. Good agreement with the expected
standard model backgrounds, dominated by QCD multijet production, is observed
for various final-state multiplicities. Limits on the minimum black hole mass
are set, in the range 3.5 -- 4.5 TeV, for a variety of parameters in a model
with large extra dimensions, along with model-independent limits on new physics
in these final states. These are the first direct limits on black hole
production at a particle accelerator.
