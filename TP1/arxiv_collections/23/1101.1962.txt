We suggest concrete models for self-correcting quantum memory by reporting
examples of local stabilizer codes in 3D that have no string logical operators.
Previously known local stabilizer codes in 3D all have string-like logical
operators, which make the codes non-self-correcting. We introduce a notion of
"logical string segments" to avoid difficulties in defining one dimensional
objects in discrete lattices. We prove that every string-like logical operator
of our code can be deformed to a disjoint union of short segments, and each
segment is in the stabilizer group. The code has surface-like logical operators
whose partial implementation has unsatisfied stabilizers along its boundary.
