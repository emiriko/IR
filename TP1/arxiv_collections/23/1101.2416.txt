In this paper, we develop new methods for the analysis of decentralized
control systems and we apply them to formation control problems. The basic
set-up consists of a system with multiple agents corresponding to the nodes of
a graph whose edges encode the information that is available to the agents. We
address the question of whether the information flow defined by the graph is
sufficient for the agents to accomplish a given task. Formation control is
concerned with problems in which agents are required to stabilize at a given
distance from other agents. In this context, the graph of a formation encodes
both the information flow and the distance constraints, by fixing the lengths
of the edges. A formation is said to be rigid if it cannot be continuously
deformed with the distance constraints satisfied; a formation is minimally
rigid if no distance constraint can be omitted without the formation losing its
rigidity. Hence, the graph underlying minimally rigid formation provides just
enough constraints to yield a rigid formation. An open question we will settle
is whether the information flow afforded by a minimally rigid graph is
sufficient to insure global stability. We show that the answer is negative in
the case of directed information flow. In this first part, we establish basic
properties of formation control in the plane. Formations and the associated
control problems are defined modulo rigid transformations. This fact has strong
implications on the geometry of the space of formations and on the feedback
laws, since they need to respect this invariance. We study both aspects here.
We show that the space of frameworks of n agents is CP(n-2) x (0,\infty). We
then illustrate how the non-trivial topology of this space relates to the
parametrization of the formation by inter-agent distances.
