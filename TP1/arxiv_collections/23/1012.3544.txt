On the basis of an analysis of a 3/4-filled two-dimensional (2D) extended
Hubbard model under the fluctuation-exchange approximation, we find Coulomb
frustrated phase separation (PS) in a region of nonzero temperature, where the
quantum critical phenomenon of charge ordering (CO) dominates. In quasi-2D
organic conductors on the verge of CO, this frustrated PS provides a mechanism
for generating spatial inhomogeneity, which is characterized by an extremely
slow relaxation and an intermediate length scale.
