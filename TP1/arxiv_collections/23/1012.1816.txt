Considering a Bose-Einstein condensed gas confined in one dimension with
periodic boundary conditions, we demonstrate that, very generally,
solitary-wave and rotational excitations coincide. This exact equivalence
allows us to establish connections between a number of effects that are present
in these two problems, many of which have been studied using the mean-field
approximation.
