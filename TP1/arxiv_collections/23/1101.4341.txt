We investigate the complexity of short symbolic sequences of chaotic
dynamical systems by using lossless compression algorithms. In particular, we
study Non-Sequential Recursive Pair Substitution (NSRPS), a lossless
compression algorithm first proposed by W. Ebeling et al. [Math. Biosc. 52,
1980] and Jim\'{e}nez-Monta\~{n}o et al. [arXiv:cond-mat/0204134, 2002]) which
was subsequently shown to be optimal. NSPRS has also been used to estimate
Entropy of written English (P. Grassberger [arXiv:physics/0207023, 2002]). We
propose a new measure of complexity - defined as the number of iterations of
NSRPS required to transform the input sequence into a constant sequence. We
test this measure on symbolic sequences of the Logistic map for various values
of the bifurcation parameter. The proposed measure of complexity is easy to
compute and is observed to be highly correlated with the Lyapunov exponent of
the original non-linear time series, even for very short symbolic sequences (as
short as 50 samples). Finally, we construct symbolic sequences from the
Skew-Tent map which are incompressible by popular compression algorithms like
WinZip, WinRAR and 7-Zip, but compressible by NSRPS.
