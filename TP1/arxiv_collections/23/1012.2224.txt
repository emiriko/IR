We performed spin-polarized density functional calculations of
lanthanide-series (Ln) iron oxypnictides LnFeAsO (Ln=La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, and
Gd) with constrained Fe magnetic moments, finding that in-plane dxy and
out-of-plane dyz orbital characters are preferred for small Fe magnetic
moments. Comparison of LnFeAsO compounds shows that the antiferromagnetism
(AFM) from the Fe dxy orbital is itinerantly driven by orbital-dependent
Fermi-surface nesting while AFM from the Fe dyz orbital is driven by
superexchange mechanism. The Fe magnetic moments of the two orbital characters
show different coupling strengths to Fermi-surface electrons
orbital-selectively, suggesting that they may play different roles in
superconductivity and in AFM, and making d orbital characters of the magnetic
moment resolvable by measuring the electronic structures.
