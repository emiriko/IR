We investigate the entanglement properties of finite spin rings, with
noncollinear Ising interaction between nearest neighbours. The orientations of
the Ising axes are determined either by the spin position within the ring
(model A) or by the direction of the bond (model B). In both cases, the
considered spin Hamiltonians have a point group symmetry, rather than a
translation invariance, as in spin rings with collinear Ising interaction. The
ground state of these models exhibit remarkable entanglement properties,
resembling GHZ-like states in the absence of an applied magnetic field (model
B). Besides, the application of an homogeneous magnetic field allows to modify
qualitatively the character of the ground state entanglement, switching from
multipartite to pairwise quantum correlations (both models A and B).
