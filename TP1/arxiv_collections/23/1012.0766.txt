Graphene nanostrips with single or a few layers can be made into bending
resonators with extremely high sensitivity to environment changes. In this work
we study the effect of interlayer shear on resonant frequencies f of graphene
nanostrips, via both molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and elastic model
analysis incorporating interlayer shear. Contrary to the classical thin beam
theory prediction f~nl^-2 (l is beam length and n layer number), MD simulation
results reveal very different dependences, f~l^-1.36 and f - fmono~(n-1)/n
(fmono is frequency of the monolayer beam). Interlayer shear modulus of
multilayer graphene strips is much smaller than their intralayer Young's
modulus, and the weak interlayer interaction can not maintain the registry
between the carbon atoms in adjacent layers. Large shear deformation occurs
during vibration of multilayer graphene nano-strips. Therefore we propose a
multi-beam shear model (MBSM) with the interlayer shear energy of multilayer
graphene nano-strips taken into account. It makes predictions consistent
excellently with direct MD simulations without any fitting parameter required.
The results are of importance for various applications of multi-layer graphene
nano-strips, such as in nano-electromechanical devices including resonators,
sensors and actuators, where interlayer shear has apparent impacts to
deformation, vibration, and energy dissipation processes.
