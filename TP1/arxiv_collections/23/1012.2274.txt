In this paper, we initiate the study of nonassociative strict deformation
quantization of C*-algebras with a torus action. We shall also present a
definition of nonassociative principal torus bundles, and give a classification
of these as nonassociative strict deformation quantization of ordinary
principal torus bundles. We then relate this to T-duality of principal torus
bundles with $H$-flux. We also show that the Octonions fit nicely into our
theory.
