The data warehouse (DW) technology was developed to integrate heterogeneous
information sources for analysis purposes. Information sources are more and
more autonomous and they often change their content due to perpetual
transactions (data changes) and may change their structure due to continual
users' requirements evolving (schema changes). Handling properly all type of
changes is a must. In fact, the DW which is considered as the core component of
the modern decision support systems has to be update according to different
type of evolution of information sources to reflect the real world subject to
analysis. The goal of this paper is to propose an overview and a comparative
study between different works related to the DW evolution problem.
