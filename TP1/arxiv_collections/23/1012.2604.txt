NA61/SHINE is a fixed-target experiment to study hadron production in
hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at the CERN SPS. Due to the very
good acceptance and particle identification in forward direction, NA61/SHINE is
well suited for measuring particle production to improve the reliability of air
shower simulations. Data with proton and pion beams have been taken in 2007 and
2009. First analysis results for the pion yield in proton-carbon interactions
at 31 GeV will be shown and compared to predictions from models used in air
shower simulations.
