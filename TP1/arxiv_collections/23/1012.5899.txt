The European VLBI Network (EVN) provides us with the necessary sensitivity
and angular resolution to study the nuclear and circumnuclear regions in
Luminous and Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies. The high Star Formation Rates
(SFR) inferred for these galaxies implies both the presence of a high number of
massive stars and a dense surrounding medium. Therefore, bright radio SNe are
expected to occur. With the aim of estimating the SFR in ULIRGs by means of
Core Collapse supernova (CCSN) detections, we started an observing campaign
with the EVN on a small sample of the brightest and farthest ULIRGs in the
local Universe. We present here our results from three epochs of
quasi-simultaneous observations with the EVN at 6 and 18 cm towards one of the
objects in our sample: IRAS 23365+3604.
