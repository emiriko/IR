The response of RPC detectors is highly sensitive to environmental variables.
A novel approach is presented to model the response of RPC detectors in a
variety of experimental conditions. The algorithm, based on Artificial Neural
Networks, has been developed and tested on the CMS RPC gas gain monitoring
system during commissioning.
