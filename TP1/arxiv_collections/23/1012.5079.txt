Numerical aspects of dynamos in periodic domains are discussed. Modifications
of the solutions by numerically motivated alterations of the equations are
being reviewed using the examples of magnetic hyperdiffusion and artificial
diffusion when advancing the magnetic field in its Euler potential
representation. The importance of using integral kernel formulations in
mean-field dynamo theory is emphasized in cases where the dynamo growth rate
becomes comparable with the inverse turnover time. Finally, the significance of
microscopic magnetic Prandtl number in controlling the conversion from kinetic
to magnetic energy is highlighted.
