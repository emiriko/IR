We investigate a model in which Dark Matter is stabilized by means of a Z2
parity that results from the same non-abelian discrete flavor symmetry which
accounts for the observed pattern of neutrino mixing. In our A4 example the
standard model is extended by three extra Higgs doublets and the Z2 parity
emerges as a remnant of the spontaneous breaking of A4 after electroweak
symmetry breaking. We perform an analysis of the parameter space of the model
consistent with electroweak precision tests, collider searches and
perturbativity. We determine the regions compatible with the observed relic
dark matter density and we present prospects for detection in direct as well as
indirect Dark Matter search experiments.
