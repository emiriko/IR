This document presents a lab demo that exemplifies the manual derivation of
an OO Method conceptual model, taking as input a Communication Analysis
requirements model. In addition, it is described how the conceptual model is
created in the OLIVANOVA Modeler tool. The lab demo corresponds to part of the
business processes of a fictional small and medium enterprise named
SuperStationery Co. This company provides stationery and office material to its
clients. The company acts as a as intermediary: the company has a catalogue of
products that are bought from suppliers and sold to clients. This lab demo,
besides illustrating the derivation technique, demonstrates that the technique
is feasible in practice. Also, the results of this lab demo provide a valuable
feedback in order to improve the derivation technique.
