We apply the factorization technique developed by Kuru and Negro [Ann. Phys.
323 (2008) 413] to study complex classical systems. As an illustration we apply
the technique to study the classical analogue of the exactly solvable PT
symmetric Scarf II model, which exhibits the interesting phenomenon of
spontaneous breakdown of PT symmetry at some critical point. As the parameters
are tuned such that energy switches from real to complex conjugate pairs, the
corresponding classical trajectories display a distinct characteristic feature
- the closed orbits become open ones.
