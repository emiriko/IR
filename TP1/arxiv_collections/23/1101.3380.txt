We study the scenario where the players of a classical complete information
game initially share an entangled pure quantum state. Each player may perform
arbitrary local operations on his own qubits, but no direct communication is
allowed. In this framework, we define the concept of quantum correlated
equilibrium (QCE) for both normal and extensive form games of complete
information. We show that in a normal form game, any outcome distribution
implementable by a QCE can also be implemented by a classical correlated
equilibrium (CE). We prove that the converse is surprisingly false: we give an
example of an outcome distribution of a normal form game which is implementably
by a CE, yet we prove that in any attempted quantum protocol beginning with a
partition of a pure quantum state, at least one of the players will have
incentive to deviate.
  We extend our analysis to extensive form games, and find that the relation
between classical and quantum correlated equilibria becomes less clear. We
compare the outcome distributions implementable in our quantum model to those
implementable by a classical extensive form correlated equilibrium (EFCE). For
example, we show that there exists an extensive form complete information game
and a distribution of outcomes which can be implemented by a QCE but not by any
EFCE, in contrast to the result for normal form games. We also consider the
concept of an immediate-revelation extensive form correlated equilibrium
(IR-EFCE) and compare the power of IR-EFCE to EFCE and to QCE.
