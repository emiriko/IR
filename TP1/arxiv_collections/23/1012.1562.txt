The measurement of the trilinear and quartic Higgs self-couplings is
necessary for the reconstruction of the Higgs potential. This way the Higgs
mechanism as the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking can be tested. The
couplings are accessible in multi-Higgs production processes at the LHC. In
this paper we investigate the prospects of measuring the trilinear Higgs
coupling in composite Higgs models. In these models, the Higgs boson emerges as
a pseudo-Goldstone boson of a strongly interacting sector, and the Higgs
potential is generated by loops of the Standard Model (SM) gauge bosons and
fermions. The Higgs self-couplings are modified compared to the SM and
controlled by the compositeness parameter $\xi$ in addition to the Higgs boson
mass. We construct areas of sensitivity to the trilinear Higgs coupling in the
relevant parameter space for various final states.
