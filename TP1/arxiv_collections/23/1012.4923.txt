We study the problem to extend an immersed circle f in the 2-dimensional
sphere to an immersion of the disc. We analyze existence and uniqueness for
this problems in terms of the combinatorial structure of a word assigned to f.
Our techniques are based on ideas of Blank who studied the extension problem in
case of a planar target.
