We predict resistance anomalies to be observed at high mobility two
dimensional electron systems (2DESs) in the fractional quantized Hall regime,
where the narrow (L <10 ?m) Hall bar is defined by top gates. An analytic
calculation scheme is used to describe the formation of integral and fractional
incompressible strips. We incorporate the screening properties of the 2DES,
together with the effects of perpendicular magnetic field, to calculate the
effective widths of the current carrying channels. The many-body effects are
included to our calculation scheme through the energy gap obtained from the
well accepted formulation of the composite fermions. We show that, the
fractional incompressible strips at the edges, assuming different filling
factors, become evanescent and co-exist at certain magnetic field intervals
yielding an overshoot at the Hall resistance. Similar to that of the integral
quantized Hall effect. We also provide a mechanism to explain the absence of
1/3 state at the Fabry-Perot interference experiments. Yet, an un-investigated
sample design is proposed to observe and enhance the fragile effects like
interference and overshooting based on our analytical model.
