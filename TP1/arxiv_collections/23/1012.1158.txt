In the study of solutions to the relativistic Boltzmann equation, their
regularity with respect to the momentum variables has been an outstanding
question, even local in time, due to the initially unexpected growth in the
post-collisional momentum variables which was discovered in 1991 by Glassey &
Strauss \cite{MR1105532}. We establish momentum regularity within energy spaces
via a new splitting technique and interplay between the Glassey-Strauss frame
and the center of mass frame of the relativistic collision operator. In a
periodic box, these new momentum regularity estimates lead to a proof of global
existence of classical solutions to the two-species relativistic
Vlasov-Boltzmann-Maxwell system for charged particles near Maxwellian with hard
ball interaction.
