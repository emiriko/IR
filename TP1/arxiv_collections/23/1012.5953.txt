A three dimensional (3D) tomographic reconstruction of the local differential
emission measure (LDEM) of the global solar corona during the whole heliosphere
interval (WHI, Carrington rotation CR-2068) is presented, based on STEREO/EUVI
images. We determine the 3D distribution of the electron density, mean
temperature, and temperature spread, in the range of heliocentric heights 1.03
to 1.23 Rsun. The reconstruction is complemented with a potential field source
surface (PFSS) magnetic-field model. The streamer core, streamer legs, and
subpolar regions are analyzed and compared to a similar analysis previously
performed for CR-2077, very near the absolute minimum of the Solar Cycle 23. In
each region, the typical values of density and temperature are similar in both
periods. The WHI corona exhibits a streamer structure of relatively smaller
volume and latitudinal extension than during CR-2077, with a global
closed-to-open density contrast about 6% lower, and a somewhat more complex
morphology. The average basal electron density is found to be about 2.23 and
1.08 x 10^8 cm^-3, in the streamer core and subpolar regions, respectively. The
electron temperature is quite uniform over the analyzed height range, with
average values of about 1.13 and 0.93 MK, in the streamer core and subpolar
regions, respectively. Within the streamer closed region, both periods show
higher temperatures at mid-latitudes and lower temperatures near the equator.
Both periods show beta>1 in the streamer core and beta<1 in the surrounding
open regions, with CR-2077 exhibiting a stronger contrast. Hydrostatic fits to
the electron density are performed, and the scale height is compared to the
LDEM mean electron temperature. Within the streamer core, the results are
consistent with an isothermal hydrostatic plasma regime, with the temperatures
of ions and electrons differing by up to about 10% .. (continues)..
