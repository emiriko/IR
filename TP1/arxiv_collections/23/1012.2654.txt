Results of transport, magnetic, thermal, and 75As-NMR measurements are
presented for superconducting Sr2VFeAsO3 with an alternating stack of FeAs and
perovskite-like block layers. Although apparent anomalies in magnetic and
thermal properties have been observed at ~150 K, no anomaly in transport
behaviors has been observed at around the same temperature. These results
indicate that V ions in the Sr2VO3-block layers have localized magnetic moments
and that V-electrons do not contribute to the Fermi surface. The electronic
characteristics of Sr2VFeAsO3 are considered to be common to those of other
superconducting systems with Fe-pnictogen layers.
