In this paper we study the optimal formation control of multiple agents whose
interaction parameters are adjusted upon a cost function consisting of both the
control energy and the geometrical performance. By optimizing the interaction
parameters and by the linear quadratic regulation(LQR) controllers, the upper
bound of the cost function is minimized. For systems with homogeneous agents
interconnected over sparse graphs, distributed controllers are proposed that
inherit the same underlying graph as the one among agents. For the more general
case, a relaxed optimization problem is considered so as to eliminate the
nonlinear constraints. Using the subgradient method, interaction parameters
among agents are optimized under the constraint of a sparse graph, and the
optimum of the cost function is a better result than the one when agents
interacted only through the control channel. Numerical examples are provided to
validate the effectiveness of the method and to illustrate the geometrical
performance of the system.
