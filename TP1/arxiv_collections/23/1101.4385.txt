We present the results of kinetic modelling of quantum effects in laser-beam
interaction. In the developed numerical model, electron-positron pair
production by hard photons, hard photon emission and the electromagnetic fields
generated by the created charged particles are taken into account. Interaction
of a relativistic electron beam with a strong laser pulse is analyzed. It is
shown that the quantum effects can be important even for moderately intense
laser pulses when the number of emitted photons by single electron is not
large. Electron-positron pair plasma production in extremely-intense laser
field via development of electromagnetic cascades is also studied. The
simulation results confirm the prediction of strong laser field absorption in
the self-generated electron-positron plasma. It is shown that the
self-generated electron-positron plasma can be an efficient source of energetic
gamma-quanta.
