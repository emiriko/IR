Blazars from the first-three-months Fermi-AGN list were observed with the
Urumqi 25m radio telescope at 5GHz in IDV (Intra-Day Variability) mode and
inter-month observation mode. A significant correlation between the flux
density at 5GHz and the gamma-ray intensity for the Fermi-LAT detected blazars
is seen. There is a higher IDV detection rate in Fermi detected blazars than
those reported for other samples. Stronger variability appears at lower
Galactic latitudes; IDV appears to be stronger in weaker sources, indicating
that the variability is affected by interstellar scintillation.
