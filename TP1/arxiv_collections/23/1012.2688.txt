The Higgs sector is extended in $R$-symmetric supersymmetry theories by two
iso-doublets $R_{d,u}$ which complement the standard iso-doublets $H_{d,u}$. We
have analyzed masses and interactions of these novel states and describe their
[non-standard] decay modes and their production channels at the LHC and
$e^+e^-$ colliders.
