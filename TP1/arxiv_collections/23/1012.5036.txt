If Dark Energy introduces an acceleration in the universal expansion then
large scale gravitational potential wells should be shrinking, causing a
blueshift in the CMB photons that cross such structures (Integrated Sachs-Wolfe
effect, [ISW]). Galaxy clusters are known to probe those potential wells. In
these objects, CMB photons also experience inverse Compton scattering off the
hot electrons of the intra-cluster medium, and this results in a distortion
with a characteristic spectral signature of the CMB spectrum (the so-called
thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, [tSZ]). Since both the ISW and the tSZ
effects take place in the same potential wells, they must be spatially
correlated. We present how this cross ISW-tSZ signal can be detected in a
CMB-data contained way by using the frequency dependence of the tSZ effect in
multi frequency CMB experiments like {\it Planck}, {\em without} requiring the
use of external large scale structure tracers data. We find that by masking low
redshift clusters, the shot noise level decreases significantly, boosting the
signal to noise ratio of the ISW--tSZ cross correlation. We also find that
galactic and extragalactic dust residuals must be kept at or below the level of
~0.04 muK^2 at l=10, a limit that is a factor of a few below {\it Planck}'s
expectations for foreground subtraction. If this is achieved, CMB observations
of the ISW-tSZ cross correlation should also provide an independent probe for
the existence of Dark Energy and the amplitude of density perturbations.
