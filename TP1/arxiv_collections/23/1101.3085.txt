Since the information available is fundamental for our perceptions and
opinions, we are interested in understanding the conditions allowing for a good
information to be disseminated. This paper explores opinion dynamics by means
of multi-agent based simulations when agents get informed by different sources
of information. The scenario implemented includes three main streams of
information acquisition, differing in both the contents and the perceived
reliability of the messages spread. Agents' internal opinion is updated either
by accessing one of the information sources, namely media and experts, or by
exchanging information with one another. They are also endowed with cognitive
mechanisms to accept, reject or partially consider the acquired information. We
expect that peer-to--peer communication and reliable information sources are
able both to reduce biased perceptions and to inhibit information cheating,
possibly performed by the media as stated by the agenda-setting theory. In the
paper, after having shortly presented both the hypotheses and the model, the
simulation design will be specified and results will be discussed with respect
to the hypotheses. Some considerations and ideas for future studies will
conclude the paper.
