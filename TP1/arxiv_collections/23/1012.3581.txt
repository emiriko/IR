We consider the bosonic fractional quantum Hall effect in the presence of a
non-Abelian gauge field in addition to the usual Abelian magnetic field. The
non-Abelian field breaks the twofold internal state degeneracy, but preserves
the Landau level degeneracy. Using exact diagonalization, we find that for
moderate non-Abelian field strengths the system's behaviour resembles a single
internal state quantum Hall system, while for stronger fields there is a phase
transition to either two internal state behaviour or the complete absence of
fractional quantum Hall plateaus. Usually the energy gap is reduced by the
presence of a non-Abelian field, but some non-Abelian fields appear to slightly
increase the gap of the $\nu=1$ and $\nu=3/2$ Read-Rezayi states.
