In this note, we propose to use sparse methods (e.g. LASSO, Post-LASSO,
sqrt-LASSO, and Post-sqrt-LASSO) to form first-stage predictions and estimate
optimal instruments in linear instrumental variables (IV) models with many
instruments in the canonical Gaussian case. The methods apply even when the
number of instruments is much larger than the sample size. We derive asymptotic
distributions for the resulting IV estimators and provide conditions under
which these sparsity-based IV estimators are asymptotically oracle-efficient.
In simulation experiments, a sparsity-based IV estimator with a data-driven
penalty performs well compared to recently advocated many-instrument-robust
procedures. We illustrate the procedure in an empirical example using the
Angrist and Krueger (1991) schooling data.
