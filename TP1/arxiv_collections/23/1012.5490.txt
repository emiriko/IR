We study the prescribed mean curvature equation with a prescribed boundary
contact angle condition in $M\times\R$ where $M^n$ is a Riemannian submanifold
in $\R^{n+1}$. The main purpose is to establish a priori gradient estimates for
solutions, from which the long time existence of the solution are derived.
