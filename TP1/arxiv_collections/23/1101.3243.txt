We describe a simple Zeeman slower design using permanent magnets. Contrary
to common wire-wound setups no electric power and water cooling are required.
In addition, the whole system can be assembled and disassembled at will. The
magnetic field is however transverse to the atomic motion and an extra repumper
laser is necessary. A Halbach configuration of the magnets produces a high
quality magnetic field and no further adjustment is needed. After optimization
of the laser parameters, the apparatus produces an intense beam of slow and
cold 87Rb atoms. With a typical flux of 1 - 5 \times 10^10 atoms/s at 30 ms^-1,
our apparatus efficiently loads a large magneto-optical trap with more than
10^10 atoms in one second, which is an ideal starting point for degenerate
quantum gases experiments.
