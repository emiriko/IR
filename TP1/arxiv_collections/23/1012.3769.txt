A successful implementation of thermal leptogenesis requires the re-heat
temperature after inflation T_R to exceed ~2\times 10^9 GeV. Such a high T_R
value typically leads to an overproduction of gravitinos in the early universe,
which will cause conflicts, mainly with BBN constraints. Asaka and Yanagida
(AY) have proposed that these two issues can be reconciled in the context of
the Peccei-Quinn augmented MSSM (PQMSSM) if one adopts a mass hierarchy
m(sparticle)>m(gravitino)>m(axino), with m(axino) keV. We calculate the relic
abundance of mixed axion/axino dark matter in the AY scenario, and investigate
under what conditions a value of T_R sufficient for thermal leptogenesis can be
generated. A high value of PQ breaking scale f_a is needed to suppress
overproduction of axinos, while a small vacuum misalignment angle \theta_i is
needed to suppress overproduction of axions. The large value of f_a results in
late decaying neutralinos. To avoid BBN constraints, the AY scenario requires a
low thermal abundance of neutralinos and high values of neutralino mass. We
include entropy production from late decaying saxions, and find the saxion
needs to be typically at least several times heavier than the gravitino. A
viable AY scenario suggests that LHC should discover a spectrum of SUSY
particles consistent with weak scale supergravity; that the apparent neutralino
abundance is low; that a possible axion detection signal (probably with m_axion
in the sub-micro-eV range) should occur, but no direct or indirect signals for
WIMP dark matter should be observed.
