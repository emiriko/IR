On 17 October 2008, the Cassini spacecraft crossed the southern sources of
Saturn kilometric radiation (SKR), while flying along high-latitude nightside
magnetic field lines. In situ measurements allowed us to characterize for the
first time the source region of an extra-terrestrial auroral radio emission.
Using radio, magnetic field and particle observations, we show that SKR sources
are surrounded by a hot tenuous plasma, in a region of upward field-aligned
currents. Magnetic field lines supporting radio sources map a continuous,
high-latitude and spiral-shaped auroral oval observed on the dawnside,
consistent with enhanced auroral activity. Investigating the Cyclotron Maser
Instability (CMI) as a mechanism responsible for SKR generation, we find that
observed cutoff frequencies are consistent with radio waves amplified
perpendicular to the magnetic field by hot (6 to 9 keV) resonant electrons,
measured locally.
