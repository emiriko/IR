Based on the rapid experimental developments of circuit QED, we propose a
feasible scheme to simulate a spin-boson model with the superconducting
circuits, which can be used to detect quantum Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) phase
transition. We design the spin-boson model by using a superconducting phase
qubit coupled with a semi-infinite transmission line, which is regarded as
bosonic reservoir with a continuum spectrum. By tuning the bias current or the
coupling capacitance, the quantum KT transition can be directly detected
through tomography measurement on the states of the phase qubit. We also
estimate the experimental parameters using numerical renormalization group
method.
