We study the structure of the inverse limit of the graded algebras of local
unitary invariant polynomials using its Hilbert series. For k subsystems, we
conjecture that the inverse limit is a free algebra and the number of
algebraically independent generators with homogenous degree 2m equals the
number of conjugacy classes of index m subgroups in a free group on k-1
generators.
  Similarly, we conjecture that the inverse limit in the case of k-partite
mixed state invariants is free and the number of algebraically independent
generators with homogenous degree m equals the number of conjugacy classes of
index m subgroups in a free group on k generators. The two conjectures are
shown to be equivalent.
  To illustrate the equivalence, using the representation theory of the unitary
groups, we obtain all invariants in the m=2 graded parts and express them in a
simple form both in the case of mixed and pure states. The transformation
between the two forms is also derived. Analogous invariants of higher degree
are also introduced.
