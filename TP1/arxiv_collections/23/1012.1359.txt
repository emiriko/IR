The properties of blazar variability in the radio band are studied using the
unique combination of temporal resolution from single dish monitoring and
spatial resolution from VLBA imaging; such measurements, now available in all
four Stokes parameters, together with theoretical simulations, identify the
origin of radio band variability and probe the characteristics of the radio jet
where the broadband blazar emission originates. Outbursts in total flux density
and linear polarization in the optical-to-radio bands are attributed to shocks
propagating within the jet spine, in part based on limited modeling invoking
transverse shocks; new radiative transfer simulations allowing for shocks at
arbitrary angle to the flow direction confirm this picture by reproducing the
observed centimeter-band variations observed more generally, and are of current
interest since these shocks may play a role in the gamma-ray flaring detected
by Fermi. Recent UMRAO multifrequency Stokes V studies of bright blazars
identify the spectral variability properties of circular polarization for the
first time and demonstrate that polarity flips are relatively common.
All-Stokes data are consistent with the production of circular polarization by
linear-to-circular mode conversion in a region that is at least partially
self-absorbed. Detailed analysis of single-epoch, multifrequency, all-Stokes
VLBA observations of 3C 279 support this physical picture and are best
explained by emission from an electron-proton plasma.
