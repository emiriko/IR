The Folded-port InfraRed Echellette (FIRE) has recently been commissioned on
the Magellan 6.5m Baade Telescope. This single object, near-infrared
spectrometer simultaneously covers the 0.85-2.45 micron window in both
cross-dispersed (R ~ 6000) or prism-dispersed (R ~ 250-350) modes. FIRE's
compact configuration, high transmission optics and high quantum efficiency
detector provides considerable sensitivity in the near-infrared, making it an
ideal instrument for studies of cool stars and brown dwarfs. Here we present
some of the first cool star science results with FIRE based on commissioning
and science verification observations, including evidence of clouds in a
planetary-mass brown dwarf, accretion and jet emission in the low-mass T Tauri
star TWA 30B, radial velocities of T-type brown dwarfs, and near-infrared
detection of a debris disk associated with the DAZ white dwarf GALEX 1931+01.
