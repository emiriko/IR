A new algorithm for computing the multivariate Fa\`a di Bruno's formula is
provided. We use a symbolic approach based on the classical umbral calculus
that turns the computation of the multivariate Fa\`a di Bruno's formula into a
suitable multinomial expansion. We propose a MAPLE procedure whose
computational times are faster compared with the ones existing in the
literature. Some illustrative applications are also provided.
