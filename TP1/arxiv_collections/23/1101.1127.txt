In this work, we investigate gradient coupling effect on amplitude death in
an array of N cou- pled nonidentical oscillators with no-flux boundary
conditions and periodic boundary conditions respectively. We find that the
effects of gradient coupling on amplitude death in diffusive coupled
nonidentical oscillators is quite different between those two boundaries
conditions. With no-flux boundary conditions, there is a system size related
critical gradient coupling $r_c$ within which the gradient coupling tends to
monotonically enlarge the amplitude death domain in the parameter space. With
the periodical boundary conditions, there is an optimal gradient coupling
constant $r_o$ to realize largest AD domain. The gradient coupling first
enlarges then decreases the amplitude death domain of diffusive coupled
oscillators. The amplitude death domain of parameter space are analytically
predicted for small number of gradient coupled oscillators.
