Universality of strongly interacting fermions is a topic of great interest in
diverse fields. Here we investigate theoretically the universal dynamic density
response of resonantly interacting ultracold Fermi atoms in the limit of either
high temperature or large frequency: (1) At high temperature, we use quantum
virial expansion to derive universal, non-perturbative expansion functions of
dynamic structure factor; (2) At large momentum, we identify that the
second-order expansion function gives the Wilson coefficient used in the
operator expansion product method. The dynamic structure factor is therefore
determined by its second-order expansion function with an overall normalization
factor given by Tan's contact parameter. We show that the spin parallel and
antiparallel dynamic structure factors have respectively a tail of the form
$\sim \pm \omega^{-5/2}$ for $\omega\rightarrow\infty$, decaying slower than
the total dynamic structure factor found previously ($\sim \omega^{-7/2}$). Our
predictions for dynamic structure factor at high temperature or large frequency
are testable using Bragg spectroscopy for ultracold atomic Fermi gases.
