Transport coefficeints, in particular the shear viscosity to entropy density
ratio is studied in systems where the small-width quasiparticle assumption is
not valid. It is found that $\eta/s$ has no unversal lower bound, the minimal
value depends on the system and the temperature, and can be even zero. We
construct models where the $1/4\pi$ conjectured bound is violated.
