In the ultra-cold regime Van der Waals forces between neutral atoms can be
represented by short range effective interactions. We show that universal low
energy scaling features of the underlying vdW long range force stemming from
two photon exchange impose restrictions on an Effective Field Theory without
explicit photons. The role of naively redundant operators, relevant to the
definition of three body forces, is also analyzed.
