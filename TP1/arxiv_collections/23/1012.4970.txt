We present here a first application of the Fermionic Molecular Dynamics (FMD)
approach to low-energy nuclear reactions, namely the
$^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be radiative capture reaction. We divide the
Hilbert space into an external region where the system is described as $^3$He
and $^4$He clusters interacting only via the Coulomb interaction and an
internal region where the nuclear interaction will polarize the clusters.
Polarized configurations are obtained by a variation after parity and angular
momentum projection procedure with respect to the parameters of all single
particle states. A constraint on the radius of the intrinsic many-body state is
employed to obtain polarized clusters at desired distances. The boundary
conditions for bound and scattering states are implemented using the Bloch
operator.
  The FMD calculations reproduce the correct energy for the centroid of the
$3/2^-$ and $1/2^-$ bound states in $^7$Be. The charge radius of the ground
state is in good agreement with recent experimental results. The FMD
calculations also describe well the experimental phase shift data in the
$1/2^+$, $3/2^+$ and $5/2^+$ channels that are important for the capture
reaction at low energies. Using the bound and scattering many-body wave
functions we calculate the radiative capture cross section. The calculated $S$
factor agrees very well, both in absolute normalization and energy dependence,
with the recent experimental data from the Weizmann, LUNA, Seattle and ERNA
experiments.
