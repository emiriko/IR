In this paper, we present a study on the recent approaches in handling
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attack is a fairly new type
of attack to cripple the availability of Internet services and resources. A
DDos attack can originate from anywhere in the network and typically overwhelms
the victim server by sending a huge number of packets. Several remedial
measures have been proposed by various researchers. This paper attempts to
discuss the recent offerings to handle the DDoS attacks.
