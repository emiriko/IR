We derive the stochastic equations and consider the non-Markovian dynamics of
a system of multiple two-level atoms in a common quantum field. We make only
the dipole approximation for the atoms and assume weak atom-field interactions.
From these assumptions we use a combination of non-secular open- and
closed-system perturbation theory, and we abstain from any additional
approximation schemes. These more accurate solutions are necessary to explore
several regimes: in particular, near-resonance dynamics and low-temperature
behavior. In detuned atomic systems, small variations in the system energy
levels engender timescales which, in general, cannot be safely ignored, as
would be the case in the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). More problematic
are the second-order solutions, which, as has been recently pointed out, cannot
be accurately calculated using any second-order perturbative master equation,
whether RWA, Born-Markov, Redfield, etc.. This latter problem, which applies to
all perturbative open-system master equations, has a profound effect upon
calculation of entanglement at low temperatures. We find that even at zero
temperature all initial states will undergo finite-time disentanglement
(sometimes termed "sudden death"), in contrast to previous work. We also use
our solution, without invoking RWA, to characterize the necessary conditions
for Dickie subradiance at finite temperature. We find that the subradiant
states fall into two categories at finite temperature: one that is temperature
independent and one that acquires temperature dependence. With the RWA there is
no temperature dependence in any case.
