Since the discovery of the presence of biogenic magnetites in living
organisms, there have been speculations on the role that these biomagnetites
play in cellular processes. It seems that the formation of biomagnetite
crystals is a universal phenomenon and not an exception in living cells. Many
experimental facts show that features of organic and inorganic processes could
be indistinguishable at nanoscale levels. Living cells are quantum "devices"
rather than simple electronic devices utilizing only the charge of conduction
electrons. In our opinion, due to their unusual biophysical properties, special
biomagnetites must have a biological function in living cells in general and in
the brain in particular. In this paper we advance a hypothesis that while
biomagnetites are developed jointly with organic molecules and cellular
electromagnetic fields in cells, they can record information about the Earth's
magnetic vector potential of the entire flight in migratory birds.
