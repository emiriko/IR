The electric dipole moments (EDMs) of heavy nuclei, such as 199Hg, 225Ra and
211Rn, can be enhanced by the Schiff moments induced by the presence of nearby
parity-doublet states. Working within the framework of the maximally
CP-violating and minimally flavour-violating (MCPMFV) version of the MSSM, we
discuss the maximal values that such EDMs might attain, given the existing
experimental constraints on the Thallium, neutron and Mercury EDMs. The maximal
EDM values of the heavy nuclei are obtained with the help of a
differential-geometrical approach proposed recently that enables the maxima of
new CP-violating observables to be calculated exactly in the linear
approximation. In the case of 225Ra, we find that its EDM may be as large as 6
to 50 x 10^{-27} e.cm.
