N=1 supersymmetric SU(K+P)xSU(K) cascading gauge theory of Klebanov et.al
[1,2] undergoes a first-order finite temperature confinement/deconfinement
phase transition at T_c=0.6141111(3) Lambda, where Lambda is the strong
coupling scale of the theory. The deconfined phase of the theory, with the
unbroken chiral symmetry, extends down to T_u=0.8749(0) T_c, where it becomes
perturbatively unstable due to the condensation of the hydrodynamic (sound)
modes. We show that at T_cSB =0.882503(0) T_c > T_u the deconfined phase of the
cascading plasma is perturbatively unstable towards development of the chiral
symmetry breaking condensates. We present evidence that the ground state of the
cascading plasma for T<T_cSB can not be homogeneous and isotropic.
