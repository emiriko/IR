We present a study of the inclusive photon spectrum from 6.3 million J/psi
decays collected with the KEDR detector at the VEPP-4M e+e- collider. We
measure the branching fraction of the radiative decay J/psi -> eta_c gamma,
eta_c width and mass. Taking into account an asymmetric photon line shape we
obtain: M(eta_c) = (2978.1 +- 1.4 +- 2.0) MeV/c^2, Gamma(eta_c) = (43.5 +- 5.4
+- 15.8) MeV, B(J/psi->eta_c gamma) = (2.59 +- 0.16 +- 0.31)%$.
