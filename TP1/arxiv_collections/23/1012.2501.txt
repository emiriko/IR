The symmetry breaking of 5-dimensional SU(6) GUT into 4-dimensional SU(3) x
SU(3) x U(1) with orbifold S1/Z2 through Scherk-Schwarz mechanism is
investigated. It is shown that the origin of Little Higgs can be generated to
further break SU(3) x SU(3) x U(1) down to the electroweak scale through Higgs
mechanism.
