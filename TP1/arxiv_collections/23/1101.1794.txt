It has been experimentally confirmed that quantum physical phenomena can
violate the Information Bell Inequalities. A violation of the one or the other
of these Information Bell Inequalites is equivalent to a violation of local
realism meaning that either objectivity or locality, or both, do not hold for
the phenomena under investigation. We propose (1) an experimental design for
carrying out classical measurements in the absence of ontological
complementarity; (2) a rational way to extract epistemologically complementary
(pseudocomplementary) data from it; (3) a statistical approach which can reject
stochastic and/or suspected violations of local realism in measurements of such
data.
