The formulas which describe the time evolution of radiation produced by a
relativistic particle moving in a crystal are derived. It is shown that the
conditions are realizable under which parametric (quasi-Cherenkov) radiation,
transition radiation, diffracted radiation of the oscillator, surface
quasi-Cherenkov and Smith-Purcell radiation last considerably longer than the
time of the particle flight through the crystal. The results of carried out
experiments demonstrate the presence of additional radiation peak appearing
after the electron beam has left the photonic crystal.
