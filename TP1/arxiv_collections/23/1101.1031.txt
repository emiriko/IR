The gold film (mean thickness $\approx$ 3.5 nm) was condensed in high vacuum
at temperature 70 K on single-crystal sapphire substrate. The transport
properties of the film at low temperature reveal simultaneously indications of
1D and 2D quantum interference effects of weak localization and
electron-electron interaction. It is shown that this behavior is determined by
inhomogeneous electron transport at the threshold of thickness-controlled
metal-insulator transition.
