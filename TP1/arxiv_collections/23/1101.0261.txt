The last unknown neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ is one of the
fundamental parameters of nature; it is also a crucial parameter for
determining the sensitivity of future long-baseline experiments aimed to study
CP violation in the neutrino sector. Daya Bay is a reactor neutrino oscillation
experiment designed to achieve a sensitivity on the value of
$sin^2(2\theta_{13})$ to better than 0.01 at 90% CL. The experiment consists of
multiple identical detectors placed underground at different baselines to
minimize systematic errors and suppress cosmogenic backgrounds. With the
baseline design, the expected anti-neutrino signal at the far site is about 360
events per day and at each of the near sites is about 1500 events per day. An
overview and current status of the experiment will be presented.
