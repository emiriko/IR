The new IR-improved
Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi-Callan-Symanzik (DGLAP-CS) kernels
recently developed by one of us is implemented in the HERWIG6.5 environment to
generate a new MC, HERWIRI1.0(31), for hadron-hadron scattering at high
energies. The comparison between the parton shower generated by the standard
DGLAP-CS kernels and that generated by the new IR-improved DGLAP-CS kernels is
illustrated using MC data. This is done for some of the respective exact {\cal
O}(\alpha_s) corrected spectra using the seamless interfaces to MC@NLO while
making comparisons with FNAL data. Some discussion of possible implications for
LHC phenomenology is also presented.
