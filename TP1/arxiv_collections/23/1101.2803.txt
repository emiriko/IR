We continue to investigate which polynomials can possibly occur as factors in
the denominators of rational solutions of a given partial linear difference
equation.
  In an earlier article we had introduced the distinction between periodic and
aperiodic factors in the denominator, and we gave an algorithm for predicting
the aperiodic ones. Now we extend this technique towards the periodic case and
present a refined algorithm which also finds most of the periodic factors.
