The nuclide 18F disintegrates to 18O by beta+ emission (96.86%) and electron
capture (3.14%) with a half-life of 1.8288 h. It is widely used in nuclear
medicine for positron emission tomography (PET). Because of its short half-life
this nuclide requires the development of fast measuring methods to be
standardized. The combination of LSC methods with digital techniques proves to
be a good alternative to get low uncertainties for this, and other, short lived
nuclides. A radioactive solution of 18F has been standardized by coincidence
counting with a LSC, using the logical sum of double coincidences in a TDCR
array and a NaI scintillation detector. The results show good consistency with
other techniques like 4Pi gamma and LSC.
