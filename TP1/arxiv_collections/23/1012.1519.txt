We present a method to construct "X" form unitary Yang-Baxter $\breve{R}$
matrices, which act on the tensor product space $V_{i}^{j_{1}}\otimes
V_{i+1}^{j_{2}}$. We can obtain a set of entangled states for $(2j_{1}+1)\times
(2j_{2}+1)$-dimensional system with these Yang-Baxter $\breve{R}$ matrices. By
means of Yang-Baxter approach, a $8\times 8$ Yang-Baxter Hamiltonian is
constructed. Yangian symmetry and Yangian generators as shift operators for
this Yang-Baxter system are investigated in detail.
