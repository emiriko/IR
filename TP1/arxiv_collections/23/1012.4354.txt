In turbulent dynamos the production of large-scale magnetic fields is
accompanied by a separation of magnetic helicity in scale. The large- and
small-scale parts increase in magnitude. The small-scale part can eventually
work against the dynamo and quench it, especially at high magnetic Reynolds
numbers. A one-dimensional mean-field model of a dynamo is presented where
diffusive magnetic helicity fluxes within the domain are important. It turns
out that this effect helps to alleviate the quenching. Here we show that
internal magnetic helicity fluxes, even within one hemisphere, can be important
for alleviating catastrophic quenching.
