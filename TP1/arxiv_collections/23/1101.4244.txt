We present the first Dyson-Schwinger equation calculation of the light hadron
spectrum that simultaneously correlates the masses of meson and baryon ground-
and excited-states within a single framework. At the core of our analysis is a
symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector-vector contact interaction. In
comparison with relevant quantities the
root-mean-square-relative-error/degree-of freedom is 13%. Notable amongst our
results is agreement between the computed baryon masses and the bare masses
employed in modern dynamical coupled-channels models of pion-nucleon reactions.
Our analysis provides insight into numerous aspects of baryon structure; e.g.,
relationships between the nucleon and Delta masses and those of the
dressed-quark and diquark correlations they contain.
