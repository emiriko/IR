The standard picture of planet formation posits that giant gas planets are
over-grown rocky planets massive enough to attract enormous gas atmospheres. It
has been shown recently that the opposite point of view is physically
plausible: the rocky terrestrial planets are former giant planet embryos dried
of their gas "to the bone" by the influences of the parent star. Here we
provide a brief overview of this "Tidal Downsizing" hypothesis in the context
of the Solar System structure.
