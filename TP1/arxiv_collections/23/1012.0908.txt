Advanced gravitational wave detectors, currently under construction, are
expected to directly observe gravitational wave signals of astrophysical
origin. The Einstein Telescope, a third-generation gravitational wave detector,
has been proposed in order to fully open up the emerging field of gravitational
wave astronomy. In this article we describe sensitivity models for the Einstein
Telescope and investigate potential limits imposed by fundamental noise
sources. A special focus is set on evaluating the frequency band below 10Hz
where a complex mixture of seismic, gravity gradient, suspension thermal and
radiation pressure noise dominates. We develop the most accurate sensitivity
model, referred to as ET-D, for a third-generation detector so far, including
the most relevant fundamental noise contributions.
