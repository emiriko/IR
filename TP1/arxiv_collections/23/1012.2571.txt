We explore the consequences of the neutrino mass matrix having a hidden
$\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry and one zero eigenvalue. When implemented, these two
conditions give relations among the mixing angles. In addition, fitting these
relations to the existing oscillation data allows limits to be placed on the
parameter of the symmetry.
