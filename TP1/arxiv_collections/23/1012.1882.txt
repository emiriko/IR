Information system designers face many challenges w.r.t. selecting
appropriate semantic technologies and deciding on a modelling approach for
their system. However, there is no clear methodology yet to evaluate
"semantically enriched" information systems. In this paper we present a case
study on different modelling approaches for annotating medical images and
introduce a conceptual framework that can be used to analyse the fitness of
information systems and help designers to spot the strengths and weaknesses of
various modelling approaches as well as managing trade-offs between modelling
effort and their potential benefits.
