In this article we address the problem of catching objects that move at a
relatively large distance from the robot, of the order of tens of times the
size of the robot itself. To this purpose, we adopt casting manipulation and
visual-based feedback control. Casting manipulation is a technique to deploy a
robotic end-effector far from the robot's base, by throwing the end-effector
and controlling its ballistic flight using forces transmitted through a light
tether connected to the end-effector itself. The tether cable can then be used
to retrieve the end- effector to exert forces on the robot's environment. In
previous work, planar casting manipulation was demon- strated to aptly catch
static objects placed at a distant, known position, thus proving it suitable
for applications such as sample acquisition and return, rescue, etc. In this
paper we propose an extension of the idea to controlling the position of the
end- effector to reach moving targets in 3D. The goal is achieved by an
innovative design of the casting mechanism, and by closing a real-time control
loop on casting manipulation using visual feedback of moving targets. To
achieve this result, simplified yet accurate models of the system suitable for
real-time computation are developed, along with a suitable visual feedback
scheme for the flight phase. Effectiveness of the visual feedback controller is
demonstrated through experiments with a 2D casting robot.
