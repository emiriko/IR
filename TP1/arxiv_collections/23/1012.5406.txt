The clothing procedure, put forward in quantum field theory (QFT) by
Greenberg and Schweber, is applied for the description of nucleon-nucleon (N-N)
scattering. We consider pseudoscalar, vector and scalar meson fields
interacting with fermion ones via the Yukawa-type couplings to introduce trial
interactions between "bare" particles. The subsequent unitary clothing
transformations (UCTs) are found to express the total Hamiltonian through new
interaction operators that refer to particles with physical (observable)
properties, the so-called clothed particles. In this work, we are focused upon
the Hermitian and energy-independent operators for the clothed nucleons, being
built up in the second order in the coupling constants. The corresponding
analytic expressions in momentum space are compared with the separate meson
contributions to the one-boson-exchange potentials in the meson theory of
nuclear forces. In order to evaluate the T-matrix of the N-N scattering we have
used an equivalence theorem that enables us to operate in the clothed particle
representation (CPR) instead of the bare particle representation (BPR) with its
large amount of virtual processes. We have derived the Lippmann-Schwinger type
equation for the CPR elements of the T-matrix for a given collision energy in
the two-nucleon sector of the Hilbert space of hadronic states.
