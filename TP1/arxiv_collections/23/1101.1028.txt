We reconstruct the rare decays $B^+ \to K^+\mu^+\mu^-$, $B^0 \to
K^{*}(892)^0\mu^+\mu^-$, and $B^0_s \to \phi(1020)\mu^+\mu^-$ in a data sample
corresponding to $4.4 {\rm fb^{-1}}$ collected in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at
$\sqrt{s}=1.96 {\rm TeV}$ by the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron
Collider. Using $121 \pm 16$ $B^+ \to K^+\mu^+\mu^-$ and $101 \pm 12$ $B^0 \to
K^{*0}\mu^+\mu^-$ decays we report the branching ratios. In addition, we report
the measurement of the differential branching ratio and the muon
forward-backward asymmetry in the $B^+$ and $B^0$ decay modes, and the $K^{*0}$
longitudinal polarization in the $B^0$ decay mode with respect to the squared
dimuon mass. These are consistent with the theoretical prediction from the
standard model, and most recent determinations from other experiments and of
comparable accuracy. We also report the first observation of the $B^0_s \to
\phi\mu^+\mu^- decay and measure its branching ratio ${\mathcal{B}}(B^0_s \to
\phi\mu^+\mu^-) = [1.44 \pm 0.33 \pm 0.46] \times 10^{-6}$ using $27 \pm 6$
signal events. This is currently the most rare $B^0_s$ decay observed.
