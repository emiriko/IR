Muons with a high transverse momentum (p_T) are produced in cosmic ray air
showers via semileptonic decay of heavy quarks and the decay of high p_T kaons
and pions. These high p_T muons have a large lateral separation from the shower
core muon bundle. IceCube is well suited for the detection of high p_T muons.
The surface shower array can determine the energy, core location and direction
of the cosmic ray air shower while the in-ice array can reconstruct the energy
and direction of the high p_T muon. This makes it possible to measure the
decoherence function (lateral separation spectrum) at distances greater than
150 meters. The muon p_T can be determined from the muon energy (measured by
dE/dx) and the lateral separation. The high p_T muon spectrum may also be
calculated in a perturbative QCD framework; this spectrum is sensitive to the
cosmic-ray composition.
