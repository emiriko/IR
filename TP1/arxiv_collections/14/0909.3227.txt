Within the Standard model with the 4th generation quarks b' and t' we have
analyzed CP-violating flavor changing neutral current processes t -> cX; b'->
sX, b'-> bX,t'-> cX, and t'-> tX, with X=Z,H,gamma,g, by constructing and
employing global, unique fit for the 4th generation mass mixing matrix CKM4 at
300 < m_t' < 700 GeV. All quantities appearing in the CKM4 were subject to our
fitting procedure. We have found that our fit produces the following CP partial
rate asymmetry dominance: a_CP(b'-> s(Z,H,gamma,g))= (90,73,52,30)%, at m_t' ~
300,300,380,400 GeV, respectively. From the experimental point of view the best
decay mode, out of the above four, is certainly b'-> s gamma, because of the
presence of a clean high energy single final state photon. We have also
obtained relatively large a_CP(t -> c g) ~ 15 (10)% for t' running in the loops
with the mass m_t'= 650(500) GeV. There are fair chances that the 4th
generation quarks will be discovered at Tevatron or LHC and that some of their
decay rates shall be measured. If b' and t' exist at energies we assumed, with
well executed tagging, large a_CP could be found too.
