We report on an experimental study of the dynamics of the reflection of
ultracold atoms from a periodic one-dimensional magnetic lattice potential. The
magnetic lattice potential of period 10 \textmu m is generated by applying a
uniform bias magnetic field to a microfabricated periodic structure on a
silicon wafer coated with a multilayered TbGdFeCo/Cr magneto-optical film. The
effective thickness of the magnetic film is about 960 nm. A detailed study of
the profile of the reflected atoms as a function of externally induced periodic
corrugation in the potential is described. The effect of angle of incidence is
investigated in detail. The experimental observations are supported by
numerical simulations.
