We propose a model for protein folding in vivo based on a Brownian-ratchet
mechanism in the multidimensional energy landscape space. The device is able to
produce directed transport taking advantage of the assumed intrinsic asymmetric
properties of the proteins and employing the consumption of energy provided by
an external source. Through such a directed transport phenomenon, the
polypeptide finds the native state starting from any initial state in the
energy landscape with great efficacy and robustness, even in the presence of
different type of obstacles. This model solves Levinthal's paradox without
requiring biased transition probabilities but at the expense of opening the
system to an external field.
