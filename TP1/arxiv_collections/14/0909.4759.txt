Until recently the study of the gravitational field of dark matter was
primarily concerned with its local effects on the motion of stars in galaxies
and galaxy clusters. On the other hand, the WMAP experiment has shown that the
gravitational field produced by dark matter amplifies the higher acoustic modes
of the CMBR power spectrum, more intensely than the gravitational field of
baryons. Such a wide range of experimental evidences from cosmology to local
gravity suggests the necessity of a comprehensive analysis of the dark matter
gravitational field per se, regardless of any other attributes that dark matter
may eventually possess.
  In this paper we introduce and apply Nash's theory of perturbative geometry
to the study of the dark matter gravitational field alone, in a
higher-dimensional framework. It is shown that the dark matter gravitational
perturbations in the early universe can be explained by the extrinsic curvature
of the standard cosmology. Together with the estimated presence of massive
neutrinos, such geometric perturbation is compatible not only with the observed
power spectrum in the WMAP experiment but also with the most recent data on the
accelerated expansion of the universe.
  It is possible that the same structure formation exists locally, such as in
the cases of young galaxies or in cluster collisions. In most other cases it
seems to have ceased when the extrinsic curvature becomes negligible, leading
to Einstein's equations in four dimensions. The slow motion of stars in
galaxies and the motion of plasma substructures in nearly colliding clusters
are calculated with the geodesic equation for a slowly moving object in a
gravitational field of arbitrary strength.
