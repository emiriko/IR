The Ce compounds CeCoIn$_5$ and CeRhIn$_5$ are ideal model systems to study
the competition of antiferromagnetism (AF) and superconductivity (SC). Here we
discuss the pressure--temperature and magnetic field phase diagrams of both
compounds. In CeRhIn$_5$ the interesting observation is that in zero magnetic
field a coexistence AF+SC phase exist inside the AF phase below the critical
pressure $p_{\rm c}^\star \approx 2$ GPa. Above $p_{\rm c}^\star$ AF is
suppressed in zero field but can be re-induced by applying a magnetic field.
The collapse of AF under pressure coincides with the abrupt change of the Fermi
surface.
  In CeCoIn$_5$ a new phase appears at low temperatures and high magnetic field
(LTHF) which vanishes at the upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$. In both
compounds the paramagnetic pair breaking effect dominates at low temperature.
We discuss the evolution of the upper critical field under high pressure of
both compounds and propose a simple picture of the glue of reentrant magnetism
to the upper critical field in order to explain the interplay of
antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity.
