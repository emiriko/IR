We continue our exploration of whether the flyby anomalies can be explained
by scattering of spacecraft nucleons from dark matter gravitationally bound to
the earth. We formulate and analyze a simple model in which inelastic and
elastic scatterers populate shells generated by the precession of circular
orbits with normals tilted with respect to the earth's axis. Good fits to the
data published by Anderson et al. are obtained.
