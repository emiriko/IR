Several new features arise in the ground-state phase diagram of a spin-1
condensate trapped in an optical trap when the magnetic dipole interaction
between the atoms is taken into account along with confinement and spin
precession. The boundaries between the regions of ferromagnetic and polar
phases move as the dipole strength is varied and the ferromagnetic phases can
be modulated. The magnetization of the ferromagnetic phase perpendicular to the
field becomes modulated as a helix winding around the magnetic field direction,
with a wavelength inversely proportional to the dipole strength. This
modulation should be observable for current experimental parameters in
$^{87}$Rb. Hence the much-sought supersolid state, with broken continuous
translation invariance in one direction and broken global U(1) invariance,
occurs generically as a metastable state in this system as a result of dipole
interaction. The ferromagnetic state parallel to the applied magnetic field
becomes striped in a finite system at strong dipolar coupling.
