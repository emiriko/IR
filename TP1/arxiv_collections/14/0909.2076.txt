We report the first operation of a rotating odd-parity Lorentz Invariance
test in electrodynamics using a microwave Mach-Zehnder interferometer with
permeable material in one arm. The experiment sets a direct bound to $
\kappa_{tr}$ of $-0.3\pm 3\times10^{-7}$. Using new power recycled waveguide
interferometer techniques (with the highest spectral resolution ever achieved
of $2\times10^{-11} rad/\sqrt{Hz}$) we show an improvement of several orders of
magnitude is attainable in the future.
