We study the dispersive properties for the wave equation in the Kerr
space-time with small angular momentum. The main result of this paper is to
establish Strichartz estimates for solutions of the aforementioned equation. As
an application, we then prove global well-posedness and uniqueness for the
energy critical semilinear wave equation.
