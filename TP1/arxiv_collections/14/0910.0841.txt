In this proceedings paper we report on a calculation of graphene's Landau
levels in a magnetic field. Our calculations are based on a self-consistent
Hartree-Fock approximation for graphene's massless-Dirac continuum model. We
find that because of graphene's chiral band structure interactions not only
shift Landau-level energies, as in a non-relativistic electron gas, but also
alter Landau level wavefunctions. We comment on the subtle continuum model
regularization procedure necessary to correctly maintain the lattice-model's
particle hole symmetry properties.
