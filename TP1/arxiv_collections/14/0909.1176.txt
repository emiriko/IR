It is well known that the diffuse gamma-rays are produced by the collisions
between the galactic cosmic rays with the stellar matter (Hayakawa-Morrison
Hypothesis). In this paper the author tries to estimate the contribution of
star flares in the low energy component of the diffuse component of the
galactic gamma-rays. It is expected that high energy part of the disuse
component of the galactic gamma-rays reflects the power spectrum of galactic
cosmic rays with gamma= -2.75 (in differential). In the galactic disk and
bulge, there are more than 100 billion stars. They might often make flare and
produce high energy cosmic rays by the flare in the energy range from 100 MeV
to 1 TeV with the power index gamma= -3.75 (in differential). In this paper the
author tries to estimate the contribution of the star flares to the diffuse
component of gamma-rays.
