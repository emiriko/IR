We present a theory for Fano interference in light scattering by individual
obstacle, based on a temporal coupled-mode formalism. This theory is applicable
for obstacles that are much smaller than the incident wavelength, or for
systems with two-dimensional cylindrical or three-dimensional spherical
symmetry. We show that for each angle momentum channel, the Fano interference
effect can be modeled by a simple temporal coupled-mode equation, which
provides a line shape formula for scattering and absorption cross-section. We
validate the analysis with numerical simulations. As an application of the
theory, we design a structure that exhibits strong absorption and weak
scattering properties at the same frequency.
