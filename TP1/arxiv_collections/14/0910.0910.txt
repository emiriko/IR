One of the benchmark analyses to be performed with the first data at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider will be the measurement of the Z boson transverse
momentum spectrum. In this article, I present a prospective analysis for this
measurement in the dimuon channel on the ATLAS experiment. The analysis uses
simulated datasets at a center-of-mass energy of 10 TeV. After summarizing the
motivations for the measurement, I discuss the Z boson selection criteria,
possible physics backgrounds, and background removal techniques with a focus on
data-driven background determination. I conclude with an outlook toward the
collision data expected in 2009-10.
