Non-statistical event-by-event fluctuations are considered an important
signal for the critical endpoint of the QCD phase diagram. Event-by-event
fluctuations of different observables are thus investigated in detail in
current experiments. In this contribution, a study of the centrality dependence
of event-by-event fluctuations of particle yield ratios by the NA49 experiment
in Pb+Pb collisions at 158A GeV beam energy is presented for the first time. An
increase of the absolute values of dynamical fluctuations towards lower
centralities is observed. The influence of resonance decays will be discussed.
Event-by-event fluctuations are an important observable to be studied at the
future CBM experiment at FAIR. CBM will investigate the intermediate region of
the QCD phase diagram in great detail searching for the first order phase
transition line and the expected critical endpoint. It is therefore important
to investigate the sensitivity of the CBM detector to particle ratio
fluctuations in Au+Au collisions at 10-45 AGeV beam energy. Detailed simulation
studies will be presented.
