We study the resonances of the quantum kicked rotor subjected to an
excitation that follows a deterministic time-dependent prescription. For the
primary resonances we find an analytical relation between the long-time
behavior of the standard deviation and the external kick strength. For the
secondary resonances we obtain essentially the same result numerically.
Selecting the time sequence of the kick allows to obtain a variety of
asymptotic wave-function spreadings: super-ballistic, ballistic, sub-ballistic,
diffusive, sub-diffusive and localized.
