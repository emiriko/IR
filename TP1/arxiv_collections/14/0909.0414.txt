We propose a strategy to enhance the atom-to-molecule conversion efficiency
near a Feshbach resonance. Based on the mean-field approximation, we derive the
fixed point solutions of the classical Hamiltonian. Rabi oscillation between
the atomic and molecular states around fixed point solutions and its
oscillation period are discussed. By designing a sequence of magnetic field
pulses in analogy with Ramsey experiments, we show that a much higher
atom-to-molecule conversion efficiency can be accessed by tuning the pulse
durations appropriately.
