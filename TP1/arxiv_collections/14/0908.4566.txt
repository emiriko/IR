The super upper half plane, this is the ordinary upper half plane with
additional odd (anticommuting) directions, admits a transitive super action of
a certain super Lie group G . First we define the spaces of super automorphic
and cusp forms on the super upper half plane for an ordinary lattice in G and
give an asymptotic formula for their dimensions for high weight. For involving
also the odd directions of G we introduce local super deformation of lattices
in G and show that for high weight the spaces of super automorphic and cusp
forms are stable under such local super deformations.
