Approximately 20% of very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -2.0) are strongly
enhanced in carbon ([C/Fe] > +1.0). Such stars are referred to as
carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. We present a chemical abundance
analysis based on high resolution spectra acquired with UVES at the VLT of
three dwarf CEMP stars: SDSS J1349-0229, SDSS J0912+0216 and SDSS J1036+1212.
These very metal-poor stars, with [Fe/H] < -2.5, were selected from our ongoing
survey of extremely metal-poor dwarf candidates from the SDSS. Among these
CEMPs, SDSS J1349-0229 has been identified as a carbon star ([C/O] > +1.0).
First and second peak s-process elements, as well as second peak r-process
elements have been detected in all stars. In addition, elements from the third
r-process peak were detected in one of the stars, SDSS J1036+1212. We present
the abundance results of these stars in the context of neutron-capture
nucleosynthesis theories.
