We discuss effects of reflective scattering for hadron and heavy nuclei
collisions at the LHC and asymptotical energies. It is shown that the
reflective scattering might lead to decreasing matter density with energy
beyond the LHC energies. Limiting form of energy dependence of hadron density
is obtained. Unitarity upper bound for the absolute value of the real part of
elastic scattering amplitude and two-particle inelastic binary reactions
amplitudes in impact parameter representation is two times less than the
corresponding bound for the imaginary part of the elastic scattering amplitude.
The former limit restricts a possible odderon contribution.
