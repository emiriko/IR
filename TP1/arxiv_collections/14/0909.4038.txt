Exclusive processes in hard electroproduction is one of the best place for
understanding the factorization properties of QCD. The HERA experiment recently
provided precise data for rho electroproduction, including all spin density
matrix elements. From QCD, it is expected that such a process should factorize
between a hard (calculable) coefficient function, and hadronic (p and rho)
matrix elements. Such a factorization is up to now only proven for a
longitudinaly polarized rho. Within the kt-factorization approach (valid at
large s_{gamma* p}), we evaluate the impact factor of the transition gamma* ->
rhoT taking into account the twist 3 contributions. We show that a gauge
invariant expression is obtained with the help of QCD equations of motion. More
generally, relying on these equations and on the invariance under rotation on
the light-cone of the factorized amplitude, the non-perturbative Distribution
Amplitudes can be reduced to a minimal set. This opens the way to a consistent
treatment of factorization for exclusive processes with a transversally
polarized vector meson. We prove the equivalence of two proposed
parametrizations of the rhoT distribution amplitudes.
