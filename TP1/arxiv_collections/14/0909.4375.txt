We investigate the dynamical evolution of a Jovian--mass planet injected into
an orbit highly inclined with respect to its nesting gaseous disk.
Planet--planet scattering induced by convergent planetary migration and mean
motion resonances may push a planet into such an out of plane configuration
with inclinations as large as $20^\circ-30^\circ$. In this scenario the tidal
interaction of the planet with the disk is more complex and, in addition to the
usual Lindblad and corotation resonances, it involves also inclination
resonances responsible of bending waves.
  We have performed three--dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the disk and
of its interactions with the planet with a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
(SPH) code. A main result is that the initial large eccentricity and
inclination of the planetary orbit are rapidly damped on a timescale of the
order of $10^3$ yrs, almost independently of the initial semimajor axis and
eccentricity of the planet. The disk is warped in response to the planet
perturbations and it precesses. Inward migration occurs also when the planet is
inclined and it has a drift rate which is intermediate between type I and type
II migration. The planet is not able to open a gap until its inclination
becomes lower than $\sim 10^\circ$ when it also begins to accrete a significant
amount of mass from the disk.
