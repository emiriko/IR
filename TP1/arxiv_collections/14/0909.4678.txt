In view of the appreciable semiconducting gap of 0.26 eV observed in recent
experiments, epitaxial graphene on a SiC substrate seems a promising channel
material for FETs. Indeed, it is two-dimensional - and therefore does not
require prohibitive lithography - and exhibits a wider gap than other
alternative options, such as bilayer graphene. Here we propose a model and
assess the achievable performance of a nanoscale FET based on epitaxial
graphene on SiC, conducting an exploration of the design parameter space. We
show that the current can be modulated by 4 orders of magnitude; for digital
applications an Ion /Ioff ratio of 50 and a subthreshold slope of 145 mV/decade
can be obtained with a supply voltage of 0.25 V. This represents a significant
progress towards solid-state integration of graphene electronics, but not yet
sufficient for digital applications.
