We analyze in detail the quantum instability which characterizes charged
scalar field on three special de Sitter charged black hole backgrounds. In
particular, we compute exactly the imaginary part of the effective action for
scalar charged fields on the ultracold I, ultracold II and Nariai charged black
hole backgrounds. Both the transmission coefficient approach and the
$\zeta$-function approach are exploited. Thermal effects on this quantum
instability are also taken into account in presence of a non-zero black hole
temperature (ultracold I and Nariai).
