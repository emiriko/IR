Covariant density functional theory, in the framework of self-consistent
Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) and Relativistic Random Phase approximation
(RPA), is for the first time applied to axially deformed nuclei. The fully
self-consistent RMF+RRPA equations are posed for the case of axial symmetry and
non-linear energy functionals, and solved with the help of a new parallel code.
Formal properties of RPA theory are studied and special care is taken in order
to validate the proper decoupling of spurious modes and their influence on the
physical response. Sample applications to the magnetic and electric dipole
transitions in $^{20}$Ne are presented and analyzed.
