This paper considers the control landscape of quantum transitions in
multi-qubit systems driven by unitary transformations with single-qubit
interaction terms. The two-qubit case is fully analyzed to reveal the features
of the landscape including the nature of the absolute maximum and minimum, the
saddle points and the absence of traps. The results permit calculating the
Schmidt state starting from an arbitrary two-qubit state following the local
gradient flow. The analysis of multi-qubit systems is more challenging, but the
generalized Schmidt states may also be located by following the local gradient
flow. Finally, we show the relation between the generalized Schmidt states and
the entanglement measure based on the Bures distance.
