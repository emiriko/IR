We derive the equations of motion of an extended test body in the context of
Einstein's theory of gravitation. The equations of motion are obtained via a
multipolar approximation method and are given up to the quadrupolar order.
Special emphasis is put on the explicit construction of the so-called canonical
form of the energy-momentum density. The set of gravitational multipolar
moments and the corresponding equations of motion allow for a systematic
comparison to competing multipolar approximation schemes.
