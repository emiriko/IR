A preconditioning for the Wilson fermion matrix on the lattice is defined
which is particularly suited to the case when the temporal lattice spacing is
much smaller than the spatial one. Details on the implementation of the scheme
are given. The method is tested in numerical studies of QCD on anisotropic
lattices.
