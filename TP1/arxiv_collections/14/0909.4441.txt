We consider multi-agent systems where agents' preferences are aggregated via
sequential majority voting: each decision is taken by performing a sequence of
pairwise comparisons where each comparison is a weighted majority vote among
the agents. Incompleteness in the agents' preferences is common in many
real-life settings due to privacy issues or an ongoing elicitation process. In
addition, there may be uncertainty about how the preferences are aggregated.
For example, the agenda (a tree whose leaves are labelled with the decisions
being compared) may not yet be known or fixed. We therefore study how to
determine collectively optimal decisions (also called winners) when preferences
may be incomplete, and when the agenda may be uncertain. We show that it is
computationally easy to determine if a candidate decision always wins, or may
win, whatever the agenda. On the other hand, it is computationally hard to know
wheth er a candidate decision wins in at least one agenda for at least one
completion of the agents' preferences. These results hold even if the agenda
must be balanced so that each candidate decision faces the same number of
majority votes. Such results are useful for reasoning about preference
elicitation. They help understand the complexity of tasks such as determining
if a decision can be taken collectively, as well as knowing if the winner can
be manipulated by appropriately ordering the agenda.
