Several inflationary models predict the possibility that the primordial
perturbations of the density field may contain a degree of non-Gaussianity
which would influence the subsequent evolution of cosmic structures at large
scales. In order to study their impact, we use a set of three cosmological
DM-only simulations starting from initial conditions with different levels of
non-Gaussianity: f_NL=0,+/-100. More specifically, we focus on the distribution
of galaxy clusters at different redshifts and, using suitable scaling
relations, we determine their X-ray and SZ signals. Our analysis allows us to
estimate the differences in the logN-logS and logN-logY due to the different
initial conditions and to predict the cluster counts at different redshifts
expected for future surveys (eROSITA and SPT). We also use a second set of
simulations assuming a different cosmological scenario to estimate how the
dependence on f_NL is degenerate with respect to other parameters. Our results
indicate that the effects introduced by a realistic amount of primordial
non-Gaussianity are small when compared to the ones connected with current
uncertainties in cosmological parameters, particularly with sigma_8. However,
if future surveys will be associated with optical follow-up campaigns to
determine the cluster redshift, an analysis of the samples at z>1 can provide
significant constraints on f_NL. In particular we predict that the SPT cluster
survey will be able to detect ~1000 clusters at z>1 for the Gaussian case, with
a difference of 15-20 per cent associated to f_NL=+/-100.
