Current reversal is an intriguing phenomenon that has been central to recent
experimental and theoretical investigations of transport based on ratchet
mechanism. By considering a system of two interacting ratchets, we demonstrate
how the coupling can be used to control the reversals. In particular, we find
that current reversal that exists in a single driven ratchet system can
ultimately be eliminated with the presence of a second ratchet. For specific
coupling strengths a current-reversal free regime has been detected.
Furthermore, in the fully synchronized state characterized by the coupling
threshold $k_{th}$, a specific driving amplitude $a_{opt}$ is found for which
the transport is optimum.
