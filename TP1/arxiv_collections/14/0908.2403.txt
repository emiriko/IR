Previous studies of type IIP supernovae have inferred that progenitor masses
recovered from hydrodynamic models are higher than 15 Msun. To verify the
progenitor mass of this supernova category, we attempt a parameter
determination of the well-observed luminous type IIP supernova 2004et. We model
the bolometric light curve and the photospheric velocities of SN 2004et by
means of hydrodynamic simulations in an extended parameter space. From
hydrodynamic simulations and observational data, we infer a presupernova radius
of 1500 Rsun, an ejecta mass of 24.5 Msun, an explosion energy of 2.3x10^{51}
erg, and a radioactive Ni-56 mass of 0.068 Msun. The estimated progenitor mass
on the main sequence is in the range of 25-29 Msun. In addition, we find clear
signatures of the explosion asymmetry in the nebular spectra of SN 2004et. The
measured progenitor mass of SN 2004et is significantly higher than the
progenitor mass suggested by the pre-explosion images. We speculate that the
mass inferred from hydrodynamic modeling is overestimated and crucial missing
factors are multi-dimensional effects.
