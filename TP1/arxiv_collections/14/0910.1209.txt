Some exactly solvable potentials in the position dependent mass background
are generated whose bound states are given in terms of Laguerre- or Jacobi-type
$X_1$ exceptional orthogonal polynomials. These potentials are shown to be
shape invariant and isospectral to the potentials whose bound state solutions
involve classical Laguerre or Jacobi polynomials.
