One of the most interesting and important phenomena predicted to occur in
heavy-ion collisions is the local strong parity violation. In non-central
collisions, it is expected to result in charge separation of produced particles
along the system's orbital momentum. I report on results of the charge
separation measurement in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at sqrt(s_NN)= 200 and 62
GeV with the STAR detector at RHIC based on three-particle mixed harmonic
azimuthal correlations. Systematic study of parity conserving (background)
effects with existing heavy-ion event generators, and their possible
contributions to the observed correlations are also present.
