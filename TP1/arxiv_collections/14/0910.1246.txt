The notion of a Heisenberg Uniqueness Pair (HUP) is introduced. This amounts
to asking which collections of exponentials are weak-star fundamental in
$L^\infty$ on a planar curve. In the case when the curve is a hyperbola, we can
give a complete answer if the frequencies are restricted to equally spaced
points on a lattice-cross. As a consequence, we solve a problem on the density
of algebras generated by two inner functions raised by Matheson and Stessin.
