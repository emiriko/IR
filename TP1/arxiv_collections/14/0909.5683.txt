We consider quantum interpolation of polynomials. We imagine a quantum
computer with black-box access to input/output pairs (x_i, f(x_i)), where f is
a degree-d polynomial, and we wish to compute f(0). We give asymptotically
tight quantum lower bounds for this problem, even in the case where 0 is among
the possible values of x_i.
