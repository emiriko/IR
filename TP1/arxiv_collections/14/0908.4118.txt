Anomalous diffusion, process in which the mean-squared displacement of system
states is a non-linear function of time, is usually identified in real
stochastic processes by comparing experimental and theoretical displacements at
relatively small time intervals. This paper proposes an interpolation
expression for the identification of anomalous diffusion in complex signals for
the cases when the dynamics of the system under study reaches a steady state
(large time intervals). This interpolation expression uses the chaotic
difference moment (transient structural function) of the second order as an
average characteristic of displacements. A general procedure for identifying
anomalous diffusion and calculating its parameters in real stochastic signals,
which includes the removal of the regular (low-frequency) components from the
source signal and the fitting of the chaotic part of the experimental
difference moment of the second order to the interpolation expression, is
presented. The procedure was applied to the analysis of the dynamics of
magnetoencephalograms, blinking fluorescence of quantum dots, and X-ray
emission from accreting objects. For all three applications, the interpolation
was able to adequately describe the chaotic part of the experimental difference
moment, which implies that anomalous diffusion manifests itself in these
natural signals. The results of this study make it possible to broaden the
range of complex natural processes in which anomalous diffusion can be
identified. The relation between the interpolation expression and a diffusion
model, which is derived in the paper, allows one to simulate the chaotic
processes in the open complex systems with anomalous diffusion.
