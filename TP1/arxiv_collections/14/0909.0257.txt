We present recent results from a GALEX investigation of star formation in 16
cooling core clusters of galaxies, selected to span a broad range in both
redshift and central cooling time. Initial results demonstrate clear UV
excesses in most, but not all, brightest cluster galaxies in our sample. This
UV excess is a direct indication of the presence of young massive stars and,
therefore, recent star formation. We report on the physical extent of UV
emission in these objects as well as their FUV-NUV colors, and compare GALEX
inferred star formation rates to central cooling times, H-alpha and IR
luminosities for our sample.
