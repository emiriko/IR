We have investigated the Josephson inductance $L_J$ of a Superconducting
Cooper Pair Transistor (SCPT). We traced the inductance using microwave
reflection measurements on a tuned resonance circuit in which a SCPT was
mounted in parallel to a $ \sim 200$ pH strip line inductance. When the inverse
of the Josephson inductance, determined on the charge-phase bias plane for a
SCPT with a Josephson to Coulomb energy ratio of $E_J/E_C =1.75$, is integrated
over the phase, we obtain a current-phase relation, which is strongly
non-sinusoidal near the charge degeneracy point.
