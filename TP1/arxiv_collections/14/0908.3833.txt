Electrical transport properties as a function of magnetic field and time have
been investigated in polycrystalline, Nd_{0.84}Sr_{0.16}CoO_3. A strong
exchange bias (EB) effect is observed associated with the fairly large
intragranular magnetoresistance (MR). The EB effect observed in the MR curve is
compared with the EB effect manifested in magnetic hysteresis loop. Training
effect, described as the decrease of EB effect when the sample is successively
field-cycled at a particular temperature, has been observed in the shift of the
MR curve. Training effect could be analysed by the successful models. The EB
effect, MR and a considerable time dependence in MR are attributed to the
intrinsic nanostructure giving rise to the varieties of magnetic interfaces in
the grain interior.
