With the purpose to introduce a useful tool for researches concerning
foundations of quantum mechanics and applications to quantum technologies, here
we study three quantumness quantifiers for bipartite optical systems: one based
on sub-shot-noise correlations, one related to antibunching and one springing
from entanglement determination. The specific cases of parametric down
conversion seeded by thermal, coherent and squeezed states are discussed in
detail.
