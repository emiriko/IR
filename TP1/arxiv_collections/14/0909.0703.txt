This thesis presents an investigation of meson and baryon properties in the
framework of covariant bound-state equations based on the Dyson-Schwinger
equations of QCD. Pion and rho-meson, diquark, nucleon and delta-baryon masses
are obtained as self-consistent solutions of the respective equations for
$q\bar{q}$, $qq$, $qqq$ and $q(qq)$ systems. The common parenthesis is given by
a rainbow-ladder truncation in the quark-(anti-)quark channel. It includes an
effective quark-gluon coupling as the only phenomenological input and inherent
link in the calculation of meson and baryon observables.
  Results for hadron masses and the pion's and nucleon's static electromagnetic
properties as a function of a self-consistently calculated pion mass are
presented and compared to lattice results and their chiral extrapolations. The
evolution of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors with larger photon
momentum is investigated. The impact of further contributions beyond
rainbow-ladder, e.g. pionic corrections, and possible future applications are
discussed.
