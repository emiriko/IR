We argue that quantum mechanics makes sense without such controversial
postulates as the wave function collapse, the quantum probability rule and the
observable postulate. We only need the existence of a wave function as a
representation of a state, its dynamical evolution rule and another rather
trivial postulate proposed here (Read-Off Postulate). The wave function
collapse and the probability rule are replaced with intrinsic properties of the
theory, i.e. decoherence and relative frequency, respectively. Interpretation
of the wave function as a faithful representation of the reality naturally
emerges, although quantum reality has a peculiar feature which distinguishes it
from classical reality.
