We investigate the dynamical evolution of the terrestrial planets during the
planetesimal-driven migration of the giant planets. A basic assumption of this
work is that giant planet migration occurred after the completion of
terrestrial planet formation, such as in the models that link the former to the
origin of the Late Heavy Bombardment. The divergent migration of Jupiter and
Saturn causes the g5 eigenfrequency to cross resonances of the form g5=gk with
k ranging from 1 to 4. Consequently these secular resonances cause
large-amplitude responses in the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets. We
show that the resonances g5=g_4 and g5=g3 do not pose a problem if Jupiter and
Saturn have a fast approach and departure from their mutual 2:1 mean motion
resonance. On the other hand, the resonance crossings g5=g2 and g5=g1 are more
of a concern as they tend to yield a terrestrial system incompatible with the
current one. We offer two solutions to this problem. The first uses the fact
that a secular resonance crossing can also damp the amplitude of a Fourier mode
if the latter is large originally. A second scenario involves a 'jumping
Jupiter' in which encounters between an ice giant and Jupiter, without ejection
of the former, cause the latter to migrate away from Saturn much faster than if
migration is driven solely by encounters with planetesimals. In this case, the
g5=g2 and g5=g1 resonances can be jumped over, or occur very briefly.
