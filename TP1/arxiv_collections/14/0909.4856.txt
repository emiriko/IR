New methods and theory have recently been developed to nonparametrically
estimate cumulative incidence functions for competing risks survival data
subject to current status censoring. In particular, the limiting distribution
of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator and a simplified "naive
estimator" have been established under certain smoothness conditions. In this
paper, we establish the large-sample behavior of these estimators in two
additional models, namely when the observation time distribution has discrete
support and when the observation times are grouped. These asymptotic results
are applied to the construction of confidence intervals in the three different
models. The methods are illustrated on two data sets regarding the cumulative
incidence of (i) different types of menopause from a cross-sectional sample of
women in the United States and (ii) subtype-specific HIV infection from a
sero-prevalence study in injecting drug users in Thailand.
