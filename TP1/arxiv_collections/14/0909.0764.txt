This article introduces Object-Oriented Intensional Programming (OO-IP), a
new hybrid language between Object-Oriented and Intensional Programming
Languages in the sense of the latest evolutions of Lucid. This new hybrid
language combines the essential characteristics of Lucid and Java, and
introduces the notion of object streams which makes it is possible that each
element in a Lucid stream to be an object with embedded intensional properties.
Interestingly, this hybrid language also brings to Java objects the power to
explicitly express and manipulate the notion of context, creating the novel
concept of intensional object, i.e. objects whose evaluation is
context-dependent, which are here demonstrated to be translatable into standard
objects. By this new approach, we extend the use and meaning of the notion of
intensional objects and enrich the meaning of object streams in Lucid and
semantics of intensional objects in Java.
