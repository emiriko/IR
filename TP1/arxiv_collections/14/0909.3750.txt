We demonstrate experimentally how orbital-angular-momentum entanglement of
two photons evolves under influence of atmospheric turbulence. We find that the
quantum channel capacity is surprisingly robust: Its typical horizontal decay
distance is of the order of 2 kilometers, demonstrating the potential of
photonic orbital angular momentum for free-space quantum communication in a
metropolitan environment.
