The presence of pulsations in late-type Be stars is still a matter of
controversy. It constitutes an important issue to establish the relationship
between non-radial pulsations and the mass-loss mechanism in Be stars.
  To contribute to this discussion, we analyse the photometric time series of
the B8IVe star HD 50209 observed by the CoRoT mission in the seismology field.
  We use standard Fourier techniques and linear and non-linear least squares
fitting methods to analyse the CoRoT light curve. In addition, we applied
detailed modelling of high-resolution spectra to obtain the fundamental
physical parameters of the star.
  We have found four frequencies which correspond to gravity modes with
azimuthal order m=0,-1,-2,-3 with the same pulsational frequency in the
co-rotating frame. We also found a rotational period with a frequency of 0.679
\cd (7.754 $\mu$Hz).
  HD 50209 is a pulsating Be star as expected from its position in the HR
diagram, close to the SPB instability strip.
