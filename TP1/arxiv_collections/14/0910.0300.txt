We determine the conditions for the existence of a pair of degenerate parity
breaking separable eigenstates in general arrays of arbitrary spins connected
through $XYZ$ couplings of arbitrary range and placed in a transverse field,
not necessarily uniform. Sufficient conditions under which they are ground
states are also provided. It is then shown that in finite chains, the
associated definite parity states, which represent the actual ground state in
the immediate vicinity of separability, can exhibit entanglement between any
two spins regardless of the coupling range or separation, with the reduced
state of any two subsystems equivalent to that of pair of qubits in an
entangled mixed state. The corresponding concurrences and negativities are
exactly determined. The same properties persist in the mixture of both definite
parity states. These effects become specially relevant in systems close to the
$XXZ$ limit. The possibility of field induced alternating separable solutions
with controllable entanglement side limits is also discussed. Illustrative
numerical results for the negativity between the first and the $j^{\rm th}$
spin in an open spin $s$ chain for different values of $s$ and $j$ are as well
provided.
