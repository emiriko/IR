We study tilting for a class of Calabi-Yau algebras associated to helices on
Fano varieties. We do this by relating the tilting operation to mutations of
exceptional collections. For helices on del Pezzo surfaces the algebras are of
dimension three, and using an argument of Herzog, together with results of
Kuleshov and Orlov, we obtain a complete description of the tilting process in
terms of quiver mutations.
