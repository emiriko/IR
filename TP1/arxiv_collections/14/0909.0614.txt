We study the magnetic properties of the coloured multiquark states in the
quark-gluon plasma where the gluons are deconfined and the chiral symmetry is
still broken, using the Sakai-Sugimoto model. There are two possible magnetized
multiquark configurations. Both configurations converge to the same
configuration at the critical field and temperature before they dissociate
altogether either into less coloured multiquarks or into other phases for a
fixed density. It is also found that the multiquarks with higher colour charges
respond more to the external magnetic field in both the magnetization and the
degree of chiral symmetry breaking. Magnetic field also makes it more difficult
for multiquark states with large colour charges to satisfy the equilibrium
condition of the configuration in the gravity dual picture. As long as the
chemical potential $\mu > \mu_{onset}$, the magnetized multiquarks phase is
thermodynamically preferred over the magnetized vacuum. Pure pion gradient and
the chiral-symmetric quark-gluon plasma ($\chi_S$-QGP) phase for the general
Sakai-Sugimoto model are discussed and compared with the multiquark phase in
the presence of the magnetic field. It is found that at large densities and
moderate fields, the mixed phase of multiquarks and the pion gradient is
thermodynamically preferred over the $\chi_S$-QGP.
