The analysis of transiting extra-solar planets provides an enormous amount of
information about the formation and evolution of planetary systems. A precise
knowledge of the host stars is necessary to derive the planetary properties
accurately. The properties of the host stars, especially their chemical
composition, are also of interest in their own right. Information about planet
formation is inferred by, among others, correlations between different
parameters such as the orbital period and the metallicity of the host stars.
The stellar properties studied should be derived as homogeneously as possible.
The present work provides new, uniformly derived parameters for 13 host stars
of transiting planets. Effective temperature, surface gravity, microturbulence
parameter, and iron abundance were derived from spectra of both high
signal-to-noise ratio and high resolution by assuming iron excitation and
ionization equilibria. For some stars, the new parameters differ from previous
determinations, which is indicative of changes in the planetary radii. A
systematic offset in the abundance scale with respect to previous assessments
is found for the TrES and HAT objects. Our abundance measurements are
remarkably robust in terms of the uncertainties in surface gravities. The iron
abundances measured in the present work are supplemented by all previous
determinations using the same analysis technique. The distribution of iron
abundance then agrees well with the known metal-rich distribution of planet
host stars. To facilitate future studies, the spectroscopic results of the
current work are supplemented by the findings for other host stars of
transiting planets, for a total dataset of 50 objects.
