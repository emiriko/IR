This study investigates the relationship between atmospheric extinction and
the spectrum of the Red Rectangle nebula on scales of a few to a few tens of
Ang. It is found that the fine structure of the nebula's continuum short-ward
of 6700A is similar to background spectra, and is thus determined either by
atmospheric absorption or by light from HD44179 scattered in the earth
atmosphere.
