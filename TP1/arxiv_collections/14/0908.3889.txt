We report on early results of a numerical and statistical study of binary
black hole inspirals. The two black holes are evolved using post-Newtonian
approximations starting with initially randomly distributed spin vectors. We
characterize certain aspects of the distribution shortly before merger. In
particular we note the uniform distribution of black hole spin vector dot
products shortly before merger and a high correlation between the initial and
final black hole spin vector dot products in the equal-mass, maximally spinning
case. These simulations were performed on Graphics Processing Units, and we
demonstrate a speed-up of a factor 50 over a more conventional CPU
implementation.
