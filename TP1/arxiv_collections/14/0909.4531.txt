We expand on the results of Nielsen et al. (2008), using the null result for
giant extrasolar planets around the 118 target stars from the VLT NACO H and Ks
band planet search (Masciadri et al. 2005), the VLT and MMT Simultaneous
Differential Imaging (SDI) survey (Biller et al. 2007), and the Gemini Deep
Planet Survey (Lafreniere et al. 2007) to set constraints on the population of
giant extrasolar planets. Our analysis is extended to include the planet
luminosity models of Fortney et al. (2008), as well as the correlation between
stellar mass and frequency of giant planets found by Johnson et al. (2007).
Doubling the sample size of FGKM stars strengthens our conclusions: a model for
extrasolar giant planets with power-laws for mass and semi-major axis as giving
by Cumming et al. (2008) cannot, with 95% confidence, have planets beyond 65
AU, compared to the value of 94 AU reported in Nielsen et al. (2008), using the
models of Baraffe et al. (2003). When the Johnson et al. (2007) correction for
stellar mass (which gives fewer Jupiter-mass companions to M stars with respect
to solar-type stars) is applied, however, this limit moves out to 82 AU. For
the relatively new Fortney et al. (2008) models, which predict fainter planets
across most of parameter space, these upper limits, with and without a
correction for stellar mass, are 182 and 234 AU, respectively.
