New exact solutions of relativistic perfect fluid hydrodynamics are
described, including the first family of exact rotating solutions. The method
used to search for them is an investigation of the relativistic hydrodynamical
equations and the collisionless Boltzmann equation. Possible connections to the
evolution of hot and dense partonic matter in heavy-ion collisions is
discussed.
