We investigate quantum phase transitions in which a change in the type of
entanglement from bound entanglement to either free entanglement or
separability may occur. In particular, we present a theoretical method to
construct a class of quantum spin-chain Hamiltonians that exhibit this type of
quantum criticality. Given parameter-dependent two-site reduced density
matrices (with prescribed entanglement properties), we lay out a reverse
construction for a compatible pure state for the whole system, as well as a
class of Hamiltonians for which this pure state is a ground state. This
construction is illustrated through several examples.
