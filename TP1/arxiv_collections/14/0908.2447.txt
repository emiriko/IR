Atom interferometry is a rapidly advancing field and this Letter proposes an
experiment based on existing technology that can search for new short distance
forces. With current technology it is possible to improve the sensitivity by up
to a factor of 10^2 and near-future advances will be able to rewrite the limits
for forces with ranges from 100 um to 1 km.
