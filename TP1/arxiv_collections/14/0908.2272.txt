Suppose G is a non-free finitely generated Kleinian group without parabolics
which is not a lattice and let C(G) denote the commensurator in PSL(2,C). We
prove that if the limit set of G is not a round circle, then C(G) is discrete.
Furthermore, G has finite index in C(G) unless G is a fiber group in which case
C(G) is a lattice.
