I summarize the results of our integral field spectroscopic observations of
the nearby prototype of HII galaxies, II Zw 40. Observations with GMOS-IFU on
GEMINI-North in the optical allowed us to make a detailed kinematic picture of
the central starburst, while SINFONI with adaptive optics on the ESO-VLT gave
us a near-IR view of the interplay between the ISM phases.
  Here, I also address the question that not all starbursts require an external
trigger such as a galaxy-galaxy encounter, as it seems to be the case for a
fraction of low luminosity HII galaxies. We speculate that these may form stars
spontaneously like "pop-corn in a pan".
