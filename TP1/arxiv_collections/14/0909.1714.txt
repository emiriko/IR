We study the behaviour of an ultracold atomic gas of bosons in a bichromatic
lattice, where the weaker lattice is used as a source of disorder. We
numerically solve a discretized mean-field equation, which generalizes the
one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\`e model for particles in a quasi-periodic potential
by including the interaction between atoms. We compare the results for
commensurate and incommensurate lattices. We investigate the role of the
initial shape of the wavepacket as well as the interplay between two competing
effects of the interaction, namely self-trapping and delocalization. Our
calculations show that, if the condensate initially occupies a single lattice
site, the dynamics of the interacting gas is dominated by self-trapping in a
wide range of parameters, even for weak interaction. Conversely, if the
diffusion starts from a Gaussian wavepacket, self-trapping is significantly
suppressed and the destruction of localization by interaction is more easily
observable.
