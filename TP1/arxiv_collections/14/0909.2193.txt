We present the largest spectroscopic follow-up performed in SWIRE ELAIS-N1.
We were able to determine redshifts for 289 extragalactic sources. The values
of spectroscopic redshifts of the latter have been compared with the estimated
values from our photometric redshift code with very good agreement between the
two for both galaxies and quasars. Six of the quasars are hyperluminous
infrared galaxies all of which are broad line AGN. We have performed emission
line diagnostics for 30 sources in order to classify them into star-forming,
Seyferts, composite and LINER and compare the results to the predictions from
our SED template fitting methods and mid-IR selection methods.
