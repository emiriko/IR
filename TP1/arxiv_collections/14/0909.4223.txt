Isolated photon production in deep inelastic ep scattering has been measured
with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 320pb^-1.
Measurements were made in the isolated-photon transverse-energy and
pseudorapidity ranges 4 < E_T < 15 GeV and -0.7 < eta < 0.9 for exchanged
photon virtualities, Q^2, in the range 10 < Q^2 < 350 GeV and for invariant
masses of the hadronic system W_X> 5 GeV. Differential cross sections are
presented for inclusive isolated photon production as functions of Q^2, x, E_T
and eta. Leading-logarithm parton-shower Monte Carlo simulations and
perturbative QCD predictions give a reasonable description of the data over
most of the kinematic range.
