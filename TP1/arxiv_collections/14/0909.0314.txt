It has long been known that null unstable geodesics are related to the
characteristic modes of black holes-- the so called quasinormal resonances. The
basic idea is to interpret the free oscillations of a black hole in the eikonal
limit in terms of null particles trapped at the unstable circular orbit and
slowly leaking out. The real part of the complex quasinormal resonances is
related to the angular velocity at the unstable null geodesic. The imaginary
part of the resonances is related to the instability timescale (or the inverse
Lyapunov exponent) of the orbit. While this geometric-optics description of the
black-hole quasinormal resonances in terms of perturbed null {\it rays} is very
appealing and intuitive, it is still highly important to verify the validity of
this approach by directly analyzing the Teukolsky wave equation which governs
the dynamics of perturbation {\it waves} in the black-hole spacetime. This is
the main goal of the present paper. We first use the geometric-optics technique
of perturbing a bundle of unstable null rays to calculate the resonances of
near-extremal Kerr black holes in the eikonal approximation. We then directly
solve the Teukolsky wave equation (supplemented by the appropriate physical
boundary conditions) and show that the resultant quasinormal spectrum obtained
directly from the wave analysis is in accord with the spectrum obtained from
the geometric-optics approximation of perturbed null rays.
