Second-generation interferometric gravitational-wave detectors will be
operating at the Standard Quantum Limit, a sensitivity limitation set by the
trade off between measurement accuracy and quantum back action, which is
governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. We review several schemes
that allows the quantum noise of interferometers to surpass the Standard
Quantum Limit significantly over a broad frequency band. Such schemes may be an
important component of the design of third-generation detectors.
