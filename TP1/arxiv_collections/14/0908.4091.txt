We present a catalog of extended objects in the vicinity of M81 based a set
of 24 Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) Wide Field
Camera (WFC) F814W (I-band) images. We have found 233 good globular cluster
candidates; 92 candidate HII regions, OB associations, or diffuse open
clusters; 489 probable background galaxies; and 1719 unclassified objects. We
have color data from ground-based g- and r-band MMT Megacam images for 79
galaxies, 125 globular cluster candidates, 7 HII regions, and 184 unclassified
objects. The color-color diagram of globular cluster candidates shows that most
fall into the range 0.25 < g-r < 1.25 and 0.5 < r-I < 1.25, similar to the
color range of Milky Way globular clusters. Unclassified objects are often
blue, suggesting that many of them are likely to be HII regions and open
clusters, although a few galaxies and globular clusters may be among them.
