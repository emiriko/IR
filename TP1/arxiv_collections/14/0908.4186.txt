The normalized raw data of the Earth's electric field, monitored at PYR, ATH,
HIO monitoring sites in Greece, are studied as far as it concerns the presence
of electric seismic precursors. Electric preseismic pulses, plateau-like
anomalous electric field and Very Long Period (VLP) anomalies were detected
prior to the occurrence of the July 1st, 2009 large (Ms = 6.3R) EQ in Greece.
Further processing of the same data revealed the true form of the generated
preseimic potential thus providing an indirect estimation of the time window of
the occurrence of the large EQ. Finally, by correlating, at pairs, the
anomalous electric field from all monitoring sites it is possible to calculate
the "strange attractor like" seismic electric precursor that provides a time
window for the occurrence of the large EQ and utilizes the determination not
only of the regional seismogenic area that has been activated but also a more
precise epicenter too.
