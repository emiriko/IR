Multiple antenna technologies have received high attention in the last few
decades for their capabilities to improve the overall system performance.
Multiple-input multiple-output systems include a variety of techniques capable
of not only increase the reliability of the communication but also impressively
boost the channel capacity. In addition, smart antenna systems can increase the
link quality and lead to appreciable interference reduction.
