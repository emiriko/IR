Excitations from a strongly frustrated system, the kagome ice state of the
spin ice Dy2Ti2O7 under magnetic fields along a [111] direction, have been
studied. They are theoretically proposed to be regarded as magnetic monopoles.
Neutron scattering measurements of spin correlations show that close to the
critical point the monopoles are fluctuating between high- and low-density
states, supporting that the magnetic Coulomb force acts between them. Specific
heat measurements show that monopole-pair creation obeys an Arrhenius law,
indicating that the density of monopoles can be controlled by temperature and
magnetic field.
