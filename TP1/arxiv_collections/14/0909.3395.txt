Based upon physiological observation on time dependent orientation
selectivity in the cells of macaque's primary visual cortex together with the
psychophysical studies on the tuning of orientation detectors in human vision
we suggest that time dependence in brightness perception can be accommodated
through the time evolution of cortical contribution to the orientation tuning
of the ODoG filter responses. A set of Difference of Gaussians functions has
been used to mimic the time dependence of orientation tuning. The tuning of
orientation preference and its inversion at a later time have been considered
in explaining qualitatively the temporal dynamics of brightness perception
observed in "Brief presentations reveal the temporal dynamics of brightness
induction and White's illusion" for 58 and 82 ms of stimulus exposure.
