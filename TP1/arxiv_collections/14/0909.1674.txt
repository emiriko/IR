We used the quantitative theory of solubility of karst rocks of Shopov et.
al, (1989, 1991a) in dependence of the temperature and other thermodynamic
parameters to make reconstructions of past carbonate denudation rates. This
theory produced equations assessing the carbonate denudation rates in
dependence on the temperature or on the precipitation. We estimated the
averaged denudation rate in the region to 14 mm/kyr or 38 t/km2 per year. We
used this estimate as starting point and substituted our proxy records of the
annual temperature and the annual precipitation in the equations of dependence
of karst denudation rate on precipitation and temperature. This way we
reconstructed variations of the annual karst denudation rate for the last 280
years in dependence on the annual precipitation and for the last 1250 years in
dependence on the temperature. Both reconstructions produce quite reasonable
estimate of the variations of carbonate denudation, which is within observed
variation of 8- 20 mm/kyr (86% variation). Precipitation dependence of
carbonate denudation produces 79 % variation in the denudation rate in result
of the reconstructed variation of 300 mm/yr from the driest to the wettest year
during the last 280 years. Temperature dependence of carbonate denudation due
to temperature dependence of solubility of the carbonate dioxide produce only
9.3% variation in the denudation rate in result of the reconstructed variation
of 4.7 deg. C during the last 1250 years, so it is negligible in respect of the
precipitation dependence.
