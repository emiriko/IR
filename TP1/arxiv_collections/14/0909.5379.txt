Analysis of the data obtained with the RXTE observatory during a powerful
outburst of the X-ray pulsar V0332+53 in 2004-2005 is presented. Observational
data covering the outburst brightening phase are analysed in detail for the
first time. A comparison of source parameters and their evolution during the
brightening and fading phases shows no evidence for any hysteresis behaviour.
It is found that the dependences of the energy of the cyclotron absorption line
on the luminosity during the brightening and fading phases are almost
identical. The complete data sequence including the outburst brightening and
fading phases makes it possible to impose the more stringent constraints on the
magnetic field in the source. The pulse profile and pulsed fraction are studied
as functions of the luminosity and photon energy.
