Clustering large spatial databases is an important problem, which tries to
find the densely populated regions in a spatial area to be used in data mining,
knowledge discovery, or efficient information retrieval. However most
algorithms have ignored the fact that physical obstacles such as rivers, lakes,
and highways exist in the real world and could thus affect the result of the
clustering. In this paper, we propose CPO, an efficient clustering technique to
solve the problem of clustering in the presence of obstacles. The proposed
algorithm divides the spatial area into rectangular cells. Each cell is
associated with statistical information used to label the cell as dense or
non-dense. It also labels each cell as obstructed (i.e. intersects any
obstacle) or nonobstructed. For each obstructed cell, the algorithm finds a
number of non-obstructed sub-cells. Then it finds the dense regions of
non-obstructed cells or sub-cells by a breadthfirst search as the required
clusters with a center to each region.
