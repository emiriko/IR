We report on our theoretical investigation considering the widths of
quantized Hall plateaus (QHPs) depending on the density asymmetry induced by
the large current within the out-of-linear response regime. We solve the
Schrodinger equation within the Hartree type mean field approximation using
Thomas Fermi Poisson nonlinear screening theory. We observe that the two
dimensional electron system splits into compressible and incompressible regions
for certain magnetic field intervals, where the Hall resistance is quantized
and the longitudinal resistance vanishes, if an external current is imposed. We
found that the strong current imposed, induces an asymmetry on the IS width
depending linearly on the current intensity.
