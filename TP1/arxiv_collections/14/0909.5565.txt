We derive a time-convolutionless master equation for the spin-boson model in
the weak coupling limit. The temporarily negative decay rates in the master
equation indicate short time memory effects in the dynamics which is explicitly
revealed when the dynamics is studied using the non-Markovian jump description.
The approach gives new insight into the memory effects influencing the spin
dynamics and demonstrates, how for the spin-boson model the the co-operative
action of different channels complicates the detection of memory effects in the
dynamics.
