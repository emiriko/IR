Astronomy is an observationally-led subject where chance discoveries play an
important role. A whole range of such discoveries is continually made, from the
trivial to the highly significant. What is generally needed is for luck to
strike someone who is prepared, in the sense that they appreciate that
something novel has been seen. "Chance favours the prepared mind" in the words
of Pasteur, 1854.
