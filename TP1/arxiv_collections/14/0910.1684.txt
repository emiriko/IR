Four-dimensional super-twistors provide a compact covariant description of
on-shell N=4 d=4 super-Yang-Mills. In this paper, ten-dimensional
super-twistors are introduced which similarly provide a compact covariant
description of on-shell d=10 super-Yang-Mills. The super-twistor variables are
Z=(lambda^alpha, mu_alpha, Gamma^m) where lambda^alpha and mu_alpha are
constrained bosonic d=10 spinors and Gamma^m is a constrained fermionic d=10
vector. The Penrose map relates the twistor superfield Phi(Z) with the d=10
super-Yang-Mills vertex operator lambda^alpha A_alpha(x,theta) which appears in
the pure spinor formalism of the superstring, and the cubic super-Yang-Mills
amplitude is proportional to the super-twistor integral \int dZ Phi_1 Phi_2
Phi_3.
