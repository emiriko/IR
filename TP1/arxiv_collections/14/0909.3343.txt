We investigate the emergent behavior of four types of generic dynamical
systems under random environmental perturbations. Sufficient conditions for
nearly-emergence in various scenarios are presented. Recent fundamental works
of F. Cucker and S. Smale on the construction and analysis of flocking models
directly inspired our present work.
