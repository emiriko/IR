We follow the generalisation of exclusion statistics to infinite dimensional
Hilbert space as envisaged in Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf{72}}, 3629, 1994. We
reproduce the third virial coefficients at leading order for single species of
anionic gas and 2nd mixed virial coefficients for multicomponent anionic gas.
We argue that this particular method can be useful in determining definition of
mutual exclusion statistics. We demonstrate this by taking high temperature
expansion of two particle partition function of well known systems and show
that it follows Haldane's definition of exclusion statistics. We also discuss
equilibrium particle distributions at thermodynamic limit.
