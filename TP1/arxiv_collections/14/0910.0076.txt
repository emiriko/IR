A theoretical description of shell structure for charged particles in a
harmonic trap is explored at strong coupling conditions of $\Gamma$ = 50 and
100. The theory is based on an extension of the hypernetted chain approximation
to confined systems plus a phenomenological representation of associated bridge
functions. Predictions are compared to corresponding Monte Carlo simulations
and quantitative agreement for the radial density profile is obtained.
