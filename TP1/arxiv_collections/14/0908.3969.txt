We discuss the recent derivation of the three-loop ${\cal O}(\alpha\alpha_s)$
contribution to the Higgs boson production cross section via gluon fusion
arising from diagrams with light quarks, using an effective theory approach. We
show results for the updated prediction of this process accounting for all the
new theoretical calculations and the newest MSTW PDFs.
