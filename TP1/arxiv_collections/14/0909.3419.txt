The low lying spectrum of QCD in the delta-regime is calculated here in
chiral perturbation theory up to NNL order. The spectrum has a simple form in
terms of the pion decay constant F and a combination of the low energy
constants Lambda1 and Lambda2. Since measuring low lying stable masses is among
the easiest numerical tasks, the results should help fixing these parameters to
good precision.
