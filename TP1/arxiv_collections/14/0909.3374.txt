We study possible phenomenological consequences of the recently proposed new
approach to the Weinberg-Salam model. The electroweak theory is considered as a
gravity and the Higgs particle is interpreted in it as a dilaton, without the
usual potential of interaction in the Higgs sector. We have taken as a test the
process of photons pair production, $e^+ + e^- \to Z + \gamma + \gamma$. In the
framework of new formulation this reaction is mediated in the lowest order by
the dilaton. The cross section is found to be rather small.
