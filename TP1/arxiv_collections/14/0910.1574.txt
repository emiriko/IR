We present an approximative simulation method for quantum many-body systems
based on coarse graining the space of the momentum transferred between
interacting particles, which leads to effective Hamiltonians of reduced size
with the flavor-twisted boundary condition. A rapid, accurate, and fast
convergent computation of the ground-state energy is demonstrated on the
spin-1/2 quantum antiferromagnet of any dimension by employing only two sites.
The method is expected to be useful for future simulations and quick estimates
on other strongly correlated systems.
