We study the late time evolution of flat and negatively curved
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) models with a perfect fluid matter source and
a scalar field arising in the conformal frame of $f(R)$ theories nonminimally
coupled to matter. Under mild assumptions on the potential V we prove that
equilibria corresponding to non-negative local minima for V are asymptotically
stable, as well as horizontal asymptotes approached from above by V. We
classify all cases of the flat model where one of the matter components
eventually dominates. In particular for a nondegenerate minimum of the
potential with zero critical value we prove in detail that if the parameter of
the equation of state is larger than one, then there is a transfer of energy
from the fluid to the scalar field and the later eventually dominates in a
generic way.
