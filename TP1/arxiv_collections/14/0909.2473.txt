Many famous graphs are edge-primitive, for example, the Heawood graph, the
Tutte--Coxeter graph and the Higman--Sims graph. In this paper we
systematically analyse edge-primitive and edge-quasiprimitive graphs via the
O'Nan--Scott Theorem to determine the possible edge and vertex actions of such
graphs. Many interesting examples are given and we also determine all
$G$-edge-primitive graphs for $G$ an almost simple group with socle $PSL(2,q)$.
