Using exponential quadratic operators, we present a general framework for
studying the exact dynamics of system-bath interaction in which the Hamiltonian
is described by the quadratic form of bosonic operators. To demonstrate the
versatility of the approach, we study how the environment affects the squeezing
of quadrature components of the system. We further propose that the squeezing
can be enhanced when parity kicks are applied to the system.
