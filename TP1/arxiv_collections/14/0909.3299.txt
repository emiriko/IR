We present results from a continuing interferometric survey of high-redshift
submillimeter galaxies with the Submillimeter Array, including high-resolution
(beam size ~2 arcsec) imaging of eight additional AzTEC 1.1mm selected sources
in the COSMOS Field, for which we obtain six reliable (peak S/N>5 or peak S/N>4
with multiwavelength counterparts within the beam) and two moderate
significance (peak S/N>4) detections. When combined with previous detections,
this yields an unbiased sample of millimeter-selected SMGs with complete
interferometric followup. With this sample in hand, we (1) empirically confirm
the radio-submillimeter association, (2) examine the submillimeter morphology -
including the nature of submillimeter galaxies with multiple radio counterparts
and constraints on the physical scale of the far infrared - of the sample, and
(3) find additional evidence for a population of extremely luminous, radio-dim
submillimeter galaxies that peaks at higher redshift than previous,
radio-selected samples. In particular, the presence of such a population of
high-redshift sources has important consequences for models of galaxy formation
- which struggle to account for such objects even under liberal assumptions -
and dust production models given the limited time since the Big Bang.
