We introduce a new numerical technique, namely triangular tessellation, to
calculate the free energy associated with the adsorption of a colloidal
particle at a flat interface. The theory and numerical scheme presented here
are sufficiently general to handle non-convex patchy colloids with arbitrary
surface patterns characterized by a wetting angle, e.g., amphiphilicity. We
ignore interfacial deformation due to capillary, electrostatic, or
gravitational forces, but the method can be extended to take such effects into
account. It is verified that the numerical method presented is accurate and
sufficiently stable to be applied to more general situations than presented in
this paper. The merits of the tessellation method prove to outweigh those of
traditionally used semi-analytic approaches, especially when it comes to
generality and applicability.
