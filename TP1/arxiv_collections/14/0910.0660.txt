We show explicitly how to realize an arbitrary linear unitary Bogoliubov
transformation (LUBO) on a multi-mode quantum state through homodyne-based
one-way quantum computation. Any LUBO can be approximated by means of a fixed,
finite-sized, sufficiently squeezed Gaussian cluster state that allows for the
implementation of beam splitters (in form of three-mode connection gates) and
general one-mode LUBOs. In particular, we demonstrate that a linear four-mode
cluster state is a sufficient resource for an arbitrary one-mode LUBO.
Arbitrary input quantum states including non-Gaussian states could be
efficiently attached to the cluster through quantum teleportation.
