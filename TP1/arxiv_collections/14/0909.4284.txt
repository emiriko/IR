We bring out the identity between two ways of defining a single parameter to
combine positional & strength asymmetries of extended extragalactic double
radio sources associated with active galaxies. Thus, (r.s - 1)/[(1 + r).(1 +
s)], combining arm ratio r (defined to be <= 1, i.e., shorter to longer arm) &
strength ratio s (in the sense closer to farther, so that it may be <, > or =
1), is identical to -(1/2)[(1 - fr)/(1 + fr) - t], where fr is strength ratio
defined >= 1 (i.e., stronger to weaker), & t = +/- (Q - 1)/(Q + 1), +/- signs
applying respectively to doubles with closer hotspot fainter & those with
closer hotspot brighter, while Q is arm ratio defined >= 1.
