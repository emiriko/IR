A formalism for analyzing the complete set of field equations describing
Macroscopic Gravity is presented. Using this formalism, a cosmological solution
to the Macroscopic Gravity equations is determined. It is found that if a
particular segment of the connection correlation tensor is zero and if the
macroscopic geometry is described by a flat Robertson-Walker metric, then the
effective correction to the averaged Einstein Field equations of General
Relativity i.e., the backreaction, is equivalent to a positive spatial
curvature term. This investigation completes the analysis of [Phys. Rev. Lett.,
vol. 95, 151102, (2005)] and the formalism developed provides a possible basis
for future studies.
