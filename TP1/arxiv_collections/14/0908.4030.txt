We present a precision determination of the critical coupling beta_c for the
deconfinement transition in pure SU(2) gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions. This is
possible from universality, by intersecting the center vortex free energy as a
function of the lattice coupling beta with the exactly known value of the
interface free energy in the 2D Ising model at criticality. Results for
lattices with different numbers of sites N_t along the Euclidean time direction
are used to determine how beta varies with temperature for a given N_t around
the deconfinement transition.
