We consider the conditional galaxy density around each galaxy, and study its
fluctuations in the newest samples of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release
7. Over a large range of scales, both the average conditional density and its
variance show a nontrivial scaling behavior, which resembles to criticality.
The density depends, for 10 < r < 80 Mpc/h, only weakly (logarithmically) on
the system size. Correspondingly, we find that the density fluctuations follow
the Gumbel distribution of extreme value statistics. This distribution is
clearly distinguishable from a Gaussian distribution, which would arise for a
homogeneous spatial galaxy configuration. We also point out similarities
between the galaxy distribution and critical systems of statistical physics.
