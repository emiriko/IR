We propose a geometric phase gate in a decoherence-free subspace with trapped
ions. The quantum information is encoded in the Zeeman sublevels of the
ground-state and two physical qubits to make up one logical qubit with ultra
long coherence time. Single- and two-qubit operations together with the
transport and splitting of linear ion crystals allow for a robust and
decoherence-free scalable quantum processor. For the ease of the phase gate
realization we employ one Raman laser field on four ions simultaneously, i.e.
no tight focus for addressing. The decoherence-free subspace is left neither
during gate operations nor during the transport of quantum information.
