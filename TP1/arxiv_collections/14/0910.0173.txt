We continue the analysis of perturbations in vector inflation. The dominant
theme of this paper is the long wavelength limit of perturbations in small
fields inflation and the controversial issue of its linear stability. We
explain the nature of longitudinal modes, describe how they evolve, and show
that they are not as harmful as it could seem at the first glance. On the other
hand, the gravitational waves instability in large fields models is shown
explicitly. It strongly limits a potential applicability of the recently
proposed (delta N)-type approach to vector inflationary perturbations. Finally,
we expose a problem of an extra (gravitational) degree of freedom which appears
whenever the vector fields are non-minimally coupled to gravity.
