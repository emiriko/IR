In this paper we show that spinel ferrite nanocrystals (NiFe2O4, and CoFe2O4)
can be texturally embedded inside a ZnO matrix by ion implantation and
post-annealing. The two kinds of ferrites show different magnetic properties,
e.g. coercivity and magnetization. Anomalous Hall effect and positive
magnetoresistance have been observed. Our study suggests a
ferrimagnet/semiconductor hybrid system for potential applications in
magneto-electronics. This hybrid system can be tuned by selecting different
transition metal ions (from Mn to Zn) to obtain various magnetic and electronic
properties.
