The magnetic susceptibilities and specific heats of the crystalline garnet
and glass forms of Mn3Al2Si3O12 are reported. This allows a direct comparison
of the degree of magnetic frustration of the triangle-based garnet lattice and
the structurally disordered solid at the same composition for isotropic spin
5/2 Mn^2+ (3d^5). The results show that the glass phase shows more pronounced
signs of magnetic frustration than the crystalline phase. Through comparison of
the specific heats of Ca3Al2Si3O12 (grossular) and Mn3Al2Si3O12 (spessartine)
garnets, information is provided concerning the anomalous extra specific heat
in the latter material.
