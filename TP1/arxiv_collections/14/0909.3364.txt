$\kappa$-deformed commutation relation between quantum operators is
constructed via abelian twist deformation in $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime. The
commutation relation is written in terms of universal $R$-matrix satisfying
braided statistics. The equal-time commutator function turns out to vanish in
this framework.
