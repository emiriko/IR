In contrast with classical approaches, we present the project based on
considering Collective Behaviours as coherent sequences of states adopted by
different single systems consisting of the same elements interacting over time
in different ways, i.e., through sequences of variable structures or phase
transitions. This coherence is considered here as being represented by the
values taken by suitable mesoscopic variables and their properties represented
by Meta-Structures. We introduce a formal tool, i.e., the mesoscopic general
vector to represent the adoption, over time, of mesoscopic properties by
Interacting Collective elements. We explore novel conceptual aspects including
Dynamic Mesoscopic Levels of Description; necessary and sufficient
meta-structural conditions for the establishment and conservation over time of
Collective Behaviours; relationships between Meta-Structures and Boundary
Conditions to transform, even partially, the former into the latter to
prescribe and induce the emergence of Collective Behaviours as well as coherent
Multiple Systems or coherent Collective Beings. We present future lines of
research and possible applications.
