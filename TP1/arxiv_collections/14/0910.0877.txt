Population transfer between low lying Rydberg states independent of the
initial state is realized using a train of half-cycle pulses with pulse
durations much less than the classical orbit period. We demonstrate
experimentally the transfer of population from initial states around n=50 down
to n<40 as well as up to the continuum. The measured population transfer
matches well to a model of the process for 1D atoms.
