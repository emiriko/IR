We consider an Ising model where longitudinal components of every pair of
spins have antiferromagnetic interaction of the same magnitude. When subjected
to a transverse magnetic field at zero temperature, the system undergoes a
phase transition of second order to an ordered phase and if the temperature is
now increased, there is another phase transition to disordered phase. We
provide derivation of these features by perturbative treatment up to the second
order and argue that the results are non-trivial and not derivable from the
known results about related models.
