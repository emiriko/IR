The motivations for the NMSSM are reviewed, and possible unconventional
signals for Higgs and sparticle production at the LHC are discussed. In the
presence of a light pseudoscalar, the SM-like Higgs scalar can decay dominantly
into a 4-tau final state. In the fully constrained NMSSM with mSUGRA-like soft
SUSY breaking terms, the correct dark matter relic density is obtained for a
singlino-like LSP which modifies considerably all sparticle decay chains.
