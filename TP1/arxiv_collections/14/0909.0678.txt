We control the quantum mechanical motion of neutral atoms in an optical
lattice by driving microwave transitions between spin states whose trapping
potentials are spatially offset. Control of this offset with nanometer
precision allows for adjustment of the coupling strength between different
motional states, analogous to an adjustable effective Lamb-Dicke factor. This
is used both for efficient one-dimensional sideband cooling of individual atoms
to a vibrational ground state population of 97%, and to drive coherent Rabi
oscillation between arbitrary pairs of vibrational states. We further show that
microwaves can drive well resolved transitions between motional states in
maximally offset, shallow lattices, and thus in principle allow for coherent
control of long range quantum transport.
