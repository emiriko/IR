The radio emitting X-ray binary GRS 1915+105 shows a wide variety of X-ray
and radio states. We present a decade of monitoring observations, with the
RXTE-ASM and the Ryle Telescope, in conjunction with high-resolution radio
observations using MERLIN and the VLBA. Linear polarisation at 1.4 and 1.6 GHz
has been spatially resolved in the radio jets, on a scale of ~150 mas and at
flux densities of a few mJy. Depolarisation of the core occurs during radio
flaring, associated with the ejection of relativistic knots of emission. We
have identified the ejection at four epochs of X-ray flaring. Assuming no
deceleration, proper motions of 16.5 to 27 mas per day have been observed,
supporting the hypothesis of a varying angle to the line-of-sight per ejection,
perhaps in a precessing jet.
