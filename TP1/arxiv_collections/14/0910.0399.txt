Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is the supermassive black hole residing at the center
of the Milky Way. It has been the main target of an extensive multiwavelength
campaign we carried out in April 2007. Herein, we report the detection of a
bright flare from the vicinity of the horizon, observed simultaneously in
X-rays (XMM/EPIC) and near infrared (VLT/NACO) on April 4th for 1-2 h. For the
first time, such an event also benefitted from a soft gamma-rays
(INTEGRAL/ISGRI) and mid infrared (VLT/VISIR) coverage, which enabled us to
derive upper limits at both ends of the flare spectral energy distribution
(SED). We discuss the physical implications of the contemporaneous light curves
as well as the SED, in terms of synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton and
external Compton emission processes.
