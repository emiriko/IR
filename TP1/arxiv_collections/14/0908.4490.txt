We present a near-optimal quantum dynamical decoupling scheme that eliminates
general decoherence of a qubit to order n using O(n^2) pulses, an exponential
decrease in pulses over all previous decoupling methods. Numerical simulations
of a qubit coupled to a spin bath demonstrate the superior performance of the
new pulse sequences.
