It is shown that the pair plasmas with small temperature asymmetry can
support existence of localized as well as de-localized optical vortex solitons.
Coexistence of such solitons is possible due to peculiar form of saturating
nonlinearity which has a focusing-defocusing nature -- for weak amplitudes
being focusing becoming defocusing for higher amplitudes. It is shown that
delocalized vortex soliton is stable in entire region of its existence while
single- and multi-charged localized vortex solitons are unstable for low
amplitudes and become stable for relativistic amplitudes.
