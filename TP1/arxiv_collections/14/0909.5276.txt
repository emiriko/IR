I examine a mechanism by which two fast narrow jets launched by a newly
formed neutron star (NS), or a black hole (BH), at the center of a core
collapse supernovae (CCSN), form two slow massive wide (SMW) jets. Such SMW
jets are assumed as initial conditions in some numerical simulations that
demonstrate that SMW jets can expel the rest of the collapsing star. The
original fast narrow jets must deposit their energy inside the star via shock
waves, and form two hot bubbles that accelerate a much larger mass to form SMW
jets. To prevent the jets from penetrating through the still infalling gas and
escape instead of forming the hot bubbles, the jets should encounter fresh
infalling gas. This condition is met if the jets' axis changes its direction.
The exact condition is derived. In addition, to maintain a small neutrino
cooling the fast narrow jets must be shocked at a distance r>1000 km from the
core, such that most of the post-shock energy is in radiation, and temperature
is not too high. The scenario proposed here was shown to be able to suppress
star formation in newly formed galaxies, and in forming SMW jets in cooling
flow clusters of galaxies and in planetary nebulae. Namely, I suggest that NSs
(or BHs) at the center of CCSNs shut off their own growth and expel the rest of
the mass available for accretion by the same mechanism that super-massive BHs
shut off their own growth, as well as that of their host bulge, in young
galaxies.
