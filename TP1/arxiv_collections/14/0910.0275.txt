We present blue optical spectra of 92 members of h and chi Per obtained with
the WIYN telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. From these spectra,
several stellar parameters were measured for the B-type stars, including V sin
i, T_eff, log g_polar, M_star, and R_star. Stromgren photometry was used to
measure T_eff and log g_polar for the Be stars. We also analyze photometric
data of cluster members and discuss the near-to-mid IR excesses of Be stars.
