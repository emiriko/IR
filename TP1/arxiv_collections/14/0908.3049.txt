Single crystals of the spin dimer system Sr3Cr2O8 have been grown for the
first time. Magnetization, heat capacity, and magnetocaloric effect data up to
65 T reveal magnetic order between applied fields of Hc1 ~ 30.4 T and Hc2 ~ 62
T. This field-induced order persists up to ~ 8 K at H ~ 44 T, the highest
observed in any quantum magnet where Hc2 is experimentally-accessible. We fit
the temperature-field phase diagram boundary close to Hc1 using the expression
Tc = A(H-Hc1)^v. The exponent v = 0.65(2), obtained at temperatures much
smaller than 8 K, is that of the 3D Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) universality
class. This finding strongly suggests that Sr3Cr2O8 is a new realization of a
triplon BEC where the universal regimes corresponding to both Hc1 and Hc2 are
accessible at He-4 temperatures.
