We introduce sum-frequency generation (SFG) as an effective physical
two-photon detector for high power two-mode squeezed coherent states with
arbitrary frequency separation, as produced by parametric oscillators well
above the threshold. Using a formalism of "collective modes", we describe both
two-mode squeezing and degenerate squeezing on equal footing and derive simple
relations between the input degree of squeezing and the measured SFG quadrature
noise. We compare the proposed SFG detection to standard homodyne measurement,
and show advantages in robustness to detection inefficiency (loss of SFG
photons) and acceptance bandwidth.
