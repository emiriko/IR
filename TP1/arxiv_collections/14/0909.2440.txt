We present a first experiment combining high pression and coherent X-ray
diffraction. By using a dedicated diamond anvil cell, we show that the degree
of coherence of the X-ray beam is preserved when the X-ray beam passes through
the diamond cell. This observation opens the possibility of studying the
dynamics of slow fluctuations under high pressure.
