A basic constraint to be satisfied by Brans class I solution for being a
traversible wormhole is derived. It is argued that the solution could be a
wormhole analogue of the Horowitz-Ross naked black hole. It is further
demonstrated that the wormhole is traversible only "in principle", but not in
practice. Using a recently proposed measure of total gravitational energy
inside a static wormhole configuration, it is shown that the wormhole contains
repulsive gravity required for the defocussing of orbits at the throat.
