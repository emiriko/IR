claims that due to motional averaging by lattice vibrations, 18.6 keV electron
antineutrinos emitted/captured without recoil from 2-body decay in the 3H/3He
system embedded in Nb metal will be observable with natural width. In this
comment we argue that 1) stochastic relaxation processes and 2) inhomogeneities
in the metal matrices will prevent the generation of antineutrinos with natural
width in the 3H/3He system, 3) the different lattice-deformation energies of 3H
and 3He in the Nb matrix will drastically decrease the fraction of phononless
emission/detection of antineutrinos, 4) the age itself of the 3H source does
not affect the linewidth.
