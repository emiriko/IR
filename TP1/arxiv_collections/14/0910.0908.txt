The discovery of bright gamma-ray emission coincident with supernova remnant
(SNR) W51C is reported using the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope. W51C is a middle-aged remnant (~10^4 yr) with
intense radio synchrotron emission in its shell and known to be interacting
with a molecular cloud. The gamma-ray emission is spatially extended, broadly
consistent with the radio and X-ray extent of SNR W51C. The energy spectrum in
the 0.2-50 GeV band exhibits steepening toward high energies. The luminosity is
greater than 1x10^{36} erg/s given the distance constraint of D>5.5 kpc, which
makes this object one of the most luminous gamma-ray sources in our Galaxy. The
observed gamma-rays can be explained reasonably by a combination of efficient
acceleration of nuclear cosmic rays at supernova shocks and shock-cloud
interactions. The decay of neutral pi-mesons produced in hadronic collisions
provides a plausible explanation for the gamma-ray emission. The product of the
average gas density and the total energy content of the accelerated protons
amounts to 5x10^{51}(D/6kpc)^2 erg/cm^3. Electron density constraints from the
radio and X-ray bands render it difficult to explain the LAT signal as due to
inverse Compton scattering. The Fermi LAT source coincident with SNR W51C sheds
new light on the origin of Galactic cosmic rays.
