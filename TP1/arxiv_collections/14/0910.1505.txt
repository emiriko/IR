We develop a method to infer or rule out the presence of an atmosphere on a
tidally-locked hot super Earth. The question of atmosphere retention is a
fundamental one, especially for planets orbiting M stars due to the star's
long-duration active phase and corresponding potential for stellar-induced
planetary atmospheric escape and erosion. Tidally-locked planets with no
atmosphere are expected to show a Lambertian-like thermal phase curve, causing
the combined light of the planet-star system to vary with planet orbital phase.
  We report Spitzer 8 micron IRAC observations of GJ 876 taken over 32
continuous hours and reaching a relative photometric precision of 3.9e-04 per
point for 25.6 s time sampling. This translates to a 3 sigma limit of 5.13e-05
on a planet thermal phase curve amplitude. Despite the almost photon-noise
limited data, we are unable to conclusively infer the presence of an atmosphere
or rule one out on the non-transiting short-period super Earth GJ 876d. The
limiting factor in our observations was the miniscule, monotonic photometric
variation of the slightly active host M star, because the partial sine wave due
to the planet has a component in common with the stellar linear trend. The
proposed method is nevertheless very promising for transiting hot super Earths
with the James Webb Space Telescope and is critical for establishing
observational constraints for atmospheric escape.
