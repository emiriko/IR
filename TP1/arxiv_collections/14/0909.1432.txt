Covariant density functional theory based on the relativistic mean field
(RMF) Lagrangian with the parameter set NL3 has been used in the last ten years
with great success. Now we propose a modification of this parameter set, which
improves the description of the ground state properties of many nuclei and
simultaneously provides an excellent description of excited states with
collective character in spherical as well as in deformed nuclei.
