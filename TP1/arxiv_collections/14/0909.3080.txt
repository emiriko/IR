The blogosphere can be construed as a knowledge network made of bloggers who
are interacting through a social network to share, exchange or produce
information. We claim that the social and semantic dimensions are essentially
co-determined and propose to investigate the co-evolutionary dynamics of the
blogosphere by examining two intertwined issues: First, how does knowledge
distribution drive new interactions and thus influence the social network
topology? Second, which role structural network properties play in the
information circulation in the system? We adopt an empirical standpoint by
analyzing the semantic and social activity of a portion of the US political
blogosphere, monitored on a period of four months.
