We report a high-pressure single crystal study of the superconducting
ferromagnet UCoGe. Ac-susceptibility and resistivity measurements under
pressures up to 2.2 GPa show ferromagnetism is smoothly depressed and vanishes
at a critical pressure $p_c = 1.4$ GPa. Near the ferromagnetic critical point
superconductivity is enhanced. Upper-critical field measurements under pressure
show $B_{c2}(0)$ attains remarkably large values, which provides solid evidence
for spin-triplet superconductivity over the whole pressure range. The obtained
$p-T$ phase diagram reveals superconductivity is closely connected to a
ferromagnetic quantum critical point hidden under the superconducting `dome'.
