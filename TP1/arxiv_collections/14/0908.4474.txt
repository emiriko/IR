We propose a method for producing a conical beam based on the lateral
refraction of the TM01 mode from a two-mode fiber after chemical etching of the
cladding, and for controlling its radial polarization. The whole power of the
guided mode is transferred to the refracted beam with low diffraction.
Polarization control by a series of azimuthal detectors and a stress controller
affords the transmission of a stabilized radial polarization through an optical
fiber. A solid component usable for many applications has been obtained.
