This article aims at presenting our objective that is to use DfD rules
earlier during the design process. Indeed, during the conceptual design phase,
designers don't have simple qualitative tools or methods to evaluate their
products. There are guidelines that are very useful in a first approach to give
some objectives, but there is no quantitative indicators associated to these
rules to consider the disassembly aspects when the first choices are realised
for the product. So we will present that to use DfD rules during the conceptual
design phase, we first have: ?to identify which kind of rules can be applied
when designers only have a functional representation of their product. ?to
create the necessary indicators to evaluate these rules depending on designers
choices. We think that this approach is usable for many DfX rules either if we
only consider in this paper DfD rules.
