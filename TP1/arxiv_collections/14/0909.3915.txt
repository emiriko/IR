Star clusters are privileged laboratories for studying the evolution of
massive stars (OB stars). One particularly interesting question concerns the
phases, during which the classical Be stars occur, which unlike HAe/Be stars,
are not pre-main sequence objects, nor supergiants. Rather, they are extremely
rapidly rotating B-type stars with a circumstellar decretion disk formed by
episodic ejections of matter from the central star. To study the impact of
mass, metallicity, and age on the Be phase, we observed SMC open clusters with
two different techniques: 1) with the ESO-WFI in its slitless mode, which
allowed us to find the brighter Be and other emission-line stars in 84 SMC open
clusters 2) with the VLT-FLAMES multi-fiber spectrograph in order to determine
accurately the evolutionary phases of Be stars in the Be-star rich SMC open
cluster NGC 330. Based on a comparison to the Milky Way, a model of Be stellar
evolution / appearance as a function of metallicity and mass / spectral type is
developed, involving the fractional critical rotation rate as a key parameter.
