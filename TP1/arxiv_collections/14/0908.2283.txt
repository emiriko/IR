We propose a linear model for the dynamics of amplitudes associated with
formation of phase slip centers in a one-dimensional superconductor. The model
is derived taking into account the fact that, during the formation of phase
slip centers the wave number of the superconducting phase remains practically
constant. The model captures various forms of amplitude modulations associated
with PSCs in closed analytic forms.
