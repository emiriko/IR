The corrections of two-photon exchange on deuteron electromagnetic form
factors are estimated based on an effective Lagrangian approach. Numerical
results for the form factors $G_{C,M,Q}$ of the deuteron with the corrections
are compared to its empirical ones. Moreover, the two new form factors, due to
the two-photon exchange, are analyzed. Possible way to test the two-photon
exchange corrections to the deuteron form factors is discussed.
