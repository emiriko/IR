[arXiv:0809.1324 [hep-ph]], we constructed a holographic description of walking
technicolour theories using both a hard- and a soft-wall model. Here, we show
that the dilaton field becomes phenomenologically irrelevant for the spectrum
of spin-one resonances once a term is included in the Lagrangian that mixes the
Goldstone bosons and the longitudinal components of the axial vector mesons. We
show how this mixing affects our previous results and we make predictions about
how this description of technicolour can be tested.
