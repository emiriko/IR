We investigate a mechanism that generates the exact solutions of scalar field
cosmologies in a unified way. The procedure investigated here permits to
recover allmost all known solutions, and allows one to derive new solutions as
well. In particular, we derive and discuss one novel solution defined in terms
of the Lambert function. The solutions are organized in a classification which
depends on the choice of a generating function which we have denoted by
$x(\phi)$ that reflects the underlying thermodynamics of the model. We also
analyse and discuss the existence of form invariances and dualities between
solutions. A general way of defining the latter in an appropriate fashion for
scalar fields is put forward.
