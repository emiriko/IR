Conventional vector-based simulators for quantum computers are quite limited
in the size of the quantum circuits they can handle, due to the worst-case
exponential growth of even sparse representations of the full quantum state
vector as a function of the number of quantum operations applied. However, this
exponential-space requirement can be avoided by using general space-time
tradeoffs long known to complexity theorists, which can be appropriately
optimized for this particular problem in a way that also illustrates some
interesting reformulations of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we describe the
design and empirical space-time complexity measurements of a working software
prototype of a quantum computer simulator that avoids excessive space
requirements. Due to its space-efficiency, this design is well-suited to
embedding in single-chip environments, permitting especially fast execution
that avoids access latencies to main memory. We plan to prototype our design on
a standard FPGA development board.
