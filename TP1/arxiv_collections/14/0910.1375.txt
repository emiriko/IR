Recently we examined a large number of points in a 19-dimensional parameter
subspace of the CP-conserving MSSM with Minimal Flavor Violation. We determined
whether each of these points satisfied existing theoretical, experimental, and
observational constraints. Here we discuss the properties of the parameter
space points allowed by existing data that are relevant for dark matter
searches.
