We describe the steps involved in performing searches for sources of
transient radio emission such as Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs), and present
10 new transient radio sources discovered in a re-analysis of the Parkes
Multi-beam Pulsar Survey. Followup observations of each new source as well as
one previously known source are also presented. The new sources suggest that
the population of transient radio-emitting neutron stars, and hence the neutron
star population in general, may be even larger than initially predicted. We
highlight the importance of radio frequency interference excision for
single-pulse searches. Also, we discuss some interesting properties of
individual sources and consider the difficulties involved in precisely defining
a RRAT and determining where they fit in with the other known classes of
neutron stars.
