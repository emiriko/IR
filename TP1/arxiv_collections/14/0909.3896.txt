Isolated nuclear spins offer a promising building block for quantum
information processing systems, but their weak interactions often impede
preparation, control, and detection. Hyperfine coupling to a proximal
electronic spin can enhance each of these processes. Using the electronic spin
of the nitrogen-vacancy center as an intermediary, we demonstrate robust
initialization, single-qubit manipulation, and direct optical readout of 13C,
15N, and 14N nuclear spins in diamond. These results pave the way for nitrogen
nuclear spin based quantum information architectures in diamond.
