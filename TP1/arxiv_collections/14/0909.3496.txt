Several observations reveal that dwarf galaxy Segue 1 has a dark matter (DM)
halo at least ~ 200 times more massive than its visible baryon mass of only ~
103 solar masses. The baryon mass is dominated by stars with perhaps an
interstellar gas mass of < 13 solar masses. Regarding Segue 1 as a dwarf disc
galaxy by its morphological appearance of long stretch, we invoke the dynamic
model of Xiang-Gruess, Lou & Duschl (XLD) to estimate its physical parameters
for possible equilibria with and without an isopedically magnetized gas disc.
We estimate the range of DM mass and compare it with available observational
inferences. Due to the relatively high stellar velocity dispersion compared to
the stellar surface mass density, we find that a massive DM halo would be
necessary to sustain disc equilibria. The required DM halo mass agrees grossly
with observational inferences so far. For an isopedic magnetic field in a gas
disc, the ratio f between the DM and baryon potentials depends strongly on the
magnetic field strength. Therefore, a massive DM halo is needed to counteract
either the strong stellar velocity dispersion and rotation of the stellar disc
or the magnetic Lorentz force in the gas disc. By the radial force balances,
the DM halo mass increases for faster disc rotation.
