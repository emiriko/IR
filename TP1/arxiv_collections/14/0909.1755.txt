Using imaging that shows four magnitudes of main sequence stars, we have
discovered that the Galactic globular cluster NGC 1851 is surrounded by a halo
that is visible from the tidal radius of 700 arcsec (41 pc) to more than 4500
arcsec (>250 pc). This halo is symmetric and falls in density as a power law of
$r^{-1.24}$. It contains approximately 0.1% of the dynamical mass of NGC 1851.
There is no evidence for tidal tails. Current models of globular cluster
evolution do not explain this feature, although simulations of tidal influences
on dwarf spheroidal galaxies qualitatively mimic these results. Given the state
of published models it is not possible to decide between creation of this halo
from isolated cluster evaporation, or from tidal or disk shocking, or from
destruction of a dwarf galaxy in which this object may have once been embedded.
