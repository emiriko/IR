To improve the agility, dynamics, composability, reusability, and development
efficiency restricted by monolithic Federation Object Model (FOM), a modular
FOM was proposed by High Level Architecture (HLA) Evolved product development
group. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of HLA Evolved modular FOM. In
particular, related concepts, the overall impact on HLA standards, extension
principles, and merging processes are discussed. Also permitted and restricted
combinations, and merging rules are provided, and the influence on HLA
interface specification is given. The comparison between modular FOM and Base
Object Model (BOM) is performed to illustrate the importance of their
combination. The applications of modular FOM are summarized. Finally, the
significance to facilitate composable simulation both in academia and practice
is presented and future directions are pointed out.
