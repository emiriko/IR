A solid theoretical understanding of how inflowing, accreting plasma around
black holes and other compact objects gives rise to outflowing winds and jets
is still lacking, despite decades of observations. The fact that similar
processes and morphologies are observed in both X-ray binaries as well as
active galactic nuclei has led to suggestions that the underlying physics could
scale with black hole mass, which could provide a new handle on the problem. In
the last decade, simultaneous broadband campaigns of the fast-varying X-ray
binaries particularly in their microquasar state have driven the development
of, and in some cases altered, our ideas about the inflow/outflow connection in
accreting black holes. Specifically the discovery of correlations between the
radio, infrared and X-ray bands has revealed a remarkable connectivity between
the various emission regions, and argued for a more holistic approach to
tackling questions about accretion. This article reviews the recent major
observational and theoretical advances that focus specifically on the relation
between the two "sides" of the accretion process in black holes, with an
emphasis on how new tools can be derived for comparisons across the mass scale.
