We have investigated spin-related effects on the electronic transport in a
single antidot system in the vicinity of the $\nu = 2$ quantum Hall state where
two edge states with different spins of the lowest Landau level are formed
around the antidot. The conductance exhibits the paired $h/2e$ Aharonov-Bohm
(AB) oscillations. Using a tilted magnetic field technique, we have observed
the evolution of the oscillations with the total magnetic field and a
concomitant change in the source-drain bias dependence of the differential
conductance. From the observation, we extract the effect of the Zeeman energy
on the AB oscillations.
