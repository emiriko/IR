For the stationary one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (or
Gross-Pitaevskii equation) nonlinear resonant transmission through a finite
number of equidistant identical barriers is studied using a (semi-) analytical
approach. In addition to the occurrence of bistable transmission peaks known
from nonlinear resonant transmission through a single quantum well
(respectively a double barrier) complicated (looped) structures are observed in
the transmission coefficient which can be identified as the result of symmetry
breaking similar to the emergence of self-trapping states in double well
potentials. Furthermore it is shown that these results are well reproduced by a
nonlinear oscillator model based on a small number of resonance eigenfunctions
of the corresponding linear system.
