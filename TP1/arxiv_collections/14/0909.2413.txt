The magnetic dipole moments of the light tensor mesons $f_2$, $a_2$ and
strange $K_2^{\ast 0} (1430)$ tensor meson are calculated in the framework of
the light cone QCD sum rules. It is observed that the values of the magnetic
dipole moment for the charged tensor particles are considerably different from
zero. These values are very close to zero for the light neutral $f_2$ and $a_2$
tensor mesons, while it has a small nonzero value for the neutral strange
$K_2^{\ast 0} (1430)$ tensor meson.
