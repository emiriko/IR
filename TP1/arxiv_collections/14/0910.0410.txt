The results of several papers concerning the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture are
deduced as consequences of a simple idea that I call the averaging trick. This
idea is implicitly used in the literature, but no attempt was made to formalize
the proof scheme axiomatically. Instead, authors axiomatized classes of
automata to which it applies.
