The limacon-shaped semiconductor microcavity is a ray-chaotic cavity
sustaining low-loss modes with mostly unidirectional emission patterns.
Investigating these modes systematically, we show that the modes correspond to
ray description collectively, rather than individually. In addition, we present
experimental data on multimode lasing emission patterns that show high
unidirectionality and closely agree with the ray description. The origin of
this agreement is well explained by the collective correspondence mechanism.
