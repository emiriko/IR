Given the tendency of planets to form in multiples, and the observational
evidence in support of the existence of potential planet-hosting stars in
binaries or clusters, it is expected that extrasolar terrestrial planes are
more likely to be found in multiple body systems. This paper discusses the
prospects of the detection of terrestrial/habitable planets in multibody
systems by presenting the results of a study of the long-term stability of
these objects in systems with multiple giant planets (particularly those in
eccentric and/or in mean-motion resonant orbits), systems with close-in
Jupiter-like bodies, and systems of binary stars. The results of simulations
show that while short-period terrestrial-class objects that are captured in
near mean-motion resonances with migrating giant planets are potentially
detectable via transit photometry or the measurement of the variations of the
transit-timing due to their close-in Jovian-mass planetary companions, the
prospect of the detection of habitable planets with radial velocity technique
is higher in systems with multiple giant planets outside the habitable zone and
binary systems with moderately separated stellar companions.
