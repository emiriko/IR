An integrated approach has been developed to study radio signals induced by
cosmic rays entering the Earth's atmosphere. An engineering array will be
co-located with the infill array of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Our R&D
effort includes the physics processes leading to the development of radio
signals, end-to-end simulations of realistic hardware configurations, and tests
of various systems on site, where coincidences with the other detector systems
of the Observatory are used to benchmark the systems under development.
