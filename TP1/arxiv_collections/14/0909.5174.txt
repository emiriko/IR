One of the most popular scenarios for the superconductivity in Fe-based
superconductors (FeBSC) posits that the bosons responsible for electronic
pairing are spin-fluctuations with a wave vector spanning the hole Fermi
surfaces (FSs) near $\Gamma$ and the electron FSs near M points. So far all
FeBSC for which neutron data are available do demonstrate such excitations, and
the band structure calculations so far were finding quasi-nested FSs in all
FeBSC, providing for a peak in the spin susceptibility at the desired wave
vectors. However, the newest addition to the family, Sr$_{2}$VO$_{3}$FeAs, has
been calculated to have a very complex FS with no visible quasi-nesting
features. It was argued therefore that this material does not fall under the
existing paradigm and calls for revisiting our current ideas about what is the
likely cause of superconductivity in FeBSC. In this paper, I show that the
visible complexity of the FS is entirely due to the V-derived electronic
states. Assuming that superconductivity in Sr$_{2}$VO$_{3}$FeAs, as in the
other FeBSC, originates in the FeAs layers, and the superconducting electrons
are sensitive to the susceptibility of the FeAs electronic subsystem, I
recalculate the bare susceptibility, weighting the electronic states with their
Fe character, and obtain a susceptibility that fully supports the existing
quasi-nesting model.
