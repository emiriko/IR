We zoom in on the internal structure of the low-frequency quasi-periodic
oscillation (LF QPO) often observed in black hole binary systems to investigate
the physical nature of the lack of coherence in this feature. We show the
limitations of standard Fourier power spectral analysis for following the
evolution of the QPO with time and instead use wavelet analysis and a new
time-frequency technique -Matching Pursuit algorithm- to maximise the
resolution with which we can follow the QPO behaviour. We use the LF QPO seen
in a very high state of XTE J1550-564 to illustrate these techniques and show
that the best description of the QPO is that it is composed of multiple
independent oscillations with a distribution of lifetimes but with constant
frequency over this duration. This rules out models where there is continual
frequency modulation, such as multiple blobs spiralling inwards. Instead it
favours models where the QPO is excited by random turbulence in the flow.
