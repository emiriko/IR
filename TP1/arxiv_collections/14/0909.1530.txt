With the increasing development of laser accelerators, the electron energy is
already beyond GeV and even higher in near future. Conventional beam dump based
on ionization or radiation loss mechanism is cumbersome and costly, also has
radiological hazards. We revisit the stopping power of high-energy charged
particles in matter and discuss the associated problem of beam dump from the
point of view of collective deceleration. The collective stopping length in an
ionized gas can be several orders of magnitude shorter than the Bethe-Bloch and
multiple electromagnetic cascades' stopping length in solid. At the mean time,
the tenuous density of the gas makes the radioactivation negligible. Such a
compact and non-radioactivating beam dump works well for short and dense
bunches, which is typically generated from laser wakefield accelerator.
