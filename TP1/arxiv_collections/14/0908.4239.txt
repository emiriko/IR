A new interpretation is introduced for MOND based on the Sciama's
interpretation of Mach principle and an Unruh like effect, in the context of a
generalized equivalence principle. It is argued that in a locally accelerated
frame with acceleration $a$ the appearance of a Rindler horizon may give rise
to a constant acceleration $a_0$ as the local properties of cosmological
horizon or Hubble length. The total gravitational acceleration inside this
frame becomes the combination of $a$ with $a_0$. For $a\gg a_0$, the
conventional gravitational mass $m_g$ interacts with the dominant acceleration
as $m_g a$ and application of Sciama's interpretation leads to the standard
Newtonian dynamics. For $a\ll a_0$, however, a reduced gravitational mass
$\bar{m}_g$ interacts with the dominant acceleration as $\bar{m}_g a_0$ and the
application of Sciama's interpretation on this reduced gravitational mass leads
to MOND. This introduces a third proposal for MOND: {\it The modification of
gravitational mass}.
