The quantum smoothing theory [Tsang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 250403 (2009);
Phys. Rev. A, in press (e-print arXiv:0906.4133)] is extended to account for
discrete jumps in the classical random process to be estimated, discrete
variables in the quantum system, such as spin, angular momentum, and photon
number, and Poissonian measurements, such as photon counting. The extended
theory is used to model atomic magnetometers and study Hardy's paradox in phase
space. In the phase-space picture of Hardy's proposed experiment, the
negativity of the predictive Wigner distribution is identified as the culprit
of the disagreement between classical reasoning and quantum mechanics.
