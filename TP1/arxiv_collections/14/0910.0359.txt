We argue that a restriction determined by a drawn card or quantum random
numbers, on the running of LHC (Large Hadron Collider), which was proposed in
earlier articles by us, can only result in an, at first, apparent success
whatever the outcome. This previous work was concerned with looking for
backward causation and/or influence from the future, which, in our previous
model, was assumed to have the effect of arranging bad luck for large Higgs
producing machines, such as LHC and the never finished SSC (Superconducting
Super Collider) stopped by Congress because of such bad luck, so as not to
allow them to work.
