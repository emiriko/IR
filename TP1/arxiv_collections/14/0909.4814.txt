We present a direct measurement of the width of the W boson using the shape
of the transverse mass distribution of W->enu candidates selected in 1 fb-1 of
data collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider in ppbar
collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV. We use the same methods and data sample that
were used for our recently published W boson mass measurement, except for the
modeling of the recoil, which is done with a new method based on a recoil
library. Our result, 2.028 +- 0.072 GeV, is in agreement with the predictions
of the standard model.
