The recent liberalization of the electricity and gas markets has resulted in
the growth of energy exchanges and modelling problems. In this paper, we
modelize jointly gas and electricity spot prices using a mean-reverting model
which fits the correlations structures for the two commodities. The dynamics
are based on Ornstein processes with parameterized diffusion coefficients.
Moreover, using the empirical distributions of the spot prices, we derive a
class of such parameterized diffusions which captures the most salient
statistical properties: stationarity, spikes and heavy-tailed distributions.
The associated calibration procedure is based on standard and efficient
statistical tools. We calibrate the model on French market for electricity and
on UK market for gas, and then simulate some trajectories which reproduce well
the observed prices behavior. Finally, we illustrate the importance of the
correlation structure and of the presence of spikes by measuring the risk on a
power plant portfolio.
