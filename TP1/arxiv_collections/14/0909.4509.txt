Lecture 1 discusses non-Archimedean analogs of classical complex function
theory based on the Schnirelman integral. Lecture 2 discusses valuation
(Newton) polygons and their consequences and presents a non-Archimedean analog
of the Poisson-Jensen formula. Lecture 3 introduces non-Archimedean value
distribution theory. Lecture 4 presents an introduction to Benedetto's
non-Archimedean analogs of the Ahlfors Island theorems.
