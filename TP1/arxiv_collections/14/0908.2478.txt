We numerically study the ground state phase diagram of the two-dimensional
hard-core Bose-Hubbard model with nearest ($V_1$) and next nearest neighbor
($V_2$) repulsions. In particular, we focus on the quarter-filled phases where
one supersolid and two solid phases are observed. Using both canonical and
grand canonical quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods and a mean field calculation,
we confirm the existence of a \textit{commensurate} supersolid at quarter boson
filling. The nature of the commensurate supersolid will be discussed. Only one
kind of the supersolid phase is found energetically stable despite of the two
possible diagonal long range orderings for the solid phase. The competition
between the two solid phases manifests as a first order phase transition around
$2 V_2\sim V_1$. The change of order parameters as functions of the chemical
function is also presented.
