Kinematical studies of low and high redshift galaxies enables to probe galaxy
formation and evolution scenarios. Integral field spectroscopy is a powerful
tool to study with accuracy nearby galaxies kinematics. Recent observations
also gives a new 2D vision of high redshift galaxies kinematics. This work
mostly relies on the kinematical sample of galaxies GHASP. This control sample,
composed of 203 local spiral and irregular galaxies in low density environments
observed with Fabry-Perot techniques in the Ha line (6563 A), is by now the
largest sample of Fabry-Perot data. After a revue on Fabry-Perot interferometry
and a presentation of new data reduction procedures, my implications on both
3D-NTT Fabry-Perot instrument and the wide field spectrograph project (WFSpec)
for galaxy evolution study with the european ELT are developed. The second
section is dedicated to GHASP data. This sample have been fully reduced and
analysed using new methods. The kinematical analysis of 2D kinematical maps has
been undertaken with the study of the dark matter distribution, the rotation
curves shape, bar signatures and the ionized gas velocity dispersion. In a
third section, this local reference sample is used as a zero point for high
redshift galaxies kinematical studies. The GHASP sample is projected at high
redshift (z=1.7) in order to disentangle evolution effects from distance biases
in high redshift galaxies kinematical data observed with SINFONI, OSIRIS and
GIRAFFE. The kinematical analysis of new SINFONI high redshift observations is
also presented and high redshift data found in the literature are compared with
GHASP projected sample, suggesting some evolution of the galaxy dynamical
support within the ages.
