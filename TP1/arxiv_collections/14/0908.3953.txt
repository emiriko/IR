Debris disks are evidence that stars harbor reservoirs of dust-producing
plantesimals on spatial scales similar the solar system. Debris disks present a
wide range of sizes and structural features and there is growing evidence that,
in some cases, they might be the result of the dynamical perturbations of a
massive planet. Our solar system also harbors a debris disk and some of its
properties resemble those of extra-solar debris disks. This contribution
discusses how the study of debris disks with SPICA can shed light on the
diversity of planetary systems, the link between debris disks and planets and
the link between extra-solar planetary systems and our own.
