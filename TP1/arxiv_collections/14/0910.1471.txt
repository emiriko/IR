Streaming high quality videos consumes significantly large amount of network
resources. In this context request to service delay, network traffic,
congestion and server overloading are the main parameters to be considered in
video streaming over the internet that effect the quality of service (QoS). In
this paper, we propose an efficient architecture as a cluster of proxy servers
and clients that uses a peer to peer (P2P) approach to cooperatively stream the
video using chaining technique. We consider the following two key issues in the
proposed architecture (1) Prefix caching technique to accommodate more number
of videos close to client (2) Cooperative client and proxy chaining to achieve
the network efficiency. Our simulation results shows that the proposed approach
yields a prefix caching close to the optimal solution minimizing WAN bandwidth
usage on server-proxy path by utilizing the proxy-client and client-client path
bandwidth, which is much cheaper than the expensive server proxy path
bandwidth, server load, and client rejection ratio significantly using
chaining.
