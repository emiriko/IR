The penetration depth is calculated over the entire doping range of the
cuprate phase diagram with emphasis on the underdoped regime. Pseudogap
formation on approaching the Mott transition, for doping below a quantum
critical point, is described within a model based on the resonating valence
bond spin liquid which provides an ansatz for the coherent piece of the Green's
function. Fermi surface reconstruction, which is an essential element of the
model, has a strong effect on the superfluid density at T=0 producing a sharp
drop in magnitude, but does not change the slope of the linear low temperature
variation. Comparison with recent data on Bi-based cuprates provides validation
of the theory and shows that the effects of correlations, captured by
Gutzwiller factors, are essential for a qualitative understanding of the data.
We find that the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule still holds and we compare our
results with those for the Fermi arc and the nodal liquid models.
