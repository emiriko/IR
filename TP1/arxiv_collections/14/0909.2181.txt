In this study we address the question under which conditions a saturated
velocity field stemming from geodynamo simulations leads to an exponential
growth of the magnetic field in a corresponding kinematic calculation. We
perform global self-consistent geodynamo simulations and calculate the
evolution of a kinematically advanced tracer field. The self-consistent
velocity field enters the induction equation in each time step, but the tracer
field does not contribute to the Lorentz force. This experiment has been
performed by Cattaneo & Tobias (2009) and is closely related to the test field
method by Schrinner et al. (2005, 2007). We find two dynamo regimes in which
the tracer field either grows exponentially or approaches a state aligned with
the actual self-consistent magnetic field after an initial transition period.
Both regimes can be distinguished by the Rossby number and coincide with the
dipolar and multipolar dynamo regimes identified by Christensen & Aubert
(2006). Dipolar dynamos with low Rossby number are kinematically stable whereas
the tracer field grows exponentially in the multipolar dynamo regime. This
difference in the saturation process for dynamos in both regimes comes along
with differences in their time variability. Within our sample of 20 models,
solely kinematically unstable dynamos show dipole reversals and large
excursions. The complicated time behaviour of these dynamos presumably relates
to the alternating growth of several competing dynamo modes. On the other hand,
dynamos in the low Rossby number regime exhibit a rather simple time dependence
and their saturation merely results in a fluctuation of the fundamental dynamo
mode about its critical state.
