The paper presents a new stiffness modelling method for multi-chain parallel
robotic manipulators with flexible links and compliant actuating joints. In
contrast to other works, the method involves a FEA-based link stiffness
evaluation and employs a new solution strategy of the kinetostatic equations,
which allows computing the stiffness matrix for singular postures and to take
into account influence of the external forces. The advantages of the developed
technique are confirmed by application examples, which deal with stiffness
analysis of a parallel manipulator of the Orthoglide family
