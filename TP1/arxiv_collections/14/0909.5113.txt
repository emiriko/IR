The role of dynamical cosmological Casimir effect to phantom (constant $w$)
and oscillating Universe is discussed. It is shown explicitly that its role is
not essential near to Big Rip singularity. However, the account of Casimir
fluid makes the scale factor approach to Rip time to be faster. Rip time itself
maybe changed too.
