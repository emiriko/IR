I present recent results related to the measurement of the top quark mass,
using $p\bar{p}$ collisions recorded with the D{\O}Detector at the Tevatron.
The results are: A direct measurement of the mass difference between top and
anti-top quarks, Measurement of the top quark mass in the lepton+jets channel
and in the dilepton channel.
