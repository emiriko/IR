If all stars form in clusters and both the stars and the clusters follow a
power law distribution which favours the creation of low mass objects, then the
numerous low mass clusters will be deficient in high mass stars. Therefore, the
mass function of stars, integrated over the whole galaxy (the Integrated
Galactic Initial Mass Function, IGIMF) will be steeper at the high mass end
than the underlying IMF of the stars. We show how the steepness of the IGIMF
depends on the sampling method and on the assumptions made for the star cluster
mass function. We also investigate the O-star content, integrated photometry
and chemical enrichment of galaxies that result from several IGIMFs, as
compared to more standard IMFs.
