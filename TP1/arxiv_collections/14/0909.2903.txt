The quantum Hall effect, with a Berry's phase of $\pi$ is demonstrated here
on a single graphene layer grown on the C-face of 4H silicon carbide. The
mobility is $\sim$ 20,000 cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s at 4 K and ~15,000 cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s
at 300 K despite contamination and substrate steps. This is comparable to the
best exfoliated graphene flakes on SiO$_2$ and an order of magnitude larger
than Si-face epitaxial graphene monolayers. These and other properties indicate
that C-face epitaxial graphene is a viable platform for graphene-based
electronics.
