In star formation, magnetic fields act as a cosmic angular momentum extractor
that increases mass accretion rates onto protostars and in the process, creates
spectacular outflows. However, recently it has been argued that this magnetic
brake is so strong that early protostellar disks -- the cradles of planet
formation -- cannot form. Our three-dimensional numerical simulations of the
early stages of collapse (\lesssim 10^5 yr) of overdense star--forming clouds
form early outflows and have magnetically regulated and rotationally dominated
disks (inside 10 AU) with high accretion rates, despite the slip of the field
through the mostly neutral gas. We find that in three dimensions, magnetic
fields suppress gravitationally driven instabilities which would otherwise
prevent young, well ordered disks from forming. Our simulations have surprising
consequences for the early formation of disks, their density and temperature
structure, the mechanism and structure of early outflows, the flash heating of
dust grains through ambipolar diffusion, and the origin of planets and binary
stars.
