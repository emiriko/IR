We study a one-dimensional particles system, in the overdamped limit, where
nearest particles attract with a force inversely proportional to a power of
their distance and coalesce upon encounter. The detailed shape of the
distribution function for the gap between neighbouring particles serves to
discriminate between different laws of attraction. We develop an exact
Fokker-Planck approach for the infinite hierarchy of distribution functions for
multiple adjacent gaps and solve it exactly, at the mean-field level, where
correlations are ignored. The crucial role of correlations and their effect on
the gap distribution function is explored both numerically and analytically.
Finally, we analyse a random input of particles, which results in a stationary
state where the effect of correlations is largely diminished.
