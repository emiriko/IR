A Bose-Einstein condensate confined in an optical dipole trap is used to
generate long-term coherent memory for light, and storage times of more than
one second are observed. Phase coherence of the condensate as well as
controlled manipulations of elastic and inelastic atomic scattering processes
are utilized to increase the storage fidelity by several orders of magnitude
over previous schemes. The results have important applications for creation of
long-distance quantum networks and for generation of entangled states of light
and matter.
