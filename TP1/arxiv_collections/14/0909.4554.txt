We discuss the possibility to use a high energy neutrino beam from a muon
storage ring to provide one way communication with a submerged submarine.
Neutrino interactions produce muons which can be detected either, directly when
they pass through the submarine or by their emission of Cerenkov light in sea
water, which, in turn, can be exploited with sensitive photo detectors. Due to
the very high neutrino flux from a muon storage ring, it is sufficient to mount
either detection system directly onto the hull of the submersible. The
achievable data transfer rates compare favorable with existing technologies and
do allow for a communication at the usual speed and depth of submarines.
