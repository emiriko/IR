By tailoring the wavefront of the laser pulse used in a laser-wakefield
accelerator, we show that the properties of the x-rays produced due to the
electron beam's betatron oscillations in the plasma can be controlled. By
creating a wavefront with coma, we find that the critical energy of the
synchrotron-like x-ray spectrum can be significantly increased. The coma does
not substantially change the energy of the electron beam, but does increase its
divergence and produces an energy-dependent exit angle, indicating that changes
in the x-ray spectrum are due to an increase in the electron beam's oscillation
amplitude within the wakefield.
