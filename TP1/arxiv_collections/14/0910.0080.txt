We perform nonequilibrium simulations of heat conduction in a three
dimensional anharmonic lattice. By studying slabs of length N and width W, we
examine the cross-over from one-dimensional to three dimensional behavior of
the thermal conductivity. We find that for large N, the cross-over takes place
at a small value of the aspect ratio W/N. From our numerical data we conclude
that the three dimensional system has a finite non-diverging thermal
conductivity and thus provide the first verification of Fourier's law in a
system without pinning.
