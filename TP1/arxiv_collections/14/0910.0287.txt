The aim of this work is to show a brand-new way of making deterministic
Quantum Computing (short QC), in the sense of Theory of Calculability, by
meaning of unitary evolution. We start from the original Shor's Algorithm to
explain how the newest one works, at least compared to theory. We will give a
new conceptual foundation of QC, resulting from a set of conventional and well
known results of Calculability and Quantum Mechanics. In the practice, if that
can be used in its general sense, we will show an inaccessible relativized
process which let us able to obtain same results with the same outlay in the
time resource as the Shor's one for factorizing a given number n. Then the
QO-system will be a prototype way giving to the relativized calculus the
possibility to put in to practice an oracle, kind of object having till now
abstract nature. The basic physical tool of our theorization, we call Quantum
State Selection, consists in the twin-combined measurement process through
positive valued measure operator (POVM), needed to provide the quantum oracle's
answer.
