We study the large-x behaviour of the physical evolution kernels for flavour
non-singlet observables in deep-inelastic scattering, where x is the Bjorken
variable, semi-inclusive e^+ e^- annihilation and Drell-Yan lepton-pair
production. Unlike the corresponding MSbar-scheme coefficient functions, all
these kernels show a single-logarithmic large-x enhancement at all orders in
1-x. We conjecture that this universal behaviour, established by
Feynman-diagram calculations up to the fourth order, holds at all orders in the
strong coupling constant alpha_s. The resulting predictions are presented for
the highest ln^n(1-x) contributions to the higher-order coefficient functions.
In Mellin-N space these predictions take the form of an exponentiation which,
however, appears to be less powerful than the well-known soft-gluon
exponentiation of the leading (1-x)^(-1) ln^n(1-x) terms. In particular in
deep-inelastic scattering the 1/N corrections are non-negligible for all
practically relevant N.
