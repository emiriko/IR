Prompt gamma-ray burst spectra evolve on short time scales, suggesting that
time-resolved spectral fits may help diagnose the still unknown prompt emission
mechanism. We use broad-band gamma-ray data from the RHESSI spacecraft to test
quasi-thermal models with high signal-to-noise time-resolved spectra of nine
bright gamma-ray bursts. In contrast to results reported in more narrow energy
bands, the quality of the fits of quasi-thermal models is poor in relation to
fits of the phenomenological Band function. Moreover, the best-fit parameters
for the simplest quasi-thermal model, a black body plus a nonthermal power law,
show significant dependence on the fit band. Models that replace the power law
with more complicated nonthermal functions are not robust for the data
considered here and decrease the physical relevance of the fit black body.
