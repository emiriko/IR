Cold Rydberg atoms exposed to strong magnetic fields possess unique
properties which open the pathway for an intriguing many-body dynamics taking
place in Rydberg gases consisting of either matter or anti-matter systems. We
review both the foundations and recent developments of the field in the cold
and ultracold regime where trapping and cooling of Rydberg atoms have become
possible. Exotic states of moving Rydberg atoms such as giant dipole states are
discussed in detail, including their formation mechanisms in a strongly
magnetized cold plasma. Inhomogeneous field configurations influence the
electronic structure of Rydberg atoms, and we describe the utility of
corresponding effects for achieving tightly trapped ultracold Rydberg atoms. We
review recent work on large, extended cold Rydberg gases in magnetic fields and
their formation in strongly magnetized ultracold plasmas through collisional
recombination. Implications of these results for current antihydrogen
production experiments are pointed out, and techniques for trapping and cooling
of such atoms are investigated.
