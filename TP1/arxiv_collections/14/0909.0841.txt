We derive schemes to measure the so-called weak values of quantum system
observables by coupling of the system to a qubit meter system. We highlight, in
particular, the meaning of the imaginary part of the weak values, and show how
it can be measured directly on equal footing with the real part of the weak
value. We present compact expressions for the weak value of single qubit
observables and of product observables on qubit pairs. Experimental studies of
the results are suggested with cold trapped ions.
