The description is given for the speckle interferometer of the BTA 6-m
telescope of the SAO RAS based on a new detector with an electron
multiplication CCD. The main components of the instrument are microscope
objectives, interference filters and atmospheric dispersion correction prisms.
The PhotonMAX-512B CCD camera using a back-illuminated CCD97 allows up to 20
speckle images (with 512$\times$512 pix resolution) per second storage on the
hard drive. Due to high quantum efficiency (93% in the maximum at 550 nm), and
high transmission of its optical elements, the new camera can be used for
diffraction-limited (0.02$''$) image reconstruction of $15^{m}$ stars under
good seeing conditions. The main advantages of the new system over the previous
generation BTA speckle interferometer are examined.
