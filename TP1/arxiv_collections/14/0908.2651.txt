Higher-dimensional black holes have long been considered within the context
of brane worlds. Recently, it was shown that the brane-world ethos also permits
the consideration of higher-dimensional wormholes. When such a wormhole,
preexisting in the bulk, impinges upon our universe, taken to be a
positive-tension 3-brane, it can induce the creation in our universe of a
wormhole of ordinary dimensionality. The throat of this wormhole might fully
constrict, pinch off, and thus birth a baby universe. Alternatively, the
induced wormhole might persist. I show that persistence is more likely and note
that the persistent wormhole manifests as a particle-like object whose
interaction with cosmic matter is purely gravitational. I consider briefly the
viability of this object as a dark matter candidate.
