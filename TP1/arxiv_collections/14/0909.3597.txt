We provide two kinds of representations for the Taylor coefficients of the
Weierstrass $\sigma$-function $\sigma(\cdot;\Gamma)$ associated to an arbitrary
lattice $\Gamma$ in the complex plane $\mathbb{C}=\mathbb{R}^2$ - the first one
in terms of the so-called Hermite-Gauss series over $\Gamma$ and the second one
in terms of Hermite-Gauss integrals over $\mathbb{C}$.
