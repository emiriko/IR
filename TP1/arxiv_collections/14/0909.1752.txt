Main-sequence stars earlier than spectral type ~F6 or so are expected to
rotate rapidly due to their radiative exteriors. This rapid rotation leads to
an oblate stellar figure. It also induces the photosphere to be hotter (by up
to several thousand Kelvin) at the pole than at the equator as a result of a
process called gravity darkening that was first predicted by von Zeipel (1924).
Transits of extrasolar planets across such a non-uniform, oblate disk yield
unusual and distinctive lightcurves that can be used to determine the relative
alignment of the stellar rotation pole and the planet orbit normal. This
spin-orbit alignment can be used to constrain models of planet formation and
evolution. Orderly planet formation and migration within a disk that is
coplanar with the stellar equator will result in spin-orbit alignment. More
violent planet-planet scattering events should yield spin-orbit misaligned
planets. Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements of transits of lower-mass stars show
that some planets are spin-orbit aligned, and some are not. Since
Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements are difficult around rapid rotators,
lightcurve photometry may be the best way to determine the spin-orbit alignment
of planets around massive stars. The Kepler mission will monitor ~10^4 of these
stars within its sample. The lightcurves of any detected planets will allow us
to probe the planet formation process around high-mass stars for the first
time.
