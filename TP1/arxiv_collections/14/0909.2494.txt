In a flat universe dominated by dark energy, the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)
effect can be detected as a large-angle cross-correlation between the CMB and a
tracer of large scale structure. We investigate whether the inconclusive ISW
signal derived from 2MASS galaxy maps can be improved upon by including
photometric redshifts for the 2MASS galaxies. These redshifts are derived by
matching the 2MASS data with optical catalogues generated from SuperCOSMOS
scans of major photographic sky surveys. We find no significant ISW signal in
this analysis; an ISW effect of the form expected in a LambdaCDM universe is
only weakly preferred over no correlation, with a likelihood ratio of 1.5:1. We
consider ISW detection prospects for future large scale structure surveys with
fainter magnitude limits and greater survey depth; even with the best possible
data, the ISW cross-correlation signal would be expected to evade detection in
>~ 10% of cases.
