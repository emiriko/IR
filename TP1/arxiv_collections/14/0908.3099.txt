In these proceedings we present the main results for particle-antiparticle
mixing and rare decays in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model with custodial
symmetry. To investigate the strong bound on the Kaluza-Klein (KK) mass scale
M_KK>O(20)TeV implied by the measurement of epsilon_K we perform a fine-tuning
analysis on the one hand confirms the quoted bound on the KK mass scale but on
the other hand reveals that consistence with experiment can still be achieved
for small or moderate fine-tuning. In our analysis of rare decays of K and B
mesons we find that due to the custodial symmetry the coupling of the Z boson
to right handed quarks yields the dominant contribution. This feature of the
model leads to distinct patterns and correlations that allow to distinguish the
model from other frameworks of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM).
