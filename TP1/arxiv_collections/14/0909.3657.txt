Josephson junction-based qubits have been shown to be promising components
for a future quantum computer. A network of these superconducting qubits will
require quantum information to be stored in and transferred among them.
Resonators made of superconducting metal strips are useful elements for this
purpose because they have long coherence times and can dispersively couple
qubits. We explore the use of multiple resonators with different resonant
frequencies to couple qubits. We find that an array of resonators with
different frequencies can be individually addressed to store and retrieve
information, while coupling qubits dispersively. We show that a control qubit
can be used to effectively isolate an active qubit from an array of resonators
so that it can function within the same frequency range used by the resonators.
