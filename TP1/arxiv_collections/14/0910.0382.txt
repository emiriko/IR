We develop a supersymmetric virial expansion for two point correlation
functions of almost diagonal Gaussian Random Matrix Ensembles (ADRMT) of the
orthogonal symmetry. These ensembles have multiple applications in physics and
can be used to study universal properties of time-reversal invariant disordered
systems which are either insulators or close to the Anderson localization
transition. We derive a two-level contribution to the correlation functions of
the generic ADRMT and apply these results to the critical (multifractal) power
law banded ADRMT. Analytical results are compared with numerical ones.
