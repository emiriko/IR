The aim of the paper is to establish the strong asymptotics for the Bergman
orthogonal polynomials defined over non-smooth domains in the complex plane.
This complements an investigation started in 1923 by T. Carleman, who derived
the strong asymptotics for domains with analytic boundaries and carried over by
P.K. Suetin in the 1960's, who established them for domains with smooth
boundaries.
