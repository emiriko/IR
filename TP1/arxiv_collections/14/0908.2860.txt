This is the written version of a talk given on 1 July 2009 at the XXV Max
Born Symposium: the Planck Scale, held in Wroclaw, Poland. I review the
possible transverse geometries to supersymmetric M2-brane configurations and
discuss the representation-theoretic description of their conjectured dual
superconformal Chern-Simons theories.
