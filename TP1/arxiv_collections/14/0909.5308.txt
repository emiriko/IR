While gluinos and neutralinos are Majorana fermions in the MSSM, they can be
Dirac fermion fields in extended supersymmetry models. The difference between
the two cases manifests itself in production and decay processes at colliders.
In this contribution, results are presented for how the Majorana or Dirac
nature of gluinos and neutralinos can be extracted from di-lepton signals at
the LHC.
