Plasmonic gratings and nano-particle arrays in a metal-insulator-metal
structures are fabricated on an erbium doped silicon nitride layer. This
material system enables simple fabrication of the structure, since the active
nitride layer can be directly grown on metal. Enhancement of collected emission
of up to 12 is observed on resonance, while broad off-resonant enhancement is
also present. The output polarization behavior of the gratings and
nano-particle arrays is investigated and matched to plasmonic resonances, and
the behavior of coupled modes as a function of inter-particle distance is also
discussed.
