The charm contribution to the proton structure, F_2^c(x,Q^2), is determined
using the inclusive cross sections of D*(2010) meson production in
deep-inelastic scattering. The cross section measurement covers the region 5 <
Q2 < 1000 GeV2 in photon virtuality and 0.02 < y < 0.70 in the inelasticity of
the scattering process. The D* meson is measured in transverse momentum and
pseudo-rapidity down to p_T > 1.5 GeV and up to |eta| < 1.5. The data were
taken with the H1 detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 347
pb-1. F_2^c is determined from the D* production cross sections and compared to
leading and next-to-leading order perturbative QCD predictions.
