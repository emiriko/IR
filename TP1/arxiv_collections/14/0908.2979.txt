We study the scattering of graphene quasiparticles by topological defects,
represented by holes, pentagons and heptagons. For holes, we found that at low
concentration they give a negligible contribution to the resistivity. Whenever
pentagons or heptagons are introduced we realize that a fermionic current is
scattered by defects.
