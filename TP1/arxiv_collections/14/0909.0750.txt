We study the relation between size and star formation activity in a complete
sample of 225 massive (M > 5 x 10^10 Msun) galaxies at 1.5<z<2.5, selected from
the FIREWORKS UV-IR catalog of the CDFS. Based on stellar population synthesis
model fits to the observed restframe UV-NIR SEDs, and independent MIPS 24
micron observations, 65% of galaxies are actively forming stars, while 35% are
quiescent. Using sizes derived from 2D surface brightness profile fits to high
resolution (FWHM_{PSF}~0.45 arcsec) groundbased ISAAC data, we confirm and
improve the significance of the relation between star formation activity and
compactness found in previous studies, using a large, complete mass-limited
sample. At z~2, massive quiescent galaxies are significantly smaller than
massive star forming galaxies, and a median factor of 0.34+/-0.02 smaller than
galaxies of similar mass in the local universe. 13% of the quiescent galaxies
are unresolved in the ISAAC data, corresponding to sizes <1 kpc, more than 5
times smaller than galaxies of similar mass locally. The quiescent galaxies
span a Kormendy relation which, compared to the relation for local early types,
is shifted to smaller sizes and brighter surface brightnesses and is
incompatible with passive evolution. The progenitors of the quiescent galaxies,
were likely dominated by highly concentrated, intense nuclear star bursts at
z~3-4, in contrast to star forming galaxies at z~2 which are extended and
dominated by distributed star formation.
