We study the cooling of hybrid stars coupling with spin-down. Due to the
spin-down of hybrid stars, the interior density continuously increases,
different neutrino reactions may be triggered(from the modified Urca process to
the quark and nucleon direct Urca process) at different stages of evolution. We
calculate the rate of neutrino emissivity of different reactions and simulate
the cooling curves of the rotational hybrid stars. The results show the cooling
curves of hybrid stars clearly depend on magnetic field if the direct urca
reactions occur during the spin-down. Comparing the results of the rotational
star model with the transitional static model, we find the cooling behavior of
rotational model is more complicated, the temperature of star is higher,
especially when direct urca reactions appear in process of rotation. And then
we find that the predicted temperatures of some rotating hybrid stars are
compatible with the pulsar's data which are contradiction with the results of
transitional method.
