We use the Papapetrou method of multipole expansion to show that a Dirac
field in the Einstein-Cartan-Kibble-Sciama (ECKS) theory of gravity cannot form
singular configurations concentrated on one- or two-dimensional surfaces in
spacetime. Instead, such a field describes a nonsingular particle whose spatial
dimension is at least on the order of its Cartan radius. In particular, torsion
modifies Burinskii's model of the Dirac electron as a Kerr-Newman singular ring
of the Compton size, by replacing the ring with a toroidal structure with the
outer radius of the Compton size and the inner radius of the Cartan size. We
conjecture that torsion produced by spin prevents the formation of
singularities from matter composed of quarks and leptons. We expect that the
Cartan radius of an electron, ~10^{-27} m, introduces an effective ultraviolet
cutoff in quantum field theory for fermions in the ECKS spacetime. We also
estimate a maximum density of matter to be on the order of the corresponding
Cartan density, ~10^{51} kg m^{-3}, which gives a lower limit for black-hole
masses ~10^{16} kg. This limit corresponds to energy ~10^{43} GeV which is 39
orders of magnitude larger than the maximum beam energy currently available at
the LHC. Thus, if torsion exists and the ECKS theory of gravity is correct, the
LHC cannot produce micro black holes.
