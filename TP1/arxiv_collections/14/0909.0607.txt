We have investigated the possibility of observing higher order antibunching
(HOA) and higher order subpossonian photon statistics (HOSPS) in five wave
mixing and third harmonic generation process. It had been shown that both
processes satisfy the criteria of HOA and HOSPS. Further, some observations on
the nature of interaction which produces HOA and HOSPS are reported.
