Three dimensional roll-type double-diffusive convection in a horizontally
infinite layer of an uncompressible liquid is considered in the neighborhood of
Hopf bifurcation points. A system of amplitude equations for the variations of
convective rolls amplitude is derived by multiple-scaled method. An attention
is paid to an interaction of convection and horizontal vortex. Different cases
of the derived equations are discussed.
