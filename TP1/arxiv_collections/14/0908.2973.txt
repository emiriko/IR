We present a combined analysis of the space- and time-like electromagnetic
pion form factors in light-cone perturbative QCD with transverse momentum
dependence and Sudakov suppression. Including the non-perturbative ``soft' QCD
and power suppressed twist-3 corrections to the standard twist-2 perturbative
QCD result, the experimental pion data available at moderate energies/momentum
transfers can be explained reasonably well. This may help towards resolving the
bulk of the existing discrepancy between the space- and time-like experimental
data.
