We present solutions of asymmetric double sine-Gordon equation (DSGE) of an
infinite system based on Mobius transformation and numerical exercise. This
method is able to give the forms of the solutions for all the region on the
\phi-\eta parameter plane where \phi is an additional phase and \eta is the
ratio of the magnitudes of two sine terms. We are able to show how the
deconfinement occurs near \phi=(1/2+n)\pi and \phi=n pi. and also find the
solution for all values of \phi. We predict different kind of solutions and
transitions among them in different parts of the parameter space of this
equation.
