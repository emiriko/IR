We study level mixing in the single particle energy spectrum of one of the
constituent quantum dots in a vertical double quantum dot by performing
magneto-resonant-tunneling spectroscopy. The device used in this study differs
from previous vertical double quantum dot devices in that the single side gate
is now split into four separate gates. Because of the presence of natural
perturbations caused by anharmonicity and anistrophy, applying different
combinations of voltages to these gates allows us to alter the effective
potential landscape of the two dots and hence influence the level mixing. We
present here preliminary results from one three level crossing and one four
level crossings high up in the energy spectrum of one of the probed quantum
dots, and demonstrate that we are able to change significantly the energy
dispersions with magnetic field in the vicinity of the crossing regions.
