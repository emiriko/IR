We use the language of semidefinite programming and duality to derive
necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimal Lewenstein-Sanpera
Decomposition (LSD) of 2-qubit states. We first provide a simple and natural
derivation of the Wellens-Kus equations for full-rank states. Then, we obtain a
set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimal decomposition of
rank-3 states. This closes the gap between the full-rank case, where optimality
conditions are given by the Wellens-Kus equations, and the rank-2 case, where
the optimal decomposition is analytically known. We also give an analytic
expression for the optimal LSD of a special class of rank-3 states. Finally,
our formulation ensures efficient numerical procedures to return the optimal
LSD for any arbitrary 2-qubit state.
