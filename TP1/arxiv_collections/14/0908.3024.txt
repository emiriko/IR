Many physical constants related to quantized gravity, e.g., the Planck
length, mass, curvature, stress-energy, etc., are nonanalytic in G at G=0, and
thus have expansions in powers of G whose terms are progressively more
divergent with increasing order. Since the gravity field's classical action is
inversely proportional to G, the path integral for gravity-field quantum
transition amplitudes shows that these depend on G only through the product hG,
and are nonanalytic in G at G=0 for the same reason that all quantum transition
amplitudes are nonanalytic in h at h=0, namely their standard oscillatory
essential singularity at the classical "limit". Thus perturbation expansions in
powers of G of gravity-field transition amplitudes are also progressively more
divergent with increasing order, and hence unrenormalizable. While their
perturbative treatment is impossible, the exceedingly small value of hG makes
the semiclassical treatment of these amplitudes extraordinarily accurate,
indeed to such an extent that purely classical treatment of the gravity field
ought to always be entirely adequate. It should therefore be fruitful to couple
classical gravity to other fields which actually need to be quantized: those
fields' ubiquitous, annoying ultraviolet divergences would thereupon undergo
drastic self-gravitational red shift, and thus be cut off.
