In this proceeding, we discuss recent results on exclusive radiative B meson
decays from the Belle Collaboration. These decays are sensitive to right-handed
currents from New Physics. In particular, we measure time-dependent CP
violation parameters in B^0->K_S\pi^0\gamma and B^0->K_S\rho^0\gamma decays,
using high-statistics data samples collected at the Y(4S) resonance with the
Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e^+e^- collider. With the present
statistics, these measurements are consistent with the standard model
predictions. We also search for the radiative decay B^0->\phiK^0\gamma and
report the first observation with a significance of 5.4 \sigma, including
systematic uncertainties.
