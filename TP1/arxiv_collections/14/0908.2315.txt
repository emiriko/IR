I study, by some specific examples, how the development of a scientific
research project is strongly influenced by the theoretical framework at which
research is done. Special attention is paid to the deep changes that the
physical concept of vacuum has undergone through history. I also include a
pedagogical explanation (suitable for non-specialist readers) of the central
role played by this concept in present-day theoretical physics.
