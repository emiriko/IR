The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio and Sakai-Sugimoto models are juxtaposed, focusing on
the models' dynamically generated masses and the phase diagrams. The models are
studied in the parameter space of temperature, constant electromagnetic fields
and the quark chemical potential. When the chemical potential is zero or small,
the models show good agreement. However, the responses of the models under the
large chemical potential are very different. In the presence of the background
magnetic field, while the large chemical potential triggers the de Haas-van
Alphen oscillation and the boundstate destabilization effect of the magnetic
field in the NJL model, the Sakai-Sugimoto model completely fails to capture
these phenomena, indicating the lack of the fermi sphere in the latter model.
Also the orders of the chiral phase transitions are generally different.
