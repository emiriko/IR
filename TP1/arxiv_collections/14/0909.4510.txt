We investigate a stable Casimir force configuration consisting of an object
contained inside a spherical or spheroidal cavity filled with a dielectric
medium. The spring constant for displacements from the center of the cavity and
the dependence of the energy on the relative orientations of the inner object
and the cavity walls are computed. We find that the stability of the force
equilibrium can be predicted based on the sign of the force, but the torque
cannot be.
