Many evidences exist for a connection between galaxy interactions and induced
star formation. However, a large range of responses of galaxies to tidal
interactions is found, both in observations and in numerical simulations. We
will discuss some recent results obtained analysing a large sample (~ 1000) of
simulations of interacting pairs and their agreement with the most recent
observational works.
