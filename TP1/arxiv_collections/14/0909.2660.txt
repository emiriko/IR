Current high resolution observations of galaxy clusters reveal a dynamical
intracluster medium (ICM). The wealth of structures includes signatures of
interactions between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the ICM, such as cavities
and shocks, as well as signatures of bulk motions, e.g. cold fronts. Aiming at
understanding the physics of the ICM, we study individual clusters by both,
deep high resolution observations and numerical simulations which include
processes suspected to be at work, and aim at reproducing the observed
properties. By comparing observations and simulations in detail, we gain deeper
insights into cluster properties and processes. Here we present two examples of
our approach: the large-scale shock in the Hydra A cluster, and sloshing cold
fronts.
