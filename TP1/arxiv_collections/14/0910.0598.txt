We discuss the main features and predictions of the GLMM model, which is
based on a QCD motivated theoretical approach, and successfully describes the
experimental data on total, elastic and diffractive cross sections. In addition
we calculate the survival probability for a SM Higgs at the LHC, and compare
our results with those of the Durham group.
