In the hot, dense plasma of solar and stellar interiors, the Coulomb
interaction is screened by the surrounding plasma. Although the standard
Salpeter approximation for static screening is widely accepted and used in
stellar modeling, the question of dynamic screening has been revisited. In
particular, Shaviv and Shaviv apply the techniques of molecular dynamics to the
conditions in the solar core in order to numerically determine the dynamic
screening effect. By directly calculating the motion of ions and electrons due
to Coulomb interactions, they compute the effect of screening without the
mean-field assumption inherent in the Salpeter approximation. Here we reproduce
their numerical analysis of the screening energy in the plasma of the solar
core and conclude that the effects of dynamic screening are relevant and should
be included in the treatment of the plasma, especially in the computation of
stellar nuclear reaction rates.
