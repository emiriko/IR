(abridged) MGRO J2019+37 is an unidentified extended source of VHE gamma-rays
originally reported by the Milagro Collaboration as the brightest TeV source in
the Cygnus region. Its extended emission could be powered by either a single or
several sources. The GeV pulsar AGL J2020.5+3653, discovered by AGILE and
associated with PSR J2021+3651, could contribute to the emission from MGRO
J2019+37, although extrapolation of the GeV spectrum does not explain the
detected multi-TeV flux. Our aim is to identify radio and NIR sources in the
field of the extended TeV source MGRO J2019+37, and study potential
counterparts that could contribute to its emission. We surveyed a region of
about 6 square degrees with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at the
frequency 610 MHz. We also observed the central square degree of this survey in
the NIR Ks-band using the 3.5 m telescope in Calar Alto. Archival X-ray
observations of some specific fields are included. VLBI observations of an
interesting radio source were performed. We explored possible scenarios to
produce the multi-TeV emission from MGRO J2019+37 and studied which of the
sources could be the main particle accelerator. We present a catalogue of 362
radio sources detected with the GMRT in the field of MGRO J2019+37, and the
results of a cross-correlation of this catalog with one obtained at NIR
wavelengths, as well as with available X-ray observations of the region. Some
peculiar sources inside the ~1 degree uncertainty region of the TeV emission
from MGRO J2019+37 are discussed in detail, including the pulsar PSR J2021+3651
and its pulsar wind nebula PWN G75.2+0.1, two new radio-jet sources, the HII
region Sh 2-104 containing two star clusters, and the radio source NVSS
J202032+363158.
