We update results presented at Lattice 2005 on charmonium masses. New
ensembles of gauge configurations with 2+1 flavors of improved staggered quarks
have been analyzed. Statistics have been increased for other ensembles. New
results are also available for P-wave mesons and for bottomonium on selected
ensembles.
