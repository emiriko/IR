A self-adjoint dynamical time operator is introduced in Dirac's relativistic
formulation of quantum mechanics and shown to satisfy a commutation relation
with the Hamiltonian analogous to that of the position and momentum operators.
The ensuing time-energy uncertainty relation involves the uncertainty in the
instant of time when the wave packet passes a particular spatial position and
the energy uncertainty associated with the wave packet at the same time, as
envisaged originally by Bohr. The instantaneous rate of change of the position
expectation value with respect to the simultaneous expectation value of the
dynamical time operator is shown to be the phase velocity, in agreement with de
Broglie's hypothesis of a particle associated wave whose phase velocity is
larger than c. Thus, these two elements of the original basis and
interpretation of quantum mechanics are integrated into its formal mathematical
structure. Pauli's objection is shown to be resolved or circumvented. Possible
relevance to current developments in interference in time, in Zitterbewegung
like effects in spintronics, grapheme and superconducting systems and in
cosmology is noted.
