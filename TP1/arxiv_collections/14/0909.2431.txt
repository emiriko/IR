A Monte Carlo event generator has been developed assuming thermal production
of hadrons. The system under consideration is sampled grand canonically in the
Boltzmann approximation. A re-weighting scheme is then introduced to account
for conservation of charges (baryon number, strangeness, electric charge) and
energy and momentum, effectively allowing for extrapolation of grand canonical
results to the microcanonical limit. This method has two strong advantages
compared to analytical approaches and standard microcanonical Monte Carlo
techniques, in that it is capable of handling resonance decays as well as
(very) large system sizes.
