A five-dimensional symmetry algebra consisting of Lie point symmetries is
firstly computed for the nonlinear Schroedinger equation, which, together with
a reflection invariance, generates two five-parameter solution groups. Three
ansaetze of transformations are secondly analyzed and used to construct exact
solutions to the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Various examples of exact
solutions with constant, trigonometric function type, exponential function type
and rational function amplitude are given upon careful analysis. A bifurcation
phenomenon in the nonlinear Schroedinger equation is clearly exhibited during
the solution process.
