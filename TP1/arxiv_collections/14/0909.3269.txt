Consider an arbitrary coloring of integers with finite number of colors. Is
it true that there are x, y such that x + y, xy and x have the same color? This
is a well-known question of Ramsey theory has not solved yet. In the article we
give a positive answer to the last question in the group Z/pZ, where p is a
prime number.
