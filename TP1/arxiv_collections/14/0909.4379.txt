Systematic experiments on stress-induced phase transitions in thin SMA
structures in literature have revealed two interesting instability phenomena:
the coalescence of two martensite-austenite fronts leads to a sudden stress
drop and that of two austenite-martensite fronts leads to a sudden stress jump.
In order to get an insight into these two phenomena, in this work we carry out
an analytical study on the stress-induced phase transitions in a thin SMA layer
(a simple structure in which the two coalescence processes can happen). We
derive a quasi-2D model with a non-convex effective strain energy function
while taking into account the rate-independent dissipation effect. By using a
coupled series-asymptotic expansion method, we manage to express the total
energy dissipation in terms of the leading-order term of the axial strain. The
equilibrium equations are obtained by maximizing the total energy dissipation,
which are then solved analytically under suitable boundary conditions. The
analytical results reveal that the mechanism for such instabilities is the
presence of "limited points", which cause the switch of nontrivial solution
modes to trivial solution modes. Descriptions for the whole coalescence
processes of two fronts are also provided based on the analytical solutions,
which also capture the morphology varies of the specimen. It is also revealed
the key role played by the thickness-length ratio on these instabilities: the
zero limit of which can lead to the smooth switch of nontrivial modes to
trivial modes with no stress drop or stress jump.
