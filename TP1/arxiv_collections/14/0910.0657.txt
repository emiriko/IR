The predictabilities of the three alpha-decay half-life formulae, the Royer
GLDM, the Viola-Seaborg and the Sobiczewski-Parkhomenko formulae, have been
evaluated by developing a method based on the ansatz of standard experimental
benchmarking. The coefficients of each formula were re-derived using the
reliable data of the alpha-standards nuclei. The modified formulae that
resulted were used to evaluate the accuracies of the formulae towards the
prediction of half-lives of a set of nuclides with well-studied alpha-
spectroscopic data as well as a set of exotic alpha-emitters. Further, a simple
linear optimization of the modified formulae allowed adjustments for the
insufficient statistics of the primary data set without changing the modified
formulae. While the three modified formulae showed equivalent results for all
the medium heavy nuclei except the odd-odd, the modified GLDM showed relatively
the best figures of merit for the odd-odd and superheavy nuclides.
