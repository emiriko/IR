Dark matter annihilation is one of the leading explanations for the recently
observed $e^\pm$ excesses in cosmic rays by PAMELA, ATIC, FERMI-LAT and HESS.
Any dark matter annihilation model proposed to explain these data must also
explain the fact that PAMELA data show excesses only in $e^\pm$ spectrum but
not in anti-proton. It is interesting to ask whether the annihilation mode into
anti-proton is completely disallowed or only suppressed at low energies. Most
models proposed have negligible anti-protons in all energy ranges. We show that
the leptocentric $U(1)_{B-3L_i}$ dark matter model can explain the $e^\pm$
excesses with suppressed anti-proton mode at low energies, but at higher
energies there are sizable anti-proton excesses. Near future data from PAMELA
and AMS can provide crucial test for this type of models. Cosmic $\gamma$ ray
data can further rule out some of the models. We also show that this model has
interesting cosmic neutrino signatures.
