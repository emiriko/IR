In this paper, we investigate synchronization of coupled second-order linear
harmonic oscillators with random noises and time delays. The interaction
topology is modeled by a weighted directed graph and the weights are perturbed
by white noise. On the basis of stability theory of stochastic differential
delay equations, algebraic graph theory and matrix theory, we show that the
coupled harmonic oscillators can be synchronized almost surely with
perturbation and time delays. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate
our theoretical results.
