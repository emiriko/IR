The quantum Hall effect near the charge neutrality point in bilayer graphene
is investigated in high magnetic fields of up to 35 T using electronic
transport measurements. In the high field regime, the eight-fold degeneracy in
the zero energy Landau level is completely lifted, exhibiting new quantum Hall
states corresponding filling factors $\nu=$0, 1, 2, & 3. Measurements of the
activation energy gap in tilted magnetic fields suggest that the Landau level
splitting at the newly formed $\nu=$1, 2, & 3 filling factors are independent
of spin, consistent with the formation of a quantum Hall ferromagnet. In
addition, measurements taken at the $\nu$ = 0 charge neutral point show that,
similar to single layer graphene, the bilayer becomes insulating at high
fields.
