In this paper, we construct eight infinite families of ternary linear codes
associated with double cosets with respect to certain maximal parabolic
subgroup of the special orthogonal group $SO^{-}(2n,q)$. Here ${q}$ is a power
of three. Then we obtain four infinite families of recursive formulas for power
moments of Kloosterman sums with square arguments and four infinite families of
recursive formulas for even power moments of those in terms of the frequencies
of weights in the codes. This is done via Pless power moment identity and by
utilizing the explicit expressions of exponential sums over those double cosets
related to the evaluations of $"$Gauss sums" for the orthogonal groups
$O^{-}(2n,q)$.
