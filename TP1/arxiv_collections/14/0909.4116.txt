The effects of a nearby two-level charge fluctuator on a double-dot two-spin
qubit are studied theoretically. Assuming no direct tunneling between the
charge fluctuator and the qubit quantum dots, the Coulomb couplings between the
qubit orbital states and the fluctuator are calculated within the Hund-Mulliken
framework to quadrupole-quadrupole order in a multipole expansion. We identify
and quantify the coupling term that entangles the qubit to the fluctuator and
analyze qubit decoherence effects that result from the decay of the fluctuator
to its reservoir. Our results show that the charge environment can severely
impact the performance of spin qubits, and indicate working points at which
this decoherence channel is minimized. Our analysis also suggests that an
ancillary double-dot can provide a convenient point for single-qubit operations
and idle position, adding flexibility in the quantum control of the two-spin
qubit.
