Near-superradiant scattering of charged scalars and fermions by a
near-extreme Kerr-Newman black hole and photons and gravitons by a near-extreme
Kerr black hole are computed as certain Fourier transforms of correlators in a
two-dimensional conformal field theory. The results agree with the classic
spacetime calculations from the 1970s, thereby providing good evidence for a
conjectured Kerr-Newman/CFT correspondence.
