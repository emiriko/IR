Our study is a follow-up of the SACY project, an extended survey in the
Southern Hemisphere targeted to search for young nearby associations. Nine
associations have either been newly identified, or had their member list better
defined. These associations, with ages between about 6 Myr and 70 Myr, form an
excellent sample to study the Li depletion in the pre-main sequence (PMS)
evolution. We investigate the use of Li abundances as an independent clock to
constrain the PMS evolution. We have calculated the LTE Li abundances for 376
members of different young associations. In addition we considered the effects
of their projected stellar rotation. We present the Li depletion as function of
age in the first hundred million years for the first time for the most extended
sample of Li abundances in young stellar associations. A clear Li depletion can
be measured in the temperature range from 5000K to 3500K for the age span
covered by these nine associations. The age sequence based on the Li-clock
agrees well with the isochronal ages, $\epsilon$Cha association being the only
possible exception. The lithium depletion patterns for those associations
resemble those of the young open clusters, strengthening the notion that the
members proposed for these loose young associations have indeed a common
physical origin. The observed scatter in the Li abundances hampers the use of
Li to determine reliable ages for individual stars. Rotation velocities above
20 km s$^{-1}$ seem to inhibit the Li depletion.
