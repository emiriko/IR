Context. CoRoT light curves have an unprecedented photometric quality, having
simultaneously a high signal-to-noise ratio, a long time span and a nearly
continuous duty-cycle. Aims. We analyse the light-curves of four bright targets
observed in the seismology field and study short-lived small spots in
solar-like stars. Methods. We present a simple spot modeling by iterative
analysis. Its ability to extract relevant parameters is ensured by implementing
relaxation steps to avoid convergence to local minima of the sum of the
residuals between observations and modeling. The use of Monte-Carlo simulations
allows us to estimate the performance of the fits. Results. Our starspot
modeling gives a representation of the spots on these stars in agreement with
other well tested methods. Within this framework, parameters such as rigid-body
rotation and spot lifetimes seem to be precisely determined. Then, the
lifetime/rotation period ratios are in the range 0.5 - 2, and there is clear
evidence for differential rotation.
