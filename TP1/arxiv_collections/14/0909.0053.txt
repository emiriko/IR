Let G be an arbitrary finite weighted digraph with weights in the set of
complex rational functions. A general procedure is proposed which allows for
the reduction of G to a smaller graph with a less complicated structure having
the same spectrum as of G (up to some set known in advance). The proposed
procedure has a lot of flexibility and could be used e.g. for design of
networks with prescribed spectral and dynamical properties.
