In this work, we identify the most general measure of arbitrage for any
market model governed by It\^o processes. We show that our arbitrage measure is
invariant under changes of num\'{e}raire and equivalent probability. Moreover,
such measure has a geometrical interpretation as a gauge connection. The
connection has zero curvature if and only if there is no arbitrage. We prove an
extension of the Martingale pricing theorem in the case of arbitrage. In our
case, the present value of any traded asset is given by the expectation of
future cash-flows discounted by a line integral of the gauge connection. We
develop simple strategies to measure arbitrage using both simulated and real
market data. We find that, within our limited data sample, the market is
efficient at time horizons of one day or longer. However, we provide strong
evidence for non-zero arbitrage in high frequency intraday data. Such events
seem to have a decay time of the order of one minute.
