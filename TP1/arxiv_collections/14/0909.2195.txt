We derive the total cross section for scattering of a photon on an
ultra-short laser pulse at high energies. We take into account all multi-photon
interactions. We argue that the nonlinear effects due to these interactions
become important at very high intensities of the laser pulse. We demonstrate
however, that these intensities are significantly lower than the Schwinger
critical value.
