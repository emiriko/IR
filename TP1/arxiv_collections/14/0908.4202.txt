CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) are proposed as a technology for
various vertex detectors in nuclear and particle physics. We discuss the
mechanisms of ionizing radiation damage on MAPS hosting the the dead time free,
so-called self bias pixel. Moreover, we discuss radiation hardened sensor
designs which allow operating detectors after exposing them to irradiation
doses above 1 Mrad
