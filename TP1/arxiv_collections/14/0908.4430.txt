A major impediment to solving the problem of high-$T_c$ superconductivity is
the ongoing confusion about the magnitude, structure and doping dependence of
the superconducting gap, $\Delta_0$, and of the mysterious pseudogap found in
underdoped samples\cite{TallonLoram}. The pseudogap opens around the ($\pi$,0)
antinodes below a temperature $T^*$ leaving Fermi arcs across the remnant Fermi
surface\cite{Kanigel} on which the superconducting gap forms at $T_c$. One
thing that seems agreed is that the ratio $2\Delta_0/k_BT_c$ well exceeds the
BCS value and grows with underdoping\cite{Miyakawa1,Miyakawa2}, suggesting
unconventional, non-BCS superconductivity. Here we re-examine data from many
spectroscopies, especially Raman $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$
scattering\cite{Sacuto,Guyard}, and reconcile them all within a two-gap
scenario showing that the points of disagreement are an artefact of
spectral-weight loss arising from the pseudogap. Crucially, we find that
$\Delta_0(p)$, or more generally the order parameter, now scales with the
mean-field $T_c$ value, adopting the weak-coupling BCS ratio across the entire
phase diagram.
