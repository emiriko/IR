We discuss non-Gaussian random matrices whose elements are random variables
with heavy-tailed probability distributions. In probability theory heavy tails
of the distributions describe rare but violent events which usually have
dominant influence on the statistics. They also completely change universal
properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of random matrices. We concentrate
here on the universal macroscopic properties of (1) Wigner matrices belonging
to the Levy basin of attraction, (2) matrices representing stable free random
variables and (3) a class of heavy-tailed matrices obtained by parametric
deformations of standard ensembles.
