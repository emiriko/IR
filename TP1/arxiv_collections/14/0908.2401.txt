In this paper we study static spherically symmetric Einstein-Vlasov shells,
made up of equal mass particles, where the angular momentum L of particles
takes values only on a discrete finite set. We consider first the case where
there is only one value of L, and prove their existence by constructing
explicit examples. Shells with either hollow or black hole interiors have
finite thickness. Of particular interest is the thin shell limit of these
systems and we study its properties using both numerical and analytic arguments
to compare with known results. The general case of a set of values of L is also
considered and the particular case where L takes only two values is analyzed,
and compared with the corresponding thin shell limit already given in the
literature, finding good agreement in all cases.
