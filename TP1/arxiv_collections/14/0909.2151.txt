We study theoretically the dynamics of charged quantized vortices (CQVs).
CQVs (ion-vortex complexes) have been used as an important probe in the field
of quantum hydrodynamics. Recent experimental studies of quantum turbulence at
very low temperatures utilize CQVs. In this work we propose the equation of
motion of CQVs based on the vortex filament model. An analytical solution for a
charged vortex ring shows how it expands under an electric field. Numerical
simulation reveals the characteristic behavior of CQVs under an electric field.
