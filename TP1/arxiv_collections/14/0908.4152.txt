A list of 205 gamma-ray strong objects was reported recently as a result of a
3-month integration with the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-Ray
Space Telescope. We attempted identification of these objects,
cross-correlating the gamma-ray positions with VLBI positions of a large
all-sky sample of extragalactic radio sources selected on the basis of their
parsec-scale flux density. The original associations reported by the Fermi team
are confirmed and six new identifications are suggested. A Monte-Carlo analysis
shows that the fraction of chance associations in our analysis is less than 5
per cent, and confirms that the vast majority of gamma-ray bright extragalactic
sources are radio loud blazars with strong parsec-scale jets. A correlation
between the parsec-scale radio and gamma-ray flux is supported by our analysis
of a complete VLBI flux-density-limited sample of extragalactic jets. The
effectiveness of using a VLBI catalog to find associations between gamma-ray
detections and compact extragalactic radio sources, especially near the
Galactic plane, is demonstrated. It is suggested that VLBI catalogs should be
used for future identification of Fermi LAT objects.
