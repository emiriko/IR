We consider extensions of the standard model based on open strings ending on
D-branes, with gauge bosons due to strings attached to stacks of D-branes and
chiral matter due to strings stretching between intersecting D-branes. Assuming
that the fundamental string mass scale is in the TeV range and the theory is
weakly coupled, we review possible signals of string physics at the Large
Hadron Collider.
