The glassy dynamics is a consequence of the elastic properties of the vortex
matter, and in principle may occur in any superconductor. However, whereas a
large amount of experimental evidence confirms glassiness in high Tc
superconductors (HTS), the applicability of the whole framework developed to
describe vortex matter in HTS to other superconducting materials is unclear. In
this framework, the particular creep behavior of MgB2, larger than creep of
conventional superconductor materials but much lower than HTS one, had
precluded a complete understanding of the vortex regimes in this material. In
this work we present an experimental study of relaxation processes of pure MgB2
bulk samples measured by DC magnetization technique. We propose a novel
self-consistent scaling method to analyze the data and extract the activation
energies. The observed experimental behavior can be described in a glassy
picture, with a unique critical exponent &mu~1, characteristic of collective
creep in the intermediate vortex bundle regime.
