We compute analytic expressions for the non-linearity parameters
characterizing the bi- and tri-spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations
generated during an inflationary epoch of the early universe driven by an
arbitrary number of fields. We assume neither slow roll nor a separable
potential; instead, to compute Non-Gaussianities, we assume a separable Hubble
parameter. We apply the formalism to an exact solvable toy-model and show under
which conditions observably large non-Gaussianities are produced.
