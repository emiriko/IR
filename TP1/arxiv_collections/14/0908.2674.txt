It is well known that usual quantum teleportation protocols cannot transport
energy. Recently, new protocols called quantum energy teleportation (QET) have
been proposed, which transport energy by local operations and classical
communication with the ground states of many-body quantum systems. In this
paper, we compare two different QET protocols for transporting energy with
electromagnetic field. In the first protocol, a 1/2 spin (a qubit) is coupled
with the quantum fluctuation in the vacuum state and measured in order to
obtain one-bit information about the fluctuation for the teleportation. In the
second protocol, a harmonic oscillator is coupled with the fluctuation and
measured in order to obtain continuous-variable information about the
fluctuation. In the spin protocol, the amount of teleported energy is
suppressed by an exponential damping factor when the amount of input energy
increases. This suppression factor becomes power damping in the case of the
harmonic oscillator protocol. Therefore, it is concluded that obtaining more
information about the quantum fluctuation leads to teleporting more energy.
This result suggests a profound relationship between energy and quantum
information.
