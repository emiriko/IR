Hall and optical conductivity experiments on the cuprates indicate that the
low-energy fermionic degrees of freedom in a doped Mott insulator posess a
component that is dynamcially generated and hence determined by the
temperature. We show explicitly how the spectrum in the lower Hubbard band
should be partitioned to describe such dynamically generated charge degrees of
freedom and corroborate this picture with the results from the exact low-energy
theory of the Hubbard model. A consequence of such dynamics is that the Landau
one-to-one correspondence between bare electrons and the effective fermionic
degrees of freedom at low energies breaks down explicitly. This state of
affairs obtains because the total hole number is not conserved as it contains a
dynamical contribution. We propose that any experimental probe that couples to
the low-energy dynamics of a doped Mott insulator, quantum oscillation
experiments included, should be interpreted in terms of the total dynamically
generated hole number rather than the bare value.
