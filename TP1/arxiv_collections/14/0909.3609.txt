We propose a randomized algorithm for training Support vector machines(SVMs)
on large datasets. By using ideas from Random projections we show that the
combinatorial dimension of SVMs is $O({log} n)$ with high probability. This
estimate of combinatorial dimension is used to derive an iterative algorithm,
called RandSVM, which at each step calls an existing solver to train SVMs on a
randomly chosen subset of size $O({log} n)$. The algorithm has probabilistic
guarantees and is capable of training SVMs with Kernels for both classification
and regression problems. Experiments done on synthetic and real life data sets
demonstrate that the algorithm scales up existing SVM learners, without loss of
accuracy.
