We present a unified model of optical and ultraviolet (UV) light curves for
one of the fastest classical novae, V838 Herculis (Nova Herculis 1991), and
estimate its white dwarf (WD) mass. Based on an optically thick wind theory of
nova outbursts, we model the optical light curves with free-free emission and
the UV 1455 \AA light curves with blackbody emission. Our models of 1.35 \pm
0.02 M_\sun WD reproduce simultaneously the optical and UV 1455 \AA
observations. The mass lost by the wind is \Delta M_{wind} \sim 2 \times
10^{-6} M_\sun. We provide new determinations of the reddening, E(B-V) = 0.53
\pm 0.05, and of the distance, 2.7 \pm 0.5 kpc.
