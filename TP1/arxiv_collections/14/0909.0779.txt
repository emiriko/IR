We consider density functionals for exchange and correlation energies in
two-dimensional systems. The functionals are constructed by making use of exact
constraints for the angular averages of the corresponding exchange and
correlation holes, respectively, and assuming proportionality between their
characteristic sizes. The electron current and spin are explicitly taken into
account, so that the resulting functionals are suitable to deal with systems
exhibiting orbital currents and/or spin polarization. Our numerical results
show that in finite systems the proposed functionals outperform the standard
two-dimensional local spin-density approximation, still performing well also in
the important limit of the homogeneous two-dimensional electron gas.
