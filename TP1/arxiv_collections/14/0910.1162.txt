The motion of two attractively interacting atoms in an optical lattice is
investigated in the presence of a scattering potential. The initial
wavefunction can be prepared by using tightly bound exact two-particle
eigenfunction for vanishing scattering potential. This allows to numerically
simulate the dynamics in the generation of two-particle Schrodinger cat states
using a scheme recently proposed for scattering of quantum matter wave
solitons.
