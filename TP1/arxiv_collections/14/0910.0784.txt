The thermoelectric power factor of the narrow-gap semiconductor FeSb2 is
greatly enhanced in comparison to the isostructural homologues FeAs2 and RuSb2.
Comparative studies of magnetic and thermodynamic properties provide evidence
that the narrow and correlated bands as well as the associated enhanced
thermoelectricity are only specific to FeSb2. Our results point to the
potential of FeSb2 for practical thermoelectric application at cryogenic
temperatures and stimulate the search for new correlated semiconductors along
the same lines.
