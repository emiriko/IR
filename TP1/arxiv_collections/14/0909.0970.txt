We study high-stress SiN films for reaching the quantum regime with
mesoscopic oscillators connected to a room-temperature thermal bath, for which
there are stringent requirements on the oscillators' quality factors and
frequencies. Our SiN films support mechanical modes with unprecedented products
of mechanical quality factor $Q_m$ and frequency $\nu_m$ reaching $Q_{m} \nu_m
\simeq2 \times 10^{13}$ Hz. The SiN membranes exhibit a low optical absorption
characterized by Im$(n) \lesssim 10^{-5}$ at 935 nm, representing a 15 times
reduction for SiN membranes. We have developed an apparatus to simultaneously
cool the motion of multiple mechanical modes based on a short, high-finesse
Fabry-Perot cavity and present initial cooling results along with future
possibilities.
