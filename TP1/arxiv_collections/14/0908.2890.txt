Let $M$ be a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary $\pp M$ and $L= \DD+Z$
for a $C^1$-vector field $Z$ on $M$. Several equivalent statements, including
the gradient and Poincar\'e/log-Sobolev type inequalities of the Neumann
semigroup generated by $L$, are presented for lower bound conditions on the
curvature of $L$ and the second fundamental form of $\pp M$. The main result
not only generalizes the corresponding known ones on manifolds without
boundary, but also clarifies the role of the second fundamental form in the
analysis of the Neumann semigroup. Moreover, the L\'evy-Gromov isoperimetric
inequality is also studied on manifolds with boundary.
