Rapid energy releases (RERs) in the solar corona extend over many orders of
magnitude, the largest (flares) releasing an energy of $10^{25} $J or more.
Other events, with a typical energy that is a billion times less, are called
nanoflares. A basic difference between flares and nanoflares is that flares
need a larger magnetic field and thus occur only in active regions, while
nanoflares can appear everywhere. The origin of such RERs is usually attributed
to magnetic reconnection that takes place at altitudes just above the
transition region. Here we show that nanoflares and smaller similar RERs can be
explained within the drift wave theory as a natural stage in the kinetic growth
of the drift wave. In this scenario, a growing mode with a sufficiently large
amplitude leads to stochastic heating that can provide an energy release of
over $10^{16} $J.
