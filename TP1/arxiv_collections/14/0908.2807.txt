We study the spectra of all long Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) of known redshift
detected by the Fermi satellite. Their fluxes and fluences are large enough to
allow a time dependent study of their spectral characteristics in the 8 keV-1
MeV energy range. We find that the peak energy Ep of their EL(E) spectrum
correlates with the luminosity in a remarkable tight way within individual
bursts. This time resolved Ep-Liso correlation is very similar for all the
considered bursts, and has a slope and normalisation similar to the analogous
Ep-Liso correlation defined by the time integrated spectra of different bursts
detected by several different satellites. For a few of the considered GRBs, we
could also study the behaviour of the Ep-Liso correlation during the rising and
decaying phases of individual pulses within each burst, finding no differences.
Our results indicate the presence of a similar physical mechanism, operating
for the duration of different GRBs, linking tightly the burst luminosity with
the peak energy of the spectrum emitted at different times. Such a physical
mechanism is the same during the rise and decay phase of individual pulses
composing a GRB. These results, while calling for a robust physical
interpretation, strongly indicate that the Ep-Liso spectral energy correlation
found considering the time integrated spectra of different bursts is real, and
not the result of instrumental selection effects.
