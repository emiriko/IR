V. Turaev introduced the theory of topology of words and phrases in 2005.
This is a combinatorialy extension of the theory of virtual knots and links. In
this paper we generalize the notion of homotopy of words and phrases and we
give geometric meanings of the generalized homotopy of words. Moreover using
the generalized homotopy theory of words and phrases, we extend some homotopy
invariants of nanophrases to $S$-homotopy invariant of nanowords with some
homotopy data $S$.
