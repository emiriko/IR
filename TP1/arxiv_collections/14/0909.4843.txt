A detailed investigation of all possible textures of Fritzsch-like and
non-Fritzsch like, 144 for texture 6 zero and 432 for texture 5 zero mass
matrices, have been carried out to ascertain their compatibility with the
existing quark mixing data. It seems that all the texture 6 zero possibilities
are completely ruled out whereas in the case of texture 5 zero mass matrices
the only viable possibility looks to be that of Fritzsch-like.
