A summary is given of a talk on the physics and technology of hybrid metallic
nanostructures, with a view to metallic nanoelectronics. In the beginning of
the talk it was noted that the majority of the presentations at the conference
were not concerned with electronics but the physics of sensors, since they were
devoted to studies of the influence of temperature, magnetic field, whereas
electronics is all about modulation of electrical conductance by electrical
means. An overview was given of the latest research into electric field effects
in metals, including quantum field effects and effects in ultra-thin
quench-condensed metallic films. A design of Metallic Field Effect Transistor
using 2D metallic films was presented, and an estimate for electric field
effect was given. It was emphasized that 2D metallic nanostructures may show
completely different properties than bulk metals and are in essence novel
materials. Examples of metallic systems that could show field effects in
accessible electric fields were given. A nanotechnology enabling fabrication of
thermodynamically stable ultra-thin 2D metallic nanostructures was presented.
