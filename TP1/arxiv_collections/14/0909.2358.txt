A simplified model of a redundant power grid is used to study integration of
fluctuating renewable generation. The grid consists of large number of
generator and consumer nodes. The net power consumption is determined by the
difference between the gross consumption and the level of renewable generation.
The gross consumption is drawn from a narrow distribution representing the
predictability of aggregated loads, and we consider two different distributions
representing wind and solar resources. Each generator is connected to D
consumers, and redundancy is built in by connecting R of these consumers to
other generators. The lines are switchable so that at any instance each
consumer is connected to a single generator. We explore the capacity of the
renewable generation by determining the level of "firm" generation capacity
that can be displaced for different levels of redundancy R. We also develop
message-passing control algorithm for finding switch settings where no
generator is overloaded.
