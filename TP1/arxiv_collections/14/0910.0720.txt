Variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (VMC and DMC) calculations of
the properties of the zero-temperature fermionic gas at unitarity are reported.
The ratio of the energy of the interacting to the non-interacting gas for a
system of 128 particles is calculated to be 0.4517(3) in VMC and 0.4339(1) in
the more accurate DMC method. The spherically-averaged pair-correlation
functions, momentum densities, and one-body density matrices are very similar
in VMC and DMC, but the two-body density matrices and condensate fractions show
some differences. Our best estimate of the condensate fraction of 0.51 is a
little smaller than values from other quantum Monte Carlo calculations.
