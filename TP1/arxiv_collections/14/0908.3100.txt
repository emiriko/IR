The quantization of Einstein-Maxwell theory with a cosmological constant is
considered. We obtain all logarithmically divergent terms in the one-loop
effective action that involve only the background electromagnetic field. This
includes Lee-Wick type terms, as well as those responsible for the
renormalization group behaviour of the electric charge (or fine structure
constant). Of particular interest is the possible gauge condition dependence of
the results, and we study this in some detail. We show that the traditional
background-field method, that is equivalent to a more traditional Feynman
diagram calculation, does result in gauge condition dependent results in
general. One resolution of this is to use the Vilkovisky-DeWitt effective
action method, and this is presented here. Quantum gravity is shown to lead to
a contribution to the running charge not present when the cosmological constant
vanishes. This re-opens the possibility, suggested by Robinson and Wilczek, of
altering the scaling behaviour of gauge theories at high energies although our
result differs. We show the possibility of an ultraviolet fixed point that is
linked directly to the cosmological constant.
