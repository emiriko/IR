We report the successful stabilization of a thick bulk-like, distorted
$\alpha$-Mn film with (110) orientation on a W(110) substrate. The observed
$(3\times3)$ overstructure for the Mn film with respect to the original W(110)
low-energy electron diffraction pattern is consistent with the presented
structure model. The possibility to stabilize such a pseudomorphic Mn film is
supported by density functional total energy calculations. Angle-resolved
photoemission spectra of the stabilized $\alpha$-Mn(110) film show weak
dispersions of the valence band electronic states in accordance with the large
unit cell.
