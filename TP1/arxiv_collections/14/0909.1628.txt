We have studied electrical transport properties of a high quality
Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+x crystal below a superconducting critical temperature, Tc. In
magnetic fields B parallel to the c-axis just above a voltage response onset
resistance vs temperature data are well fitted to the vortex-glass model.
Obtained from the vortex-glass analysis a melting transition boundary for
Bi-2223 crystal shifted towards lower temperatures compared to previously
reported data for a (Bi,Pb)-2223 single crystal. The critical current density,
Jc, of Bi-2223 crystals is close to presented elsewhere Jc values for Bi-2223
tapes suggesting a principal role of weak intrinsic pinning properties of
Bi-2223 as a main limiting factor of Jc of Bi-2223 conductors.
