We investigate the impurity scattering rates for quasi-particles in vortex
cores of sign-reversing s-wave superconductors as a probe to detect the
internal phase difference of the order parameters among different Fermi
surfaces. The impurity scattering rates and coherence factors are related to
quasiparticle interference effect by the scanning tunneling microscopy and
spectroscopy technique. With use of the Born and Kramer-Pesch approximations
for the Andreev bound states, we show that the sign-reversed forward
scatterings are dominant in vortex cores. Owing to the coherence factor in
vortex cores of \pm s-wave superconductors, the impurity scattering rate of the
Andreev bound states has a characteristic distribution on the Fermi surfaces.
For comparison, the impurity scattering rates in vortex cores of s-wave and
d-wave superconductors are also discussed.
