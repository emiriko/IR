Vector unparticle couplings to standard model fields produce repulsive
corrections to gravity. From a general relativistic perspective, this leads to
an effective Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like metric whose "charge" is a function of
the unparticle coupling constant $\lambda$, and therefore can admit naked
singularities. Requiring the system to respect cosmic censorship provides a new
method of constraining the value of $\lambda$. These limits are extremely loose
for stellar-mass black holes, but commensurate with existing bounds for
primordial black holes. In the case of theoretical low-mass black holes, the
bounds on $\lambda$ are much stricter than those derived from astrophysical and
accelerator phenomenology. Additional constraints on the lower limit of
$\lambda$ are used to estimate the mass of the smallest possible black hole
$\Mbh^{\rm min}$ that can be formed in the unparticle framework, as a function
of the unparticle parameters ($\Lambda_\unp,M_\unp,\du,\dbz$).
