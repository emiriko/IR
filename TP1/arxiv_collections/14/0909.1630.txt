In this work we propose to investigate the cluster structure of the excited
states of nuclei produced in the photodisintegration reactions on 6 Li and 7Li
targets, with three bodies (clusters and nucleons) in final state using
bremsstrahlung and linear polarized beams. The analysis of the experimental
data with the use of Dalitz diagrams allows to investigate 16 cluster
structures of 9 isotopes of H, He and Li nuclei in four reactions of
photodisintegration with the above-mentioned targets.
