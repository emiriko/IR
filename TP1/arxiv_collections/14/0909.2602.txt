We suggest that superscaling in electroweak interactions with nuclei, namely
the observation that the reduced electron-nucleus cross sections are to a large
degree independent of the momentum transfer and of the nuclear species, can be
used as a tool to obtain precise predictions for neutrino-nucleus cross
sections in both charged and neutral current-induced processes.
