In the framework of density functional theory (DFT), the structural and
magnetic properties of FeN mono nitride have been investigated using the all
electrons augmented spherical wave method (ASW) with a generalized gradient GGA
functional for treating the effects of exchange and correlation. Calculation of
the energy versus volume in hypothetic rocksalt (RS), zinc-blende (ZB) and
wurtzite (W) types structures shows that the RS-type structure is more stable
than the others. Spin polarized calculation results at equilibrium volume
indicate that the ground state of RS-FeN is ferromagnetic with a high moment,
while ZB-FeN and W-FeN are non magnetic. The influence of distortions on the
stability is taken into account by considering FeN in two different
face-centred tetragonal structures (fct): fct-rocksalt and fct-zincblende. The
magnetovolume effects with respect to Slater-Pauling-Friedel model are
discussed. The electronic structures analyzed from site and spin projected
density of states are reported. A discussion of the structural and magnetic
properties of FeN is given with respect to N local environment of Fe.
