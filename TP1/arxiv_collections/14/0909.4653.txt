Lattice model of directed self avoiding walk has been solved analytically to
investigate adsorption desorption phase transition behaviour of a semiflexible
sequential copolymer chain on a two dimensional impenetrable surface
perpendicular to the preferred direction of the walk of the copolymer chain in
three dimensions. The stiffness of the chain has been accounted by introducing
an energy barrier for each bend in the walk of the copolymer chain. Exact value
of adsorption desorption transition points have been determined using
generating function method for the cases in which one type of monomer is having
interaction with the surface viz., (i) no interaction (ii) attractive
interaction and (iii) repulsive interaction. Results obtained in each of the
case show that for stiffer copolymer chain adsorption transition occurs at a
smaller value of monomer surface attraction than a flexible copolymer chain.
These features are similar to that of a semi-flexible homopolymer chain
adsorption.
