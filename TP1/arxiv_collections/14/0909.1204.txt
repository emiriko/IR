Screening effects from sea pairs on the quark-antiquark static potential are
analyzed phenomenologically from the light-quark to the heavy-quark meson
spectra. From the high excited light-quark meson spectrum a universal form for
the screened static potential is proposed. This potential is then succesfully
applied to heavy quarkonia. Our results suggest the assignment of X(4260) to
the 4s state of charmonium and the possible existence of a 5s bottomonium
resonance around 10748 MeV.
