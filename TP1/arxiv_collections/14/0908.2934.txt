We study electromagnetic streaming instabilities in thermal viscous regions
of rotating astrophysical objects, such as, protostellar and protoplanetary
magnetized accretion disks, molecular clouds, their cores, and elephant trunks.
The obtained results can also be applied to any regions of interstellar medium,
where different equilibrium velocities between charged species can arise. We
consider a weakly and highly ionized three-component plasma consisting of
neutrals and magnetized electrons and ions. The vertical perturbations along
the background magnetic field are investigated. The effect of perturbation of
collisional frequencies due to density perturbations of species is taken into
account. The growth rates of perturbations are found in a wide region of wave
number spectrum for media, where the thermal pressure is larger than the
magnetic pressure. It is shown that in cases of strong collisional coupling of
neutrals with ions the contribution of the viscosity is negligible.
