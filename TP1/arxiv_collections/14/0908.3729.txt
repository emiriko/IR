We present an economic model that establishes a link between neutrino masses
and properties of the dark matter candidate. The particle content of the model
can be divided into two groups: light particles with masses lighter than the
electroweak scale and heavy particles. The light particles, which also include
the dark matter candidate, are predicted to show up in the low energy
experiments such as $(K\to \ell +{\rm missing energy})$, making the model
testable. The heavy sector can show up at the LHC and may give rise to
Br($\ell_i \to \ell_j \gamma$) close to the present bounds. In principle, the
new couplings of the model can independently be derived from the data from the
LHC and from the information on neutrino masses and Lepton Flavor Violating
(LFV) rare decays, providing the possibility of an intensive cross-check of the
model.
