At the Tevatron, the collider experiments CDF and DO have data sets at their
disposal that compromise several hundreds of reconstructed top-antitop-quark
pairs and allow for precision measurements of the cross section and production
and decay properties. Besides comparing the measurements to standard model
predictions, these data sets open a window to physics beyond the standard
model. Dedicated analyses look for new heavy gauge bosons, fourth generation
quarks, and flavor-changing neutral currents.
