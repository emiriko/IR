The J1-J2 model on a square lattice exhibits a rich variety of different
forms of magnetic order that depend sensitively on the ratio of exchange
constants J2/J1. We use bulk magnetometry and polarized neutron scattering to
determine J1 and J2 unambiguously for two materials in a new family of vanadium
phosphates, Pb2VO(PO4)2 and SrZnVO(PO4)2, and we find that they have
ferromagnetic J1. The ordered moment in the collinear antiferromagnetic ground
state is reduced, and the diffuse magnetic scattering is enhanced, as the
predicted bond-nematic region of the phase diagram is approached.
