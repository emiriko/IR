In this short paper we review a series of publications, some of which are our
own, where various aspects of size effects were examined. By analyzing a series
of examples we show that various intensive macroscopic characteristics of
nanoobjects exhibit non-trivial size dependencies on the scale of 200 to 40 A.
Drastic variations take place for sizes in the region 50-60 A for ordinary
systems, and 60-200 A in the case of magnetic systems. We argue that X-ray and
neutron scattering gives an excellent metrological support in the domain from
100 A to 10 A.
