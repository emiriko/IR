In the U(1)_{B-L} extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model the
right-handed sneutrino is a natural candidate for thermal dark matter.
Sneutrino annihilation at the present time can be considerably enhanced due to
the exchange of the lightest field in the Higgs sector that breaks U(1)_{B-L}.
The annihilation mainly produces taus (or muons) by the virtue of B-L charge
assignments. A sneutrino mass of 1-2 TeV provides a good fit to the PAMELA and
is compatible with the latest results from the FERMI experiment. In addition,
the sneutrino-nucleon elastic scattering cross section is within the reach of
the upcoming and future direct detection experiments.
