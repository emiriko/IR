The luminescence of 3 speleothem samples from the Acquafredda karst system
and 1 from the Novella Cave (Gessi Bolognesi Natural Park, Italy) has been
recorded using excitation by impulse Xe- lamp. All these carbonate speleothems
are believed to be formed only from active CO2 from the air, because the
bedrock of the cave consist of gypsum and does not contain carbonates. The
obtained photos of luminescence record the climate changes during the
speleothem growth. U/Th and 14C dating proved that studied speleothems started
to grow since about 5,000 years ago. The detailed analyses of the luminescence
records is still in progress.
