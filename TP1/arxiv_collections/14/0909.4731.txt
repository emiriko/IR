We continue exploring free strings in the background of null Kasner-like
cosmological singularities, following arXiv:0904.4532 [hep-th]. We study the
free string Schrodinger wavefunctional along the lines of arXiv:0807.1517
[hep-th]. We find the wavefunctional to be nonsingular in the vicinity of
singularities whose Kasner exponents satisfy certain relations. We compare this
with the description in other variables. We then study certain regulated
versions of these singularities where the singular region is replaced by a
substringy but nonsingular region and study the string spectra in these
backgrounds. The string modes can again be solved for exactly, giving some
insight into how string oscillator states get excited near the singularity.
