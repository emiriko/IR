We explore short-distance static correlation functions in the infinite XXZ
chain using previously derived formulae which represent the correlation
functions in factorized form. We compute two-point functions ranging over 2, 3
and 4 lattice sites as functions of the temperature and the magnetic field in
the massive regime $\Delta>1$, extending our previous results to the full
parameter plane of the antiferromagnetic chain ($\Delta > -1$ and arbitrary
field $h$). The factorized formulae are numerically efficient and allow for
taking the isotropic limit ($\Delta = 1$) and the Ising limit ($\Delta =
\infty$). At the critical field separating the fully polarized phase from the
N\'eel phase, the Ising chain possesses exponentially many ground states. The
residual entropy is lifted by quantum fluctuations for large but finite
$\Delta$ inducing unexpected crossover phenomena in the correlations.
