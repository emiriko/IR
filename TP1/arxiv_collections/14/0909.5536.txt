We report on large energy pulse generation in an erbium-doped fiber laser
passively mode-locked with atomic layer graphene. Stable mode locked pulses
with single pulse energy up to 7.3 nJ and pulse width of 415 fs have been
directly generated from the laser. Our results show that atomic layer graphene
could be a promising saturable absorber for large energy mode locking.
