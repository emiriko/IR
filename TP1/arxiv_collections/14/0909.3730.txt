The spatially-temporal model of an all-solid-state passively Q-switched
oscillator with an active medium providing the stimulated Raman scattering is
presented. The model does not presume a Gaussian shape of the cylindrically
symmetric modes at both fundamental and Stokes wavelengths. It is found, that
the highly-nontrivial spatially-temporal dynamics can be regularized by the
optimal choice of the oscillator parameters, viz. initial transmission of a
saturable absorber, curvature of a spherical mirror, and output mirror
transmission at the fundamental and Stokes wavelengths. As a result, the pulse
can be substantially temporally squeezed and spatially broadened at both
fundamental and Stokes wavelengths.
