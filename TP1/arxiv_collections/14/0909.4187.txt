Using muon spin resonance we examine the organometallic hybrid compound
Cu(1,3-benzenedicarboxylate) [Cu(1,3-bdc)], which has structurally perfect spin
1/2 copper kagome planes separated by pure organic linkers. This compound has
antiferromagnetic interactions with Curie-Weiss temperature of -33 K. We found
slowing down of spin fluctuations starting at T=1.8 K, and that the state at
T->0 is quasi-static with no long-range order and extremely slow spin
fluctuations at a rate of 3.6 1/usec. This indicates that Cu(1,3-bdc) behaves
as expected from a kagome magnet and could serve as a model kagome compound.
