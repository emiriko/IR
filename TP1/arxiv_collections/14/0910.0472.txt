We consider a problem in random matrix theory that is inspired by quantum
information theory: determining the largest eigenvalue of a sum of p random
product states in (C^d)^{otimes k}, where k and p/d^k are fixed while d grows.
When k=1, the Marcenko-Pastur law determines (up to small corrections) not only
the largest eigenvalue ((1+sqrt{p/d^k})^2) but the smallest eigenvalue
(min(0,1-sqrt{p/d^k})^2) and the spectral density in between. We use the method
of moments to show that for k>1 the largest eigenvalue is still approximately
(1+sqrt{p/d^k})^2 and the spectral density approaches that of the
Marcenko-Pastur law, generalizing the random matrix theory result to the random
tensor case. Our bound on the largest eigenvalue has implications both for
sampling from a particular heavy-tailed distribution and for a recently
proposed quantum data-hiding and correlation-locking scheme due to Leung and
Winter. Since the matrices we consider have neither independent entries nor
unitary invariance, we need to develop new techniques for their analysis. The
main contribution of this paper is to give three different methods for
analyzing mixtures of random product states: a diagrammatic approach based on
Gaussian integrals, a combinatorial method that looks at the cycle
decompositions of permutations and a recursive method that uses a variant of
the Schwinger-Dyson equations.
