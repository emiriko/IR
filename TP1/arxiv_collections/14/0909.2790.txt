In order to test the recently proposed classification of the radio/X-ray
states of the X-ray binary Cyg X-3, we present an analysis of the radio data
available for the system at much higher spatial resolutions than used for
defining the states. The radio data set consists of archival VLBA data at 5 or
15 GHz and new e-EVN data at 5 GHz. We also present 5 GHz MERLIN observations
of an outburst of Cyg X-3. In the X-ray regime we use quasi-simultaneous with
radio, monitoring and pointed RXTE observations. We find that when the radio
emission from both jet and core is globally considered, the behaviour of Cyg
X-3 at milliarcsecond scales is consistent with that described at arcsecond
scales. However, when the radio emission is disentangled in a core component
and a jet component the situation changes. It becomes clear that in active
states the radio emission from the jet is dominating that from the core. This
shows that in these states the overall radio flux cannot be used as a direct
tracer of the accretion state.
