The purpose of this text is to give a self-contained description of the basic
theory of the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method, as well as most of the
details required to make the method work in practice. These two topics are
covered in the first two sections, while the last is dedicated to examples of
how to apply the PAW transformation when extracting non-standard quantities
from a density-functional theory (DFT) calculation.
