In 2005, Nagler and Claussen (Phys. Rev. E 71 (2005) 067103) investigated the
time series of the elementary cellular automata (ECA) for possible
(multi)fractal behavior. They eliminated the polynomial background at^b through
the direct fitting of the polynomial coefficients a and b. We here reconsider
their work eliminating the polynomial trend by means of the multifractal-based
detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) in which the wavelet multiresolution
property is employed to filter out the trend in a more speedy way than the
direct polynomial fitting and also with respect to the wavelet transform
modulus maxima (WTMM) procedure. In the algorithm, the discrete fast wavelet
transform is used to calculate the trend as a local feature that enters the
so-called details signal. We illustrate our result for three representative ECA
rules: 90, 105, and 150. We confirm their multifractal behavior and provide our
results for the scaling parameters
