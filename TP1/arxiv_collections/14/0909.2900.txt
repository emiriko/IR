It is usually assumed that dark matter direct detection is sensitive to a
large fraction of the dark matter (DM) velocity distribution. We propose an
alternative form of dark matter-nucleus scattering which only probes a narrow
range of DM velocities due to the existence of a resonance, a DM-nucleus bound
state, in the scattering - resonant dark matter (rDM). The scattering cross
section becomes highly element dependent, has increased modulation and as a
result can explain the DAMA/LIBRA results whilst not being in conflict with
other direct detection experiments. We describe a simple model that realizes
the dynamics of rDM, where the DM is the neutral component of a fermionic weak
triplet whose charged partners differ in mass by approximately 10 MeV.
