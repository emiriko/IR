We study the effect of electron-electron interaction on the one-particle
density of states (\emph{DOS}) $\rho^{(d)}(\epsilon,T)$ of low-dimensional
disordered metals near Fermi energy within the framework of the finite
temperature conventional impurity diagram technique. We consider only diffusive
limit and by a geometric re-summation of the most singular first order
self-energy corrections via the Dyson equation we obtain a non-divergent
solution for the \emph{DOS} at low energies, while for higher energies the
well-known Altshuler-Aronov corrections are recovered. At the Fermi level
$\rho^{(d)}(\epsilon,T=0)\to 0$, this indicates that interacting disordered
two- and quasi-one-dimensional systems are in insulating state at zero
temperature. The obtained results are in good agreement with recent tunneling
experiments on two-dimensional GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures and
quasi-one-dimensional doped multiwall carbon nanotubes.
