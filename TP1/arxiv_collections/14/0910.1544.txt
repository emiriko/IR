We present observations of two new single-lined eclipsing binaries, both
consisting of an Am star and an M-dwarf, discovered by the Wide Angle Search
for Planets transit photometry survey. Using WASP photometry and spectroscopic
measurements we find that HD186753B has an orbital period of P=1.9194 days, a
mass of M=0.24 +/- 0.02 M_sun and radius of R=0.31 +/- 0.06 R_sun; and that
TCY7096-222-1B has an orbital period of P=8.9582 days, a mass between 0.29 and
0.54 M_sun depending on eccentricity and radius of R=0.263+0.02-0.07 R_sun. We
find that the Am stars have relatively low rotational velocities that closely
match the orbital velocities of the M-dwarfs, suggesting that they have been
"spun-down" by the M-dwarfs.
