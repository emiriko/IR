The two southernmost gates of the Goseck rondel, built by the
Stichbandkeramik culture around 4800 BCE, were oriented to the winter solstice
sunrise and sunset. The northern gate of the rondel deviates a few degrees from
the Meridian line. It is suggested that this deviation from the cardinal
direction is due a stellar orientation towards Edasich, which was the pole star
at the time, and is thus related to the concept of the world pillar and the
pole star as the top of it.
