Since the advent of wireless communication, the need for mobile ad hoc
networks has been growing exponentially. This has opened up a Pandoras Box of
algorithms for dealing with mobile ad hoc networks, or MANETs, as they are
generally referred to. Most attempts made at evaluating these algorithms so far
have focused on parameters such as throughput, packet delivery ratio, overhead
etc. An analysis of the convergence times of these algorithms is still an open
issue. The work carried out fills this gap by evaluating the algorithms on the
basis of convergence time. Algorithms for MANETs can be classified into three
categories: reactive, proactive, and hybrid protocols. In this project, we
compare the convergence times of representative algorithms in each category,
namely Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) reactive, Destination Sequence
Distance Vector protocol (DSDV) proactive, and Temporally Ordered Routing
Algorithm (TORA) hybrid. The algorithm performances are compared by simulating
them in ns2. Tcl is used to conduct the simulations, while perl is used to
extract data from the simulation output and calculate convergence time. The
design of the experiments carried on is documented using Unified modeling
Language. Also, a user interface is created using perl, which enables the user
to either run a desired simulation and measure convergence time, or measure the
convergence time of a simulation that has been run earlier.
