We recently suggested that the Scissors Mode (a collective excitation in
which one system rotates with respect another one conserving its shape) can
occur in crystals with axially symmetric atoms as a precession of these atoms
around the anisotropy axis of their cells, giving rise to a form of dichroism.
In the present paper we investigate how the Scissors Mode can be realized in
crystals with cubic symmetry and evaluate its photo-absorption cross-section.
This turns out to be of the same order of magnitude as that for crystals with
axially symmetric atoms, but does not exhibit any correlation between the
direction of the photon and the axes of the cell.
