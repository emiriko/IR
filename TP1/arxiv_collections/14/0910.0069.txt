We characterize the law of the partition function of a Brownian directed
polymer model in terms of a diffusion process associated with the quantum Toda
lattice. The proof is via a multidimensional generalization of a theorem of
Matsumoto and Yor concerning exponential functionals of Brownian motion. It is
based on a mapping which can be regarded as a geometric variant of the RSK
correspondence.
