In the last decades electroweak processes were studied at hadron and lepton
colliders. By exploiting the large statistics and the c.o.m. energy available,
hadron colliders played a significant role in performing precision measurements
of standard model parameters and in observing rare processes. Besides, in the
last decade of the XX century, the last fermion predicted -the top quark- was
discovered at the Tevatron collider. We are now at the start of a new hadron
collider, the LHC, and in this paper, I will review recent results from the
Tevatron and compare perspectives for experiment taking data at the two
accelerators
