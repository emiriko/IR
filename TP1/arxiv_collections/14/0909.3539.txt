Using terahertz time domain spectroscopy we investigate the normal incidence
transmission through periodically and randomly arranged planar split ring
resonators (SRRs). Introduction of positional disorder in metamaterials has no
effect on the quality factor of the fundamental Inductive-Capacitive (LC)
resonance. The dipole resonances undergo broadening and shift in their
resonance frequencies. The experiment reveals that the randomly distributed SRR
structures interact incoherently at LC resonance but couple coherently at the
higher frequency dipole resonance.
