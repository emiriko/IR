We compare observations of the non-flaring solar corona made simultaneously
with Hinode/XRT and with RHESSI. The analyzed corona is dominated by a single
active region on 12 November 2006. The comparison is made on emission measures.
We derive emission measure distributions vs temperature of the entire active
region from multifilter XRT data. We check the compatibility with the total
emission measure values estimated from the flux measured with RHESSI if the
emission come from isothermal plasma. We find that RHESSI and XRT data analyses
consistently point to the presence of a minor emission measure component
peaking at log T ~ 6.8-6.9. The discrepancy between XRT and RHESSI results is
within a factor of a few and indicates an acceptable level of
cross-consistency.
