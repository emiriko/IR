We investigate indirect neutrino signals from annihilations of Kaluza-Klein
dark matter in the Sun. Especially, we examine a five- as well as a
six-dimensional model, and allow for the possibility that boundary localized
terms could affect the spectrum to give different lightest Kaluza-Klein
particles, which could constitute the dark matter. The dark matter candidates
that are interesting for the purpose of indirect detection of neutrinos are the
first Kaluza-Klein mode of the U(1) gauge boson and the neutral component of
the SU(2) gauge bosons. Using the DarkSUSY and WimpSim packages, we calculate
muon fluxes at an Earth-based neutrino telescope, such as IceCube. For the
five-dimensional model, the results that we obtained agree reasonably well with
the results that have previously been presented in the literature, whereas for
the six-dimensional model, we find that, at tree-level, the results are the
same as for the five-dimensional model. Finally, if the first Kaluza-Klein mode
of the U(1) gauge boson constitutes the dark matter, IceCube can constrain the
parameter space. However, in the case that the neutral component of the SU(2)
gauge bosons is the LKP, the signal is too weak to be observed.
