A brief historical synopsis of the connection between gauge theories and
string theory is given. Meson configurations known as k-strings are examined
from string theory via the gauge/gravity correspondence. Backgrounds dual to
k-strings in both 2+1 and 3+1 are discussed. The energy of k-strings to lowest
order consists of a tension term, proportional to the length, L, of the
k-string, i.e., the size of the mesons in the configuration. The first quantum
correction is a Coulombic 1/L correction, known as a Luscher term, plus a
constant. Acquiring tensions and Luscher terms via the gauge/gravity
correspondence is discussed.
