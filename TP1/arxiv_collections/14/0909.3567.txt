We examine the algebraic complete integrability of Lotka-Volterra equations
in three dimensions. We restrict our attention to Lotka-Volterra systems
defined by a skew symmetric matrix. We obtain a complete classification of such
systems. The classification is obtained using Painleve analysis and more
specifically by the use of Kowalevski exponents. The imposition of certain
integrality conditions on the Kowalevski exponents gives necessary conditions
for the algebraic integrability of the corresponding systems. We also show that
the conditions are sufficient.
