Currently, superconductor digital integrated circuits fabricated at HYPRES,
Inc. can operate at clock frequencies of ~ 40 GHz. The circuits present
multilayered structures containing tens of thousands of Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb Josephson
junctions (JJs) of various sizes interconnected by four Nb wiring layers,
resistors, and other circuit elements. In order to be operational, the
integrated circuits should be fabricated such that the critical currents of
Josephson junctions remain within the tight design margins and the proper
relationships between the critical currents of JJs of different sizes are
preserved. We present experimental data and discuss mechanisms of
process-induced variations of the critical current and energy gap of
Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb Josephson junctions in integrated circuits. We demonstrate that
the Josephson critical current may depend on the type and area of circuit
elements connected to the junction, on the circuit pattern, and on the step in
the fabrication process at which the connection is made. In particular, we
discuss the influence of a) junction base electrode connection to ground plane,
b) junction counter electrode connection to ground plane, and c) counter
electrode connection to Ti/Au or Ti/Pd/Au contact pads by Nb wiring. We show
that the process-induced changes of the properties of Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb junctions
are caused by migration of impurity atoms (hydrogen) between different layers
comprising the integrated circuits.
