This paper is a short introduction to cold atom physics and Bose-Einstein
condensation. Light forces on atoms are presented, together with laser cooling,
and a few atom traps: the magneto-optical trap, dipole traps and magnetic
traps. A brief description of Bose-Einstein condensation is given together with
some important links with condensed matter physics. The reader is referred to
comprehensive reviews and to other lecture notes for further details on atom
cooling, trapping and Bose-Einstein condensation.
