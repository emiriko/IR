The results from Suzaku observations of the central region of the Perseus
cluster are presented. Deep exposures with the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer
provide high quality X-ray spectra from the intracluster medium. X-ray lines
from helium-like Cr and Mn have been detected significantly for the first time
in clusters. In addition, elemental abundances of Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe,
and Ni are accurately measured within 10' (or 220 kpc) from the cluster center.
The relative abundance ratios are found to be within a range of 0.8-1.5 times
the solar value. These abundance ratios are compared with previous
measurements, those in extremely metal-poor stars in the Galaxy, and
theoretical models.
