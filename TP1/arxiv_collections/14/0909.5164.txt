The dynamical equation satisfied by the density matrix, when a quantum system
is subjected to one or more constraints arising from conserved quantities, is
derived. The resulting nonlinear motion of the density matrix has the property
that the evolution is independent of the specific composition of the pure-state
mixture generating the initial state of the system.
