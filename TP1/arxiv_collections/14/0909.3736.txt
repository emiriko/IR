Nanotransistors typically operate in far-from-equilibrium (FFE) conditions,
that cannot be described neither by drift-diffusion, nor by purely ballistic
models. In carbonbased nanotransistors, source and drain contacts are often
characterized by the formation of Schottky Barriers (SBs), with strong
influence on transport. Here we present a model for onedimensional field-effect
transistors (FETs), taking into account on equal footing both SB contacts and
FFE transport regime. Intermediate transport is introduced within the Buttiker
probe approach to dissipative transport, in which a non-ballistic transistor is
seen as a suitable series of individually ballistic channels. Our model permits
the study of the interplay of SBs and ambipolar FFE transport, and in
particular of the transition between SB-limited and dissipation-limited
transport.
