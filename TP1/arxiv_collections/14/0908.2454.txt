Cataclysmic cosmic events can be plausible sources of both gravitational
waves (GW) and high-energy neutrinos (HEN). Both GW and HEN are alternative
cosmic messengers that may escape very dense media and travel unaffected over
cosmological distances, carrying information from the innermost regions of the
astrophysical engines. For the same reasons, such messengers could also reveal
new, hidden sources that were not observed by conventional photon astronomy.
  Requiring the consistency between GW and HEN detection channels shall enable
new searches as one has significant additional information about the common
source. A neutrino telescope such as ANTARES can determine accurately the time
and direction of high energy neutrino events, while a network of gravitational
wave detectors such as LIGO and VIRGO can also provide timing/directional
information for gravitational wave bursts. By combining the information from
these totally independent detectors, one can search for cosmic events that may
arrive from common astrophysical sources.
