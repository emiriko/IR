LV4O8 (L = Yb, Y, Lu) compounds are reported to crystallize in a structure
similar to that of the orthorhombic CaFe2O4 structure-type, and contain four
inequivalent V sites arranged in zigzag chains. We confirm the structure and
report the magnetic, thermal, and transport properties of polycrystalline YV4O8
and LuV4O8. A first-order like phase transition is observed at 50 K in both
YV4O8 and LuV4O8. The symmetry remains the same with the lattice parameters
changing discontinously. The structural transition in YV4O8 leads to partial
dimerization of the V atoms resulting in a sudden sharp drop in the magnetic
susceptibility. The V spins that do not form dimers order in a canted
antiferromagnetic state. The magnetic susceptibility of LuV4O8 shows a sharp
peak at ~ 50 K. The magnetic entropies calculated from heat capacity versus
temperature measurements indicate bulk magnetic transitions below 90 K for both
YV4O8 and LuV4O8.
