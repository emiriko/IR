Based on our "finance-prediction-oriented" methodology which involves such
elements as log-periodic self-similarity, the universal preferred scaling
factor lambda=2, and allows a phenomenon of the "super-bubble" we analyze the
2009 world stock market (here represented by the SP500, Hang Seng and WIG)
development. We identify elements that indicate the third decade of September
2009 as a time limit for the present bull market phase which is thus to be
followed by a significant correction. In this context we also interpret the
Chinese stock market index SSE.
  The third decade of September 2009 was accompanied with a stock market
correction typically within the range of 4-5% worldwide. Taking into account
the market patterns that followed the time of delivering the previous scenario
we present an updated scenario whose critical time corresponds to October 28,
2009.
  Assuming quite evident (as of November 12, 2009) termination of the
correction due to the above critical time we extend - consistently with our
methodology - the stock market forecasting scenario. The corresponding expected
SP500 future trend is shown in Fig. 5 and it supports a potential average
continuation of increases to as far into the future as the turn of
February/March 2010. We also indicate the log-periodic patterns on the gold
market and they point to the end of November 2009 as the time when the trend
reversal - likely local however - is expected to begin.
