Assuming the Higgs triplet model, we obtain the bounds on the absolute
neutrino mass and the unknown MNS parameters by measuring decay processes of
doubly charged particles at the CERN LHC. Majorana CP violating phases affect
the prediction rather seriously, which is served to restrict these phases.
