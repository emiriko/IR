In the context of star and planet formation, understanding the formation of
disks is of fundamental importance. Previous studies found that the magnetic
field has a very strong impact on the collapse of a prestellar cloud,
particularly in possibly suppressing the formation of a disk even for
relatively modest values of the magnetic intensity. Since observations infer
that cores have a substantial level of magnetization, this raises the question
of how disks form. However, most studies have been restricted to the case in
which the initial angle, $\alpha$, between the magnetic field and the rotation
axis equals 0$^\circ$. We explore and analyse the influence of non aligned
configurations on disk formation. We perform 3D ideal MHD, AMR numerical
simulations for various values of $\mu$, the ratio of the mass-to-flux to the
critical mass-to-flux, and various values of $\alpha$. We find that disks form
more easily as $\alpha$ increases from 0 to 90$^\circ$. We propose that as the
magnetized pseudo-disks become thicker with increasing $\alpha$, the magnetic
braking efficiency is lowered. We also find that even small values of $\alpha$
($\simeq$ 10-20$^\circ$) show significant differences with the alligned case.
Within the framework of ideal MHD and for our choice of initial conditions,
centrifugally supported disks cannot form for values of $\mu$ smaller than
$\simeq$3, if the magnetic field and the rotation axis are perpendicular, and
smaller than about $\simeq$5-10 when they are perfectly aligned.
