The NA62 experiment at CERN collected a large sample of $K^+\to e^+\nu$
decays during a dedicated run in 2007, which allows a precise test of lepton
universality by measurement of the helicity suppressed ratio $R_K =
\Gamma(K^+\to e^+\nu)/\Gamma(K^+\to\mu^+\nu)$. The preliminary result of the
analysis of a partial data sample of 51089 $K^+\to e^+\nu$ candidates is
$R_K=(2.500\pm0.016)\times10^{-5}$, consistent with the Standard Model
expectation.
