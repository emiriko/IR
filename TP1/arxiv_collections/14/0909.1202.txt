It has been proposed that on (anti)-de Sitter background, the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle should be modified by the introduction of a term
proportional to the cosmological constant. We show that this modification of
the uncertainty principle can be derived straightforwardly from the geometric
properties of (anti)-de Sitter spacetime. We also discuss the connection
between the so-called extended generalized uncertainty principle and triply
special relativity.
