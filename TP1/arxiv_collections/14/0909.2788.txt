We propose a new scaling theory for general quantum breakdown phenomena. We
show, taking Landau-Zener type breakdown as a particular example, that the
breakdown phenomena can be viewed as a quantum phase transition for which the
scaling theory is developed. The application of this new scaling theory to
Zener type breakdown in Anderson insulators, and quantum quenching has been
discussed.
