We study the compact binary population in star clusters, focusing on binaries
containing black holes, using a self-consistent Monte Carlo treatment of
dynamics and full stellar evolution. We find that the black holes experience
strong mass segregation and become centrally concentrated. In the core the
black holes interact strongly with each other and black hole-black hole
binaries are formed very efficiently. The strong interactions, however, also
destroy or eject the black hole-black hole binaries. We find no black
hole-black hole mergers within our simulations but produce many hard escapers
that will merge in the galactic field within a Hubble time. We also find
several highly eccentric black hole-black hole binaries that are potential LISA
sources, suggesting that star clusters are interesting targets for space-based
detectors. We conclude that star clusters must be taken into account when
predicting compact binary population statistics.
