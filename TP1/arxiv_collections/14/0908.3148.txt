The term quantum neural computing indicates a unity in the functioning of the
brain. It assumes that the neural structures perform classical processing and
that the virtual particles associated with the dynamical states of the
structures define the underlying quantum state. We revisit the concept and also
summarize new arguments related to the learning modes of the brain in response
to sensory input that may be aggregated in three types: associative,
reorganizational, and quantum. The associative and reorganizational types are
quite apparent based on experimental findings; it is much harder to establish
that the brain as an entity exhibits quantum properties. We argue that the
reorganizational behavior of the brain may be viewed as inner adjustment
corresponding to its quantum behavior at the system level. Not only neural
structures but their higher abstractions also may be seen as whole entities. We
consider the dualities associated with the behavior of the brain and how these
dualities are bridged.
