The study examined the relationship between Java programming self-efficacy
and programming background of engineering students in a Nigerian University.
One hundred and ninety two final year engineering students randomly selected
from six engineering departments of the university participated in the study.
Two research instruments: Programming Background Questionnaire and Java
Programming Self-Efficacy Scale were used in collecting relevant information
from the subjects. The resulting data were analyzed using Pearson product
correlation and Multiple regression analysis. Findings revealed that Java
Programming self-efficacy has no significant relationship with each of the
computing and programming background factors. It was additionally obtained that
the number of programming courses offered and programming courses weighed
scores were the only predictors of Java self-efficacy.
