UCoGe is one of the few compounds showing the coexistence of ferromagnetism
and superconductivity at ambient pressure. With T_Curie = 3 K and T_SC = 0.6 K
it is near a quantum phase transition; the pressure needed to suppress the
magnetism is slightly higher than 1 GPa. We report simultaneous resistivity and
ac-susceptibility measurements under pressure on a polycrystal with very large
single-crystalline domains and a resistivity ratio of about 6. Both methods
confirm the phase diagram established before by resistivity measurements on a
polycrystal. The ferromagnetic phase is suppressed for P approximately 1.2 GPa.
Astonishingly, the superconductivity persists at pressures up to at least 2.4
GPa. In other superconducting and ferromagnetic heavy fermion compounds like
UGe2 and URhGe, the superconducting state is situated only inside the larger
ferromagnetic region. Therefore, UCoGe seems to be the first example where
superconductivity extends from the ferromagnetic to the paramagnetic region.
