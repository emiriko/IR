We developed a new technique for registration of the far solar corona from
ground-based observations at distances comparable to those obtained from space
coronagraphs. It makes possible visualization of fine details of studied
objects invisible by naked eye. Here we demonstrate that streamers of the
electron corona sometimes punch the dust corona and that the shape of the dust
corona may vary with time. We obtained several experimental evidences that the
far coronal streamers (observed directly only from the space or stratosphere)
emit only in discrete regions of the visible spectrum like resonance
fluorescence of molecules and ions in comets. We found that interaction of the
coronal streamers with the dust corona can produce molecules and radicals,
which are known to cause the resonance fluorescence in comets.
