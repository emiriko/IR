The excitation function for the $pp\to ppK^+K^-$ reaction revealed a
significant enhancement close to threshold which may plausibly be assigned to
the influence of the $pK^-$ and $K^+K^-$ final state interactions. In an
improved reanalysis of COSY-11 data for the $pp\to ppK^+K^-$ reaction at excess
energies of Q = 10 MeV and 28 MeV including the proton-K- interaction the
enhancement is confirmed. Invariant mass distributions for the two- and
three-particle subsystems allow to test at low excess energies the ansatz and
parameters for the description of the interaction in the ppK+K- system as
derived from the COSY-ANKE data. Finally, based for the first time on the low
energy K+K- invariant mass distributions and the generalized Dalitz plot
analysis, we estimate the scattering length for the K+K- interaction to be
|Re(a_K^+K^-)| = 0.5 + 4.0 -0.5 fm and Im(a_K^+K^-) = 3.0 +- 3.0 fm.
