The unquenched quark models predict the new particle $\Sigma^*$ with spin
parity $J^P=1/2^-$ and its mass is around the well established $\Sigma^*(1385)$
with $J^P=3/2^+$. Here by using the effective Lagrangian approach we study \kp\
reaction at the range of $\Lambda^{*}(1520)$ peak, comparing the resulting
total cross section, and $\pi^+\pi^-$, $\Lambda\pi^+$, $\Lambda\pi^-$ invariant
squared mass distributions for various incident $K^-$ momenta, as well as the
production angular distribution of the $\Lambda$ with the data from the
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory 25-inch hydrogen bubble chamber, we find that,
apart from the existing resonance $\Sigma^{*}(1385)$ with $J^P=3/2^+$, there is
a strong evidence for the existence of the new resonance $\Sigma^{*}$ with
$J^P=1/2^-$ around 1380 MeV. Higher statistic data on relevant reactions are
needed to clarify the situation.
