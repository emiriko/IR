I present results for two-loop soft anomalous dimensions, which are derived
from dimensionally regularized diagrams with eikonal quark lines and control
soft-gluon emission in hard-scattering processes. Detailed results for the UV
poles of the eikonal integrals are shown for massive quarks, and the massless
limit is also taken. The construction of soft anomalous dimensions at two-loops
allows soft-gluon resummations at NNLL accuracy.
