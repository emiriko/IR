An accurate description of the nuclear response functions for neutrino
scattering in the Gev region is essential for the interpretation of present and
future neutrino oscillation experiments. Due to the close similarity of
electromagnetic and weak scattering processes, we will review the status of the
scaling approach and of relativistic modeling for the inclusive electron
scattering response functions in the quasielastic and $\Delta$-resonance
regions. In particular, recent studies have been focused on scaling violations
and the degree to which these imply modifications of existing predictions for
neutrino reactions. We will discuss sources and magnitude of such violations,
emphasizing similarities and differences between electron and neutrino
reactions.
