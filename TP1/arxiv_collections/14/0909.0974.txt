We present an alternative organizational scheme for developing effective
theories of 2- and 3-body systems that is systematic, accurate, and efficient
with controlled errors. To illustrate our approach we consider the bound state
and scattering properties of the 2- and 3-nucleon systems. Our approach
combines the computational benefits of using separable potentials with the
improved convergence properties of potentials evolved with a renormalization
group procedure. Long ago Harms showed that any potential can be expanded in a
series of separable terms, but this fact is only useful if the expansion can be
truncated at low order. The separable expansion provides an attractive
organizational scheme that incorporates the two body bound state in the leading
term while allowing for systematic corrections thereafter. We show that when
applied to a renormalization group-evolved potential, the separable expansion
converges rapidly, with accurate results for both 2- and 3-body scattering
processes using only two separable terms.
