Spectra of the He I 10830 Angstrom line were obtained with NIRSPEC on the
Keck 2 telescope for metal-deficient field giant stars. This line is ubiquitous
in stars with T_eff greater than 4500K and M_V fainter than -1.5. Fast outflows
are detected from the majority of stars and about 40 percent of the outflows
have sufficient speed to allow escape of material from the star as well as from
a globular cluster. Outflow speeds and line strengths do not depend on
metallicity suggesting the driving mechanism for these winds derives from
magnetic and/or hydrodynamic processes. Gas outflows are present in every
luminous giant, but are not detected in all stars of lower luminosity
indicating possible variability. Mass loss rates ranging from 3X10(-10) to
6X10(-8) solar mass/yr estimated from the Sobolev approximation represent
values with evolutionary significance for red giant branch (RGB) and red
horizontal branch (RHB) stars. We estimate that 0.2 M_sun will be lost on the
RGB, and the torque of this wind can account for observations of slowly
rotating RHB stars in the field. About 0.1-0.2 M_sun will be lost on the RHB
itself. This first empirical determination of mass loss on the RHB may
contribute to the appearance of extended horizontal branches in globular
clusters. The spectra appear to resolve the problem of missing intracluster
material in globular clusters. Opportunities exist for 'wind smothering' of
dwarf stars by winds from the evolved population, possibly leading to surface
pollution in regions of high stellar density.
