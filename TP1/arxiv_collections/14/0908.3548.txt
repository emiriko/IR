We analyze the strength of polarization correlations between two light beams
that can be achieved in the semiclassical regime using statistical mixtures of
coherent states and binary on/off detectors. Under certain symmetry
assumptions, the visibility of polarization correlations is shown to be bounded
by 1/3, which is in a striking contrast with perfect 100% correlations
exhibited by photon pairs prepared in the singlet state. The semiclassical
limit is demonstrated in a measurement performed on a pair of laser beams
undergoing correlated depolarization. This result illustrates the dramatic
difference between predictions of quantum mechanics and the semiclassical
theory of electromagnetic radiation for the polarization degree of freedom.
