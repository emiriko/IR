The NASA Kepler mission is designed to find planets through transits.
Accurate and precise radii of the detected planets depend on knowing the radius
of the host star accurately, which is difficult unless the temperature and
luminosity of the star are known precisely. Kepler, however, has an
asteroseismology programme that will provide seismic variables that can
characterise stellar radii easily, accurately, and extremely precisely. In this
paper we describe the Yale-Birmingham (YB) method to determine stellar radii
using a combination of seismic and conventional variables, and analyse the
effect of these variables on the result. We find that for main-sequence stars,
a knowledge of the parallax is not important to get accurate radii using the YB
method: we can get results to an accuracy and precision of better than a few
percent if we know the effective temperature and the seismic parameters for
these stars. Metallicity does not make much difference either. However, good
estimates of the effective temperature and metallicity, along with those of the
seismic parameters, are essential to determine radii of sub giants properly. On
the other hand, for red giants we find that determining radii properly is not
possible without a good estimate of the parallax. We find that the so called
"surface term" in the seismic data has minimal effect on the inferred radii.
Uncertainties in the convective mixing length can matter under some
circumstances and can cause a systematic shift in the inferred radii. Blind
tests with data simulated to match those expected from the asteroseismic Survey
Phase of Kepler show that it will be possible to infer stellar radii
successfully using our method.
