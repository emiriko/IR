I discuss recent applications of QCD light-cone sum rules to various form
factors of pseudoscalar mesons. In this approach both soft and hard
contributions to the form factors are taken into account. Combining QCD
calculation with the analyticity of the form factors, one enlarges the region
of accessible momentum transfers.
