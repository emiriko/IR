Researchers got success in mining the Web usage data effectively and
efficiently. But representation of the mined patterns is often not in a form
suitable for direct human consumption. Hence mechanisms and tools that can
represent mined patterns in easily understandable format are utilized.
Different techniques are used for pattern analysis, one of them is
visualization. Visualization can provide valuable assistance for data analysis
and decision making tasks. In the data visualization process, technical
representations of web pages are replaced by user attractive text
interpretations. Experiments with the real world problems showed that the
visualization can significantly increase the quality and usefulness of web log
mining results. However, how decision makers perceive and interact with a
visual representation can strongly influence their understanding of the data as
well as the usefulness of the visual presentation. Human factors therefore
contribute significantly to the visualization process and should play an
important role in the design and evaluation of visualization tools. This
