In the Collider Detector at Fermilab, CDF, we have measured central exclusive
production, p+pbar --> p+X+pbar, where X is a pair of leptons or photons and
nothing else. In this talk I focus on central masses M(X) > 8 GeV/c2. We
measured QED production photon+photon --> e+e-,mu+mu- up to M(l+l-) = 75
GeV/c2, and candidates for photoproduction of Upsilons, photon+pomeron -->
Y(1S),Y(2S),Y(3S). I report a search for exclusive photoproduction of Z-bosons,
and the status of searches for exclusive two-photons: p+pbar -->
p+gamma+gamma+pbar. These measurements constrain the cross section sigma(p+p to
p+H+p) at the LHC.
