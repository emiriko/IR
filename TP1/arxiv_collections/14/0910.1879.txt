We present novel techniques for analyzing the problem of low-rank matrix
recovery. The methods are both considerably simpler and more general than
previous approaches. It is shown that an unknown (n x n) matrix of rank r can
be efficiently reconstructed from only O(n r nu log^2 n) randomly sampled
expansion coefficients with respect to any given matrix basis. The number nu
quantifies the "degree of incoherence" between the unknown matrix and the
basis. Existing work concentrated mostly on the problem of "matrix completion"
where one aims to recover a low-rank matrix from randomly selected matrix
elements. Our result covers this situation as a special case. The proof
consists of a series of relatively elementary steps, which stands in contrast
to the highly involved methods previously employed to obtain comparable
results. In cases where bounds had been known before, our estimates are
slightly tighter. We discuss operator bases which are incoherent to all
low-rank matrices simultaneously. For these bases, we show that O(n r nu log n)
randomly sampled expansion coefficients suffice to recover any low-rank matrix
with high probability. The latter bound is tight up to multiplicative
constants.
