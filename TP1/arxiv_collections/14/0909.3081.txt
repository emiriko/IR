Grand Unified Theories based on an E6 gauge group embed all Higgs- and matter
fields within one 27 dimensional fundamental representation. In addition each
27 contains a right handed neutrino, an NMSSM-like standard model singlet and a
pair of exotic particles, that couple quarks to leptons. The extended particle
content spoils simple gauge unification as in the MSSM. By embedding the SM
into a Pati-Salam gauge group above 10^16 GeV, one obtains a unification below
the Planck-scale. We present a Markov chain Monte-Carlo algorithm to
systematically scan the high dimensional parameter space and calculate
low-energy spectra, as well as first results of our studies of the LHC
phenomenology of leptoquarks and leptoquarkinos with the event generator
WHIZARD.
