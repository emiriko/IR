A system of symmetrically coupled identical oscillators with phase lag is
presented, which is capable of generating a large repertoire of transient
(metastable) "chimera" states in which synchronisation and desynchronisation
co-exist. The oscillators are organised into communities, such that each
oscillator is connected to all its peers in the same community and to a subset
of the oscillators in other communities. Measures are introduced for
quantifying metastability, the prevalence of chimera states, and the variety of
such states a system generates. By simulation, it is shown that each of these
measures is maximised when the phase lag of the model is close, but not equal,
to pi/2. The relevance of the model to a number of fields is briefly discussed,
with particular emphasis on brain dynamics.
