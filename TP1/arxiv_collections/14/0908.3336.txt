We present the results of high precision, high resolution (R~68000) optical
observations of the short-period (4d) eccentric binary system Alpha Virginis
(Spica) showing the photospheric line-profile variability that in this system
can be attributed to non-radial pulsations driven by tidal effects. Although
scant in orbital phase coverage, the data provide S/N>2000 line profiles at
full spectral resolution in the wavelength range delta-lambda = 4000--8500
Angstroms, allowing a detailed study of the night-to-night variability as well
as changes that occur on ~2 hr timescale. Using an ab initio theoretical
calculation, we show that the line-profile variability can arise as a natural
consequence of surface flows that are induced by the tidal interaction.
