Dimension-5 corrections to the gauge kinetic term of Grand Unified Theories
(GUTs) may capture effects of quantum gravity or string compactification. Such
operators modify the usual gauge coupling unification prediction in a
calculable manner. Here we examine SU(5), SO(10), and E(6) GUTs in the light of
all such permitted operators and calculate the impact on the intermediate
scales and the unification programme. We show that in many cases at least one
intermediate scale can be lowered to even 1-10 TeV, where a neutral Z' and
possibly other states are expected.
