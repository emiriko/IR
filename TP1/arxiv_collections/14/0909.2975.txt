Total solar irradiance reconstructed between 1978 and 2003 using solar
surface magnetic field distributions is compared with three composites of total
solar irradiance measurements. A good correspondence is found with the total
solar irradiance composite from PMOD/WRC, with no bias between the three
cycles. The agreement with the other composites (the ACRIM composite, mainly
based on the Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitors I, II & III, and the
IRMB composite from the Institut Royal Meteorologique Belgique) is
significantly poorer. In particular, a secular increase in the irradiance
exhibited by these composites is not present in the reconstructions. Hence any
secular trend in total solar irradiance between 1978 and 2003 is not due to
magnetic fields at the solar surface.
