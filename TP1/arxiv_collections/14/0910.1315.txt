We characterize the quantum gate fidelity in a state-independent manner by
giving an explicit expression for its variance. The method we provide can be
extended to calculate all higher order moments of the gate fidelity. Using
these results we obtain a simple expression for the variance of a single qubit
system and deduce the asymptotic behavior for large-dimensional quantum
systems. Applications of these results to quantum chaos and randomized
benchmarking are discussed.
