The report is dedicated to the preparation of the new experiment on the
neutron radiative decay what is conducted for the last years. We started the
experimental research of this neutron decay branch with the experiment
conducted at ILL in 2002 and continued in another experiment at the second and
third cycles at the FRMII reactor of the Technical University of Munich in
2005. In the first experiment we succeeded in measuring only the upper limit on
the relative intensity (B.R.) of the radiative neutron decay and in the second
we succeeded in discovering events of radiative neutron decay and measure its
B.R.=(3.2+-1.6)10-3 (with C.L.=99.7% and gamma quanta energy over 35 keV). The
obtained average B.R. value was approximately twice the theoretical value
calculated earlier within the framework of the standard electroweak model.
However, due to significant experimental error it would be preliminary to
deduce that based on this finding a deviation from the standard model has been
observed. To prove or disprove the existence of a deviation it is necessary to
conduct a new experiment that would allow to measure the radiative peak in
timing spectra with precision in the order of 1%. By the present time we have
prepared a new experiment the main result of which would be the measurement of
B.R. for the radiative branch of neutron decay with this precision.
