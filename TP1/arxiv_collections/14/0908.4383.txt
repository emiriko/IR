There has been a surge of interest in the subwavelength confinement of the
electromagnetic fields. It is well known that in optics the subwavelength
confinement can be obtained due to surface plasmon (quasielectrostatic)
oscillations. In this paper we propose to realize the subwavelength confinement
in microwaves due to dipolar-mode (quasimagnetostatic) magnon oscillations in
ferrite particles. Our studies of interactions between microwave
electromagnetic fields and small ferrite particles with magnetic-dipolar-mode
(MDM) oscillations show strong localization of electromagnetic energy. MDM
oscillations in a ferrite disk are origins of topological singularities
resulting in Poynting-vector vortices and symmetry breakings of the microwave
near fields. We show that new subwavelength microwave metamaterials can be
realized based on a system of interacting MDM ferrite disks. The volume- and
surface-wave propagation of electromagnetic signals in the proposed dense
metamaterials will be characterized by topological phase variations. The
MDM-particle-metamaterial concept opens a significantly new area of research.
In particular, there is a perspective for creation of engineered
electromagnetic fields with unique symmetry properties.
