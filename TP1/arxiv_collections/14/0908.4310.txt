One of the most important tasks in image processing problem and machine
vision is object recognition, and the success of many proposed methods relies
on a suitable choice of algorithm for the segmentation of an image. This paper
focuses on how to apply texture operators based on the concept of fractal
dimension and cooccurence matrix, to the problem of object recognition and a
new method based on fractal dimension is introduced. Several images, in which
the result of the segmentation can be shown, are used to illustrate the use of
each method and a comparative study of each operator is made.
