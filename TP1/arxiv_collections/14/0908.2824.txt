We analyse a protocol of quantum energy teleportation that transports energy
from the left edge of a linear ion crystal to the right edge by local
operations and classical communication at a speed considerably greater than the
speed of a phonon in the crystal. A probe qubit is strongly coupled with phonon
fluctuation in the ground state for a short time, and it is projectively
measured in order to obtain information about this phonon fluctuation. During
the measurement process, phonons are excited by the time-dependent measurement
interaction, and the energy of the excited phonons must be infused from outside
the system. The obtained information is transferred to the right edge of the
crystal through a classical channel. Even though the phonons excited at the
left edge do not arrive at the right edge at the same time as when the
information arrives at the right edge, we are able to soon extract energy from
the ions at the right edge by using the transferred information. Because the
intermediate ions of the crystal are not excited during the execution of the
protocol, energy is transmitted in the energy transfer channel without heat
generation.
