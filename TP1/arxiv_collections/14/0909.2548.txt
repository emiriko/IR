We demonstrate the newly developed resource for exoplanet researchers - The
Exoplanet Transit Database. This database is designed to be a web application
and it is open for any exoplanet observer. It came on-line in September 2008.
The ETD consists of three individual sections. One serves for predictions of
the transits, the second one for processing and uploading new data from the
observers. We use a simple analytical model of the transit to calculate the
central time of transit, its duration and the depth of the transit. These
values are then plotted into the observed - computed diagrams (O-C), that
represent the last part of the application.
