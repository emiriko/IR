Galaxies moving through the intracluster medium (ICM) of a cluster of
galaxies can lose gas via ram pressure stripping. This stripped gas forms a
tail behind the galaxy which is potentially observable. In this paper, we carry
out hydrodynamical simulations of a galaxy undergoing stripping with a focus on
the gas properties in the wake and their observational signatures. We include
radiative cooling in an adaptive hydrocode in order to investigate the impact
of a clumpy, multi-phase interstellar medium. We find that including cooling
results in a very different morphology for the gas in the tail, with a much
wider range of temperatures and densities. The tail is significantly narrower
in runs with radiative cooling, in agreement with observed wakes. In addition,
we make detailed predictions of H I, Halpha and X-ray emission for the wake,
showing that we generally expect detectable H I and Halpha signatures, but no
observable X-ray emission (at least for our chosen ram-pressure strength and
ICM conditions). We find that the relative strength of the Halpha diagnostic
depends somewhat on our adopted minimum temperature floor (below which we set
cooling to zero to mimic physics processes not included in the simulation).
