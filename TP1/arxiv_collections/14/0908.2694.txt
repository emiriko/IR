Based on the wealth of multiwavelength imaging data from the SDSS, we
investigate whether dwarf and giant early-type galaxies in the Virgo cluster
follow a continuum in their structural parameters and their stellar population
characteristics. More specifically we study the relation between size and
brightness for the galaxies and their color magnitude relation. In both cases,
we find noticeable deviations from a simple joint behavior of dwarfs and
giants. We discuss these findings in the light of the different formation
mechanisms commonly assumed for dwarf and giant early types, thereby taking
into account the existence of several distinct early-type dwarf subclasses. By
comparing our results to a semianalytic model of galaxy formation, we argue
that the analyzed relations might be reproduced by processes that form dwarfs
and giants altogether. The work presented here is based on Janz & Lisker 2008,
2009.
