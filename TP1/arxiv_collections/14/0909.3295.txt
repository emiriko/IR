We study matrix element fluctuations of the two-body screened Coulomb
interaction and of the one-body surface charge potential in ballistic quantum
dots, comparing behavior in actual chaotic billiards with analytic results
previously obtained in a normalized random wave model. We find that the matrix
element variances in actual chaotic billiards typically exceed by a factor of 3
or 4 the predictions of the random wave model, for dot sizes commonly used in
experiments. We discuss dynamical effects that are responsible for this
enhancement. These dynamical effects have an even more striking effect on the
covariance, which changes sign when compared with random wave predictions. In
billiards that do not display hard chaos, an even larger enhancement of matrix
element fluctuations is possible. These enhanced fluctuations have implications
for peak spacing statistics and spectral scrambling for quantum dots in the
Coulomb blockade regime.
