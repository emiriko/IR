In this article we discuss a data structure, which combines advantages of two
different ways for representing graphs: adjacency matrix and collection of
adjacency lists. This data structure can fast add and search edges (advantages
of adjacency matrix), use linear amount of memory, let to obtain adjacency list
for certain vertex (advantages of collection of adjacency lists). Basic
knowledge of linked lists and hash tables is required to understand this
article. The article contains examples of implementation on Java.
