We discuss recent observations of high energy cosmic ray positrons and
electrons in the context of hadronic interactions in supernova remnants, the
suspected accelerators of galactic cosmic rays. Diffusive shock acceleration
can harden the energy spectrum of secondary positrons relative to that of the
primary protons (and electrons) and thus explain the rise in the positron
fraction observed by PAMELA above 10 GeV. We normalize the hadronic interaction
rate by holding pion decay to be responsible for the gamma-rays detected by
HESS from some SNRs. By simulating the spatial and temporal distribution of
SNRs in the Galaxy according to their known statistics, we are able to then fit
the electron (plus positron) energy spectrum measured by Fermi. It appears that
IceCube has good prospects for detecting the hadronic neutrino fluxes expected
from nearby SNRs.
