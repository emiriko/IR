We are concerned with the uniqueness of the asymptotic behavior of strong
solutions of the initial-boundary value problem for general semilinear
parabolic equations by the asymptotic behavior of these strong solutions on a
finite set of an entire domain. More precisely, if the asymptotic behavior of a
strong solution is known on an appropriate finite set, then the asymptotic
behavior of a strong solution itself is entirely determined in a domain. We
prove the above property by the energy method.
