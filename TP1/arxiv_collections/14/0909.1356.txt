We show that two almost degenerate poles near the $\pi\Delta$ threshold and
the next higher mass pole in the $P_{11}$ partial wave of $\pi N$ scattering
evolve from a single bare state through its coupling with $\pi N$, $\eta N$ and
$\pi\pi N$ reaction channels. This finding provides new information on
understanding the dynamical origins of the Roper $N^*(1440)$ and $N^*(1710)$
resonances listed by Particle Data Group. Our results for the resonance poles
in other $\pi N$ partial waves are also presented.
