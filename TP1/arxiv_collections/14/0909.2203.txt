This article begins with a review of quantum measure spaces. Quantum forms
and indefinite inner-product spaces are then discussed. The main part of the
paper introduces a quantum integral and derives some of its properties. The
quantum integral's form for simple functions is characterized and it is shown
that the quantum integral generalizes the Lebesgue integral. A bounded,
monotone convergence theorem for quantum integrals is obtained and it is shown
that a Radon-Nikodym type theorem does not hold for quantum measures. As an
example, a quantum-Lebesgue integral on the real line is considered.
