The evolutionary stage of the delta Scuti star 44 Tau has been unclear.
Recent pulsation studies have claimed both main sequence and post-main sequence
expansion models. A new photometric study increased the number of detected
frequencies in 44 Tau to 49, of which 15 are independent modes. We now find
that a previously ignored third possibility, the post-main sequence contraction
phase, is in excellent agreement with the observed frequency range, as well as
the frequency values of all individual radial and nonradial modes. These
results resolve the previous disagreements in the literature and exemplify that
asteroseismology can determine the evolutionary status of a star.
