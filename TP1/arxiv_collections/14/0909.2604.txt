The bipolarity of Supernova 1987A can be understood in terms of its very
early light curve as observed from the CTIO 0.4-m telescope, as well as the IUE
FES, and the slightly later speckle observations of the "Mystery Spot" by two
groups. These observations imply a highly directional beam of light and jet of
particles, with initial collimation factors in excess of 10,000, velocities in
excess of 0.95 c, as an impulsive event involving up to 0.00001 solar masses,
which interacts with circumstellar material. The jet and beam coincide with the
194 degree angle of the bipolarity on the sky, and are oriented at 75 degrees
to the line of sight to the Earth. By day 30 the collimation of the jet
decreases, and its velocity declines to ~0.5 c. These observations and the
resulting kinematic solution can be understood in terms of pulsar emission from
polarization currents, induced by the periodically modulated electromagnetic
field beyond the pulsar light cylinder, which are thus modulated at up to many
times the speed of light. With plasma available at many times the light
cylinder radius, as would be the case for a spinning neutron star formed at the
center of its progenitor, pulsed emission is directed close to the rotation
axis, eviscerating this progenitor, and continuing for months to years, until
very little circumpulsar material remains. This model provides a candidate for
the central engine of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) mechanism, both long and short,
and predicts that GRB afterglows are the_pulsed_ optical/near infrared emission
associated with these newly-born neutron stars.
