We investigate the polarization transfer coefficients C_(x,z) for the gamma p
-> K^+ Lambda(1520,3/2^-) reaction process, in which the photon is polarized
circularly and the Lambda(1520,3/2^-) along the x- or z-axis. To this end, we
employ the effective Lagrangian method at tree level and the gauge-invariant
form factor scheme. In addition to the Born terms, (s,u,t_K,t_K^*)-channels and
contact term, we include the nucleon resonance D_{13}(2080) in the s-channel.
We compute the C_(x,z) as functions of theta_K as well as E_cm. It turns out
that the K^*-exchange and D_{13} contributions are negligible within available
experimental and theoretical inputs for them. In contrast, we observe that the
contact and K-exchange contributions play dominant roles for determining the
C_(x,z). Especially, the $K$-exchange enhances the transverse polarization
transfer C_x considerably.
