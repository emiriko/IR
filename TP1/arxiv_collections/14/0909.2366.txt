Important document are being kept encrypted in remote servers. In order to
retrieve these encrypted data, efficient search methods needed to enable the
retrieval of the document without knowing the content of the documents In this
paper a technique called a global heuristic search on encrypted data (GHSED)
technique will be described for search in an encrypted files using public key
encryption stored on an untrusted server and retrieve the files that satisfy a
certain search pattern without revealing any information about the original
files. GHSED technique would satisfy the following: (1) Provably secure, the
untrusted server cannot learn anything about the plaintext given only the
cipher text. (2) Provide controlled searching, so that the untrusted server
cannot search for a word without the user's authorization. (3) Support hidden
queries, so that the user may ask the untrusted server to search for a secret
word without revealing the word to the server. (4) Support query isolation, so
the untrusted server learns nothing more than the search result about the
plaintext.
