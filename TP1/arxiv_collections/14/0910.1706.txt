We correct a sign in the first variation of the on-shell action of
cosmological topologically massive gravity at the chiral point and present the
three equations affected by that sign. While this does not change any of the
main conclusions of arXiv:0805.2610, it modifies the finite part of the
Brown-York stress tensor. Our corrected Brown-York stress tensor is still
finite, conserved and traceless, but no longer coincides with that of global
AdS_3. It agrees with results found in recent literature.
