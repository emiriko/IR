The level density and gamma-ray strength function of 45Ti have been
determined by use of the Oslo method. The particle-gamma coincidences from the
46Ti(p,d gamma)45Ti pick-up reaction with 32 MeV protons are utilized to obtain
gamma-ray spectra as function of excitation energy. The extracted level density
and strength function are compared with models, which are found to describe
these quantities satisfactorily. The data do not reveal any single-particle
energy gaps of the underlying doubly magic 40Ca core, probably due to the
strong quadruple deformation.
