Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations including an on-site
Hubbard $U$ term we investigate the effect of substrate-induced strain on the
properties of ferrimagnetic Fe$_2$O$_3$-FeTiO$_3$ solid solutions and
heterostructures. While the charge compensation mechanism through formation of
a mixed \fetw, \feth-contact layer is unaffected, strain can be used to tune
the electronic properties of the system, e.g. by changing the position of
impurity levels in the band gap. Straining hematite/ilmenite films at the
lateral parameters of Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$(0001), commonly used as a substrate, is
found to be energetically unfavorable as compared to films on
Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$(0001) or FeTiO$_{3}$(0001)-substrates.
