Accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are implemented to model the
sliding process of AFM experiments at speeds close to those found in
experiment. In this study the hyperdynamics method, originally devised to
extend MD time scales for non-driven systems, is applied to the frictional
sliding system. This technique is combined with a parallel algorithm that
simultaneously simulates the system over a range of slider positions. The new
methodologies are tested using 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional Lennard-Jones
AFM models. Direct comparison with the results from conventional MD shows close
agreement validating the methods.
