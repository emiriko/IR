Parameters of magnetic flux distribution inside low-latitude coronal holes
(CHs) were analyzed. A statistical study of 44 CHs based on Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)/MDI full disk magnetograms and SOHO/EIT 284\AA
images showed that the density of the net magnetic flux, $B_{{\rm net}}$, does
not correlate with the associated solar wind speeds, $V_x$. Both the area and
net flux of CHs correlate with the solar wind speed and the corresponding
spatial Pearson correlation coefficients are 0.75 and 0.71, respectively. A
possible explanation for the low correlation between $B_{{\rm net}}$ and $V_x$
is proposed. The observed non-correlation might be rooted in the structural
complexity of the magnetic field. As a measure of complexity of the magnetic
field, the filling factor, $ f(r)$, was calculated as a function of spatial
scales. In CHs, $f(r)$ was found to be nearly constant at scales above 2 Mm,
which indicates a monofractal structural organization and smooth temporal
evolution. The magnitude of the filling factor is 0.04 from the Hinode SOT/SP
data and 0.07 from the MDI/HR data. The Hinode data show that at scales smaller
than 2 Mm, the filling factor decreases rapidly, which means a mutlifractal
structure and highly intermittent, burst-like energy release regime. The
absence of necessary complexity in CH magnetic fields at scales above 2 Mm
seems to be the most plausible reason why the net magnetic flux density does
not seem to be related to the solar wind speed: the energy release dynamics,
needed for solar wind acceleration, appears to occur at small scales below 1
Mm.
