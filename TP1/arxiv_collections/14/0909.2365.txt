A foundation for closing the gap between biometrics in the narrower and the
broader perspective is presented trough a conceptualization of biometric
systems in both perspectives. A clear distinction between verification,
identification and classification systems is made as well as shown that there
are additional classes of biometric systems. In the end a Unified Modeling
Language model is developed showing the connections between the two
perspectives.
