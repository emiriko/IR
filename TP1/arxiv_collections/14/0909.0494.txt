This paper shows that the plane wave expansion can be a useful tool in
obtaining analytical solutions to infinite integrals over spherical Bessel
functions and the derivation of identites for these functions. The integrals
are often used in nuclear scattering calculations, where an analytical result
can provide an insight into the reaction mechanism. A technique is developed
whereby an integral over several special functions which cannot be found in any
standard integral table can be broken down into integrals that have existing
analytical solutions
