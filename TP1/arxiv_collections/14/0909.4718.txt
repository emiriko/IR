We compute the automorphism groups of the Torelli complex and the complex of
separating curves for all but finitely many compact orientable surfaces. As an
application, we show that the abstract commensurators of the Torelli group and
the Johnson kernel for such surfaces are naturally isomorphic to the extended
mapping class group.
