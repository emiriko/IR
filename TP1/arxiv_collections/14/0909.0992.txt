The article [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 73}, 031111 (2006)] by Horowitz and Albano
reports on simulations of competitive surface-growth models RD+X that combine
random deposition (RD) with another deposition X that occurs with probability
$p$. The claim is made that at saturation the surface width $w(p)$ obeys a
power-law scaling $w(p) \propto 1/p^{\delta}$, where $\delta$ is only either
$\delta =1/2$ or $\delta=1$, which is illustrated by the models where X is
ballistic deposition and where X is RD with surface relaxation. Another claim
is that in the limit $p \to 0^+$, for any lattice size $L$, the time evolution
of $w(t)$ generally obeys the scaling $w(p,t) \propto (L^{\alpha}/p^{\delta})
F(p^{2\delta}t/L^z)$, where $F$ is Family-Vicsek universal scaling function. We
show that these claims are incorrect.
