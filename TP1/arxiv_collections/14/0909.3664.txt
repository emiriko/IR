Diagonalizable pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real and discrete spectra,
which are superpartners of Hermitian Hamiltonians, must be
$\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian with Hermitian, positive-definite and non-singular
$\eta$ operators. We show that despite the fact that an $\eta$ operator
produced by a supersymmetric transformation, corresponding to the exact
supersymmetry, is singular, it can be used to find the eigenfunctions of a
Hermitian operator equivalent to the given pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Once
the eigenfunctions of the Hermitian operator are found the operator may be
reconstructed with the help of the spectral decomposition.
