The 14C(alpha,gamma) reaction rate at temperatures below 0.3 GK depends on
the properties of two near threshold resonances in 18O, the 1- at 6.198 MeV and
the 3- at 6.404 MeV. The alpha+14C Asymptotic Normalization Coefficients (ANCs)
for these resonances were determined using the alpha-transfer reactions
14C(7Li,t) and 14C(6Li,d) at sub-Coulomb energies. The 14C(alpha,gamma)
reaction rate at low temperatures has been evaluated. Implications of the new
reaction rate on the evolution of accreting helium white dwarfs and on the
nucleosynthesis of low mass stars during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
phase are discussed.
