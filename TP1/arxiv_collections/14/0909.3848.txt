We present the Suzaku spectroscopic study of the Galactic middle-aged
supernova remnant (SNR) IC 443. The X-ray spectrum in the 1.75-6.0 keV band is
described by an optically-thin thermal plasma with the electron temperature of
0.6 keV and several additional Lyman lines. We robustly detect, for the first
time, strong radiative recombination continua (RRC) of H-like Si and S around
at 2.7 and 3.5 keV. The ionization temperatures of Si and S determined from the
intensity ratios of the RRC to He-like K-alpha line are 1.0 keV and 1.2 keV,
respectively. We thus find firm evidence for an extremely-overionized
(recombining) plasma. As the origin of the overionization, a thermal conduction
scenario argued in previous work is not favored in our new results. We propose
that the highly-ionized gas were made at the initial phase of the SNR evolution
in dense regions around a massive progenitor, and the low electron temperature
is due to a rapid cooling by an adiabatic expansion.
