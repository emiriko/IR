We study coherent pion production in neutrino-nucleus scattering in the
energy region relevant to neutrino oscillation experiments of current interest.
Our approach is based on a combined use of the Sato-Lee model of electroweak
pion production on a nucleon and the Delta-hole model of pion-nucleus
reactions. Thus we develop a model which describes pion-nucleus scattering and
electroweak coherent pion production in a unified manner. Numerical
calculations are carried out for the case of the 12C target. All the free
parameters in our model are fixed by fitting to both total and elastic
differential cross sections for pi-12C scattering. Then we demonstrate the
reliability of our approach by confronting our prediction for the coherent pion
photo-productions with data. Finally, we calculate total and differential cross
sections for neutrino-induced coherent pion production, and some of the results
are (will be) compared with the recent (forthcoming) data from K2K, SciBooNE
and MiniBooNE. We also study effect of the non-locality of the
Delta-propagation in the nucleus, and compare the elementary amplitudes used in
different microscopic calculations.
