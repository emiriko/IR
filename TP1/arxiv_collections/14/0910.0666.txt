We show that the slowing of the dynamics in simulations of several model
glass-forming liquids is equivalent to the hard-sphere glass transition in the
low-pressure limit. In this limit, we find universal behavior of the relaxation
time by collapsing molecular-dynamics data for all systems studied onto a
single curve as a function of $T/p$, the ratio of the temperature to the
pressure. At higher pressures, there are deviations from this universal
behavior that depend on the inter-particle potential, implying that additional
physical processes must enter into the dynamics of glass-formation.
