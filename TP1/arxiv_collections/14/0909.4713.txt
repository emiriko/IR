Klyachko and coworkers consider an orthogonality graph in the form of a
pentagram, and in this way derive a Kochen-Specker inequality for spin 1
systems. In some low-dimensional situations Hilbert spaces are naturally
organised, by a magical choice of basis, into SO(N) orbits. Combining these
ideas some very elegant results emerge. We give a careful discussion of the
pentagram operator, and then show how the pentagram underlies a number of other
quantum "paradoxes", such as that of Hardy.
