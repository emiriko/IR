Composite fermions have played a seminal role in understanding the quantum
Hall effect, particularly the formation of a compressible `composite Fermi
liquid' (CFL) at filling factor nu = 1/2. Here we suggest that in multi-layer
systems interlayer Coulomb repulsion can similarly generate `metallic' behavior
of composite fermions between layers, even if the electrons remain insulating.
Specifically, we propose that a quantum Hall bilayer with nu = 1/2 per layer at
intermediate layer separation may host such an interlayer coherent CFL, driven
by exciton condensation of composite fermions. This phase has a number of
remarkable properties: the presence of `bonding' and `antibonding' composite
Fermi seas, compressible behavior with respect to symmetric currents, and
fractional quantum Hall behavior in the counterflow channel. Quantum
oscillations associated with the Fermi seas give rise to a new series of
incompressible states at fillings nu = p/[2(p \pm 1)] per layer (p an integer),
which is a bilayer analogue of the Jain sequence.
