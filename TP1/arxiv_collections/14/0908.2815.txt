We establish bounds on the energy of a system of N identical bosons bound by
attractive pair potentials and obeying the semirelativistic Salpeter equation.
The lower bound is provided by a `reduction', with the aid of Jacobi relative
coordinates, to a suitably scaled one-body Klein-Gordon problem. Complementary
upper energy bounds are provided by means of a Gaussian trial function.
Detailed results are presented for the exponential pair potential V(r) =
-v\exp(-r/a).
