Gradual changes in exploitation, nutrient loading, etc. produce shifts
between alternative stable states (ASS) in ecosystems which, quite often, are
not smooth but abrupt or catastrophic. Early warnings of such catastrophic
regime shifts are fundamental for designing management protocols for
ecosystems. Here we study the spatial version of a popular ecological model,
involving a logistically growing single species subject to exploitation, which
is known to exhibit ASS. Spatial heterogeneity is introduced by a carrying
capacity parameter varying from cell to cell in a regular lattice. Transport of
biomass among cells is included in the form of diffusion. We investigate
whether different quantities from statistical mechanics -like the variance, the
two-point correlation function and the patchiness- may serve as early warnings
of catastrophic phase transitions between the ASS. In particular, we find that
the patch-size distribution follows a power law when the system is close to the
catastrophic transition. We also provide links between spatial and temporal
indicators and analyze how the interplay between diffusion and spatial
heterogeneity may affect the earliness of each of the observables. We find that
possible remedial procedures, which can be followed after these early signals,
are more effective as the diffusion becomes lower. Finally, we comment on
similarities and differences between these catastrophic shifts and paradigmatic
thermodynamic phase transitions like the liquid-vapour change of state for a
fluid like water.
