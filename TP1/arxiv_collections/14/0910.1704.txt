In this paper we report on the fourth soft gamma-ray source catalog obtained
with the IBIS gamma-ray imager on board the INTEGRAL satellite. The scientific
dataset is based on more than 70Ms of high quality observations performed
during the first five and a half years of Core Program and public observations.
Compared to previous IBIS surveys, this catalog includes a substantially
increased coverage of extragalactic fields, and comprises more than 700
high-energy sources detected in the energy range 17--100 keV, including both
transients and faint persistent objects which can only be revealed with longer
exposure times. A comparison is provided with the latest Swift/BAT survey
results.
