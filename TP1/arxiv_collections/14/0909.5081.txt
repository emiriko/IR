Nonlinear magneto-optical resonances have been measured in an extremely thin
cell (ETC) for the D1 transition of rubidium in an atomic vapor of natural
isotopic composition. All hyperfine transitions of both isotopes have been
studied for a wide range of laser power densities, laser detunings, and ETC
wall separations. Dark resonances in the laser induced fluorescence (LIF) were
observed as expected when the ground state total angular momentum F_g was
greater than or equal to the excited state total angular momentum F_e. Unlike
the case of ordinary cells, the width and contrast of dark resonances formed in
the ETC dramatically depended on the detuning of the laser from the exact
atomic transition. A theoretical model based on the optical Bloch equations was
applied to calculate the shapes of the resonance curves. The model averaged
over the contributions from different atomic velocity groups, considered all
neighboring hyperfine transitions, took into account the splitting and mixing
of magnetic sublevels in an external magnetic field, and included a detailed
treatment of the coherence properties of the laser radiation. Such a
theoretical approach had successfully described nonlinear magneto-optical
resonances in ordinary vapor cells. Although the values of certain model
parameters in the ETC differed significantly from the case of ordinary cells,
the same physical processes were used to model both cases. However, to describe
the resonances in the ETC, key parameters such as the transit relaxation rate
and Doppler width had to be modified in accordance with the ETC's unique
features. Agreement between the measured and calculated resonance curves was
satisfactory for the ETC, though not as good as in the case of ordinary cells.
