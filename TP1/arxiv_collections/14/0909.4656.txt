We present two different theories for Raman scattering and Resonant Inelastic
X-ray Scattering (RIXS) in the low temperature ferromagnetic phase of YTiO$_3$
and compare this to the available experimental data. For description of the
orbital ground-state and orbital excitations, we consider two models
corresponding to two theoretical limits: one where the $t_{2g}$ orbitals are
degenerate, and the other where strong lattice distortions split them. In the
former model the orbitals interact through superexchange. The resulting
superexchange Hamiltonian yields an orbitally ordered ground state with
collective orbital excitations on top of it - the orbitons. In the
orbital-lattice model, on the other hand, distortions lead to local
dd-transitions between crystal field levels. Correspondingly, the orbital
response functions that determine Raman and RIXS lineshapes and intensities are
of cooperative or single-ion character. We find that the superexchange model
yields theoretical Raman and RIXS spectra that fit very well to the
experimental data.
