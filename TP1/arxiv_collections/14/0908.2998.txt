In a simple extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model,
out-of-equilibrium decays of TeV scale exotic vector-like squarks may generate
the baryon asymmetry of the universe. Baryon number and CP violation are
present in the superpotential, so this mechanism does not rely on CP violation
in supersymmetry breaking parameters. We discuss phenomenological constraints
on the model as well as potential signals for the Large Hadron Collider and
electronic dipole moment experiments. A variation on the TeV scale model allows
the exotic squarks to be the messengers of gauge mediated supersymmetry
breaking.
