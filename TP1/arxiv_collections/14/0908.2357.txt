We present simultaneous operation of ten single-electron turnstiles leading
to one order of magnitude increase in current level up to 100 pA. Our analysis
of device uniformity and background charge stability implies that the
parallelization can be made without compromising the strict requirements of
accuracy and current level set by quantum metrology. In addition, we discuss
how offset charge instability limits the integration scale of single-electron
turnstiles.
