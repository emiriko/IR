We have built a gas-phase argon ionization detector to measure small nuclear
recoil energies (< 10 keVee). In this paper, we describe the detector response
to X-ray and gamma calibration sources, including analysis of pulse shapes,
software triggers, optimization of gas content, and energy- and
position-dependence of the signal. We compare our experimental results against
simulation using a 5.9-keV X-ray source, as well as higher-energy gamma sources
up to 1332 keV. We conclude with a description of the detector, DAQ, and
software settings optimized for a measurement of the low-energy nuclear
quenching factor in gaseous argon. This work was performed under the auspices
