We present the light-cone distribution amplitudes of the Xi baryons up to
twist six on the basis of QCD conformal partial wave expansion to the leading
order conformal spin accuracy. The nonperturbative parameters relevant to the
DAs are determined in the framework of the QCD sum rule. The light-cone QCD sum
rule approach is used to investigate both the electromagnetic form factors of
Xi and the exclusive semileptonic decay of Xi_c as applications. Our
estimations on the magnetic moments are $\mu_{\Xi^0}=-(1.92\pm0.34)\mu_N$ and
$\mu_{\Xi^-}=-(1.19\pm0.03)\mu_N$. The decay width of the process Xi_c->Xi
e^+\nu_e is evaluated to be $\Gamma=8.73\times10^{-14}{GeV}$, which is in
accordance with the experimental measurements and other theoretical approaches.
