This is a brief sketch of the use of supernovae to measure cosmological
parameters. It traces the early work, the events surrounding the discovery and
verification of cosmic acceleration using SN Ia, and the efforts today to make
sound inferences about the nature of dark energy. The prospects for minimizing
systematics by using near-infrared observations in the supernova restframe are
emphasized. This could be an important point in the design of a JDEM that
employs supernovae to measure the history of cosmic expansion.
