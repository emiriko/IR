Spectral line width broadening in Rydberg gases, a phenomenon previously
attributed to the many-body effect, was observed experimentally almost a decade
ago. The observed line width was typically 80-100 times larger than the average
interaction strength predicted from a binary interaction. The interpretation of
such a phenomenon is usually based on the so-called diffusion model, where the
line width broadening mostly originates from the diffusion of excitations. In
this paper, we present a model calculation to show that diffusion is not the
main mechanism to the line width broadening. We find that the rare pair
fluctuation at small separation is the dominant factor contributing to this
broadening. Our results give a width of about 20-30 times larger than the
average interaction strength. More importantly, by turning off the diffusion
process, we do not observe order of magnitude change in the spectral line
width.
