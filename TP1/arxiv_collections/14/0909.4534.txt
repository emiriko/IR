We analyze the thermoelectric response in layered metals with spontaneously
broken rotation symmetry. We identify the anisotropy of the quasiparticle
Nernst signal as an extremely sensitive probe of Fermi surface distortions
characteristic of the ordered state. This is due to a subtle interplay of
different transport anisotropies which become additionally enhanced near
van-Hove singularities. Applied to recent experiments, our results reinforce
the proposal that the underdoped cuprate superconductor YBCO displays such
``electron-nematic'' order in the pseudogap regime.
