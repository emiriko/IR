Narrow-gap higher mobility semiconducting alloys In_{1-x}Mn_{x}Sb were
synthesized in polycrystalline form and their magnetic and transport properties
have been investigated. Ferromagnetic response in In_{0.98}Mn_{0.02}Sb was
detected by the observation of clear hysteresis loops up to room temperature in
direct magnetization measurements. An unconventional (reentrant) magnetization
versus temperature behavior has been found. We explained the observed
peculiarities within the frameworks of recent models which suggest that a
strong temperature dependence of the carrier density is a crucial parameter
determining carrier-mediated ferromagnetism of (III,Mn)V semiconductors. The
correlation between magnetic states and transport properties of the sample has
been discussed. The contact spectroscopy method is used to investigate a band
structure of (InMn)Sb near the Fermi level. Measurements of the degree of
charge current spin polarization have been carried out using the point contact
Andreev reflection (AR) spectroscopy. The AR data are analyzed by introducing a
quasiparticle spectrum broadening, which is likely to be related to magnetic
scattering in the contact. The AR spectroscopy data argued that at low
temperature the sample is decomposed on metallic ferromagnetic clusters with
relatively high spin polarization of charge carriers (up to 65% at 4.2K) within
a cluster.
