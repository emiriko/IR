We analyze the time dependence of entanglement and total correlations between
a system and fractions of its environment in the course of decoherence. For the
quantum Brownian motion model we show that the entanglement and total
correlations have rather different dependence on the size of the environmental
fraction. Redundancy manifests differently in both types of correlations and
can be related with induced--classicality. To study this we introduce a new
measure of redundancy and compare it with the existing one.
