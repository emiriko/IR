We derive the equation of state of tracker fields, which are typical examples
of freezing quintessence (quintessence with the equation of state approaching
toward -1), taking into account of the late-time departure from the tracker
solution due to the nonzero density parameter of dark energy $\Omp$. We
calculate the equation of state as a function of $\Omp$ for constant
$\Gamma=VV"/(V')^2$ (during matter era) models. The derived equation of state
contains a single parameter, $w_{(0)}$, which parametrizes the equation of
state during the matter-dominated epoch. We derive observational constraints on
$w_{(0)}$ and find that observational data are consistent with the cosmological
constant: $-1.11< \wzero< -0.96 (1 \sigma)$.
