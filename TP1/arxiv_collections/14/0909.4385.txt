Evidence is given for a systematic text-length dependence of the power-law
index gamma of a single book. The estimated gamma values are consistent with a
monotonic decrease from 2 to 1 with increasing length of a text. A direct
connection to an extended Heap's law is explored. The infinite book limit is,
as a consequence, proposed to be given by gamma = 1 instead of the value
gamma=2 expected if the Zipf's law was ubiquitously applicable. In addition we
explore the idea that the systematic text-length dependence can be described by
a meta book concept, which is an abstract representation reflecting the
word-frequency structure of a text. According to this concept the
word-frequency distribution of a text, with a certain length written by a
single author, has the same characteristics as a text of the same length pulled
out from an imaginary complete infinite corpus written by the same author.
