Particle-hole continuum in Dirac sea of graphene has a unique window
underneath, which provides a unique opportunity for emergence of a pole in the
susceptibility of the {\em triplet} particle-hole channel in the entire
Brillouin zone (BZ). Here we use random phase approximation (RPA) to study such
collective mode at zero temperature, in a single layer of doped graphene. We
find that due to the chiral nature of one-particle states, in undoped graphene,
the wave function overlap factors do not lead to qualitative differences, while
in doped graphene they will kill small momentum part of the branch of magnetic
excitations by pushing it to touch the lower part of the continuum. The pole
corresponding to magnetic excitations survives for for larger momenta in the
BZ.
