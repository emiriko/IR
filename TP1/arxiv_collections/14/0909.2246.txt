In this work, it is pointed out that in the mean-field version of
majority-rule opinion dynamics, the dependence of the consensus time on the
population size exhibits two regimes. This is determined by the size
distribution of the groups that, at each evolution step, gather to reach
agreement. When the group size distribution has a finite mean value, the
previously known logarithmic dependence on the population size holds. On the
other hand, when the mean group size diverges, the consensus time and the
population size are related through a power law. Numerical simulations validate
this semi-quantitative analytical prediction.
