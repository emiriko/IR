Imaging with a layered superlens is a spatial filtering operation
characterized by the point spread function (PSF). We show that in the same
optical system the image of a narrow sub-wavelength Gaussian incident field may
be surprisingly dissimilar to the PSF, and the width of PSF is not a
straightforward measure of resolution. FWHM or std. dev. of PSF give ambiguous
information about the actual resolution, and imaging of objects smaller than
the FWHM of PSF is possible. A multiscale analysis of imaging gives good
insight into the peculiar scale-dependent properties of sub-wavelength imaging.
