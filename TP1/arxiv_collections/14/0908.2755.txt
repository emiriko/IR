From the freedom exhibited by the generalized Einstein action proposed in
[1], we show that we can construct the standard effective Einstein-Cartan
action coupled to the fermionic matter without the usual current-current
interaction and therefore an effective action which does not depend neither on
the Immirzi parameter nor on the torsion. This establishes the equivalence
between the Einstein-Cartan theory and the theory of the general relativity
minimally coupled to the fermionic matter.
