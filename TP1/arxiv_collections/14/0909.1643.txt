We comment on the recent manuscript by Raines et al. [arXiv:0905.0269v2] (now
published in Nature, vol. 463, p. 214-217, 2010), which suggests that in
certain conditions a single diffraction measurement may be sufficient to
reconstruct the full three-dimensional density of a scatterer. We show that
past literature contains the tools to assess rigorously the feasibility of this
approach. We question the formulation of the reconstruction algorithm used by
the authors and we argue that the experimental data used as a demonstration is
not suitable for this method, and thus that the reconstruction is not valid.
  This second version was produced for documentation purposes. In addition to
the minimally modified original comment, it includes in appendix a subsequent
reply to one of the authors (J. Miao).
