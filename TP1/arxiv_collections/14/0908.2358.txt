Surprising enhancement of the magnetic moments recently observed in dilute
Co-Mn alloy clusters is explained using ab initio electronic structure
calculations. The calculated magnetic moments generally agree with the reported
experimental data. An equation for calculating the magnetic moments of the
Co-Mn alloy clusters has been derived to correct the deviations predicted by
the rigid-band model and the virtual bound states approximation. A strategy is
proposed to obtain the ground-state structures of the Co-Mn clusters and it was
also put to the test of the experiment.
