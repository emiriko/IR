To capture the uncertainty of information or knowledge in information
systems, various information granulations, also known as knowledge
granulations, have been proposed. Recently, several axiomatic definitions of
information granulation have been introduced. In this paper, we try to improve
these axiomatic definitions and give a universal construction of information
granulation by relating information granulations with a class of functions of
multiple variables. We show that the improved axiomatic definition has some
concrete information granulations in the literature as instances.
