We have carried out a survey of compact star clusters (apparent size <3
arcsec) in the southwest part of the M31 galaxy, based on the high-resolution
Suprime-Cam images (17.5 arcmin x 28.5 arcmin), covering ~15% of the
deprojected galaxy disk area. The UBVRI photometry of 285 cluster candidates (V
< 20.5 mag) was performed using frames of the Local Group Galaxies Survey. The
final sample, containing 238 high probability star cluster candidates (typical
half-light radius r_h ~ 1.5 pc), was selected by specifying a lower limit of
r_h > 0.15 arcsec (>0.6 pc). We derived cluster parameters based on the
photometric data and multiband images by employing simple stellar population
models. The clusters have a wide range of ages from ~5 Myr (young objects
associated with 24 um and/or Ha emission) to ~10 Gyr (globular cluster
candidates), and possess mass in a range of 3.0 < log(m/M_sol) < 4.3 peaking at
m ~ 4000 M_sol. Typical age of these intermediate-mass clusters is in the range
of 30 Myr < t < 3 Gyr, with a prominent peak at ~70 Myr. These findings suggest
a rich intermediate-mass star cluster population in M31, which appears to be
scarce in the Milky Way galaxy.
