We investigate the optical/near-infrared light curve of the afterglow of GRB
080710 in the context of rising afterglows. Optical and near-infrared
photometry was performed using the seven channel imager GROND and the
Tautenburg Schmidt telescope. X-ray data were provided by the X-ray Telescope
onboard the Swift satellite. The optical/NIR light curve of the afterglow of
GRB 080710 is dominated by an initial increase in brightness, which smoothly
turns over into a shallow power law decay. The initially rising achromatic
light curve of the afterglow of GRB 080710 can be accounted for with a model of
a burst viewed off-axis or a single jet in its pre deceleration phase and in an
on-axis geometry. An unified picture of the afterglow light curve and prompt
emission properties can be obtained with an off-axis geometry, suggesting that
late and shallow rising optical light curves of GRB afterglows might be
produced by geometric effects.
