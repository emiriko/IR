We present broad band Suzaku}observations of a small sample of hard X-ray
selected (> 10 keV), nearby Seyfert 2 galaxies and discuss the results in the
context of AGN unified model. We also review the issues related to the space
density of heavily obscured, Compton Thick AGN in the local Universe and the
perspectives for the search of these objects at high redshifts
