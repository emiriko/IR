A holographic description of scalar mesons is presented, in which two- and
three-point functions are holographically reconstructed. Mass spectrum, decay
constants, eigenfunctions and the coupling of the scalar states with two pseu-
doscalars are found. A comparison of the results with current phenomenology is
discussed.
