Massive stars have been associated with the production of high-energy
neutrinos since the early claims of detection of very high-energy gamma rays
from Cygnus X-3 in the 1970s and early 1980s. Although such claims are now
discredited, many thoretical models were developed predicting significant
neutrino fluxes from binary systems with massive stars. With the discovery of
microquasars, new, improved models appeared. The large neutrino telescopes
currently under construction (IceCube, Antares) and the detection of gamma-ray
sources of likely hadronic origin associated with massive binaries and
star-forming regions make the prospects for high-energy neutrino astronomy
quite promising. In this paper I will review the basic features of neutrino
production in stellar systems and I will discuss the physical implications of a
positive neutrino detection from such systems for our view of the stellar
evolution and comsic ray origin.
