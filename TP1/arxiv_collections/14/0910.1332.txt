The international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) is being built,
at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), to demonstrate the feasibility of
ionization cooling of muon beams. This is one of the major technological steps
needed in the development of a muon collider and a neutrino factory based on
muon decays in a storage ring. MICE will use particle detectors to measure the
cooling effect with high precision, achieving a precision on the measurement of
emittance of 0.1% or better. The particle i.d. detectors and trackers must work
in harsh environmental conditions due to high magnetic fringe fields and RF
noise. We will briefly describe the MICE particle i.d. detector systems, and
show some current performance measurements of these detectors.
