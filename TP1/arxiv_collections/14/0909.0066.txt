Inspiralling compact binaries are expected to circularize before their
gravitational-wave signals reach the sensitive frequency band of ground-based
detectors. Current searches for gravitational waves from compact binaries using
the LIGO and Virgo detectors therefore use circular templates to construct
matched filters. Binary formation models have been proposed which suggest that
some systems detectable by the LIGO--Virgo network may have non-negligible
eccentricity. We investigate the ability of the restricted 3.5 post-Newtonian
order TaylorF2 template bank, used by LIGO and Virgo to search for
gravitational waves from compact binaries with masses $M \le 35 M_\odot$, to
detect binaries with non-zero eccentricity. We model the gravitational waves
from eccentric binaries using the $x$-model post-Newtonian formalism proposed
by Hinder \emph{et. al.} [I. Hinder, F. Hermann, P. Laguna, and D. Shoemaker,
arXiv:0806.1037v1]. We find that small residual eccentricities ($e_0 \lesssim
0.05$ at 40 Hz) do not significantly affect the ability of current LIGO
searches to detect gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries with
total mass $2 M_\odot < M < 15 M_\odot$. For eccentricities $e_0 \gtrsim 0.1$,
the loss in matched filter signal-to-noise ratio due to eccentricity can be
significant and so templates which include eccentric effects will be required
to perform optimal searches for such systems.
