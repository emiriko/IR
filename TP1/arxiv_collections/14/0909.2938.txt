We present abundances of Fe, Na, and O for 1409 red giant stars in 15
galactic globular clusters, derived from the homogeneous analysis of high
resolution FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectra. Combining the present data with previous
results, we obtained a total sample of 1958 stars in 19 clusters, the largest
and most homogeneous database of this kind to date. Our GCs have [Fe/H] from
-2.4 to -0.4, with a wide variety of global parameters (morphology of the
horizontal branch, mass, concentration, etc). For all clusters we find the Na-O
anticorrelation, the classical signature of proton-capture reactions in
H-burning at high temperature in a previous generation of more massive stars,
now extinct. Using quantitative criteria (from the morphology and extension of
the Na-O anticorrelation), we can define 3 components of the stellar population
in GCs: a primordial component (P) of first-generation stars, and 2 components
of second-generation stars (intermediate I and extreme E populations from their
different chemical composition). The P component is present in all GCs, and its
fraction is almost constant at about one third. The I component represents the
bulk of the cluster population. The E component is not present in all GCs, and
it is more conspicuous in some (but not in all) of the most massive ones. We
discuss the fractions and spatial distributions of these components in our
sample and in two additional clusters (M3 and M13) from the literature. We also
find that the slope of the anti-correlation (defined by the minimum O and
maximum Na abundances) changes from cluster-to-cluster, a change that is
represented well by a bilinear relation on cluster metallicity and luminosity.
This second dependence suggests a correlation between average mass of polluters
and cluster mass.
