We examine the nature of the cosmological big-bounce (BB) transition within
the loop geometry underlying Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) at classical and
quantum levels. Our canonical quantization method is an alternative to the
standard LQC. Our method opens the door for analyzes of spectra of physical
observables like energy density and volume operator. We find that one cannot
determine the energy scale specific to BB by making use of the loop geometry
without an extra input from observational cosmology.
