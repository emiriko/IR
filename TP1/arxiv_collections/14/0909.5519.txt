We propose a method to prepare different non-Poissonian signal pulses from
sources of Poissonian photon number distribution using only linear optical
elements and threshold photon detectors. This method allows a simple passive
preparation of decoy states for quantum key distribution. We show that the
resulting key rates are comparable to the performance of active choices of
intensities of Poissonian signals.
