In open quantum systems, phenomenological master equations with unknown
parameters are often introduced. Here we propose a time-independent procedure
based on quantum tomography to reconstruct the potentially unknown parameters
of a wide class of Markovian master equations. According to our scheme, the
system under investigation is initially prepared in a Gaussian state. At an
arbitrary time t, in order to retrieve the unknown coefficients one needs to
measure only a finite number (ten at maximum) of points along three
time-independent tomograms. Due to the limited amount of measurements required,
we expect our proposal to be especially suitable for experimental
implementations.
