We describe a general analysis package for supernova (SN) light curves,
called SNANA, that contains a simulation, light curve fitter, and cosmology
fitter. The software is designed with the primary goal of using SNe Ia as
distance indicators for the determination of cosmological parameters, but it
can also be used to study efficiencies for analyses of SN rates, estimate
contamination from non-Ia SNe, and optimize future surveys. Several SN models
are available within the same software architecture, allowing technical
features such as K-corrections to be consistently used among multiple models,
and thus making it easier to make detailed comparisons between models. New and
improved light-curve models can be easily added. The software works with
arbitrary surveys and telescopes and has already been used by several
collaborations, leading to more robust and easy-to-use code. This software is
not intended as a final product release, but rather it is designed to undergo
continual improvements from the community as more is learned about SNe. Below
we give an overview of the SNANA capabilities, as well as some of its
limitations. Interested users can find software downloads and more detailed
information from the manuals at http://www.sdss.org/supernova/SNANA.html .
