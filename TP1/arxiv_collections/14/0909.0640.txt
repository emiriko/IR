The exact energy spectrum is developed for a two temperature kinetic Ising
spin chain, and its dual reaction diffusion system with spatially alternating
pair annihilation and creation rates. Symmetries of the system
pseudo-Hamiltonian that enable calculation of the spectrum are also used to
derive explicit state vectors for small system sizes, and to make observations
regarding state vectors in the general case. Physical consequences of the
surprisingly simple form for the eigenvalues are also discussed.
