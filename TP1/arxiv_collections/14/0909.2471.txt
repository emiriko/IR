We study a zero-dimensional version of the fluctuating nonlinear
hydrodynamics (FNH) of supercooled liquids originally investigated by Das and
Mazenko (DM) [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 34}, 2265 (1986)]. The time-dependent
density-like and momentum-like variables are introduced with no spatial degrees
of freedom in this toy model. The structure of nonlinearities takes the similar
form to the original FNH, which allows one to study in a simpler setting the
issues raised recently regarding the field theoretical approaches to glass
forming liquids. We study the effects of density nonlinearities on the time
evolution of correlation and response functions by developing field theoretic
formulations in two different ways: first by following the original
prescription of DM and then by constructing a dynamical action which possesses
a linear time reversal symmetry as proposed recently. We show explicitly that,
at the one-loop order of the perturbation theory, the DM-type field theory does
not support a sharp ergodic-nonergodic transition, while the other admits one.
The simple nature of the toy model in the DM formulation allows us to develop
numerical solutions to a complete set of coupled dynamical equations for the
correlation and response functions at the one-loop order.
