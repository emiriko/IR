It is briefly demonstrated that Gisin's so-called 'locality' assumption
[arXiv:0901.4255] is in fact equivalent to the existence of a local
deterministic model. Thus, despite Gisin's suggestions to the contrary, 'local
realism' in the sense of Bell is built into his argument from the very
beginning. His 'locality' assumption may more appropriately be labelled
'separability'. It is further noted that the increasingly popular term 'quantum
nonlocality' is not only misleading, but tends to obscure the important
distinction between no-signalling and separability. In particular, 'local
non-realism' remains firmly in place as a hard option for interpreting Bell
inequality violations. Other options are briefly speculated on.
