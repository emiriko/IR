We propose a novel scheme for confining atoms to optical lattices by
engineering a spatially-inhomogeneous hopping matrix element in the
Hubbard-model (HM) description, a situation we term off-diagonal confinement
(ODC). We show, via an exact numerical solution of the boson HM with ODC, that
this scheme possesses distinct advantages over the conventional method of
confining atoms using an additional trapping potential, including the presence
of incompressible Mott phases at commensurate filling and a phase diagram that
is similar to the uniform HM. The experimental implementation of ODC will thus
allow a more faithful realization of correlated phases of interest in cold atom
experiments.
