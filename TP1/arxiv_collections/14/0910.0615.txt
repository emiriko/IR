We demonstrate the formation of semimetal graphite/semiconductor Schottky
barriers where the semiconductor is either silicon (Si), gallium arsenide
(GaAs) or 4H-silicon carbide (4H-SiC). Near room temperature, the forward-bias
diode characteristics are well described by thermionic emission, and the
extracted barrier heights, which are confirmed by capacitance voltage
measurements, roughly follow the Schottky-Mott relation. Since the outermost
layer of the graphite electrode is a single graphene sheet, we expect that
graphene/semiconductor barriers will manifest similar behavior.
