The correlation between the large-scale distribution of galaxies and their
spectroscopic properties at z=1.5 is investigated using the Horizon MareNostrum
cosmological run.
  We have extracted a large sample of 10^5 galaxies from this large
hydrodynamical simulation featuring standard galaxy formation physics. Spectral
synthesis is applied to these single stellar populations to generate spectra
and colours for all galaxies. We use the skeleton as a tracer of the cosmic web
and study how our galaxy catalogue depends on the distance to the skeleton. We
show that galaxies closer to the skeleton tend to be redder, but that the
effect is mostly due to the proximity of large haloes at the nodes of the
skeleton, rather than the filaments themselves.
  This effects translate into a bimodality in the colour distribution of our
sample. The origin of this bimodality is investigated and seems to follow from
the ram pressure stripping of satellite galaxies within the more massive
clusters of the simulation.

galaxies at various redshifts) are available online at
