Context: There is a lively debate about the solar oxygen abundance and the
role of 3D models in its recent downward revision. The models have been tested
using high resolution solar atlases. Further testing can be done using
centre-to-limb variations. Aims: Using high quality observations of oxygen
lines across the solar surface we seek to test if the 3D and 1D models
reproduce their observed centre-to-limb variation (CLV). In particular we seek
to assess whether the 3D model is appropriate to derive the solar oxygen
abundance. Methods: We use our recent observations of OI 777 nm, OI 615.81 nm,
[OI] 630.03 nm and nine lines of other elements for five viewing angles
0.2<mu<1 of the quiet solar disk. We compare them with the predicted line
profiles from the 3D and 1D models computed using the most up-to-date line
formation codes, line data and allowing for departures of LTE. The CLV of the
OI 777 nm lines is also used to obtain an empirical correction for the poorly
known efficiency of the inelastic collisions with H. Results: The 3D model
generally reproduces the CLV observations of the lines very well, particularly
the oxygen lines. From the OI 777 nm lines we find that the classical Drawin
recipe slightly overestimates H collisions. The limb observations of the OI
615.82 nm line allow us to identify a previously unknown contribution of
molecules for this line, prevalent at the solar limb. A detailed treatment of
the [OI] 630.03 nm line shows that the 3D modeling provides an excellent
agreement with the observations. The derived oxygen abundances with the 3D
model are 8.68 (OI 777 nm), 8.66 ([OI] 630.03 nm) and 8.62 (OI 615.82 nm).
Conclusions: These additional tests have reinforced the trustworthiness of the
3D model and line formation for abundance analyses.
