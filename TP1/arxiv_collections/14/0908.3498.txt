We report on current-voltage measurements of the zero-field
normal-superconducting phase transition in thin films of
Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_{4-y}$ as a function of doping. We find that the small
size of the critical regime in these materials ($\approx 25$ mK) gives rise to
mean-field behavior at the phase transition with a static exponent of $\nu
\approx 0.5$ for all dopings (in contrast to hole-doped
$\mathrm{YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}}$). We also find mean-field behavior in the
dynamic exponent $z$. This indicates that Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_{4-y}$ behaves
similarly to conventional superconductors in contrast to other cuprate
superconductors. However, as the transition width in our samples decreases, the
dynamic critical exponent approaches $z=1.5$, similar to the critical exponent
found in hole-doped $\mathrm{YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}}$.
