The collimation efficiency for Pb ion beams in the LHC is predicted to be
lower than requirements. Nuclear fragmentation and electromagnetic dissociation
in the primary collimators create fragments with a wide range of Z/A ratios,
which are not intercepted by the secondary collimators but lost where the
dispersion has grown sufficiently large. In this article we present
measurements and simulations of loss patterns generated by a prototype LHC
collimator in the CERN SPS. Measurements were performed at two different
energies and angles of the collimator. We also compare with proton loss maps
and find a qualitative difference between Pb ions and protons, with the maximum
loss rate observed at different places in the ring. This behavior was predicted
by simulations and provides a valuable benchmark of our understanding of ion
beam losses caused by collimation.
