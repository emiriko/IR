We analytically derive the spectrum of gravitational waves due to
magneto-hydrodynamical turbulence generated by bubble collisions in a
first-order phase transition. In contrast to previous studies, we take into
account the fact that turbulence and magnetic fields act as sources of
gravitational waves for many Hubble times after the phase transition is
completed. This modifies the gravitational wave spectrum at large scales. We
also model the initial stirring phase preceding the Kolmogorov cascade, while
earlier works assume that the Kolmogorov spectrum sets in instantaneously. The
continuity in time of the source is relevant for a correct determination of the
peak position of the gravitational wave spectrum. We discuss how the results
depend on assumptions about the unequal-time correlation of the source and
motivate a realistic choice for it. Our treatment gives a similar peak
frequency as previous analyses but the amplitude of the signal is reduced due
to the use of a more realistic power spectrum for the magneto-hydrodynamical
turbulence. For a strongly first-order electroweak phase transition, the signal
is observable with the space interferometer LISA.
