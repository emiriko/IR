It is shown in this note that a class of Lagrangian field theories closely
related to the wave-map equation and the Skyrme model obeys the dominant energy
condition, and hence by Hawking's theorem satisfies finite speed of
propagation. The subject matter is a generalization of a recent result of
Gibbons.
