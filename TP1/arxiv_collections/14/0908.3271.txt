The research project has been made for mathematical modeling of aerospace
system Space-to-Surface for avoid intercepting process by flight objects
Surface-to-Air. The research has been completed and created mathematical models
which used for research and statistical analysis. In mathematical modeling has
been including a few models: Model of atmosphere, Model of speed of sound,
Model of flight head in space, Model of flight in atmosphere, Models of
navigation and guidance, Model and statistical analysis of approximation of
aerodynamic characteristics. Modeling has been created for a Space-to-Surface
system defined for an optimal trajectory in terminal phase. The modeling
includes models for simulation atmosphere, aerodynamic flight and navigation by
an infrared system. The modeling simulation includes statistical analysis of
the modeling results.
