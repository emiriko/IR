Evaluation of a variable Yd from certain measured variable(s) Xi(s), by
making use of their system-specific-relationship (SSR), is generally referred
as the indirect measurement. Naturally the SSR may stand for a simple
data-translation process in a given case, but a set of equations, or even a
cascade of different such processes, in some other case. Further, though the
measurements are a priori ensured to be accurate, there is no definite method
for examining whether the result obtained at the end of an SSR, specifically a
cascade of SSRs, is really representative as the measured Xi-values.
  Of Course, it was recently shown that the uncertainty (ed) in the estimate
(yd) of a specified Yd is given by a specified linear combination of
corresponding measurement-uncertainties (uis). Here, further insight into this
principle is provided by its application to the cases represented by
cascade-SSRs. It is exemplified how the different stage-wise uncertainties
(Ied, IIed, ... ed), that is to say the requirements for the evaluation to be
successful, could even a priori be predicted. The theoretical tools (SSRs) have
resemblance with the real world measuring devices (MDs), and hence are referred
as also the data transformation scales (DTSs). However, non-uniform behavior
appears to be the feature of the DTSs rather than of the MDs.
