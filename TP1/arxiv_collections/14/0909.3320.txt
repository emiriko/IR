We present a means of characterizing and removing internal reflections
between the CCD and other optical surfaces in an astronomical camera. The
stellar reflections appear as out-of-focus images and are not necessarily
axisymmetric about the star. Using long exposures of very bright stars as
calibration images we are able to measure the position, size, and intensity of
reflections as a function of their position on the field. We also measure the
extended stellar point-spread function out to one degree. Together this
information can be used to create an empirical model of the excess light from
bright stars and reduce systematic artifacts in deep surface photometry. We
then reduce a set of deep observations of the Virgo cluster with our method to
demonstrate its efficacy and to provide a comparison with other strategies for
removing scattered light.
