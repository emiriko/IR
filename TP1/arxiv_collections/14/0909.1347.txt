We show that three-dimensional massive gravity admits Lifshitz metrics with
generic values of the dynamical exponent z as exact solutions. At the point
z=3, exact black hole solutions which are asymptotically Lifshitz arise. These
spacetimes are three-dimensional analogues of those that were recently proposed
as gravity duals for scale invariant fixed points.
