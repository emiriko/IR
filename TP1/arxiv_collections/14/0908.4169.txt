We report the electronic and magnetic behaviour of the frustrated triangular
metallic antiferromagnet 2H-AgNiO2 in high magnetic fields (54 T) using
thermodynamic and transport measurements. Here localized d electrons are
arranged on an antiferromagnetic triangular lattice nested inside a honeycomb
lattice with itinerant d electrons. When the magnetic field is along the easy
axis we observe a cascade of field-induced transitions, attributed to the
competition between easy-axis anisotropy, geometrical frustration and coupling
of the localized and itinerant system. The quantum oscillations data suggest
that the Fermi surface is reconstructed by the magnetic order but in high
fields magnetic breakdown orbits are possible. The itinerant electrons are
extremely sensitive to scattering by spin fluctuations and a significant mass
enhancement (~ 3) is found.
