We investigate the finite time thermodynamics of a single-level fermion
system interacting with a thermal reservoir through a tunneling junction. The
optimal protocol to extract the maximum work from the system when moving the
single energy level between an initial higher value and a final lower value in
a finite time is calculated from a quantum master equation. The calculation
also yields the optimal protocol to raise the energy level with the expenditure
of the least amount of work on the system. The optimal protocol displays
discontinuous jumps at the initial and final times.
