The key to understanding the physical processes that occur during galaxy
interactions is dynamical modeling, and especially the detailed matching of
numerical models to specific systems. To make modeling interacting galaxies
more efficient, we have constructed the `Automatic Galaxy Collision' (AGC)
code, which requires less human intervention in finding good matches to data.
We present some preliminary results from this code for the well-studied system
Arp 284 (NGC 7714/5), and address questions of uniqueness of solutions.
