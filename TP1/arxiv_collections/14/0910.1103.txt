The baryon magnetic and transition magnetic moments are computed in heavy
baryon chiral perturbation theory in the large-N_c limit, where N_c is the
number of colors. One-loop nonanalytic corrections of orders m_q^{1/2} and m_q
ln m_q are incorporated into the analysis, where contributions of both
intermediate octet and decuplet baryon states are explicitly included.
Expressions are obtained in the limit of vanishing baryon mass differences and
compared with the current experimental data. Furthermore, a comparison with
conventional heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory is carried out for three
light quarks flavors and at the physical value N_c=3.
