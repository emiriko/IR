We present an analysis of timing residual (noise) of 54 pulsars obtained from
25-m radio telescope at Urumqi Observatory with a time span of 5~8 years,
dealing with statistics of the Hurst parameter. The majority of these pulsars
were selected to have timing noise that look like white noise rather than
smooth curves. The results are compared with artificial series of different
constant pairwise covariances. Despite the noise like appearance, many timing
residual series showed Hurst parameters significantly deviated from that of
independent series. We concluded that Hurst parameter may be capable of
detecting dependence in timing residual and of distinguishing chaotic behavior
from random processes.
