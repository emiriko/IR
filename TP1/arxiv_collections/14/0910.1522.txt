A two-stage Stirling-type U-shape pulse tube cryocooler driven by a 10
kW-class linear compressor was designed, built and tested. A special feature of
the cold head is the absence of a heat exchanger at the cold end of the first
stage, since the intended application requires no cooling power at this
intermediate temperature. Simulations where done using Sage-software to find
optimum operating conditions and cold head geometry. Flow-impedance matching
was required to connect the compressor designed for 60 Hz operation to the 40
Hz cold head. A cooling power of 12.9 W at 25 K with an electrical input power
of 4.6 kW has been achieved up to now. The lowest temperature reached is 13.7
K.
