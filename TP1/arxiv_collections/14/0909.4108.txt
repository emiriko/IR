Galaxy mergers and interactions are mechanisms which could drive the
formation of bars. Therefore, we could expect that the fraction of barred
galaxies increases with the local density. Here we show the first results of an
extensive search for barred galaxies in different environments. We conclude
that the bar fraction on bright (L>L*) field, Virgo, and Coma cluster galaxies
is compatible. These results point towards an scenario where the formation
and/or evolution of bars depend mostly on internal galaxy processes rather than
external ones.
