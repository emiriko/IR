A spectrometer for resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) is proposed
where imaging and dispersion actions in two orthogonal planes are combined to
deliver full two-dimensional map of RIXS intensity in one shot with parallel
detection in incoming hvin and outgoing hvout photon energies. Preliminary
ray-tracing simulations with a typical undulator beamline demonstrate a
resolving power well above 11000 in both hvin and hvout near a photon energy of
930 eV, with a vast potential for improvement. Combining such a spectrometer -
nicknamed hv2 - with an XFEL source allows efficient time-resolved RIXS
experiments.
