We study $S=1/2$ dimer excitation in a coupled chain and dimer compound
Cu$_2$Fe$_2$Ge$_4$O$_{13} by inelastic neutron scattering technique. The Zeeman
split of the dimer triplet by a staggered field is observed at low temperature.
With the increase of temperature the effect of random field is detected by a
drastic broadening of the triplet excitation. Basic dynamics of dimer in the
staggered and random fields are experimentally identified in
Cu$_2$Fe$_2$Ge$_4$O$_{13}.
