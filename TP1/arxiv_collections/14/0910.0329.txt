Monte Carlo simulation is the most accurate method for absorbed dose
calculations in radiotherapy. Its efficiency still requires improvement for
routine clinical applications, especially for online adaptive radiotherapy. In
this paper, we report our recent development on a GPU-based Monte Carlo dose
calculation code for coupled electron-photon transport. We have implemented the
Dose Planning Method (DPM) Monte Carlo dose calculation package (Sempau et al,
Phys. Med. Biol., 45(2000)2263-2291) on GPU architecture under CUDA platform.
The implementation has been tested with respect to the original sequential DPM
code on CPU in phantoms with water-lung-water or water-bone-water slab
geometry. A 20 MeV mono-energetic electron point source or a 6 MV photon point
source is used in our validation. The results demonstrate adequate accuracy of
our GPU implementation for both electron and photon beams in radiotherapy
energy range. Speed up factors of about 5.0 ~ 6.6 times have been observed,
using an NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPU card against a 2.27GHz Intel Xeon CPU
processor.
