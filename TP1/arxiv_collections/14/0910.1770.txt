The search for neutral resonances at the energy frontier has a long and
illustrious history, resulting in multiple discoveries. The canonical search
scans the reconstructed invariant mass distribution of identified fermion
pairs. Two recent analyses from the CDF experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron
have applied novel methods to resonance searches. One analysis uses simulated
templates to fit the inverse mass distribution of muon pairs, a quantity with
approximately constant resolution for momenta measured with a tracking
detector. The other analysis measures the angular distribution of electron
pairs as a function of dielectron mass, gaining sensitivity over a probe of the
mass spectrum alone. After reviewing several models that predict new neutral
resonances, we discuss these CDF analyses and potential future applications.
