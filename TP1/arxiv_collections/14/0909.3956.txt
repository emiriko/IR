We analyse the newest diffractive deep inelastic scattering data from HERA
using the dipole model approach. We find a reasonable good agreement between
the predictions and the data although the region of small values of a kinematic
variable $\beta$ needs refinement. A way to do this is to consider an approach
with diffractive parton distributions evolved with the DGLAP evolution
equations.
