The problem of Subgraph Isomorphism is defined as follows: Given a pattern H
and a host graph G on n vertices, does G contain a subgraph that is isomorphic
to H? Eppstein [SODA 95, J'GAA 99] gives the first linear time algorithm for
subgraph isomorphism for a fixed-size pattern, say of order k, and arbitrary
planar host graph, improving upon the O(n^\sqrt{k})-time algorithm when using
the ``Color-coding'' technique of Alon et al [J'ACM 95]. Eppstein's algorithm
runs in time k^O(k) n, that is, the dependency on k is superexponential. We
solve an open problem posed in Eppstein's paper and improve the running time to
2^O(k) n, that is, single exponential in k while keeping the term in n linear.
Next to deciding subgraph isomorphism, we can construct a solution and
enumerate all solutions in the same asymptotic running time. We may list w
subgraphs with an additive term O(w k) in the running time of our algorithm. We
introduce the technique of "embedded dynamic programming" on a suitably
structured graph decomposition, which exploits the topology of the underlying
embeddings of the subgraph pattern (rather than of the host graph). To achieve
our results, we give an upper bound on the number of partial solutions in each
dynamic programming step as a function of pattern size--as it turns out, for
the planar subgraph isomorphism problem, that function is single exponential in
the number of vertices in the pattern.
