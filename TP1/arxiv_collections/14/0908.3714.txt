We use Hopf algebras to prove a version of the Littlewood-Richardson rule for
skew Schur functions, which implies a conjecture of Assaf and McNamara. We also
establish skew Littlewood-Richardson rules for Schur P- and Q-functions and
noncommutative ribbon Schur functions, as well as skew Pieri rules for k-Schur
functions, dual k-Schur functions, and for the homology of the affine
Grassmannian of the symplectic group.
