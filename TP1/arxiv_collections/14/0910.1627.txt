We introduce a method to obtain self-consistent, axially symmetric, thin
disklike stellar models in the first post-Newtonian (1PN) approximation. The
models obtained are fully analytical and corresponds to the post-Newtonian
generalizations of classical ones. By introducing in the field equations
provided by the 1PN approximation a known distribution function (DF)
corresponding to a Newtonian model, two fundamental equations determining the
1PN corrections are obtained, which are solved using the Hunter method. The
rotation curves of the 1PN-corrected models differs from the classical ones
and, for the generalized Kalnajs discs, the 1PN corrections are clearly
appreciable with values of the mass and radius of a typical galaxy. On the
other hand, the relativistic mass correction can be ignored for all models.
