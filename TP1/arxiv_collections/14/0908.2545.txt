The Fisher-Shannon and Cramer-Rao information measures, and the LMC-like or
shape complexity (i.e., the disequilibrium times the Shannon entropic power) of
hydrogenic stationary states are investigated in both position and momentum
spaces. First, it is shown that not only the Fisher information and the
variance (then, the Cramer-Rao measure) but also the disequilibrium associated
to the quantum-mechanical probability density can be explicitly expressed in
terms of the three quantum numbers (n, l, m) of the corresponding state.
Second, the three composite measures mentioned above are analytically,
numerically and physically discussed for both ground and excited states. It is
observed, in particular, that these configuration complexities do not depend on
the nuclear charge Z. Moreover, the Fisher-Shannon measure is shown to
quadratically depend on the principal quantum number n. Finally, sharp upper
bounds to the Fisher-Shannon measure and the shape complexity of a general
hydrogenic orbital are given in terms of the quantum numbers.
