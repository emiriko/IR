We present radial velocities of the M8V-type, very low-mass star vB 10 that
have been obtained at four different epochs of observations between 2001 and
2008. We use high-resolution (R ~ 20,000) near-infrared (J-band) spectra taken
with the NIRSPEC instrument on the Keck II telescope. Our data suggest that vB
10 shows radial velocity variability with an amplitude of ~1 km/s, a result
that is consistent with the recent finding of a massive planet companion around
the star by Pravdo & Shaklan (2009). More velocity measurements and a better
sampling of the orbital phase are required to precisely constrain the orbital
parameters and the individual masses of the pair.
