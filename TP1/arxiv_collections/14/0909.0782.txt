The observations carried out by the space missions CoRoT and Kepler provide a
large set of asteroseismic data. Their analysis requires an efficient procedure
first to determine if the star is reliably showing solar-like oscillations,
second to measure the so-called large separation, third to estimate the
asteroseismic information that can be retrieved from the Fourier spectrum. We
develop in this paper a procedure, based on the autocorrelation of the seismic
Fourier spectrum. We have searched for criteria able to predict the output that
one can expect from the analysis by autocorrelation of a seismic time series.
First, the autocorrelation is properly scaled for taking into account the
contribution of white noise. Then, we use the null hypothesis H0 test to assess
the reliability of the autocorrelation analysis. Calculations based on solar
and CoRoT times series are performed in order to quantify the performance as a
function of the amplitude of the autocorrelation signal. We propose an
automated determination of the large separation, whose reliability is
quantified by the H0 test. We apply this method to analyze a large set of red
giants observed by CoRoT. We estimate the expected performance for photometric
time series of the Kepler mission. Finally, we demonstrate that the method
makes it possible to distinguish l=0 from l=1 modes. The envelope
autocorrelation function has proven to be very powerful for the determination
of the large separation in noisy asteroseismic data, since it enables us to
quantify the precision of the performance of different measurements: mean large
separation, variation of the large separation with frequency, small separation
and degree identification.
