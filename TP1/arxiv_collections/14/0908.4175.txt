Various commercial coated conductors were irradiated with fast neutrons in
order to introduce randomly distributed, uncorrelated defects which increase
the critical current density, Jc, in a wide temperature and field range. The
Jc-anisotropy is significantly reduced and the angular dependence of Jc does
not obey the anisotropic scaling approach. These defects enhance the
irreversibility line in not fully optimized tapes, but they do not in
state-of-the-art conductors. Neutron irradiation provides a clear distinction
between the low field region, where Jc is limited by the grain boundaries, and
the high field region, where depinning leads to dissipation.
