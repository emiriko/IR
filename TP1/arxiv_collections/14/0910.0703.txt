In this paper a model of subscriber telephone network based on the concept of
cellular automata is elaborated. Some fractal properties inherent in the model
are revealed that vary depending on parameters assigning its operation rules.
The main advantage of the model in question is its compatibility with
algorithmic methods - a finite set of formal rules, assigned on a finite set of
elements (cells), allows precise realization in the form of algorithms.
