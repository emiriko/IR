We discuss in detail the physics reach of an experimental set-up where
electron neutrinos (anti-neutrinos) produced in a beta-beam facility at Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) are sent, over a distance of L~1300km,
to the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL). A 300kt
Water Cherenkov (WC) detector and a 50kt Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber
(LArTPC) are considered as possible detector choices. We propose to use 18Ne
and 6He as source ions for electron neutrino and electron anti-neutrino beams,
respectively. The maximum Lorentz boost factor, gamma, available for these ions
using the Tevatron are gamma_Ne=585 and gamma_He=350. This particular set-up
provides the opportunity to probe the first oscillation maximum using the
neutrino beam and the second oscillation maximum using the anti-neutrino beam
which helps to evade some parameter degeneracies. The resulting physics
sensitivities for theta_13, CP violation and the mass hierarchy are compared to
those of a conventional superbeam from FNAL to DUSEL.
