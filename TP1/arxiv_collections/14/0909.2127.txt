It is conjectured that energy sources of the gamma ray bursts are similar to
energy sources which trigger solar and stellar transient activity phenomena
like flares, plasma accelerated flows in the flux tubes and, dissipation of
energy and acceleration of particles by the MHD waves. Phenomenologically we
examine in detail the following energy sources which may trigger gamma ray
bursts : (i) cosmic primordial flares which could be solar flare like phenomena
in the region of inter galactic or inter galactic cluster regions, (ii)
primordial magnetic flux tubes that might have been formed from the convective
collapse of the primordial magnetic flux (iii) nonlinear interaction and
dissipation of MHD waves that are produced from the perturbations of
large-scale inter galactic or inter cluster magnetic field of primordial
origin. We examine in detail each of the afore mentioned phenomena keeping in
mind that whether such processes are responsible for energy sources of the
gamma ray bursts.
  By considering the similarity of observations and prevailing physical
conditions in the cosmic environment, the following study suggests that most
likely and a promising energy source for creation of the gamma ray bursts may
be due to primordial flares.
