We obtain a general parametrization for the neutrino Majorana mass matrix in
which all possible deviations from tribimaximal mixing are given by three
complex parameters, and the deviation from each tribimaximal mixing eigenvector
is identified with precisely two of them. This parametrization provides a
useful tool for classifying the corrections to exact tribimaximal mixing in
flavor models.
