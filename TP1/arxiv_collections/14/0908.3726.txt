The properties of the momentum space quark propagator in Landau gauge are
studied for the overlap quark action in quenched lattice QCD. Numerical
calculations are performed over four ensembles of gauge configurations, where
three are smeared using either 1, 3, or 6 sweeps of stout-link smearing. We
calculate the non-perturbative wave function renormalization function $Z(p)$
and the non-perturbative mass function $M(p)$ for a variety of bare quark
masses. We find that the wave-function renormalization function is slightly
sensitive to the number of stout-link smearing sweeps. For the mass function we
find the effect of the stout-link smearing algorithm to be small for moderate
to light bare quark masses. For a heavy bare quark mass we find a strong
dependence on the number of smearing sweeps.
