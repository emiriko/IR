Short time-scale flux density variations of flat spectrum radio sources are
often explained by the scattering of radio waves in the turbulent, ionized
Interstellar Matter of the Milky Way. One of the most convincing observational
arguments in favor of this is the annual modulation of the variability
time-scale caused by the Earth orbital motion around the Sun. J1128+592 is an
IDV source with a possible annual modulation in its variability time-scale. We
observed the source in 6 epochs with the VLBA at 5, 8 and 15 GHz in total
intensity and polarization. The VLBA observations revealed an east-west
oriented core-jet structure. Its position angle agrees with the angle of
anisotropy derived from the annual modulation model. No significant long-term
structural changes were observed with VLBI on mas-scales, however, compared to
archival data, the VLBI core size is expanded. This expansion offers a possible
explanation to the observed decrease of the strength of IDV. VLBI polarimetry
revealed significant changes in the electric vector position angle and Rotation
Measure of the core and jet. Part of the observed RM variability could be
attributed to a scattering screen (37 pc distance), which covers the source
(core and jet) and which may be responsible for the IDV. Superposition of
polarized sub-components below the angular resolution limit may affect the
observed RM as well.
