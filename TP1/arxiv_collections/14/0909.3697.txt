In a system of coupled harmonic oscillators, the interaction can be
represented by a real, symmetric and positive definite interaction matrix. The
quantization of a Hamiltonian describing such a system has been done in the
canonical case. In this paper, we take a more general approach and look at the
system as a Wigner quantum system. Hereby, one does not assume the canonical
commutation relations, but instead one just requires the compatibility between
the Hamilton and Heisenberg equations. Solutions of this problem are related to
the Lie superalgebras gl(1|n) and osp(1|2n). We determine the spectrum of the
considered Hamiltonian in specific representations of these Lie superalgebras
and discuss the results in detail. We also make the connection with the
well-known canonical case.
