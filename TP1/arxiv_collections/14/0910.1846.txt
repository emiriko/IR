We present new advances in the spectral extraction of point-like sources
adapted to the Infrared Spectrograph onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. For
the first time, we created a super-sampled point spread function of the
low-resolution modules. We describe how to use the point spread function to
perform optimal extraction of a single source and of multiple sources within
the slit. We also examine the case of the optimal extraction of one or several
sources with a complex background. The new algorithms are gathered in a plugin
called Adopt which is part of the SMART data analysis software.
