The treatment of the time-independent Schrodinger equation in real-space is
an indispensable part of introductory quantum mechanics. In contrast, the
Schrodinger equation in momentum space is an integral equation that is not
readily amenable to an analytical solution and is rarely taught. We present a
numerical approach to the Schrodinger equation in momentum space. After a
suitable discretization process, we obtain the Hamiltonian matrix and
diagonalize it numerically. By considering a few examples, we show that this
approach is ideal for exploring bound-states in a localized potential and
complements the traditional (analytical or numerical) treatment of the
Schrodinger equation in real-space.
