At zero temperature magnetic phases of the quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg
antiferromagnet on a simple cubic lattice with competing first and second
neighbor exchanges (J1 and J2) is investigated using the non-linear spin wave
theory. We find existence of two phases: a two sublattice Neel phase for small
J2 (AF), and a collinear antiferromagnetic phase at large J2 (CAF). We obtain
the sublattice magnetizations and ground state energies for the two phases and
find that there exists a first order phase transition from the AF-phase to the
CAF-phase at the critical transition point, pc = 0.28. Our results for the
value of pc are in excellent agreement with results from Monte-Carlo
simulations and variational spin wave theory. We also show that the quartic 1/S
corrections due spin-wave interactions enhance the sublattice magnetization in
both the phases which causes the intermediate paramagnetic phase predicted from
linear spin wave theory to disappear.
