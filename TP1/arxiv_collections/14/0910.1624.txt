We show that the renormalized quantum invariants of links and graphs in the
3-sphere, derived from tensor categories in ["Modified quantum dimensions and
re-normalized link invariants", arXiv:0711.4229] lead to modified 6j-symbols
and to new state sum 3-manifold invariants. We give examples of categories such
that the associated standard Turaev-Viro 3-manifold invariants vanish but the
secondary invariants may be non-zero. The categories in these examples are
pivotal categories which are neither ribbon nor semi-simple and have an
infinite number of simple objects.
