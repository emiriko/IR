We review results from recent high resolution cosmological structure
formation simulations, namely the Via Lactea I & II and GHALO projects. These
simulations study the formation of Milky Way sized objects within a
cosmological framework. We discuss the general properties of cold dark matter
halos at redshift z = 0 and focus on new insights into the structure of halos
we got due to the unprecedented high resolution in these simulations.
