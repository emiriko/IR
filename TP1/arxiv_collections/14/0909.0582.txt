We numerically calculate the spatial correlators of the scalar and
pseudoscalar operators $F^2$ and $F\tilde F$, in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory at
zero and finite-temperature on the lattice. We compare the results over the
distances $\frac{1}{2T}<r<\frac{3}{2T}$ to the free-field prediction, to the
operator-product expansion as well as to the strongly coupled large-$N_c$
$\sN=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory, where results are obtained by AdS/CFT methods.
For $T_c<T<1.15T_c$, both channels exhibit stronger spatial correlations than
in the vacuum, and we give an explanation for this, using sum-rules and the
operator-product expansion. The AdS/CFT calculation provides a
semi-quantitatively successful description of the vacuum-subtracted $F^2$
correlator, renormalized in the 3-loop $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme, in the
interval of temperatures $1.2<T/T_c<1.9$, while the free-field prediction has
the wrong sign. The $F\tilde F$ and $F^2$ correlators are predicted to have the
same functional form both at weak coupling and in the strongly coupled SYM
theory. The Yang-Mills plasma does not meet that expectation below $2T_c$.
Instead we find that strong fluctuations of $F\tilde F$ are present at least up
to that temperature. We discuss the impact of our results on our understanding
of the quark-gluon plasma.
