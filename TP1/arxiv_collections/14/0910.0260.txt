About 90% of Bs-bar Bs pairs produced at the Upsilon(5s) resonance are
initially Bs*-bar Bs* pairs which decay radiatively to Bs-bar Bs. This implies
that the Bs pair will then be in an eigenstate of charge conjugation (i.e.
C=-1) and therefore in an entangled state. This allows for a determination of
Delta Gamma/Gamma and the CP phase using a number of possible correlations
between the decays of the two Bs mesons. In particular, we consider the time
integrated correlation; the time ordering asymmetry and the time
ordering-charge asymmetry, which in addition to time ordering distinguishes Bs
from Bs-bar, for various combinations of final states. With the statistics of
about O(10^7-10^8) Upsilon(5s) events available at B factories, we find that
the time ordering asymmetry between suitably defined hadronic and flavor
specific (tagging) decays offers a promising method for determining the width
difference. The corresponding time ordering-charge asymmetry can also bound the
mixing phase. Similar observables involving exclusive decays are also
considered. At the super B factories with O(50) times greater luminosity time
ordering and time ordering-charge asymmetries between inclusive and exclusive
modes may also provide additional bounds on the phases in those decays;
