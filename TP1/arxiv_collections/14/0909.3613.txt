We present a dense coding scheme between one sender and two receivers, which
guarantees that the receivers simultaneously obtain their respective messages.
In our scheme, the quantum entanglement channel is first locked by the sender
so that the receivers cannot learn their messages unless they collaborate to
perform the unlocking operation. We also show that the quantum Fourier
transform can act as the locking operator both in simultaneous dense coding and
teleportation.
