We consider a class of ordinary differential equations describing
one-dimensional quasiperiodically forced systems in the presence of large
damping. We give a fully constructive proof of the existence of response
solutions, that is quasi-periodic solutions which have the same frequency
vector as the forcing. This requires dealing with a degenerate implicit
function equation: we prove that the latter has a unique solution, which can be
explicitly determined. As a by-product we obtain an explicit estimate of the
minimal size of the damping coefficient.
