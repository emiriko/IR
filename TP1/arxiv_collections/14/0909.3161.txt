In this paper, the Coulomb-induced changes of Fano interference in electronic
transport through a double quantum dot Aharonov-Bohm ring are discussed. It is
found that the Coulomb interaction in the quantum dot in the reference channel
can remarkably modify the Fano interference, including the increase or decrease
of the symmetry of the Fano lineshape, as well as the inversion of the Fano
lineshape, which is dependent on the appropriate strength of the Coulomb
interaction. %But the nonzero Coulomb interaction %only leads to the emergence
of two-group Fano lineshapes. When both the quantum dot levels are adjustable,
the Coulomb-induced splitting of the nonresonant channel leads to the
destruction of the Fano interference; whereas two blurry Fano lineshapes may
appear in the conductance spectra when the many-body effect in the dot of the
resonant channel is also considered. Interestingly, in the absence of magnetic
field, when the different-strength electron interactions make one pair of
levels of the dots in different channels the same, the corresponding resonant
state keeps vacuum despite the adjustment of quantum dot levels.
