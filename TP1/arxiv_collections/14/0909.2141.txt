In a recent article F. Cardone et al. [Phys. Lett. A 373 (2009) 1956] have
claimed that subjecting a solution of 228Th to cavitation leads to a
"transformation" of the thorium nuclei that is 104 times faster than the normal
nuclear decay for this isotope. We have criticized the evidence provided for
this claim in a "Comment" [Phys. Lett. A (2009), in press, DOI
10.1016/j.physleta.2009.08.045]. In their "Reply" [Phys. Lett. A (2009), in
press, DOI 10.1016/j.physleta.2009.08.047] Cardone et al. answer only some
minor points but avoid addressing the real issue. They even state a new
extraordinary claim, namely that the thorium "transformations" occur without
emission of gamma rays. In addition, the information provided in their Reply
displays a worrying lack of control of their experimental situation and the
data they put forward as evidence for their claims. We point out several
shortcomings and errors in the described experimental preparations, set-up and
reporting, as well as in the data analysis. We conclude that the evidence
presented by Cardone et al. is insufficient to justify their claims and that
the shortcomings of their work are so severe that the original paper and the
Reply should be withdrawn.
