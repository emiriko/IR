We study in detail the mid-infrared Spitzer-IRS spectrum of M 87 in the range
5 to 20 micron. Thanks to the high sensitivity of our Spitzer-IRS spectra we
can disentangle the stellar and nuclear components of this active galaxy. To
this end we have properly subtracted from the M 87 spectrum, the contribution
of the underlying stellar continuum, derived from passive Virgo galaxies in our
sample. The residual is a clear power-law, without any additional thermal
component, with a zero point consistent with that obtained by high spatial
resolution, ground based observations. The residual is independent of the
adopted passive template. This indicates that the 10 micron silicate emission
shown in spectra of M 87 can be entirely accounted for by the underlying old
stellar population, leaving little room for a possible torus contribution. The
MIR power-law has a slope alpha ~ 0.77-0.82 (S$_\nu\propto\nu^{-\alpha}$),
consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission.
