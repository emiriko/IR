Nuclear reactions generate energy in nuclear reactors, in stars, and are
responsible for the existence of all elements heavier than hydrogen in the
universe. Nuclear reactions denote reactions between nuclei, and between nuclei
and other fundamental particles, such as electrons and photons. A short
description of the conservation laws and the definition of basic physical
quantities is presented, followed by a more detailed account of specific cases:
(a) formation and decay of compound nuclei; (b)direct reactions; (c) photon and
electron scattering; (d) heavy ion collisions; (e) formation of a quark-gluon
plasma; (f) thermonuclear reactions; (g) and reactions with radioactive beams.
Whenever necessary, basic equations are introduced to help understand general
properties of these reactions. Published in Wiley Encyclopedia of Physics,
