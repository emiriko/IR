We study thermodynamics properties of a one dimensional gas of hard elongated
particles. The particle centers are restricted to a line, while they can rotate
in two-dimensional space. Correlations between orientations of the objects are
studied (by transfer matrix method) as a function of density and aspect ratio.
The behavior in the extreme high-density (jamming) limit is described by a few
universality classes depending on the object's shape. In particular, there is a
diverging correlation length when the contact point of adjacent objects is far
from the line along which their centers move, as for needles and rectangles.
