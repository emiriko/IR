We consider an asexual biological population of constant size $N$ evolving in
discrete time under the influence of selection and mutation. Beneficial
mutations appear at rate $U$ and their selective effects $s$ are drawn from a
distribution $g(s)$. After introducing the required models and concepts of
mathematical population genetics, we review different approaches to computing
the speed of logarithmic fitness increase as a function of $N$, $U$ and $g(s)$.
We present an exact solution of the infinite population size limit and provide
an estimate of the population size beyond which it is valid. We then discuss
approximate approaches to the finite population problem, distinguishing between
the case of a single selection coefficient, $g(s) = \delta(s - s_b)$, and a
continuous distribution of selection coefficients. Analytic estimates for the
speed are compared to numerical simulations up to population sizes of order
$10^{300}$.
