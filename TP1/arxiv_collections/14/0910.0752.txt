In this paper we consider a resonant injection-locked frequency divider which
is of interest in electronics, and we investigate the frequency locking
phenomenon when varying the amplitude and frequency of the injected signal. We
study both analytically and numerically the structure of the Arnold tongues in
the frequency-amplitude plane. In particular, we provide exact analytical
formulae for the widths of the tongues, which correspond to the plateaux of the
devil's staircase picture. The results account for numerical and experimental
findings presented in the literature for special driving terms and,
additionally, extend the analysis to a more general setting.
