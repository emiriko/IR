We present a test for the problem of decentralized sequential hypothesis
testing, which is asymptotically optimum. By selecting a suitable sampling
mechanism at each sensor, communication between sensors and fusion center is
asynchronous and limited to 1-bit data. The proposed SPRT-like test turns out
to be order-2 asymptotically optimum in the case of continuous time and
continuous path signals, while in discrete time this strong asymptotic
optimality property is preserved under proper conditions. If these conditions
do not hold, then we can show optimality of order-1. Simulations corroborate
the excellent performance characteristics of the test of interest.
