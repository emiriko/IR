A new effort to explore the diffractive regime in polarized $p+p$ collisions
in a broad high energy range ($\sqrt{s}$ = 200 - 500 GeV) has been initiated
with the STAR detector at RHIC. Staged implementation of multiple Roman Pot
stations for tagging the forward proton in the diffractive processes will
enable searches for the centrally produced for the possible gluon bound state
via double Pomeron exchange process and the theoretically expected Odderon
state in QCD by studying spin-dependent elastic scattering in a wide $t$-range
with polarized $p+p$.
