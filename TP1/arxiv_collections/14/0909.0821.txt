The solvability of The Dirac equation is studied for the exponential-type
potentials with the pseudospin symmetry by using the parametric generalization
of the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The energy eigenvalue equation, and the
corresponding Dirac spinors for Morse, Hulthen, and q-deformed Rosen-Morse
potentials are obtained within the framework of an approximation to the
spin-orbit coupling term, so the solutions are given for any value of the
spin-orbit quantum number $\kappa=0$, or $\kappa \neq 0$.
