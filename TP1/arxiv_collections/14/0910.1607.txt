We show that in multiband superconductors even small interband proximity
effect can lead to a qualitative change in the interaction potential between
superconducting vortices by producing long-range intervortex attraction. This
type of vortex interaction results in unusual response to low magnetic fields
leading to phase separation into domains of a two-component Meissner states and
vortex droplets.
