In order to analyze the instability phenomenon observed along the Northern
High Speed Line of R\'eseau Ferr\'e de France (RFF), soil blocks were taken at
a site near the railway, at four different depths (1.2, 2.2, 3.5 and 4.9 m).
Cyclic triaxial tests were carried out on saturated and unsaturated soil
specimens. The results from tests on initially saturated specimens showed that
the soil taken at 2.2 m depth has the lowest resistance to cyclic loading, in
relation to its highest porosity and lowest clay fraction. This soil was then
studied at unsaturated state with various initial water contents. Unsaturated
soil specimens were first subjected to cyclic loadings to decrease their
volume. These cyclic loadings was stopped when the volume decrease was
approximately equal to the initial pore air volume, or when the pores filled by
air were eliminated and the soil was considered to become saturated.
Afterwards, the back-pressure tubing was saturated with de-aired water and
cycles were applied under undrained condition. Significant effect of initial
water content was evidenced: the lower the initial water content, the higher
the cyclic resistance. This can be explained by the densification of the soil
during the initial cyclic loadings.
