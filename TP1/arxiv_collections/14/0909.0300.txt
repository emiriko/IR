We present a simple architecture for deterministic quantum circuits operating
on single photon qubits. Few resources are necessary to implement two
elementary gates and can be recycled for computing with large numbers of
qubits. The deterministic realization of some key multi-qubit gates, such as
the Fredkin and Toffoli gate, is greatly simplified in this approach.
