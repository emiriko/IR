Numerical-relativity (NR) simulations of compact binaries are expected to be
an invaluable tool in gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. The sensitivity of
future detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) will place much higher
demands on NR simulations than first- and second-generation ground-based
detectors. We discuss the issues facing compact-object simulations over the
next decade, with an emphasis on estimating where the accuracy and parameter
space coverage will be sufficient for ET and where significant work is needed.
