The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) around the flux state in square Kondo lattice
is investigated. By introducing the lattice distortion and local chirality, the
square Kondo lattice can break the parity symmetry and time reversal symmetry
spontaneously, and thus generate a topological nontriviality in the band
structure associated with the AHE. Moreover, a possible realization of this AHE
in multiferroic TbMnO$_3$ is discussed.
