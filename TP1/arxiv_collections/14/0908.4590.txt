We investigate non-equilibrium dynamical scaling in adiabatic quench
processes across quantum multicritical points. Our analysis shows that the
resulting power-law scaling depends sensitively on the control path, and that
anomalous critical exponents may emerge depending on the universality class. We
argue that the observed anomalous behavior originates in the fact that the
dynamical excitation process takes place asymmetrically with respect to the
static multicritical point, and that non-critical energy modes may play a
dominant role. As a consequence, dynamical scaling requires introducing new
non-static exponents.
