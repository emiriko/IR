In this paper, we study how the interaction of the axigluon with quarks is
modified when we introduce new color-octet spin-one fields in a chiral color
model. We show that in this case the strength of this interaction is not
completely determined by the gauge symmetry any more and can be significantly
weaker than the one predicted in the original chiral color model. In this way,
we reinterpret the non-observability of the axigluon at the Tevatron, not as a
limit on the axigluon mass, but as a limit on the strength of the axigluon
coupling to quarks.
