We conjecture that the confinement- deconfinement phase transition in QCD at
large number of colors $N$ and $N_f\ll N$ at $T\neq 0$ and $\mu\neq 0$ is
triggered by the drastic change in $\theta$ behavior. The conjecture is
motivated by the holographic model of QCD where confinement -deconfinement
phase transition indeed happens precisely at $T=T_c$ where $\theta$ dependence
experiences a sudden change in behavior. The conjecture is also supported by
quantum field theory arguments when the instanton calculations (which trigger
the $\theta$ dependence) are under complete theoretical control for $T>T_c$,
suddenly break down immediately below $T<T_c$ with sharp changes in the
$\theta$ dependence. Finally, the conjecture is supported by a number of
numerical lattice results. We employ this conjecture to study confinement
-deconfinement phase transition of hot and dense QCD in large $N$ limit by
analyzing the $\theta$ dependence. We estimate the critical values for $T_c$
and $\mu_c$ where the phase transition happens by approaching the critical
values from the hot and/or dense regions where the instanton calculations are
under complete theoretical control. We also describe some defects of various
codimensions within a holographic model of QCD by focusing on their role around
the phase transition point.
