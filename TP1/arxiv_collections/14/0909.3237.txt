We report a nearly perfect bandwidth-unlimited, dispersion-free tunable
optical delay system using a prism pair. The observed delay-bandwidth product
using a 25-femtosecond light pulse is ~7x104, where the delay time is
independent of the signal bandwidth. The present technique breaks from the
conventional methods constrained by delay-bandwidth product, nontunability, and
delay time dependent optical loss.
