We have studied the effect of Fe substitution on magnetic and magnetocaloric
properties in La0.7Sr0.3Mn1-xFexO3 (x = 0.05, 0.07, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20) over
a wide temperature range (T = 10-400 K). It is shown that substitution by Fe
gradually decreases the ferromagnetic Curie temperature (Tc) and saturation
magnetization up to x = 0.15 but a dramatic change occurs for x = 0.2. The x =
0.2 sample can be considered as a phase separated compound in which both
short-range ordered ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases coexist. The
magnetic entropy change (DSm) was estimated from isothermal magnetization
curves and it decreases with increase of Fe content from 4.4 J/KgK at 343 K (x
= 0.05) to 1.3 J/KgK at 105 K (x = 0.2), under H = 5 T. The
La0.7Sr0.3Mn0.93Fe0.07O3 sample shows negligible hysteresis loss, operating
temperature over 60 K range around room temperature with refrigerant capacity
of 225 J/Kg, and magnetic entropy of 4 J/kgK which will be an interesting
compound for application in room temperature refrigeration.
