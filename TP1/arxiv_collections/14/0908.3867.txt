The role of double humped states in spreading of wave packets for the
nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLSE) with a random potential is explored and
the spreading mechanism is unraveled. Comparison with an NLSE with a
double-well potential is made. There are two independent affects of the
nonlinearity on the double humped states for the NLSE: coupling to other states
and destruction. The interplay between these effects is discussed.
