We present analyses of exclusive semileptonic b -> c decays based on data
samples collected by the Belle detector at the KEK-B e+ e- asymmetric collider.
  The first topic are precision measurements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
matrix element |V_{cb}| and the HQET form factor parameters \rho^2, R_1 and R_2
extracted from B^+ -> \bar{D}^{*0} \ell^+ \nu decays using untagged Upsilon(4S)
events. Additionally, a test of the form factor parametrization is performed.
  Secondly, measurements of B -> D^* \tau \nu and B -> D \tau \nu decays are
presented, where the accompanying second B meson is tagged and reconstructed.
Branching fractions of the semi-tauonic decays are measured.
