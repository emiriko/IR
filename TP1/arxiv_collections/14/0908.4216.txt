We consider quantum wire arrays consisting of GaAs rods embedded in
Al$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As and disposed in sites of a square or triangular lattice.
The electronic and hole spectra around the conduction band bottom and the
valence band top are examined versus geometry of the lattice formed by the
rods, concentration of Al in the matrix material, and structural parameters
including the filling fraction and the lattice constant. Our calculations use
the envelope function and are based on the effective-mass approximation. We
show that the electronic and hole spectra resulting from the periodicity of the
heterostructure, depend on the factors considered and that the effect of
lattice geometry varies substantially with lattice constant. For low lattice
constant values the minigaps are significantly wider in the case of triangular
lattice, while for high lattice constant values wider minigaps occur in the
square lattice-based arrays. We analyse the consequences of our findings for
the efficiency of solar cells based on quantum wire arrays.
