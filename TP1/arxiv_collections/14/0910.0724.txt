We present the first results from the new Survey of Extragalactic Nuclear
Spectral Energies (SENSE) sample of "blazars". The sample has been chosen with
minimal selection effects and is therefore ideal to probe the intrinsic
properties of the blazar population. We report evidence for negative
cosmological evolution in this radio selected sample and give an outline of
future work related to the SENSE sample.
