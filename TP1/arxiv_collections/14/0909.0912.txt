We analyze here the reasons why an explanation of the Pioneer anomaly
proposed by the authors is fully compatible with the cartography of the solar
system. First, this proposal posits that the phenomenon is an apparent
acceleration, not a real one, caused by a progressive desynchronization of the
astronomical and the atomic clock-times, after they had been synchronized at a
previous instant. The desynchronization could be caused by a coupling between
the background gravitation and the quantum vacuum. Therefore, the standard
argument for the incompatibility of the Pioneer acceleration and the values of
the planets' orbits radii cannot be applied. Second, this proposal gives
exactly the same results for radar ranging observations as standard physics.
Hence, it cannot be in conflict with the very precise cartography of the solar
system determined by NASA's Viking mission. Otherwise stated, while this
proposal predicts apparent changes in the velocities of the spaceships and in
the frequencies of Doppler observations, as really observed, it does not affect
the values of the distances in any way whatsoever. Note that an acceleration
between the astronomical and the atomic clock-times ({\it i. e.} a progressive
desynchronization) can not be discarded a priori as long as we will lack a
theory of quantum gravity.
