We discuss two ways of deriving the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) for
soft fermion excitations in a hot non-Abelian plasma being in a thermal
equilibrium. The first of them is based on the extended (pseudo)classical model
in describing a quark-gluon plasma suggested in [Yu.A. Markov, M.A. Markova,
Nucl. Phys. A {\bf 784} (2007) 443], while the second one rests on the standard
technique of calculation of the FDT for thermodynamically equilibrium systems.
We show that full accounting all subtleties that are common to the fermion
system under consideration, results in perfect coincidence of thus obtained
FDTs. This provides a rather strong argument for the validity of the
pseudoclassical model suggested.
