In the context of Fritzsch-like texture 4 zero Hermitian quark mass matrices,
we have attempted to find an `exact' formula for sin2\beta wherein the
dependence of \beta on the quark masses and the elements of the quark mass
matrices is visible in a simple and clear manner. This has been achieved
keeping in mind the strong hierarchy of the quark masses and assuming the weak
hierarchy amongst the elements of the mass matrices. This `exact' formula
represents a vast improvement over the leading order formula based on strong
hierarchy of the elements of the mass matrices. Apart from showing the
compatibility of texture 4 zero mass matrices with the present value of
sin2\beta and other CKM parameters, we find interesting conclusions regarding
the structural features of the mass matrices.
