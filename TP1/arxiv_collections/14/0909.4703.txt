In the no-scale supergravity global symmetries protect local supersymmetry
and a zero value for the cosmological constant. The breakdown of these
symmetries, which ensures the vanishing of the vacuum energy density, results
in a set of degenerate vacua with broken and unbroken supersymmetry leading to
the natural realisation of the multiple point principle (MPP). In the MPP
inspired SUGRA models the cosmological constant is naturally tiny.
