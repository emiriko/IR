Recent quantitative measurements of the orbital to spin magnetic moment ratio
$m_L/m_S$ in electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) experiments have given
a $m_L/m_S$ ratio that is larger than commonly accepted values. We demonstrate
here that plural scattering may noticeably influence the $m_L/m_S$ ratio. An
equation is derived which describes its influence as a function of the spectral
integrals of the plasmon scattering region and zero-loss peak. The influence of
the electron-plasmon scattering can be removed when electron energy-loss
spectra of the ionization edge are deconvoluted by the low-loss signal. For a
bcc-Fe sample we obtain $m_L/m_S=0.04$ after plasmon removal. We conclude that
the plural scattering should be considered when extracting quantitative
information from EMCD measurements.
