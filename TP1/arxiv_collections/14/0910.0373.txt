The development of search algorithms for gravitational wave sources in the
LISA data stream is currently a very active area of research. It has become
clear that not only does difficulty lie in searching for the individual
sources, but in the case of galactic binaries, evaluating the fidelity of
resolved sources also turns out to be a major challenge in itself. In this
article we review the current status of developed algorithms for galactic
binary, non-spinning supermassive black hole binary and extreme mass ratio
inspiral sources. While covering the vast majority of algorithms, we will
highlight those that represent the state of the art in terms of speed and
accuracy.
