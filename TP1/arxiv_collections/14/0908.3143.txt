In complex electromagnetic environments it can often be difficult to
determine whether signals received by an antenna array emanated from the same
source. The failure to appropriately assign signal reception events to the
correct emission event makes accurate localisation of the signal source
impossible. In this paper we show that as the received signal events must lie
on the light-cone of the emission event the Cayley-Menger determinate
calculated from using the light-cone geodesic distances between received
signals must be zero. This result enables us to construct an algorithm for
sorting received signals into groups corresponding to the same far-field
emission.
