We analyze a generic model of mesoscopic machines driven by the nonadiabatic
variation of external parameters. We derive a formula for the probability
current; as a consequence we obtain a no-pumping theorem for cyclic processes
satisfying detailed balance and demonstrate that the rectification of current
requires broken spatial symmetry.
