This paper extends the existing theory of two carrier photorefractivity
resonance, which is generally applied to Iron doped Indium Phosphide (InP:Fe),
to the case of low non-harmonic illumination. The space charge field profile is
computed, and the variations of its amplitude, width and position are
determined as functions of the background intensity. The effect of
photorefractive resonance on these quantities is evidenced, contributing to the
understanding of published experimental results in InP:Fe.
