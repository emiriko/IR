Prompt-photon cross sections in deep inelastic ep scattering were measured
with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 320pb^-1.
Measurements of differential cross sections are presented for inclusive
prompt-photon production as a function of Q^2, x, E_T and eta. Perturbative QCD
predictions and Monte Carlo predictions are compared to the measurements.
