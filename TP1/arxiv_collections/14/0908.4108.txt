We discuss three conceivable scenarios of extension and/or modification of
the IAU relativistic resolutions on time scales and spatial coordinates beyond
the Standard IAU Framework. These scenarios include: (1) the formalism of the
monopole and dipole moment transformations of the metric tensor replacing the
scale transformations of time and space coordinates; (2) implementing the
parameterized post-Newtonian formalism with two PPN parameters - beta and
gamma; (3) embedding the post-Newtonian barycentric reference system to the
Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmological model.
