Magnetoresistivity measurements with fine tuning of the field direction on
high quality single crystals of the ferromagnetic superconductor UCoGe show
anomalous anisotropy of the upper critical field H_c2. H_c2 for H // b-axis
(H_c2^b) in the orthorhombic crystal structure is strongly enhanced with
decreasing temperature with an S-shape and reaches nearly 20 T at 0 K. The
temperature dependence of H_c2^a shows upward curvature with a low temperature
value exceeding 30 T, while H_c2^c at 0 K is very small (~ 0.6 T). Contrary to
conventional ferromagnets, the decrease of the Curie temperature with
increasing field for H // b-axis marked by an enhancement of the effective mass
of the conduction electrons appears to be the origin of the S-shaped H_c2^b
curve. These results indicate that the field-induced ferromagnetic instability
or magnetic quantum criticality reinforces superconductivity.
