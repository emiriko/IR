Here we use pristine graphene samples in order to analyze how the Raman peaks
intensity, measured at 2.4 eV and 1.96 eV excitation energy, changes with the
amount of doping. The use of pristine graphene allows investigating the
intensity dependence close to the Dirac point. We show that the G peak
intensity is independent on the doping, while the 2D peak intensity strongly
decreases for increasing doping. Analyzing this dependence in the framework of
a fully resonant process, we found that the total electron-phonon scattering
rate is ~40 meV at 2.4 eV.
