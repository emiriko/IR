It is shown that quantum aspects of the energy-momentum tensor reveal dark
matter and dark energy behavior for general relativity. Special meaning is
assigned to the operator X^2d^2/dX^2 +2Xd/dX, for any field X that is part of
the energy-momentum tensor, and to the distinction between information on
gravitational and non-gravitational effects. Changes in such information cause
the Sun-Earth distance to increase by 11 cm/yr.
