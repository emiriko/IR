These lectures focus on the structure of various Higgs boson theories. Topics
in the first lectures include: mass generation in chiral theories, spontaneous
symmetry breaking, neutrino masses, perturbative unitarity, vacuum stability,
vacuum alignment, flavor changing neutral current solutions with multiple Higgs
doublets, analysis of type I theory with Z2 symmetry, and rephasing symmetries.
After an Essay on the Hierarchy Problem, additional topics are covered that
more directly relate to naturalness of the electroweak theory. Emphasis is on
their connection to Higgs boson physics. Topics in these later lectures
include: supersymmetry, supersymmetric Higgs sector in the Runge basis,
leading-order radiative corrections of supersymmetric light Higgs boson mass,
theories of extra dimensions, and radion mixing with the Higgs boson in warped
extra dimensions. And finally, one lecture is devoted to Higgs boson
connections to the hidden sector.
