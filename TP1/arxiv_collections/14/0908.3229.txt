We will simplify the earlier proofs of Perelman's collapsing theorem of
3-manifolds given by Shioya-Yamaguchi and Morgan-Tian.
  Among other things, we use Perelman's semi-convex analysis of distance
functions to construct the desired local Seifert fibration structure on
collapsed 3-manifolds. The verification of Perelman's collapsing theorem is the
last step of Perelman's proof of Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture on the
classification of 3-manifolds.
  Our proof of Perelman's collapsing theorem is almost self-contained. We
believe that our proof of this collapsing theorem is accessible to non-experts
and advanced graduate students.
