The magnetic moment in the parent phase of the iron-pnictide superconductors
varies with composition even when the nominal charge of iron is unchanged. We
propose the spin-lattice coupling due to the magneto-volume effect as the
primary origin of this effect, and formulate a Landau theory to describe the
dependence of the moment to the Fe-As layer separation. We then compare the
superconductive critical temperature of doped iron pnictides to the local
moment predicted by the theory, and suggest that the spin-phonon coupling may
play a role in the superconductivity of this compound.
