Recently, a mechanism for relaxing a large cosmological constant (CC) has
been proposed [arxiv:0902.2215], which permits solutions with low Hubble rates
at late times without fine-tuning. The setup is implemented in the LXCDM
framework, and we found a reasonable cosmological background evolution similar
to the LCDM model with a fine-tuned CC. In this work we analyse analytically
the perturbations in this relaxation model, and we show that their evolution is
also similar to the LCDM model, especially in the matter era. Some tracking
properties of the vacuum energy are discussed, too.
