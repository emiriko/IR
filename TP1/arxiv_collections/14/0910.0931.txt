Kaluza-Klein dark matter is an attractive weakly interacting massive particle
in universal extra dimension model. In the recent extension "split-UED",
annihilation of Kaluza-Klein dark matter with a mass range 600-1000 GeV
provides excellent fits to the recently observed excesses in cosmic electron
and positron fluxes of Pamela, ATIC and Fermi-LAT experiments. The cosmic
gamma-ray flux in the same process can be significant around 300 GeV, thus can
be observed or constrained by the forthcoming Fermi-LAT diffuse gamma-ray data.
The collider signal at the LHC is the resonance in the dijets channels and the
large missing energy in the missing energy plus jets.
