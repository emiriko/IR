These proceedings summarize the first MiniBooNE electron antineutrino
appearance search results, corresponding to a data sample collected for
3.39$\times10^{20}$ protons on target (POT). The search serves as a direct test
of the LSND oscillation signature, and provides complementary information which
can be used in studies addressing the MiniBooNE neutrino-mode low-energy
excess.
