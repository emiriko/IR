In a case study (June 6-7, 2008) we report on how the internal structure of a
coronal mass ejection (CME) at 1 AU can be anticipated from remote observations
of white-light images of the heliosphere. Favorable circumstances are the
absence of fast equatorial solar wind streams and a low CME velocity which
allow us to relate the imaging and in-situ data in a straightforward way. The
STEREO-B spacecraft encountered typical signatures of a magnetic flux rope
inside an interplanetary CME (ICME) whose axis was inclined at 45 degree to the
solar equatorial plane. Various CME direction-finding techniques yield
consistent results to within 15 degree. Further, remote images from STEREO-A
show that (1) the CME is unambiguously connected to the ICME and can be tracked
all the way to 1 AU, (2) the particular arc-like morphology of the CME points
to an inclined axis, and (3) the three-part structure of the CME may be
plausibly related to the in situ data. This is a first step in predicting both
the direction of travel and the internal structure of CMEs from complete remote
observations between the Sun and 1 AU, which is one of the main requirements
for forecasting the geo-effectiveness of CMEs.
