Because of the extreme smallness of the energy spread of the unstable state
describing the decaying proton, due in its turn to the anomalous smallness of
the resonance width expected for the proton decay, the application of the
Heisenberg time-energy relation predicts the measurement times for the proton
decay observation to be so long as to forbid a "continuous" observation of the
decay. This might account for the missing observation of the proton decay.
