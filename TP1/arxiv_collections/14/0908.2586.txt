Based on a possible solution to the tetron spin problem, a modification of
the standard Big Bang scenario is suggested, where the advent of a spacetime
manifold is connected to the appearance of tetronic bound states. The metric
tensor is constructed from tetron constituents and the reason for cosmic
inflation is elucidated. Furthermore, there are natural dark matter candidates
in the tetron model. The ratio of ordinary to dark matter in the universe is
calculated to be 1:5.
