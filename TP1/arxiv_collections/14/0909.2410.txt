Synchronization of fractional-order chaotic systems is a hot topic in the
field of nonlinear study. The co-coupled synchronization between two
fractional-order chaotic systems with different initial conditions is
investigated in this paper. Based on Lyapunov stability principle and
Gerschgorin theorem, the co-coupled synchronization theorem of fractional-order
chaotic systems is deduced, and the range of coupling coefficients is confirmed
for synchronization of fractional-order unified chaotic systems. By building up
the synchronization simulation model on Simulink, the co-coupled
synchronization between two fractional-order unified chaotic systems with
different initial value is carried out, and the synchronization performances
are analyzed, and the simulation results show that this synchronization method
is effective.
