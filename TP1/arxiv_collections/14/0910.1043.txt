Diverse mass and mixing patterns between the quarks and leptons makes it
challenging to construct a simple grand unified theory of flavor. We show that
SO(10) SUSY GUTs with type II seesaw mechanism giving neutrino masses provide a
natural framework for addressing this issue. A simple ansatz that the dominant
Yukawa matrix (the 10-Higgs coupling to matter) has rank one, appears to
simultaneously explain both the large lepton mixings as well as the observed
quark flavor hierarchy in these models. A testable prediction of this ansatz is
the neutrino mixing, U_{e3}, which should be observable in planned long
baseline experiments.
