We describe an image analysis supervised learning algorithm that can
automatically classify galaxy images. The algorithm is first trained using a
manually classified images of elliptical, spiral, and edge-on galaxies. A large
set of image features is extracted from each image, and the most informative
features are selected using Fisher scores. Test images can then be classified
using a simple Weighted Nearest Neighbor rule such that the Fisher scores are
used as the feature weights. Experimental results show that galaxy images from
Galaxy Zoo can be classified automatically to spiral, elliptical and edge-on
galaxies with accuracy of ~90% compared to classifications carried out by the
author. Full compilable source code of the algorithm is available for free
download, and its general-purpose nature makes it suitable for other uses that
involve automatic image analysis of celestial objects.
