We report smooth relativistic Hartree-Fock pseudopotentials (also known as
averaged relativistic effective potentials or AREPs) and spin-orbit operators
for the atoms H to Ba and Lu to Hg. We remove the unphysical extremely
non-local behaviour resulting from the exchange interaction in a controlled
manner, and represent the resulting pseudopotentials in an analytic form
suitable for use within standard quantum chemistry codes. These
pseudopotentials are suitable for use within Hartree-Fock and correlated wave
function methods, including diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations.
