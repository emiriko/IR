We discuss the potential to observe effects of CP violation in squark decay
chains at the LHC. As the CP-violating observable we use the asymmetry composed
by triple products of final state momenta. Extending methods for momentum
reconstruction we show that there are good prospects for observation of these
effects at the LHC. Finally, we include the main experimental factors and
discuss the expected sensitivity.
