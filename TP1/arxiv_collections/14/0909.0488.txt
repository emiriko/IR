Let A be a bounded, relatively closed subset of the upper half plane H whose
complement C is simply connected. If B_t is a standard complex Brownian motion
starting at iy and t_A = inf {t > 0: B_t not in C}, the half-plane capacity of
A, hcap(A) is defined to be the limit as y goes to infinity of y E[Im(B_{t_A}].
This quantity arises naturally in the study of Schramm-Loewner Evolutions
(SLE). In this note, we show that hcap(A) is comparable to a more geometric
quantity hsiz(A) that we define to be the 2-dimensional Lebesgue measure of the
union of all balls tangent to R whose centers belong to A. Our main result is
that hsiz(A)/66 < hcap(A) leq 7 hsiz(A)/(2 pi).
