Nontrivial infinitesimal bendings for a class of two-dimensional surfaces are
constructed. The surfaces considered here are orientable; compact; with
boundary; have positive curvature everywhere except at finitely many planar
points; and have vanishing first homology group.As a consequence, a nonrigidity
result for such surfaces is deduced.
