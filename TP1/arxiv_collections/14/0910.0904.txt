A simultaneous arithmetic progression (s.a.p.) of length k consists of k
points (x_i, y_\sigma(i)), where x_i and y_i are arithmetic progressions and
\sigma is a permutation. Garcia-Selfa and Tornero asked whether there is a
bound on the length of an s.a.p. on an elliptic curve in Weierstrass form over
Q. We show that 4319 is such a bound for curves over R. This is done by
considering translates of the curve in a grid as a graph. A simple upper bound
is found for the number of crossings and the 'crossing inequality' gives a
lower bound. Together these bound the length of an s.a.p. on the curve. We then
use a similar method to extend the result to arbitrary real algebraic curves.
Instead of considering s.a.p.'s we consider k^2/3 points in a grid. The number
of crossings is bounded by Bezout's Theorem. We then give another proof using a
result of Jarnik bounding the number of grid points on a convex curve. This
result applies as any real algebraic curve can be broken up into convex and
concave parts, the number of which depend on the degree. Lastly, these results
are extended to complex algebraic curves.
