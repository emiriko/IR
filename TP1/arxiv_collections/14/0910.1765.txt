We compute the pair entanglement between two interacting bosons in a two
dimensional (2D)isotropic harmonic trap. The interaction potential is modeled
by a 2D regularized pseudo-potential. By analytically decomposing the wave
function into the single particle basis, we show the dependency of the pair
entanglement on the scattering length. Our results turn out to be in good
agreements with earlier results using a quasi-2D geometry.
