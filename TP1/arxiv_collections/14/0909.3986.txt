Recently, Horava proposed a power counting renormalizable theory for
(3+1)-dimensional quantum gravity, which reduces to Einstein gravity with a
non-vanishing cosmological constant in IR, but possesses improved UV behaviors.
In this work, we analyze the stability of the Einstein static universe by
considering linear homogeneous perturbations in the context of an IR
modification of Horava gravity, which implies a `soft' breaking of the
`detailed balance' condition. The stability regions of the Einstein static
universe are parameterized by the linear equation of state parameter w=p/\rho
and the parameters appearing in the Horava theory, and it is shown that a large
class of stable solutions exists in the respective parameter space.
