Measurements and modeling of electron spin transport and dynamics are used to
characterize hyperfine interactions in Fe/GaAs devices with $n$-GaAs channels.
Ga and As nuclei are polarized by electrically injected electron spins, and the
nuclear polarization is detected indirectly through the depolarization of
electron spins in the hyperfine field. The dependence of the electron spin
signal on injector bias and applied field direction is modeled by a coupled
drift-diffusion equation, including effective fields from both the electronic
and nuclear polarizations. This approach is used to determine the electron spin
polarization independently of the assumptions made in standard transport
measurements. The extreme sensitivity of the electron spin dynamics to the
nuclear spin polarization also facilitates the electrical detection of nuclear
magnetic resonance.
