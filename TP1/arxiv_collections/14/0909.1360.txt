We report the local measurements of the magnetic penetration depth $\lambda$
in a superconducting Nb film using magnetic force microscopy (MFM). We
developed a method for quantitative extraction of the penetration depth from
single-parameter simultaneous fits to the lateral and height profiles of the
MFM signal, and demonstrate that the obtained value is in excellent agreement
with that obtained from the bulk magnetization measurements.
