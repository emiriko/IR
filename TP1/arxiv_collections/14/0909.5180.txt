We present experiments on the magnetic field-dependent thermal transport in
the spin-1/2 ladder system (C$_5$H$_{12}$N)$_2$CuBr$_4$. The thermal
conductivity $\kappa(B)$ is only weakly affected by the field-induced
transitions between the gapless Luttinger-liquid state realized for $B_{c1}< B
< B_{c2}$ and the gapped states, suggesting the absence of a direct
contribution of the spin excitations to the heat transport. We observe,
however, that the thermal conductivity is strongly suppressed by the magnetic
field deeply within the Luttinger-liquid state. These surprising observations
are discussed in terms of localization of spinons within finite ladder segments
and spinon-phonon umklapp scattering of the predominantly phononic heat
transport.
