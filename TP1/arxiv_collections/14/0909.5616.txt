We present a characterization method based on spectral cross-correlation to
obtain the physical parameters of the controversial stellar aggregate
ESO442-SC04. The data used was obtained with GMOS at Gemini-South telescope
including 17 stars in the central region of the ob ject and 6 standard-stars.
FXCOR was used in an iterative process to obtain self-consistent radial
velocities for the standard-stars and averaged radial velocities for the
science spectra. Spectral types, effective temperature, suface gravity and
metallicities parameters were determined using FXCOR to correlate cluster
spectra with ELODIE spectral library and selecting the best correlation matches
using the Tonry and Davis Ratio (TDR). Analysis of the results suggests that
the stars in ESO442-SC04 are not bound and therefore they do not constitute a
physical system.
