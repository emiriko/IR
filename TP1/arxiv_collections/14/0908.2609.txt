Duistermaat and van der Kallen show that there is no nontrivial complex
Laurent polynomial all of whose powers have a zero constant term. Inspired by
this, Sturmfels posed two questions: Do the constant terms of a generic Laurent
polynomial form a regular sequence? If so, then what is the degree of the
associated zero-dimensional ideal? In this note, we prove that the Eulerian
numbers provide the answer to the second question. The proof involves
reinterpreting the problem in terms of toric geometry.
