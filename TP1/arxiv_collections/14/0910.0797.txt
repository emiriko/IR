Ultra low frequency-ULF (1 Hz or lower), kHz and MHz electromagnetic (EM)
anomalies were recorded prior to the L'Aquila catastrophic earthquake (EQ) that
occurred on April 6, 2009. The detected anomalies followed this temporal
scheme. (i) The MHZ EM anomalies were detected on March 26, 2009 and April 2,
2009. The kHz EM anomalies were emerged on April, 4 2009. The ULF EM anomaly
was continuously recorded from March 29, 2009 up to April 2, 2009. "Are EQs
predictable?" is a question hotly debated in the science community. Its answer
begs for another question: "Are there credible EQ precursors?". Despite fairly
abundant circumstantial evidence pre-seismic EM signals have not been
adequately accepted as real physical quantities. Therefore, the question
effortlessly arises as to whether the observed anomalies before the L'Aquila EQ
were seismogenic or not. The main goal of this work is to provide some insight
into this issue.
