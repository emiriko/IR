We prove, outside the influence region of a ball of radius $R_0$ centered in
the origin of the initial data hypersurface, the existence of global solutions
near to Kerr spacetime, provided that the initial data are sufficiently near to
those of Kerr; This external region is the "far" part of the outer region of
the perturbed Kerr spacetime. Moreover if we assume that the corrections to the
Kerr metric decay sufficiently fast, $o(r^{-3})$, we prove that the various
null components of the Riemann tensor decay in agreement with the "Peeling
theorem".
