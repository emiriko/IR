We study triaxial bright solitons made of attractive Bose-condensed atoms
characterized by the absence of confinement in the longitudinal axial direction
but trapped by an anisotropic harmonic potential in the transverse plane. By
numerically solving the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation we
investigate the effect of the transverse trap anisotropy on the critical
interaction strength above which there is the collapse of the condensate. The
comparison with previous predictions [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 66}, 043619 (2002)]
shows significant differences for large anisotropies.
