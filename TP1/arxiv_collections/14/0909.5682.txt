A three-generation SU(5) GUT, that is 3x(10+5bar) and a single 5-5bar pair,
is constructed by compactification of the E_8 heterotic string. The base
manifold is the Z_5 x Z_5-quotient of the quintic, and the vector bundle is the
quotient of a positive monad. The group action on the monad and its
bundle-valued cohomology is discussed in detail, including topological
restrictions on the existence of equivariant structures. This model and a
single Z_5 quotient are the complete list of three generation quotients of
positive monads on the quintic.
