Direction relations between extended spatial objects are important
commonsense knowledge. Recently, Goyal and Egenhofer proposed a formal model,
known as Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC), for representing direction
relations between connected plane regions. CDC is perhaps the most expressive
qualitative calculus for directional information, and has attracted increasing
interest from areas such as artificial intelligence, geographical information
science, and image retrieval. Given a network of CDC constraints, the
consistency problem is deciding if the network is realizable by connected
regions in the real plane. This paper provides a cubic algorithm for checking
consistency of basic CDC constraint networks, and proves that reasoning with
CDC is in general an NP-Complete problem. For a consistent network of basic CDC
constraints, our algorithm also returns a 'canonical' solution in cubic time.
This cubic algorithm is also adapted to cope with cardinal directions between
possibly disconnected regions, in which case currently the best algorithm is of
time complexity O(n^5).
