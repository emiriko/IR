The KATRIN experiment is going to search for the mass of the electron
antineutrino down to 0.2 eV/c^2. In order to reach this sensitivity the
background rate has to be understood and minimised to 0.01 counts per second.
One of the background sources is the unavoidable Penning trap for electrons due
to the combination of the electric and magnetic fields between the pre- and the
main spectrometer at KATRIN. In this article we will show that by sweeping a
conducting wire periodically through such a particle trap stored particles can
be removed, an ongoing discharge in the trap can be stopped, and the count rate
measured with a detector looking at the trap is reduced.
