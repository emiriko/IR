Ligands for only two human olfactory receptors are known. One of them, OR1D2,
binds to Bourgeonal [Malnic B, Godfrey P-A, Buck L-B (2004) The human olfactory
receptor gene family. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 101: 2584-2589 and Erratum
in: Proc Natl Acad Sci U. S. A. (2004) 101: 7205]. OR1D2, OR1D4 and OR1D5 are
three full length olfactory receptors present in an olfactory locus in human
genome. These receptors are more than 80% identical in DNA sequences and have
108 base pair mismatches among them. We have used L-system mathematics and have
been able to show a closely related subfamily of OR1D2, OR1D4 and OR1D5.
