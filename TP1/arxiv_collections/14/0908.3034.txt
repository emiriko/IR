We investigate the possibility of a trans-Planckian duality, which exchanges
a manifold of events (space-time), with a manifold of momenta
(energy-momentum). Gravity has a dual counter-part, that is, a geometric theory
defined on the manifold of momenta. We provide a mathematical framework that
can possibly realize this idea, and analyze its classical behaviour.
