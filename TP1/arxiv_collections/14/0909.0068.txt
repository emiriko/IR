Acoustic lenses are employed in a variety of applications, from biomedical
imaging and surgery, to defense systems, but their performance is limited by
their linear operational envelope and complexity. Here we show a dramatic
focusing effect and the generation of large amplitude, compact acoustic pulses
(sound bullets) in solid and fluid media, enabled by a tunable, highly
nonlinear acoustic lens. The lens consists of ordered arrays of granular
chains. The amplitude, size and location of the sound bullets can be controlled
by varying static pre-compression on the chains. We support our findings with
theory, numerical simulations, and corroborate the results experimentally with
photoelasticity measurements. Our nonlinear lens makes possible a qualitatively
new way of generating high-energy acoustic pulses, enabling, for example,
surgical control of acoustic energy.
