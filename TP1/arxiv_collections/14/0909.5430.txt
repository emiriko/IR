We study the phenomenon of accidental or "emergent" supersymmetry within
gauge theory and connect it to the scenarios of Split Supersymmetry and Higgs
compositeness. Combining these elements leads to a significant refinement and
extension of the proposal of Partial Supersymmetry, in which supersymmetry is
broken at very high energies but with a remnant surviving to the weak scale.
The Hierarchy Problem is then solved by a non-trivial partnership between
supersymmetry and compositeness, giving a promising approach for reconciling
Higgs naturalness with the wealth of precision experimental data. We discuss
aspects of this scenario from the AdS/CFT dual viewpoint of higher-dimensional
warped compactification. It is argued that string theory constructions with
high scale supersymmetry breaking which realize warped/composite solutions to
the Hierarchy Problem may well be accompanied by some or all of the features
described. The central phenomenological considerations and expectations are
discussed, with more detailed modelling within warped effective field theory
reserved for future work.
