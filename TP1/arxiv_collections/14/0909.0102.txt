We demonstrate the realization of a new scheme for cold atom gravimetry based
on the use of double diffraction beamsplitters recently demonstrated in
\cite{Leveque}, where the use of two retro-reflected Raman beams allows
symmetric diffraction in $\pm \hbar k_{eff}$ momenta. Though in principle
restricted to the case of zero Doppler shift, for which the two pairs of Raman
beams are simultaneously resonant, we demonstrate that such diffraction pulses
can remain efficient on atoms with non zero velocity, such as in a gravimeter,
when modulating the frequency of one of the two Raman laser sources. We use
such pulses to realize an interferometer insensitive to laser phase noise and
some of the dominant systematics. This reduces the technical requirements and
would allow the realization of a simple atomic gravimeter. We demonstrate a
sensitivity of $1.2\times10^{-7}g$ per shot.
