We present our description of neutrino induced charged current quasielastic
scattering (CCQE) in nuclei at energies relevant for the MiniBooNE experiment.
In our framework, the nucleons, with initial momentum distributions according
to the Local Fermi Gas model, move in a density- and momentum-dependent mean
field potential. The broadening of the outgoing nucleons due to nucleon-nucleon
interactions is taken into account by spectral functions. Long range (RPA)
correlations renormalizing the electroweak strength in the medium are also
incorporated. The background from resonance excitation events that do not lead
to pions in the final state is also predicted by propagating the outgoing
hadrons with the Giessen semiclassical BUU model in coupled channels (GiBUU).
We achieve a good description of the shape of the CCQE Q2 distribution
extracted from data by MiniBooNE, thanks to the inclusion of RPA correlations,
but underestimate the integrated cross section when the standard value of MA =
1 GeV is used. Possible reasons for this mismatch are discussed.
