We determine the conditions under which topological order survives a rapid
quantum quench. Specifically, we consider the case where a quantum spin system
is prepared in the ground state of the Toric Code Model and, after the quench,
it evolves with a Hamiltonian that does not support topological order. We
provide analytical results supported by numerical evidence for a variety of
quench Hamiltonians. The robustness of topological order under non-equilibrium
situations is tested by studying the topological entropy and a novel dynamical
measure, which makes use of the similarity between partial density matrices
obtained from different topological sectors.
