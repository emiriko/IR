The Lambdac(2940)+ baryon with possible quantum numbers J(P) = 1/2+ and 1/2-
is studied as a molecular state composed of a nucleon and D* meson. We give
predictions for the strong two-body decay channels Lambdac(2940)+ to p D0,
Sigmac(++) pi(-) and Sigmac(0) pi(+) where the sum of partial widths is
consistent with current data for the case of J(P) = 1/2(+). The case of J(P) =
1/2(-) is shown to be ruled out.
