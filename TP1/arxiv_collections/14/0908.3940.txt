After briefly reviewing the gauge symmetry in Moyal spacetimes, we analyse
aspects of symmetry breaking within a quantisation program preserving the
twisted Poincar\'e symmetry. We develop the LSZ approach for Moyal spacetimes
and derive a mapping for scattering amplitudes on these spacetimes from the
corresponding ones on the commutative spacetime. This map applies in the
presence of spontaneous breakdown of symmetries as well. We also derive
Goldstone's theorem on Moyal spacetime. The formalism developed here can be
directly applied to the twisted standard model.
