We have obtained a full suite of Spitzer observations to characterize the
debris disk around HR 8799 and to explore how its properties are related to the
recently discovered set of three massive planets orbiting the star. We
distinguish three components to the debris system: (1) warm dust (T ~150 K)
orbiting within the innermost planet; (2) a broad zone of cold dust (T ~45 K)
with a sharp inner edge, orbiting just outside the outermost planet and
presumably sculpted by it; and (3) a dramatic halo of small grains originating
in the cold dust component. The high level of dynamical activity implied by
this halo may arise due to enhanced gravitational stirring by the massive
planets. The relatively young age of HR 8799 places it in an important early
stage of development and may provide some help in understanding the interaction
of planets and planetary debris, an important process in the evolution of our
own solar system.
