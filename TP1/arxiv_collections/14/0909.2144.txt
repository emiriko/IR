We theoretically study the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in phase-separated
two-component Bose-Einstein condensates using the Gross-Pitaevskii and
Bogoliubov-de Gennes models. A flat interface between the two condensates is
shown to deform into sawtooth or Stokes-like waves, leading to the formation of
singly quantized vortices on the peaks and troughs of the waves. This scenario
of interface instability in quantum fluids is quite different from that in
classical fluids.
