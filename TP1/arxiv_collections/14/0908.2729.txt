In this paper we introduce the concept of $(\varepsilon)$-almost paracontact
manifolds, and in particular, of $(\varepsilon)$-para Sasakian manifolds.
Several examples are presented. Some typical identities for curvature tensor
and Ricci tensor of $(\varepsilon)$-para Sasakian manifolds are obtained. We
prove that if a semi-Riemannian manifold is one of flat, proper recurrent or
proper Ricci-recurrent, then it can not admit an $(\varepsilon)$-para Sasakian
structure. We show that, for an $(\varepsilon)$-para Sasakian manifold, the
conditions of being symmetric, semi-symmetric or of constant sectional
curvature are all identical. It is shown that a symmetric spacelike (resp.
timelike) $(\varepsilon)$-para Sasakian manifold $M^{n}$ is locally isometric
to a pseudohyperbolic space $H_{\nu}^{n}(1)$ (resp. pseudosphere
$S_{\nu}^{n}(1)$). In last, it is proved that for an $(\varepsilon)$-para
Sasakian manifold, the conditions of being Ricci-semisymmetric, Ricci-symmetric
and Einstein are all identical.
