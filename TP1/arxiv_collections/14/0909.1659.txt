Radar is a critical tool for maintaining knowledge of the many ob-jects in
low Earth orbit and thus for maintaining confidence that societies around the
world are secure against a variety of space-based threats. It is therefore
important to raise awareness that LEO objects are embedded in the envelope of
relatively dense plasma that co-rotates with the Earth (ionosphere-plasmasphere
system) and thus accurate tracking must cor-rect for the group delay and
refraction caused by that system. This paper seeks to promote that awareness by
reviewing those effects and high-lighting key issues: the need to customise
correction to the altitude of the tracked object and prevailing space weather
conditions, that ionospheric correction may be particularly important as an
object approaches re-entry. The paper outlines research approaches that should
lead to better techniques for ionospheric correction and shows how these might
be pur-sued in the context of the EURIPOS initiative.
