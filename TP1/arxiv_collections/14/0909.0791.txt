Quantum-optical coherence tomography (Q-OCT) is an interferometric technique
for axial imaging offering several advantages over conventional methods.
Chirped-pulse interferometry (CPI) was recently demonstrated to exhibit all of
the benefits of the quantum interferometer upon which Q-OCT is based. Here we
use CPI to measure axial interferograms to profile a sample accruing the
important benefits of Q-OCT, including automatic dispersion cancellation, but
with 10 million times higher signal. Our technique solves the artifact problem
in Q-OCT and highlights the power of classical correlation in optical imaging.
