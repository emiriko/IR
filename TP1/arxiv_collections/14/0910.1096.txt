We study and construct non-abelian hermitian Yang-Mills (HYM) instantons on
Calabi-Yau cones. By means of a particular isometry preserving ansatz, the HYM
equations are reduced to a novel Higgs-Yang-Mills flow on the Einstein-Kahler
base. For any 2d-dimensional Calabi-Yau cone, we find explicit solutions of the
flow equations that correspond to non-trivial SU(d) HYM instantons. These can
be regarded as deformations of the spin connection of the Calabi-Yau cone.
