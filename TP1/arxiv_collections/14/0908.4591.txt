Recent observations of Cepheids using infrared interferometry and Spitzer
photometry have detected the presence of circumstellar envelopes (CSE) of dust
and it has been hypothesized that the CSE's are due to dust forming in a
Cepheid wind. Here we use a modified Castor, Abbott & Klein formalism to
produce a Cepheid wind, and this is used to estimate the contribution of mass
loss to the Cepheid mass discrepancy Furthermore, we test the OGLE-III
Classical Cepheids using the IR fluxes from the SAGE survey to determine if
Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids have CSE's. It is found that IR excess is a
common phenomenon for LMC Cepheids and that the resulting mass-loss rates can
explain at least a fraction of the Cepheid mass discrepancy, depending on the
assumed dust-to-gas ratio in the wind.
