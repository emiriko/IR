The microscopic theory of Josephson effect in point contacts between two-band
superconductors is developed. The general expression for the Josephson current,
which is valid for arbitrary temperatures, is obtained. We considered the dirty
superconductors with interband scattering, which produces the coupling of the
Josephson currents between different bands. The influence of phase shifts and
interband scattering rates in the banks is analyzed near critical temperature
Tc. It is shown that for some values of parameters the critical current can be
negative, which means the pi-junction behavior.
