According to the Carter-Israel conjecture, the end-state of the gravitational
collapse of matter is a Kerr-Newman black hole. Nevertheless, neither the
theory nor observations can confirm that. In this talk, we discuss the
possibility that the collapsing matter can create a super-spinning compact
object with no event horizon, and we show how near future observations at
sub-millimeter wavelength of SgrA* can test this scenario for the black hole
candidate in the Galactic Center.
