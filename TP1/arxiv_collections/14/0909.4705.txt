We aim to characterise the appearance and behaviour of a flare and filament
ejection which occurred on 8th September 1999 and was observed by TRACE in
L-alpha as well as by the Yohkoh Soft and Hard X-ray telescopes. We explore the
flare energetics and its spatial and temporal evolution. A correction is
applied to the TRACE data to obtain a better estimate of the pure L-alpha
signature. The L-alpha power is obtained from a knowledge of the TRACE response
function, and the flare electron energy budget is estimated by interpreting
Yohkoh/HXT emission in the context of the collisional thick target model.
