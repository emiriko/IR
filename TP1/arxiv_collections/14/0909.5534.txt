We demonstrate Doppler-free saturated absorption spectroscopy of cold
molecular radicals formed by laser ablation inside a cryogenic buffer gas cell.
By lowering the temperature, congested regions of the spectrum can be
simplified, and by using different temperatures for different regions of the
spectrum a wide range of rotational states can be studied optimally. We use the
technique to study the optical spectrum of YbF radicals with a resolution of 30
MHz, measuring the magnetic hyperfine parameters of the electronic ground
state. The method is suitable for high resolution spectroscopy of a great
variety of molecules at controlled temperature and pressure, and is
particularly well-suited to those that are difficult to produce in the gas
phase.
