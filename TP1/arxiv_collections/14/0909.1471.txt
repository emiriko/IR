We consider the Lie algebra of derivations of a zero dimensional local
complex algebra. We describe an inequality involving the embedding dimension,
the order, and the first deviation that forces this Lie algebra to be solvable.
Our result was motivated by and generalizes the solvability of the Yau algebra
of an isolated hypersurface singularity.
