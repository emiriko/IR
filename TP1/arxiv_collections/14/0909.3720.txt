We consider entropic uncertainty relations for outcomes of the measurements
of a quantum state in 3 or more mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), chosen from the
standard construction of MUBs in prime dimension. We show that, for any choice
of 3 MUBs and at least one choice of a larger number of MUBs, the best possible
entropic uncertainty relation can be only marginally better than the one that
trivially follows from the relation by Maassen and Uffink (PRL, 1987) for 2
bases.
