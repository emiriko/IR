Electron captures on nuclei play an important role in the dynamics of the
collapsing core of a massive star that leads to a supernova explosion. Recent
calculations of these capture rates were based on microscopic models which
account for relevant degrees of freedom. Due to computational restrictions such
calculations were limited to a modest number of nuclei, mainly in the mass
range A=45-110. Recent supernova simulations show that this pool of nuclei,
however, omits the very neutron-rich and heavy nuclei which dominate the
nuclear composition during the last phase of the collapse before neutrino
trapping. Assuming that the composition is given by Nuclear Statistical
Equilibrium we present here electron capture rates for collapse conditions
derived from individual rates for roughly 2700 individual nuclei. For those
nuclei which dominate in the early stage of the collapse, the individual rates
are derived within the framework of microscopic models, while for the nuclei
which dominate at high densities we have derived the rates based on the Random
Phase Approximation with a global parametrization of the single particle
occupation numbers. In addition, we have improved previous rate evaluations by
properly including screening corrections to the reaction rates into account.
