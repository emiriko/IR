Surface electromagnetic modes supported by metal surfaces have a great
potential for uses in miniaturised detectors and optical circuits. For many
applications these modes are excited locally. In the optical regime, Surface
Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) have been thought to dominate the fields at the
surface, beyond a transition region comprising 3-4 wavelengths from the source.
In this work we demonstrate that at sufficiently long distances SPPs are not
the main contribution to the field. Instead, for all metals, a different type
of wave prevails, which we term Norton waves for their reminiscence to those
found in the radio-wave regime at the surface of the Earth. Our results show
that Norton Waves are stronger at the surface than SPPs at distances larger
than 6-9 SPP's absorption lengths, the precise value depending on wavelength
and metal. Moreover, Norton waves decay more slowly than SPPs in the direction
normal to the surface.
