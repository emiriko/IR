This short review aims to summarize on "What the Charge Density Waves can
tell to other inhomogeneous states in strongly correlated systems, particularly
to spin-polarized superconductors". We shall update on expanding observations
of solitons in quasi 1D CDW conductors and link them to the growing information
and demands related to inhomogeneous spin-polarized states in superconductors.
The related theory, existent or awaited for, stretches from solitons in 1D
models to vortex-like elementary excitations in 2D,3D ordered incommensurate
CDWs and superconductors.
