For quantum states of two subsystems, entanglement measures are related to
capacities of communication tasks -- highly entangled states give higher
capacity of transmitting classical as well as quantum information. However, we
show that this is no more the case in general: quantum capacities of
multi-access channels, motivated by communication in quantum networks, do not
have any relation with genuine multiparty entanglement measures. Along with
revealing the structural richness of multi-access channel capacities, this
gives us a tool to classify multiparty quantum states from the perspective of
its usefulness in quantum networks, which cannot be visualized by known
multiparty entanglement measures.
