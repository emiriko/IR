Quantum-mechanical molecular-dynamics simulations are carried out to explore
possible precursor states of nano-polycrystalline diamond, a novel ultra-hard
material produced directly from graphite. Large-scale simulation with 10^5
atoms is realized by using the ' order-N' simulation code 'ELSES'
(http://www.elses.jp). The simulation starts with a diamond structure that
contains initial structural defects and results in a mixture of
graphite(sp^2)-like and diamond(sp^3)-like regions as nano-meter-scale domains.
We speculate that the domains are metastable and are possible candidates of the
precursor structures.
