Combining density-functional theory calculations with many-body
Green's-function technique, we reveal that the macroscopic magnetization in
half-metallic antiferromagnets does not vanish at finite temperature as for the
T=0 limit. This anomalous behavior stems from the inequivalent magnetic
sublattices which lead to different intrasublattice exchange interactions. As a
consequence, the spin fluctuations suppress the magnetic order of the
sublattices in a different way leading to a ferrimagnetic state at finite
temperatures. Computational results are presented for the half-metallic
antiferromagnetic CrMnZ (Z=P,As,Sb) semi-Heusler compounds.
