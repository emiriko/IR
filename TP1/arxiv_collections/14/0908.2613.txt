We present the results of near-infrared spectroscopic observations of dense
($\simgt$ 10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$) iron ejecta in the young core-collapse supernova
remnant G11.2-0.3. Five ejecta knots projected to be close to its center show a
large dispersion in their Doppler shifts: two knots in the east are blueshifted
by more than 1,000 \kms, while three western knots have relatively small
blueshifts of 20-60 \kms. This velocity discrepancy may indicate that the
western knots have been significantly decelerated or that there exists a
systematic velocity difference among the knots. One ejecta filament in the
northwestern boundary, on the other hand, is redshifted by $\simgt$ 200 \kms,
while opposite filament in the southeastern boundary shows a negligible radial
motion. Some of the knots and filaments have secondary velocity components, and
one knot shows a bow shock-like feature in the velocity structure. The iron
ejecta appear to be devoid of strong emission from other heavy elements, such
as S, which may attest to the alpha-rich freezeout process in the explosive
nucleosynthesis of the core-collapse supernova explosion close to its center.
The prominent bipolar distribution of the Fe ejecta in the northwestern and
southeastern direction, along with the elongation of the central pulsar wind
nebula in the perpendicular direction, is consistent with the interpretation
that the supernova exploded primarily along the northwestern and southeastern
direction.
