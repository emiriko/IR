We show that a dilute ensemble of epoxy-bonded adatoms on graphene has a
tendency to form a spatially correlated state accompanied by a gap in
graphene's electron spectrum. This effect emerges from the electron-mediated
interaction between adatoms with a peculiar $1/r^3$ distance dependence. The
partial ordering transition is described by a random bond three state Potts
model.
