We consider first an interesting connection between the development of
physics and the Boston Red Sox. We then discuss in detail the collider
phenomenology, as well as precision electroweak observables of a very light
neutralino. We conclude by considering also the astrophysics and cosmology of a
very light neutralino. We find that a massless neutralino is consistent with
all present data.
