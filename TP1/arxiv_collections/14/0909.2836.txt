The CP-violation necessary for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the
Universe in the "flavoured" leptogenesis scenario can arise from the "low
energy" PMNS neutrino mixing matrix and/or from the "high energy" part of
neutrino Yukawa couplings, which can mediate CP-violating phenomena only at
some high energy scale. The possible interplay between these two types of
CP-violation is discussed. The type I see-saw model with three heavy
right-handed Majorana neutrinos having hierarchical spectrum is considered. The
analysis shows that there exist regions in the leptogenesis parameter space
where the relevant "high energy" phases have large CP-violating values, but the
purely "high energy" contribution to the baryon asymmetry plays a
subdominant/suppressed role in the production of baryon asymmetry compatible
with the observations and one can have successful leptogenesis if the requisite
CP-violation is provided by the Majorana phase(s) in the neutrino mixing
matrix.
