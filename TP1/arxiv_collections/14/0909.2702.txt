There has not been a comprehensive framework for comparing spectral data from
different planets.Such a framework is needed for the study of extrasolar
planets and objects within the solar system. We have undertaken observations to
compile a library of planet spectra for all planets, some moons, and some dwarf
planets in the solar system to study their general spectroscopic and
photometric natures. During May and November of 2008, we acquired spectra for
the planets using TRISPEC, which is capable of simultaneous three-band
spectroscopy in a wide wavelength range of 0.45 - 2.5 microns with low
resolving power (lambda-over-Delta-lambda is 140 - 360). Patterns emerge from
comparing the spectra. Analyzing their general spectroscopic and photometric
natures, we show that it is possible to distinguish between gas planets, soil
planets and ice planets. These methods can be applied to extrasolar
observations using low resolution spectrography or broad-band filters. The
present planet spectral library is the first library to contain observational
spectra for all of the solar system planets, based on simultaneous observations
in visible and near infrared wavelengths. This library will be a useful
reference for analyzing extrasolar planet spectra, and for calibrating
planetary data sets.
