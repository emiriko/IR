We re-examine the infrared counterpart of the dipping low-mass x-ray binary
4U1323-619. New X-ray data available from the XMM and Chandra observatories
combined with archival IR observations from the ESO 3.6m New Technology
Telescope allow us to define a new possible counterpart. We present here its
photometric properties and compare them with a simple analytical model of an
accretion disc illuminated by the hot central corona known to be present in the
binary system.
