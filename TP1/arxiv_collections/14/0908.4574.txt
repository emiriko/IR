A new strategy to select candidate blazars for VHE observations, that gives
an inherently complete sample from an all-sky compilation (excluding a narrow
region around the galactic plane) of GeV-bright blazars is presented.
  The strategy is based on selecting candidate VHE blazars from a GeV-detected
blazar sample, namely the LAT-bright-AGN-sample (LBAS) of the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope (FGST). The intrinsic spectra in the VHE regime is estimated
based on the extrapolation of the GeV spectra measured with FGST. This is
corrected for the unavoidable extinction due to the Extragalactic Background
Light (EBL) in the UV to mid-IR. The resulting observable spectra ranked by the
integrated flux is used to extract candidates for observations in the VHE
regime with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). The predictions
are cross-checked using the sample of known VHE blazars.
