In our modern society, people are daily confronted with an increasing amount
of information of any kind. As a consequence, the attention capacities and
processing abilities of individuals often saturate. People, therefore, have to
select which elements of their environment they are focusing on, and which are
ignored. Moreover, recent work shows that individuals are naturally attracted
by what other people are interested in. This imitative behaviour gives rise to
various herding phenomena, such as the spread of ideas or the outbreak of
commercial trends, turning the understanding of collective attention an
important issue of our society. In this article, we propose an individual-based
model of collective attention. In a situation where a group of people is facing
a steady flow of novel information, the model naturally reproduces the
log-normal distribution of the attention each news item receives, in agreement
with empirical observations. Furthermore, the model predicts that the
popularity of a news item strongly depends on the number of concurrent news
appearing at approximately the same moment. We confirmed this prediction by
means of empirical data extracted from the website digg.com. This result can be
interpreted from the point of view of competition between the news for the
limited attention capacity of individuals. The proposed model, therefore,
provides new elements to better understand the dynamics of collective attention
in an information-rich world.
