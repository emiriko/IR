We address the question of how to determine the stop mixing angle and its
CP-violating phase at the LHC. As an observable we discuss ratios of branching
ratios for different decay modes of the light stop ~t_1 to charginos and
neutralinos. These observables can have a very strong dependence on the
parameters of the stop sector. We discuss in detail the origin of these
effects. Using various combinations of the ratios of branching ratios we argue
that, depending on the scenario, the observable may be promising in exposing
the light stop mass, the mixing angle and the CP phase. This will, however,
require a good knowledge of the supersymmetric spectrum, which is likely to be
achievable only in combination with results from a linear collider.
