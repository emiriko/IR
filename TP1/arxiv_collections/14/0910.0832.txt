We consider the problem of exploring an anonymous unoriented ring of size $n$
by $k$ identical, oblivious, asynchronous mobile robots, that are unable to
communicate, yet have the ability to sense their environment and take decisions
based on their local view. Previous works in this weak scenario prove that $k$
must not divide $n$ for a deterministic solution to exist. Also, it is known
that the minimum number of robots (either deterministic or probabilistic) to
explore a ring of size $n$ is 4. An upper bound of 17 robots holds in the
deterministic case while 4 probabilistic robots are sufficient. In this paper,
we close the complexity gap in the deterministic setting, by proving that no
deterministic exploration is feasible with less than five robots whenever the
size of the ring is even, and that five robots are sufficient for any $n$ that
is coprime with five. Our protocol completes exploration in O(n) robot moves,
which is also optimal.
