The role of magnetic helicity in astrophysical large-scale dynamos is
reviewed and compared with cases where there is no energy supply and an initial
magnetic field can only decay. In both cases magnetic energy tends to get
redistributed to larger scales. Depending on the efficiency of magnetic
helicity fluxes, the decay of a helical field can speed up. Likewise, the
saturation of a helical dynamo can speed up through magnetic helicity fluxes.
The astrophysical importance of these processes is reviewed in the context of
the solar dynamo and an estimated upper limit for the magnetic helicity flux of
10^46 Mx^2/cycle is given.
