We perform a detailed study of the type IIA superstring in AdS(4) x CP(3).
After introducing suitable bosonic light-cone and fermionic kappa worldsheet
gauges we derive the pure boson and fermion SU(2|2) x U(1) covariant light-cone
Hamiltonian up to quartic order in fields.
  As a first application of our derivation we calculate energy shifts for
string configurations in a closed fermionic subsector and successfully match
these with a set of light-cone Bethe equations. We then turn to investigate the
mismatch between the degrees of freedom of scattering states and oscillatory
string modes. Since only light string modes appear as fundamental Bethe roots
in the scattering theory, the physical role of the remaining $4_F+4_B$ massive
oscillators is rather unclear. By continuing a line of research initiated by
Zarembo, we shed light on this question by calculating quantum corrections for
the propagators of the bosonic massive fields. We show that, once loop
corrections are incorporated, the massive coordinates dissolve in a continuum
state of two light particles.
