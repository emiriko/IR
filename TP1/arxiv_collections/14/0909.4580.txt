We consider the effect of non-magnetic impurities on the onset temperature
$T^*$ for the $d-$wave pairing in spin-fluctuation scenario for the cuprates.
We analyze intermediate coupling regime when the magnetic correlation length
$\xi/a >1$ and the dimensionless coupling $u$ is O(1). In the clean limit, $T^*
\approx 0.02 v_f/a$ in this parameter range, and weakly depends on $\xi$ and
$u$. We found numerically that this universal pairing scale is also quite
robust with respect to impurities: the scattering rate $\Gamma_{cr}$ needed to
bring $T^*$ down to zero is about 4 times larger than in weak coupling, in good
quantitative agreement with experiments. We provide analytical reasoning for
this result.
