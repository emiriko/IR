We present the next-to-leading strong interaction corrections to the Delta
F=2 Hamiltonian in the MSSM with exact diagonalization of the squark mass
matrices. These results allow phenomenological studies of neutral meson mixing
in scenarios with non-degenerate squarks, with control over the renormalization
scale and scheme dependence.
