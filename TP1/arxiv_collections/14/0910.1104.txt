Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x is the only cuprate superconductor that can be made into a
round-wire conductor form with a high enough critical current density Jc for
applications. Here we show that the Jc(5 T,4.2 K) of such Ag-sheathed
filamentary wires can be doubled to more than 1.4x10^5 A/cm^2 by low
temperature oxygenation. Careful analysis shows that the improved performance
is associated with a 12 K reduction in transition temperature Tc to 80 K and a
significant enhancement in intergranular connectivity. In spite of the
macroscopically untextured nature of the wire, overdoping is highly effective
in producing high Jc values.
