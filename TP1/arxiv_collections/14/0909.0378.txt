We study the transmission through single and double ferromagnetic barriers on
the surface of a topological insulator. By adjusting the gate voltage and
magnetization oreintation, the ferromagnetic barrier can be tuned into various
transmission regions, where the wavevector-dependent tunnelings are quite
different. We find that the Klein tunneling can be manipulated or even be
turned off. These special properties offer the possibility to control electron
beams on the "topological metal". Various novel devices, such as electronic
collimation, wavevector filter, magnetic and electric switchs, and
wavevector-based spin valve, may be constructed based on our observed
phenomena.
