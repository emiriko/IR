We report molecular dynamics simulation results for two-component fluid
mixtures of Gaussian-core particles, focusing on how tracer diffusivities and
static pair correlations depend on temperature, particle concentration, and
composition. At low particle concentrations, these systems behave like simple
atomic mixtures. However, for intermediate concentrations, the single-particle
dynamics of the two species largely decouple, giving rise to the following
anomalous trends. Increasing either the concentration of the fluid (at fixed
composition) or the mole fraction of the larger particles (at fixed particle
concentration) enhances the tracer diffusivity of the larger particles, but
decreases that of the smaller particles. In fact, at sufficiently high particle
concentrations, the larger particles exhibit higher mobility than the smaller
particles. Each of these dynamic behaviors is accompanied by a corresponding
structural trend that characterizes how either concentration or composition
affects the strength of the static pair correlations. Specifically, the dynamic
trends observed here are consistent with a single empirical scaling law that
relates an appropriately normalized tracer diffusivity to its pair-correlation
contribution to the excess entropy.
