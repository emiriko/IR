The Jacobi curve of an extremal of optimal control problem is a curve in a
Lagrangian Grassmannian defined up to a symplectic transformation and
containing all information about the solutions of the Jacobi equations along
this extremal. In our previous works we constructed the canonical bundle of
moving frames and the complete system of symplectic invariants, called
curvature maps, for parametrized curves in Lagrange Grassmannians satisfying
very general assumptions. The structural equation for a canonical moving frame
of the Jacobi curve of an extremal can be interpreted as the normal form for
the Jacobi equation along this extremal and the curvature maps can be seen as
the "coefficients" of this normal form. In the case of a Riemannian metric
there is only one curvature map and it is naturally related to the Riemannian
sectional curvature. In the present paper we study the curvature maps for a
sub-Riemannian structure on a corank 1 distribution having an additional
transversal infinitesimal symmetry. After the factorization by the integral
foliation of this symmetry, such sub-Riemannian structure can be reduced to a
Riemannian manifold equipped with a closed 2-form (a magnetic field). We obtain
explicit expressions for the curvature maps of the original sub-Riemannian
structure in terms of the curvature tensor of this Riemannian manifold and the
magnetic field. We also estimate the number of conjugate points along the
sub-Riemannian extremals in terms of the bounds for the curvature tensor of
this Riemannian manifold and the magnetic field in the case of an uniform
magnetic field. The language developed for the calculation of the curvature
maps can be applied to more general sub-Riemannian structures with symmetries,
including sub-Riemmannian structures appearing naturally in Yang-Mills fields.
