The possibility of explicit CP violation is studied in a supersymmetric model
proposed by Dine, Seiberg, and Thomas, with two effective dimension-five
operators. The explicit CP violation may be triggered by complex phases in the
coefficients for the dimension-five operators in the Higgs potential, and by a
complex phase in the scalar top quark masses. Although the scenario of explicit
CP violation is found to be inconsistent with the experimental data at LEP2 at
the tree level, it may be possible at the one-loop level. For a reasonable
parameter space, the masses of the neutral Higgs bosons and their couplings to
a pair of $Z$ bosons are consistent with the LEP2 data, at the one-loop level.
