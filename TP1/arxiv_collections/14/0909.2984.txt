The resistance at the charge neutral (Dirac) point was shown by Checkelsky et
al in Phys. Rev. B 79, 115434 (2009) to diverge upon the application of a
strong magnetic field normal to graphene. We argue that this divergence is the
signature for a Kekule instability of graphene, which is induced by the
magnetic field. We show that the strong magnetic field does not remove the zero
modes that bind a fraction of the electron around vortices in the Kekule
dimerization pattern, and that quenched disorder present in the system makes it
energetically possible to separate the fractional charges. These findings,
altogether, indicate that graphene can sustain deconfined fractionalized
electrons.
