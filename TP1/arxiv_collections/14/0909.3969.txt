In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with complex parameters,
one-loop corrections to the decay of a stop into a bottom-quark and a chargino
can lead to a CP violating decay rate asymmetry. We perform a detailed
numerical analysis of this asymmetry and also of the branching ratio of the
decay, analyzing the dependence on the parameters and complex phases involved.
In addition, we take the Yukawa couplings of the top- and bottom-quark running.
We account for the constraints on the parameters coming from the experimental
limit of the electric dipole moment of the electron by calculating and thus
checking it automatically along the way. We obtain as results that the
asymmetry rises up to 24 percent, depending on the point in parameter space.
The combined quantity asymmetry times branching ratio reaches up to 3.5
percent. We also comment on the feasibility of measuring this asymmetry at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It will be possible to measure our decay
rate asymmetry at LHC.
