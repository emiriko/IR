Very recently the new low-temperature (TC ~ 3K) superconductor (SC) SrPd2Ge2
has been reported. This compound is isostructural with curently intensively
studied group of so-called "122" SC's (based on tetragonal AM2Pn2 phases, where
A are Sr, Ba; M are d metals and Pn are pnictogens: As or P), but it is
pnictogen-free. Here, by means of first-principle FLAPW-GGA calculations, we
have studied the electronic structure of new SC SrPd2Ge2. The band structure,
total and partial densities of states and Fermi surface topology for SrPd2Ge2
are evaluated and discussed in comparison with those of isostructural SrNi2Ge2
and SrNi2As2 phases.
