We report new estimates of the time delays in the quadruple gravitationally
lensed quasar PG1115+080, obtained from the monitoring data in filter R with
the 1.5-m telescope at the Maidanak Mountain (Uzbekistan, Central Asia) in
2004-2006. The time delays are 16.4 days between images C and B, and 12 days
between C and A1+A2, with image C being leading for both pairs. The only known
estimates of the time delays in PG1115 are those based on observations by
Schechter et al. (1997) -- 23.7 and 9.4 days between images C and B, C and
A1+A2, respectively, as calculated by Schechter et al., and 25 and 13.3 days as
revised by Barkana (1997) for the same image components with the use of another
method. The new values of time delays in PG 1115+080 may be expected to provide
larger estimates of the Hubble constant thus decreasing a diversity between the
H_0 estimates taken from gravitationally lensed quasars and with other methods.
