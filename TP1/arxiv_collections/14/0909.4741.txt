We show that three dimensional superconductors, described within a Bogoliubov
de Gennes framework can have zero energy bound states associated with pointlike
topological defects. The Majorana fermions associated with these modes have
non-Abelian exchange statistics, despite the fact that the braid group is
trivial in three dimensions. This can occur because the defects are associated
with an orientation that can undergo topologically nontrivial rotations. A new
feature of three dimensional systems is that there are "braidless" operations
in which it is possible to manipulate the groundstate associated with a set of
defects without moving or measuring them. To illustrate these effects we
analyze specific architectures involving topological insulators and
superconductors.
