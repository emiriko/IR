It is shown that the specific heat jump at the superconducting transition
temperature in pnictide and cuprate superconductors is produced by ferroelastic
fluctuations just below the transition temperature. The amplitude of the
corresponding lattice distortion is estimated. It is shown that a contribution
from ferroelastic fluctuations to the specific heat jump is also present in
low-temperature superconductors.
