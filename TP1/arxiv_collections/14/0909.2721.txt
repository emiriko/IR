Providing on-line services on the Internet will require the definition of
flexible interfaces that are capable of adapting to the user's characteristics.
This is all the more important in the context of medical applications like home
monitoring, where no two patients have the same medical profile. Still, the
problem is not limited to the capacity of defining generic interfaces, as has
been made possible by UIML, but also to define the underlying information
structures from which these may be generated. The DIATELIC project deals with
the tele-monitoring of patients under peritoneal dialysis. By means of XML
abstractions, termed as "medical components", to represent the patient's
profile, the application configures the customizable properties of the
patient's interface and generates a UIML document dynamically. The interface
allows the patient to feed the data manually or use a device which allows
"automatic data acquisition". The acquired medical data is transferred to an
expert system, which analyses the data and sends alerts to the medical staff.
In this paper we show how UIML can be seen as one component within a global XML
based architecture.
