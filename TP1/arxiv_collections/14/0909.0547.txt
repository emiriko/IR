The quality factor and energy decay time of superconducting resonators have
been measured as a function of material, geometry, and magnetic field. Once the
dissipation of trapped magnetic vortices is minimized, we identify surface
two-level states (TLS) as an important decay mechanism. A wide gap between the
center conductor and the ground plane, as well as use of the superconductor Re
instead of Al, are shown to decrease loss. We also demonstrate that classical
measurements of resonator quality factor at low excitation power are consistent
with single-photon decay time measured using qubit-resonator swap experiments.
