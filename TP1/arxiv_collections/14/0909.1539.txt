This work summarizes the main results of the operation of the International
Program Luminescence of Cave Minerals of the commission on Physical Chemistry
and Hydrogeology of Karst of UIS of UNESCO in the field of activators of
speleothem luminescence. It discusses Activators of Luminescence in Speleothems
as a source of major mistakes in the interpretation of luminescent
paleoclimatic records. It demonstrates the existence of 6 types of luminescence
of speleothems and cave minerals in dependence of the type of the luminescence
center and its incorporation in the mineral. 24 different activators of
photoluminescence of speleothem calcite and 11 of aragonite are studied. This
paper demonstrates that it is impossible to produce reliable Paleotemperature
or Past Precipitation records from luminescence of speleothems without
establishing the organic origin of the entire luminescence of the particular
sample.
