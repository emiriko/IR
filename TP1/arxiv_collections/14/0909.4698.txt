A new Lagrangian of EW interactions without spontaneous symmetry breaking,
Higgs, and Fadeev-Popov procedure has been constructed. It consists of three
parts: $SU(2)_L\times U(1)$ gauge fields, massive fermion fields, and their
interactions. In this theory the gauge coupling constants g, g', and fermion
masses are the inputs. A new mechanism of $SU(2)_L\times U(1)$ symmetry
breaking caused by fermion masses has been found. In the EW theory top quark
mass plays a dominant role. This mechanism leads to nonperturbative generation
of the gauge fixings and masses of Z and W fields. $m^2_W={1\over2}g^2 m^2_t,
m^2_Z={1\over2}\bar{g}^2 m^2_t, G_F=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}m^2_t}$ are revealed from
this theory. The propagators of Z- and W-fields without quadratic divergent
terms are derived. Very heavy neutral and charged scalars are dynamically
generated from this theory too.
