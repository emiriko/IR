Radiation reaction effects on ion acceleration in laser foil interaction are
investigated via analytical modeling and multi-dimensional particle-in-cell
simulations. We find the radiation effects are important in the area where some
electrons move backwards due to static charge separation field at the laser
intensity of 1022 W=cm2. Radiation reaction tends to impede these backwards
motion. In the optical transparency region ion acceleration is enhanced when
the radiation effects are considered.
