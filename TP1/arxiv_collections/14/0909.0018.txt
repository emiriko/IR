We report long-slit spectroscopic observations of SDSS J092712+294344
carried-out at the recently commissioned 2m telescope in IUCAA Girawali
Observatory, India. This AGN-like source is known to feature three sets of
emission lines at zem = 0.6972, 0.7020 and 0.7128. Different scenarios such as
a recoiling black hole after asymmetric emission of gravitational waves, binary
black holes and possible merging systems are proposed for this object. We test
these scenarios by comparing our spectra with that from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS), obtained 4 years prior to our observations. Comparing the
redshifts of [OIII]4960,5008 we put a 3 sigma limit on the relative
acceleration to be less than 32 km s^-1 yr^-1 between different emitting
regions. Using the 2D spectra obtained at different position angles we show
that the [OIII]5008 line from the zem = 0.7128 component is extended beyond the
spectral point spread function. We infer the linear extent of this line
emitting region is ~8 kpc. We also find a tentative evidence for an offset
between the centroid of the [OIII]5008 line at zem = 0.7128 and the QSO trace
when the slit is aligned at a position angle of 299 degrees. This corresponds
to the zem = 0.7128 system being at an impact parameter of ~1 kpc with respect
to the zem = 0.6972 in the north west direction. Based on our observations we
conclude that the binary black hole model is most unlikely. The spatial extent
and the sizes are consistent with both black hole recoil and merging scenarios.
