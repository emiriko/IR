We analyze isospin breaking through quark mass differences and virtual
photons in the pion-nucleon scattering lengths in all physical channels in the
framework of covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory. The so-called
triangle relation is found to be violated by about 1.5 %. We encounter a
substantial isospin-breaking correction to neutral-pion-nucleon scattering
beyond Weinberg's prediction due to a cusp effect. Finally, the application to
hadronic atoms is briefly discussed.
