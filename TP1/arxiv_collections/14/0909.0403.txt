The recent weak lensing measurement of the dark matter mass of the
high-redshift galaxy cluster XMMUJ2235.3-2557 of (8.5 +- 1.7) x 10^{14} Msun at
z=1.4, indicates that, if the cluster is assumed to be the result of the
collapse of dark matter in a primordial gaussian field in the standard LCDM
model, then its abundance should be < 0.002 clusters in the observed area. Here
we investigate how to boost the probability of XMMUJ2235.3-2557 in particular
resorting to deviations from Gaussian initial conditions. We show that this
abundance can be boosted by factors > 3-10 if the non-Gaussianity parameter
f^local_NL is in the range 150-200. This value is comparable to the limit for
f_NL obtained by current constraints from the CMB. We conclude that mass
determination of high-redshift, massive clusters can offer a complementary
probe of primordial non-gaussianity.
