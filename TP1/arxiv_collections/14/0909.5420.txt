In this paper we describe a way to achieve the extraordinary transmission
regime from sub-wavelength slits carved on semiconductor substrates. Unlike
metals, the dielectric permittivity of typical semiconductors like GaAs or GaP
is negative beginning in the extreme UV range (lambda <= 270nm). We show that
the metal-like response of bulk semiconductors exhibits surface plasmon waves
that lead to extraordinary transmission in the UV and soft X-ray ranges. The
importance of realistic material response versus perfect conductors is also
discussed. These findings may be important in high resolution
photo-lithography, near field optical devices and ultra high density optical
storage.
