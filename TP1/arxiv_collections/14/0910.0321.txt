Elastic wave characteristics of the heat conduction in low-temperature thin
wires can be studied via a wave scattering formalism. A reaction matrix
formulation of heat conductance modeled by elastic wave scattering is
advocated. This formulation allows us to treat thin wires with arbitrary
surface disorder. It is found that the correlation in the surface disorder may
significantly affect the temperature dependence of the heat conductance.
