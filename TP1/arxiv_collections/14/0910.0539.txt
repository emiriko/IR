This paper deals with elliptic equations in the plane with degeneracies. The
equations are generated by a complex vector field that is elliptic everywhere
except along a simple closed curve. Kernels for these equations are
constructed. Properties of solutions, in a neighborhood of the degeneracy
curve, are obtained through integral and series representations. An application
to a second order elliptic equation with a punctual singularity is given.
