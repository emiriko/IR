By considering similar observed properties of gamma ray bursts (GRB) and
solar flares with the prevailing physical conditions in the cosmic environment,
the following study suggests that most likely and promising energy source for
the central engine which triggers GRB may be due to primordial flares, solar
flare like phenomena, at the sites of inter galactic or inter galactic clusters
in the early universe. The derived energy-redshift relation, E = E_{0}{(1+z)}^3
(where E is the amount of energy released, z is the redshift of GRB and E_{0}
is a constant which is estimated to be ~ 10^{52} ergs), from the simple flare
mechanism, is confirmed from the least square fit with the observed
energy-redshift relation. Some of the physical parameters like length scale,
strength of magnetic field, etc., of the flaring region of the GRB are
estimated.
