A systematic method is presented for constructing increasingly precise
sequences to refocus off-resonant spin evolution with severely limited control
amplitude. Sequences obtained should be readily applicable to the case of
electron spin qubits in quantum dots with random nuclear fields, and other
qubit systems with systematic qubit splitting errors comparable to control
field amplitude.
