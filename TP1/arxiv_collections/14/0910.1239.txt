Using constraint-based local search, we effectively model and efficiently
solve the problem of balancing the traffic demands on portions of the European
airspace while ensuring that their capacity constraints are satisfied. The
traffic demand of a portion of airspace is the hourly number of flights planned
to enter it, and its capacity is the upper bound on this number under which
air-traffic controllers can work. Currently, the only form of demand-capacity
balancing we allow is ground holding, that is the changing of the take-off
times of not yet airborne flights. Experiments with projected European flight
plans of the year 2030 show that already this first form of demand-capacity
balancing is feasible without incurring too much total delay and that it can
lead to a significantly better demand-capacity balance.
