In this paper the complex dispersion curves of the four lowest-order
transverse magnetic modes of a dielectric Goubau line ($\epsilon>0, \mu>0$) are
compared with those of a dispersive metamaterial Goubau line. The vastly
different dispersion curve structure for the metamaterial Goubau line is
characterized by unusual features such as mode bifurcation, complex fold
points, both proper and improper complex modes, and merging of complex and real
modes.
