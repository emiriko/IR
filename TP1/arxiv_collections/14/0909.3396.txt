The statistical physics and dynamics of double supported bilayers are studied
theoretically. The main goal in designing double supported lipid bilayers is to
obtain model systems of biomembranes: the upper bilayer is meant to be almost
freely floating, the substrate being screened by the lower bilayer. The
fluctuation-induced repulsion between membranes and between the lower membrane
and the wall are explicitly taken into account using a Gaussian variational
approach. It is shown that the variational parameters, the "effective"
adsorption strength and the average distance to the substrate, depend strongly
on temperature and membrane elastic moduli, the bending rigidity and the
microscopic surface tension, which is a signature of the crucial role played by
membrane fluctuations. The range of stability of these supported membranes is
studied, showing a complex dependence on bare adsorption strengths. In
particular, the experimental conditions to have an upper membrane slightly
perturbed by the lower one and still bound to the surface are found. Included
in the theoretical calculation of the damping rates associated with membrane
normal modes are hydrodynamic friction by the wall and hydrodynamic
interactions between both membranes.
