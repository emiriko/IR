The dielectric anomalies of window-type glasses at low temperatures ($T<$ 1
K) are rather successfully explained by the two-level systems (2LS) tunneling
model (TM). However, the magnetic effects discovered in the multisilicate
glasses in recent times \cite{ref1}-\cite{ref3}, and also some older data from
mixed (SiO$_2$)$_{1-x}$(K$_2$O)$_x$ and (SiO$_2$)$_{1-x}$(Na$_2$O)$_x$ glasses
\cite{ref4}, indicate the need for a suitable generalization of the 2LS TM. We
show that, not only for the magnetic effects \cite{ref3,ref5} but also for the
mixed glasses in the absence of a field, the right extension of the 2LS TM is
provided by the (anomalous) multilevel tunneling systems approach proposed by
one of us. It appears that new 2LS develop via dilution near the hull of the
SiO$_4$-percolating clusters in the mixed glasses.
