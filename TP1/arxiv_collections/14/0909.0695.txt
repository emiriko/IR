The recently found material graphene is a truly two-dimensional crystal and
exhibits, in addition, an extreme mechanical strength. This in combination with
the high electron mobility favours graphene for electromechanical
investigations down to the quantum limit. Here, we show that a monolayer of
graphene on SiO2 provides natural, ultra-small membranes of diameters down to 3
nm, which are caused by the intrinsic rippling of the material. Some of these
nano-membranes can be switched hysteretically between two vertical positions
using the electric field of the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM).
They can also be forced to oscillatory motion by a low frequency ac-field.
Using the mechanical constants determined previously, we estimate a high
resonance frequency up to 0.4 THz. This might be favorable for
quantum-electromechanics and is prospective for single atom mass spectrometers.
