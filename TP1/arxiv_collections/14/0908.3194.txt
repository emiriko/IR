The INT Photometric H-Alpha Survey (IPHAS) is particular effective in tracing
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars across the Galactic disk due to its use of
broad-band r' and i' filters, and the clear separation of the dwarf and giant
branches in the colour-colour diagram. Here we discuss some results from our
studies of the Galactic AGB population that has been revealed by IPHAS. This
includes a photometric study, our spectroscopic follow-up campaign, and the
photometric technique that allows us to separate O-rich, S-type and carbon
stars across the entire Galactic disk based on their IPHAS photometry alone. We
also discuss the potential impact of this technique on our understanding of the
dredge-up process in AGB stars, Galactic chemical evolution, and the structure
and properties of the Galactic disk.
