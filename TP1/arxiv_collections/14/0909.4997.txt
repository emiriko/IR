We investigate Dirac mass matrices derived in the gauge field theory of a
horizontal symmetry generated by a central extension of the Pauli algebra.
Through numerical analyses of the observed data of the charged fermion masses
and the flavor mixing matrix of quarks, values of free parameters in the mass
matrices are determined and several empirical relations are found among the
Yukawa coupling constants. As one specific feature of the theory, we find
different orderings in squared mass eigenvalues for the up and down quark
sectors.
