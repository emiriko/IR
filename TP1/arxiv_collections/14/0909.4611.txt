We present a multi-line study of the massive star-forming region IRAS
22506+5944. A new 6.7 GHz methanol maser was detected. 12CO, 13CO, C18O and
HCO+ J = 1-0 transition observations reveal a star formation complex consisting
mainly of two cores. The dominant core has a mass of more than 200 solar mass,
while another one only about 35 solar mass. Both cores are obviously at
different evolutionary stages. A 12CO energetic bipolar outflow was detected
with an outflow mass of about 15 solar mass.
