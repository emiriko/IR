We have embedded the classical theory of stochastic finance into a
differential geometric framework called Geometric Arbitrage Theory and show
that it is possible to:
  --Write arbitrage as curvature of a principal fibre bundle.
  --Parameterize arbitrage strategies by its holonomy.
  --Give the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing a differential homotopic
characterization.
  --Characterize Geometric Arbitrage Theory by five principles and show they
they are consistent with the classical theory of stochastic finance.
  --Derive for a closed market the equilibrium solution for market portfolio
and dynamics in the cases where:
  -->Arbitrage is allowed but minimized.
  -->Arbitrage is not allowed.
  --Prove that the no-free-lunch-with-vanishing-risk condition implies the zero
curvature condition.
