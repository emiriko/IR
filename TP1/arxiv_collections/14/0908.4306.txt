(Abridged) We present the LogN-LogS and spatial distributions of X-ray point
sources in seven Galactic Bulge (GB) fields within 4 deg from the Galactic
Center (GC). We compare the properties of 1159 X-ray point sources discovered
in our deep (100 ks) Chandra observations of three low extinction Window fields
near the GC with the X-ray sources in the other GB fields centered around Sgr
B2, Sgr C, the Arches Cluster and Sgr A* using Chandra archival data. To reduce
the systematic errors induced by the uncertain X-ray spectra of the sources
coupled with field-and-distance dependent extinction, we classify the X-ray
sources using quantile analysis and estimate their fluxes accordingly. The
result indicates the GB X-ray population is highly concentrated at the center,
more heavily than the stellar distribution models. We also compare the total
X-ray and infrared surface brightness using the Chandra and Spitzer
observations of the regions. The radial distribution of the total infrared
surface brightness from the 3.6 band $\mu$m images appears to resemble the
radial distribution of the X-ray point sources better than predicted by the
stellar distribution models. Assuming a simple power law model for the X-ray
spectra, the closer to the GC the intrinsically harder the X-ray spectra
appear, but adding an iron emission line at 6.7 keV in the model allows the
spectra of the GB X-ray sources to be largely consistent across the region.
This implies that the majority of these GB X-ray sources can be of the same or
similar type. Their X-ray luminosity and spectral properties support the idea
that the most likely candidate is magnetic cataclysmic variables (CVs),
primarily intermediate polars (IPs). Their observed number density is also
consistent with the majority being IPs.
