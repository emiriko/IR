A market with defaultable bonds where the bond dynamics is in a
Heath-Jarrow-Morton setting and the forward rates are driven by an infinite
number of Levy factors is considered. The setting includes rating migrations
driven by a Markov chain. All basic types of recovery are investigated. We
formulate necessary and sufficient conditions (generalized HJM conditions)
under which the market is arbitrage free. Connections with consistency
conditions are discussed.
