The analysis of quantum-correlated $D-\bar{D}$ decays produced at the
$\psi(3770)$ resonance gives unique insight into quantities such as
strong-phase differences and coherence factors. Knowledge of these parameters
is invaluable for measurements of the CKM-angle $\gamma$ ($\phi_3$) in $B \to
DK$ decays. Results from CLEO-c analyses performed at the $\psi(3770)$
resonance in a variety of decay channels are reported, and their consequences
for the determination of $\gamma$ is assessed. Future prospects are given for
extensions to the present studies.
