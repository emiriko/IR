We present the results of extensive multi-frequency monitoring of the radio
galaxy 3C 120 between 2002 and 2007 at X-ray, optical, and radio wave bands, as
well as imaging with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). Over the 5 yr of
observation, significant dips in the X-ray light curve are followed by
ejections of bright superluminal knots in the VLBA images. Consistent with
this, the X-ray flux and 37 GHz flux are anti-correlated with X-ray leading the
radio variations. This implies that, in this radio galaxy, the radiative state
of accretion disk plus corona system, where the X-rays are produced, has a
direct effect on the events in the jet, where the radio emission originates.
The X-ray power spectral density of 3C 120 shows a break, with steeper slope at
shorter timescale and the break timescale is commensurate with the mass of the
central black hole based on observations of Seyfert galaxies and black hole
X-ray binaries. These findings provide support for the paradigm that black hole
X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei are fundamentally similar systems,
with characteristic time and size scales linearly proportional to the mass of
the central black hole. The X-ray and optical variations are strongly
correlated in 3C 120, which implies that the optical emission in this object
arises from the same general region as the X-rays, i.e., in the accretion
disk-corona system. We numerically model multi-wavelength light curves of 3C
120 from such a system with the optical-UV emission produced in the disk and
the X-rays generated by scattering of thermal photons by hot electrons in the
corona. From the comparison of the temporal properties of the model light
curves to that of the observed variability, we constrain the physical size of
the corona and the distances of the emitting regions from the central BH.
