We calculate the transmission of electrons and holes between two normal-metal
electrodes (N), separated over a distance L by an impurity-free superconductor
(S) with d-wave symmetry of the order parameter. Nodal lines of vanishing
excitation gap form ballistic conduction channels for coupled electron-hole
excitations, described by an anisotropic two-dimensional Dirac equation. We
find that the transmitted electrical and thermal currents, at zero energy, both
have the pseudodiffusive 1/L scaling characteristic of massless Dirac fermions
- regardless of the presence of tunnel barriers at the NS interfaces. Tunnel
barriers reduce the slope of the 1/L scaling in the case of the electrical
current, while leaving the thermal current unaffected.
