Scientific communication is an essential part of modern science: whereas
Archimedes worked alone, Newton (1676) acknowledged that "If I have seen a
little further, it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants." How is
scientific communication reflected in the patterns of citations in scientific
papers? How have these patterns changed in the 20th century, as both means of
communication and individual transportation changed rapidly, compared to the
earlier post-Newton 18th and 19th centuries? Here we discuss a physical model
for scientific communications, based on an informetric study of 25 million
papers and 600 million citations; the physical model itself relies on analogies
with glass relaxation, where virtually identical patterns have been identified
in 50 well designed experiments. The model reveals a surprisingly universal
internal structure in the development of scientific research, which is
essentially constant across the natural sciences, but which changed
qualitatively around 1960.
