We report on the first local atomic structure study via the pair density
function (PDF) analysis of neutron diffraction data and show a direct
correlation of local coordinates to TC in the newly discovered superconducting
FeSe1-xTex. The isovalent substitution of Te for Se such as in FeSe0.5Te0.5
increases Tc by twofold in comparison to a-FeSe without changing the carrier
concentration but, on average, decreases the chalcogen-Fe bond angle. However,
we find that the local symmetry is lower than the average P4/nmm crystal
symmetry, because the Se and Te ions do not share the same site, leading to two
distinct z-coordinates that exhibit two types of bond angles with Fe. The angle
indeed increases from ~ 104.02o in FeSe to ~105.20o in FeSe0.5Te0.5 between Fe
and Se. Simultaneously, ab-initio calculations based on spin density function
theory yielded an optimized structure with distinct z-coordinates for Se and
Te, in agreement with the experiment. The valence charge distribution in the
Fe-Se bonds was found to be different from that in the Fe-Te bonds. Thus,
superconductivity in this chalcogenide is closely related to the local
structural environment, with direct implications on the multiband magnetism
where modulations of the ionic lattice can change the distribution of valence
electrons.
