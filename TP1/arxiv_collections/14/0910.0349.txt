In Data Mining, the usefulness of association rules is strongly limited by
the huge amount of delivered rules. In this paper we propose a new approach to
prune and filter discovered rules. Using Domain Ontologies, we strengthen the
integration of user knowledge in the post-processing task. Furthermore, an
interactive and iterative framework is designed to assist the user along the
analyzing task. On the one hand, we represent user domain knowledge using a
Domain Ontology over database. On the other hand, a novel technique is
suggested to prune and to filter discovered rules. The proposed framework was
applied successfully over the client database provided by Nantes Habitat.
