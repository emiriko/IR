The generalized Born--Infeld electrodynamics with two parameters is
investigated. In this model the propagation of a linearly polarized laser beam
in the external transverse magnetic field is considered. It was shown that
there is the effect of vacuum birefringence, and we evaluate induced
ellipticity. The upper bounds on the combination of parameters introduced from
the experimental data of BRST and PVLAS Collaborations were obtained. When two
parameters are equal to each other, we arrive at Born--Infeld electrodynamics
and the effect of vacuum birefringence vanishes. We find the canonical and
symmetrical Belinfante energy-momentum tensors. The trace of the
energy-momentum tensor is not zero and the dilatation symmetry is broken. The
four-divergence of the dilatation current is equal to the trace of the
Belinfante energy-momentum tensor and is proportional to the parameter (with
the dimension of the field strength) of the model. The dual symmetry is also
broken in the model considered.
