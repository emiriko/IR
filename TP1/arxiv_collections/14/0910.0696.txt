We discuss the topology of the wavefunctions of two-dimensional time-reversal
symmetric superconductors. We consider (a) the planar state, (b) a system with
broken up-down reflection symmetry, and (c) a system with general spin-orbit
interaction. We show explicitly how the relative sign of the order parameter on
the two Fermi surfaces affects this topology, and clarify the meaning of the
$Z_2$ classification for these topological states.
