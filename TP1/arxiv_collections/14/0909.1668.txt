Glaciations were attributed to variations of the Earths orbit (Milankovitch
cycles). But the best ever dated paleoclimatic record (from a speleothem from
Devils Hole, Nevada) demonstrated that the end of the last glacial period
(termination II) happened 10 000 years before the one suggested by the orbital
variations, i.e. the result appeared before the reason. This fact suggests that
there is something wrong in the theory. Glaciations and deglaciations drive
changes of the sea level. Changes in the speed of Earths rotation during
glacial- interglacial transitions produce fracturing of the Earths crust and
major earthquakes along the fractures. The intensity of this process is as
higher as faster is the change of the sea level and as higher is its amplitude.
Much higher dimensions of this process may be caused by eruptive increasing of
solar luminosity, which may be caused only by collision of large asteroids with
the Sun. Such collision may cause Bible Deluge type of event.
