We present a single crystal neutron diffraction study of the magnetic
short-range correlations in Tb$_5$Ge$_4$ which orders antiferromagnetically
below the Neel temperature $T_N$ $\approx$ 92 K. Strong diffuse scattering
arising from magnetic short-range correlations was observed in wide temperature
ranges both below and above $T_N$. The antiferromagnetic ordering in
Tb$_5$Ge$_4$ can be described as strongly coupled ferromagnetic block layers in
the $ac$-plane that stack along the b-axis with weak antiferromagnetic
inter-layer coupling. Diffuse scattering was observed along both $a^*$ and
$b^*$ directions indicating three-dimensional short-range correlations.
Moreover, the $q$-dependence of the diffuse scattering is Squared-Lorentzian in
form suggesting a strongly clustered magnetic state that may be related to the
proposed Griffiths-like phase in Gd$_5$Ge$_4$.
