Different screening models in quantum cascade lasers are compared by
calculating the contribution of intra-subband impurity scattering to the
optical linewidth as a function of temperature. We find a strong impact of
impurity scattering which is increasing substantially with temperature. A
simple isotropic bulk screening model works well if the screening length is of
the order or longer than the period length of the cascade structure.
