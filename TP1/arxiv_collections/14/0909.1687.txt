We experimentally demonstrate that the statistical properties of distances
between pedestrians which are hindered from avoiding each other are described
by the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble of random matrices. The same result has
recently been obtained for an $n$-tuple of non-intersecting (one-dimensional,
unidirectional) random walks. Thus, the observed behavior of autonomous walkers
conditioned not to cross their trajectories (or, in other words, to stay in
strict order at any time) resembles non-intersecting random walks.
