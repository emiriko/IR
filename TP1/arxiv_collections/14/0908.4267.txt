Neutrino physics is now poised to move into the precision regime. Active
attempts are under way to commence the era of precision neutrino measurement
science which will surely widen the horizon of our knowledge about neutrinos. A
number of high-precision neutrino oscillation experiments have been contrived
to sharpen our understanding about these tiny particles. This is the right time
to ask how different planned/proposed next generation experiments in the coming
decades would perform to explicate the nature of neutrinos and our thrust for
new physics. This thesis is an effort to have a look on several aspects of
these issues.
