We report the physical reasons of a curious decrease in the crater depth
observed for long delays in experiments with femtosecond double pulses.
Detailed hydrodynamic modeling demonstrates that the ablation mechanism is
dumped when the delay between the pulses exceeds the electron-ion relaxation
time. In this case, the interaction of the second laser pulse with the
expanding target material leads to the formation of the second shock wave
suppressing the rarefaction wave created by the first pulse. The evidence of
this effect follows from the pressure and density profiles obtained at
different delays after the first laser pulse.
