The force exerted by a semi-infinite inhomogeneous superconductor with a
planar interface to vacuum on a magnetic tip is studied theoretically in the
absence of external magnetic fields. It is shown that the force has a
contribution from inhomogeneities due to material defects with unique
characteristics. Defects are taken into account in the London limit by allowing
the mass parameter to vary spatially. The contribution from defects to the
force is calculated analytically to first order in the deviation of the mass
parameter from its constant value for the homogeneous superconductor, assuming
that the tip is a point dipole perpendicular to the interface, and that it does
not spontaneously create vortex matter. Random point defects and linear
localized defects are considered phenomenologically. For each defect type the
force dependence on the dipole position coordinates is obtained, and the force
magnitudes are estimated numerically. The predictions for the dependence of the
linear defect force on the dipole lateral position are found to agree
qualitatively with experiment.
