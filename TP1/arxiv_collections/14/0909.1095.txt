This review article describes the trapping of charged particles. The main
principles of electromagnetic confinement of various species from elementary
particles to heavy atoms are briefly described. The preparation and
manipulation with trapped single particles, as well as methods of frequency
measurements, providing unprecedented precision, are discussed. Unique
applications of Penning traps in fundamental physics are presented.
Ultra-precise trap-measurements of masses and magnetic moments of elementary
particles (electrons, positrons, protons and antiprotons) confirm
CPT-conservation, and allow accurate determination of the fine-structure
constant alpha and other fundamental constants. This together with the
information on the unitarity of the quark-mixing matrix, derived from the
trap-measurements of atomic masses, serves for assessment of the Standard Model
of the physics world. Direct mass measurements of nuclides targeted to some
advanced problems of astrophysics and nuclear physics are also presented.
