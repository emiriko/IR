We have developed a new type of opposed-anvil high pressure cell with
substantially improved space efficiency. The clamp cell and the gasket are made
of non-magnetic Ni-Cr-Al alloy. Non-magnetic tungsten carbide (NMWC) is used
for the anvils. The assembled cell with the dimension \phi 29mm \times 41mm is
capable of generating pressure up to 9 GPa over a relatively large volume of 7
mm3. Our cell is particularly suitable for those experiments which require
large sample space to achieve good signal-to-noise ratio, such as the nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment. Argon is used as the pressure transmitting
medium to obtain good hydrostaticity. The pressure was calibrated in situ by
measuring the fluorescence from ruby through a transparent moissanite (6H-SiC)
window. We have measured the pressure and temperature dependences of the 63Cu
nuclear-quadrupole-resonance (NQR) frequency of Cu2O, the in-plane Knight shift
of metallic tin, and the Knight shift of platinum. These quantities can be used
as reliable manometers to determine the pressure values in situ during the
NMR/NQR experiments up to 9 GPa.
