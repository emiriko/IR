In this work we consider vortex lattices in rotating Bose-Einstein
Condensates composed of two species of bosons having different masses.
Previously [1] it was claimed that the vortices of the two species form bound
pairs and the two vortex lattices lock. Remarkably, the two condensates and the
external drive all rotate at different speeds due to the disparity of the
masses of the constituent bosons. In this paper we study the system by solving
the full two-component Gross-Pitaevskii equations numerically. Using this
approach we verify the stability of the putative locked state which is found to
exist within a disk centered on the axis of rotation and which depends on the
mass ratio of the two bosons. We also show that an analytic estimate of this
locking radius based on a two-body force calculation agrees well with the
numerical results.
