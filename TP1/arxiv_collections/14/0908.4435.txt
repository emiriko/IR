We study entanglement dynamics in the presence of correlated environmental
noises. Specifically, we investigate the quantum entanglement dynamics of two
spins in the presence of correlated classical white noises, deriving Markov
master equation and obtaining explicit solutions for several interesting
classes of initial states including Bell states and X form density matrices. We
show how entanglement can be enhanced or reduced by the correlation between the
two participating noises.
