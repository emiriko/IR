The SPI spectrometer aboard the INTEGRAL mission observes regularly the Crab
Nebula since 2003. We report on observations distributed over 5.5 years and
investigate the variability of the intensity and spectral shape of this
remarkable source in the hard X-rays domain up to a few MeV. While single power
law models give a good description in the X-ray domain (mean photon index ~
2.05) and MeV domain (photon index ~ 2.23), crucial information are contained
in the evolution of the slope with energy between these two values. This study
has been carried out trough individual observations and long duration (~ 400
ks) averaged spectra. The stability of the emission is remarkable and excludes
a single power law model. The slopes measured below and above 100 keV agree
perfectly with the last values reported in the X-ray and MeV regions
respectively, but without indication of a localized break point. This suggests
a gradual softening in the emission around 100 keV and thus a continuous
evolution rather than an actual change in the mechanism parameters. In the MeV
region, no significant deviation from the proposed power law model is visible
up to 5-6 MeV. Finally, we take advantage of the spectroscopic capability of
the instrument to seek for previously reported spectral features in the covered
energy range with negative results for any significant cyclotron or
annihilation emission on 400 ks timescales. Beyond the scientific results, the
performance and reliability of the SPI instrument is explicitly demonstrated,
with some details about the most appropriate analysis method.
