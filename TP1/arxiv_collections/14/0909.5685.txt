We investigate $(d+1)$-dimensional quasilinear systems which are integrable
by the method of hydrodynamic reductions. In the case $d\geq 3$ we formulate a
conjecture that any such system with an irreducible dispersion relation must be
linearly degenerate. We prove this conjecture in the 2-component case,
providing a complete classification of multi-dimensional integrable systems in
question. In particular, our results imply the non-existence of 2-component
integrable systems of hydrodynamic type for $d\geq 6$.
  In the second half of the paper we discuss a numerical and analytical
evidence for the impossibility of the breakdown of smooth initial data for
linearly degenerate systems in 2+1 dimensions.
