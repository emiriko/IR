Doubly charged Higgs bosons, H^{\pm\pm}, are being searched for in the
Tevatron experiments. The most recent search by the D0 collaboration seeks
three muons (mu^\pm\mu^\pm\mu^\mp), which are assumed to originate from the
pair-production process, q\overline q\to H^{++}H^{--}, followed by the decay
H^{\pm\pm} \to \mu^\pm \mu^\pm. In this three-lepton (3l) channel there are six
distinct signatures for l=e or \mu. In the context of the Higgs Triplet Model,
we quantify the dependence of the event numbers for the 3l channels on the
parameters of the neutrino mass matrix. It is also shown that the inclusion of
the production mechanism q \overline{q'} \to H^{\pm\pm}H^{\mp}, followed by the
decay H^\pm\to l^ \pm\nu, would significantly increase the discovery potential
in these channels. We then provide perspectives on the production of these
channels at the Tevatron and LHC.
