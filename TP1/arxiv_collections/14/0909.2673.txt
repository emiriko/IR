A model for measurement in collapse-free nonrelativistic fermionic quantum
field theory is presented. In addition to local propagation and
effectively-local interactions, the model incorporates explicit representations
of localized observers, thus extending an earlier model of entanglement
generation in Everett quantum field theory [M. A. Rubin, Found. Phys. 32,
1495-1523 (2002)]. Transformations of the field operators from the Heisenberg
picture to the Deutsch-Hayden picture, involving fictitious auxiliary fields,
establish the locality of the model. The model is applied to manifestly-local
calculations of the results of measurements, using a type of sudden
approximation and in the limit of massive systems in narrow-wavepacket states.
Detection of the presence of a spin-1/2 system in a given spin state by a
freely-moving two-state observer illustrates the features of the model and the
nonperturbative computational methodology. With the help of perturbation theory
the model is applied to a calculation of the quintessential "nonlocal" quantum
phenomenon, spin correlations in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiment.
