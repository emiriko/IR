Luminous Infrared (IR) Galaxies (LIRGs) are an important cosmological class
of galaxies as they are the main contributors to the co-moving star formation
rate density of the universe at z=1. In this paper we present a GTO Spitzer IRS
program aimed to obtain spectral mapping of a sample of 14 local (d<76Mpc)
LIRGs. The data cubes map, at least, the central 20arcsec x 20arcsec to
30arcsec x 30arcsec regions of the galaxies, and use all four IRS modules
covering the full 5-38micron spectral range. The final goal of this project is
to characterize fully the mid-IR properties of local LIRGs as a first step to
understanding their more distant counterparts. In this paper we present the
first results of this GTO program. The IRS spectral mapping data allow us to
build spectral maps of the bright mid-IR emission lines (e.g., [NeII], [NeIII],
[SIII], H_2), continuum, the 6.2 and 11.3micron PAH features, and the 9.7micron
silicate feature, as well as to extract 1D spectra for regions of interest in
each galaxy. The IRS data are used to obtain spatially resolved measurements of
the extinction using the 9.7micron silicate feature, and to trace star forming
regions using the neon lines and the PAH features. We also investigate a number
of AGN indicators, including the presence of high excitation emission lines and
a strong dust continuum emission at around 6micron. We finally use the
integrated Spitzer/IRS spectra as templates of local LIRGs. We discuss several
possible uses for these templates, including the calibration of the star
formation rate of IR-bright galaxies at high redshift. We also predict the
intensities of the brightest mid-IR emission lines for LIRGs as a function of
redshift, and compare them with the expected sensitivities of future space IR
missions.
