Lock-free data objects offer several advantages over their blocking
counterparts, such as being immune to deadlocks and convoying and, more
importantly, being highly concurrent. But they share a common disadvantage in
that the operations they provide are difficult to compose into larger atomic
operations while still guaranteeing lock-freedom. We present a lock-free
methodology for composing highly concurrent linearizable objects together by
unifying their linearization points. This makes it possible to relatively
easily introduce atomic lock-free move operations to a wide range of concurrent
objects. Experimental evaluation has shown that the operations originally
supported by the data objects keep their performance behavior under our
methodology.
