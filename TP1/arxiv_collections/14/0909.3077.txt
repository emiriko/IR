Deconfined regions in relativistic heavy ion collisions are limited to small
volumes surrounded by a confined exterior. Here the geometry of a double
layered torus is discussed, which allows for different temperatures in its two
layers. This geometry enables one to approach the QCD continuum limit for small
deconfined volumes with confined exteriors in a more realistic fashion than by
using periodic boundary conditions. Preliminary data from a study for pure
SU(3) lattice gauge theory support a substantial increase in a pseudo
transition temperature.
