We present a case study of formal verification of full-wave rectifier for
analog and mixed signal designs. We have used the Checkmate tool from CMU [1],
which is a public domain formal verification tool for hybrid systems. Due to
the restriction imposed by Checkmate it necessitates to make the changes in the
Checkmate implementation to implement the complex and non-linear system.
Full-wave rectifier has been implemented by using the Checkmate custom blocks
and the Simulink blocks from MATLAB from Math works. After establishing the
required changes in the Checkmate implementation we are able to efficiently
verify the safety properties of the full-wave rectifier.
