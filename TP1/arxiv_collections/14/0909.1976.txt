We carried out 57Fe Mossbauer measurements for FeSe and Fe1.08Te to
investigate the magnetic properties. There was no sign of magnetic ordering
above 4.2 K for superconducting FeSe. The magnetic sextet corresponding to
antiferromagnetic ordering of Fe in low-spin state was observed for
non-superconducting Fe1.08Te.
