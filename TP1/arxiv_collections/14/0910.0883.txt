We describe two-dimensional gasdynamical computations of the X-ray emitting
gas in the rotating elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 that indicate an inflow of about
one solar mass per year at every radius. Such a large instantaneous inflow
cannot have persisted over a Hubble time. The central constant-entropy
temperature peak recently observed in the innermost 150 parsecs is explained by
compressive heating as gas flows toward the central massive black hole. Since
the cooling time of this gas is only a few million years, NGC 4649 provides the
most acutely concentrated known example of the cooling flow problem in which
the time-integrated apparent mass that has flowed into the galactic core
exceeds the total mass observed there. This paradox can be resolved by
intermittent outflows of energy or mass driven by accretion energy released
near the black hole. Inflowing gas is also required at intermediate kpc radii
to explain the ellipticity of X-ray isophotes due to spin-up by mass ejected by
stars that rotate with the galaxy and to explain local density and temperature
profiles. We provide evidence that many luminous elliptical galaxies undergo
similar inflow spin-up. A small turbulent viscosity is required in NGC 4649 to
avoid forming large X-ray luminous disks that are not observed, but the
turbulent pressure is small and does not interfere with mass determinations
that assume hydrostatic equilibrium.
