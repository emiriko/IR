We calculate the coupling constants between the light vector mesons and heavy
baryons within the framework of the light-cone QCD sum rule in the leading
order of heavy quark effective theory. Most resulting sum rules are stable with
the variations of the Borel parameter and the continuum threshold. The
extracted couplings will be useful in the study of the possible heavy baryon
molecular states.
