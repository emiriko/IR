For large values of tan(beta) interesting effects arise in the MSSM due to
the enhancement of down-quark self-energies. These effects are well-studied
within the decoupling limit, i.e. in the limit of supersymmetric masses far
above the electroweak scale. In this article I discuss those issues which
emerge from a treatment of these effects that goes beyond the decoupling limit.
