MASSCLEAN is a new, sophisticated and robust stellar cluster image and
photometry simulation package. This package is able to create color-magnitude
diagrams and standard FITS images in any of the traditional optical and
near-infrared bands based on cluster characteristics input by the user,
including but not limited to distance, age, mass, radius and extinction. At the
limit of very distant, unresolved clusters, we have checked the integrated
colors created in MASSCLEAN against those from other simple stellar population
(SSP) models with consistent results. Because the algorithm populates the
cluster with a discrete number of tenable stars, it can be used as part of a
Monte Carlo Method to derive the probabilistic range of characteristics
(integrated colors, for example) consistent with a given cluster mass and age.
We present the first ever mass dependent integrated colors as a function of
age, derived from over 100,000 Monte Carlo runs, which can be used to improve
the current age determination methods for stellar clusters.
