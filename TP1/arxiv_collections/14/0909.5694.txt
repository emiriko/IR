Using some ideas of Modern Kaluza-Klein theory, we examine the evolution of
entropy on a 4D Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) brane from a 5D vacuum state,
which is defined on a 5D background Riemann-flat metric. We found that entropy
production is sufficiently important during inflation: $S > 10^{90}$, for all
the initial values of temperature $T_0 < T_{GU}$.
