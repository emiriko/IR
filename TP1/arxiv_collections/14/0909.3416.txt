We consider the method of infinite matrix inversion in the context of quantum
state reconstruction. Using this method we give rigorous proofs for
reconstruction formulas for the Cahill-Glauber s-parametrized distributions and
the rotated quadrature distributions. We also demonstrate how to construct the
s-distributions from the quadrature data.
