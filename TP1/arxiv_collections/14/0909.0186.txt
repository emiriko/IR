Contrary to the reaction pbar + p --> e+ e- with a high momentum incident
antiproton on a free target proton at rest, in which the invariant mass M of
the (e+ e-) pair is necessarily much larger than the (pbar p) mass, in the
reaction pbar + d --> n e+ e- the value of M can take values near or below the
(pbar p) mass. In the antiproton-deuteron electromagnetic annihilation, this
allows to access the proton electromagnetic form factors in the time-like
region of q^2 near the (pbar p) threshold. We estimate the cross section
dsigma(pbar +d --> e+ e- n)/dM for an antiproton beam momentum of 1.5 GeV/c. We
find that near the (pbar p) threshold this cross section is about 1 pb/MeV. The
case of heavy nuclei target is also discussed. Elements of experimental
feasibility are presented for the process pbar + d --> n e+ e- in the context
of the Panda project.
