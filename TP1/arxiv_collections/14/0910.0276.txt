We present our new results for the QCD equation of state at nonzero chemical
potential at N_t=6 and compare them with N_t=4. We use the Taylor expansion
method with terms up to sixth order in simulations with 2+1 flavors of improved
asqtad quarks along a line of constant physics with m_l=0.1 m_s and
approximately physical strange quark mass m_s.
