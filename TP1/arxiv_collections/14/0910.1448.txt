In this article we rederive the Boost operators in Coulomb-Gauge Yang-Mills
theory employing the path-integral formalism and write down the complete
operators for QCD. We immediately apply them to note that what are usually
called the pion square, quartic... charge radii, defined from derivatives of
the pion form factor at zero squared momentum transfer, are completely blurred
out by relativistic and interaction corrections, so that it is not clear at all
how to interpret these quantities in terms of the pion charge distribution. The
form factor therefore measures matrix elements of powers of the QCD boost and
Moeller operators, weighted by the charge density in the target's rest frame.
In addition we remark that the decomposition of the eta' wavefunction in
quarkonium, gluonium, ... components attempted by the KLOE collaboration
combining data from phi radiative decays, requires corrections due to the
velocity of the final state meson recoiling against a photon. This will be
especially important if such decompositions are to be attempted with data from
J/psi decays.
