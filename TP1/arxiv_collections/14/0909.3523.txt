We study the decays of a standard model-like MSSM Higgs boson to pairs of
neutralinos, each of which subsequently decays promptly to a photon and a
gravitino. Such decays can arise in supersymmetric scenarios where
supersymmetry breaking is mediated to us by gauge interactions with a
relatively light gauge messenger sector (M_{mess} < 100 TeV). This process
gives rise to a collider signal consisting of a pair of photons and missing
energy. In the present work we investigate the bounds on this scenario within
the minimal supersymmetric standard model from existing collider data. We also
study the prospects for discovering the Higgs boson through this decay mode
with upcoming data from the Tevatron and the LHC.
