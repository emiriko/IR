Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations based on the ideal MHD equations have
become a powerful tool for modeling phenomena in a wide range of applications
including laboratory, astrophysical, and space plasmas. In general,
high-resolution methods for solving the ideal MHD equations are computationally
expensive and Beowulf clusters or even supercomputers are often used to run the
codes that implemented these methods. With the advent of the Compute Unified
Device Architecture (CUDA), modern graphics processing units (GPUs) provide an
alternative approach to parallel computing for scientific simulations. In this
paper we present, to the author's knowledge, the first implementation of MHD
simulations entirely on GPUs with CUDA, named GPU-MHD, to accelerate the
simulation process. GPU-MHD supports both single and double precision
computation. A series of numerical tests have been performed to validate the
correctness of our code. Accuracy evaluation by comparing single and double
precision computation results is also given. Performance measurements of both
single and double precision are conducted on both the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 295
(GT200 architecture) and GTX 480 (Fermi architecture) graphics cards. These
measurements show that our GPU-based implementation achieves between one and
two orders of magnitude depending on the used graphics card, problem size, and
precision when comparing to the original serial CPU MHD implementation. In
addition, we extend GPU-MHD to support the visualization of the simulation
results and thus the whole MHD simulation and visualization process can be
performed entirely on GPUs.
