Parity and time invariance violating electric dipole moment of $^{205}$Tl is
calculated using the relativistic Hartree-Fock and configuration interaction
methods and the many-body perturbation theory. Contributions from the
interaction of the electron electric dipole moments with internal electric
field and scalar-pseudoscalar electron-nucleon (T,P)-odd interaction are
considered. The results are $d(^{205}{\rm Tl})=-582(20) d_e$ or $d(^{205}{\rm
Tl})=-7.0(2)\times 10^{-18}C^{SP} e {\rm cm}$. Interpretation of the
measurements are discussed. The results of similar calculations for $^{133}$Cs
are $d(^{133}{\rm Cs})=124(4) d_e$ or $d(^{133}{\rm Cs})=0.76(2)\times
10^{-18}C^{SP} e {\rm cm}$.
