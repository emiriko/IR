In order to fulfil the continuity requirements for electric- and
magnetic-field amplitudes at discontinuities of chi2 nonlinearity additional
photon pairs have to be emitted in the area of discontinuity. Generalized
two-photon spectral amplitudes can be used to describe properties of photon
pairs generated in this process that we call surface spontaneous parametric
down-conversion. The spectral structure of such photon pairs is similar to that
derived for photon pairs generated in the volume. Surface and volume
contributions to spontaneous down-conversion can be comparable as an example of
nonlinear layered structures shows.
