We provide an equation of state for high density supernova matter by applying
a momentum-dependent effective interaction. We focus on the study of the
equation of state of high-density and high-temperature nuclear matter
containing leptons (electrons and neutrinos) under the chemical equilibrium
condition. Thermal effects on the properties and equation of state of nuclear
matter are evaluated and analyzed in the framework of the proposed effective
interaction model. Since supernova matter is characterized by a constant
entropy we also present the thermodynamic properties for the isentropic case.
