We discuss a realistic scenario, accounting for the existence of
sub-micrometric protein domains in cell membranes. At the biological level,
such membrane domains have been shown to be specialized, in order to perform a
determined biological task, in the sense that they gather one or a few protein
species out of the hundreds of different ones that a cell membrane may contain.
By analyzing the balance between mixing entropy and protein affinities, we
propose that such protein sorting in distinct domains can be explained without
appealing to pre-existing lipidic micro-phase separations, as in the lipid raft
scenario. We show that the proposed scenario is compatible with known physical
interactions between membrane proteins, even if thousands of different species
coexist.
