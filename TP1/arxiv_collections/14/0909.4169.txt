Spin degrees of freedom of water molecule in gas and liquid state were
investigated in order to provide a reasonable answer about the unsolved problem
of a long-term behavior of water spin isomers. The approach used involves an
assumption that molecules change their spin state from a pure state to a mixed
one when they interact with some sorts of adsorbent surface. Some models and
conceptions of the quantum information processing were used.
