We report on our recent progress on the manipulation of single rubidium atoms
trapped in optical tweezers and the generation of entanglement between two
atoms, each individually trapped in neighboring tweezers. To create an
entangled state of two atoms in their ground states, we make use of the Rydberg
blockade mechanism. The degree of entanglement is measured using global
rotations of the internal states of both atoms. Such internal state rotations
on a single atom are demonstrated with a high fidelity.
