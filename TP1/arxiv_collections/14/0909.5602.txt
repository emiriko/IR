The Kondo effect has been observed in a single gate-tunable atom. The
measurement device consists of a single As dopant incorporated in a Silicon
nanostructure. The atomic orbitals of the dopant are tunable by the gate
electric field. When they are tuned such that the ground state of the atomic
system becomes a (nearly) degenerate superposition of two of the Silicon
valleys, an exotic and hitherto unobserved valley Kondo effect appears.
Together with the regular spin Kondo, the tunable valley Kondo effect allows
for reversible electrical control over the symmetry of the Kondo ground state
from an SU(2)- to an SU(4) -configuration.
