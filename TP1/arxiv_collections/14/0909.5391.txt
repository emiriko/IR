We discuss a toy model for an emergent non-relativistic gravitational theory.
Within a certain class of Bose-Einstein condensates, it is possible to show
that, in a suitable regime, a modified version of non-relativistic Newtonian
gravity does effectively describes the low energy dynamics of the coupled
system condensate/quasi-particles.
