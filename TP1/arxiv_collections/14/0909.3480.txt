We present electronic transport characteristics of ternary alloy Cd1-xZnxS
nanowire networks in the dark and under white light illumination. Compared to
the negligible dark current, we observed a photocurrent enhancement up to 4
orders of magnitude at intensity of 460 mW/cm2. The time constant of the
dynamic photoresponse is ~5 sec. The current-voltage characteristics at
different intensities show Ohmic behavior at low bias and space charge limited
conduction (SCLC) at higher bias voltages. The SCLC behavior and slow time
response indicate that the charge transport is dominated by tunneling at the
percolating inter-nanowire junctions.
