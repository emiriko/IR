We examine electron transport through a single-molecule magnet Mn12 bridged
between Au electrodes using the first-principles method. We find crucial
features which were inaccessible in model Hamiltonian studies: spin filtering
and a strong dependence of charge distribution on local environments. The spin
filtering remains robust with different molecular geometries and interfaces,
and strong electron correlations, while the charge distribution over the Mn12
strongly depends on them. We point out a qualitative difference between locally
charged and free-electron charged Mn12.
