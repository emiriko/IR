We study flavour violation in a supersymmetric SO(10) implementation of the
type II seesaw mechanism, which provides a predictive realization of triplet
leptogenesis. The experimental upper bounds on lepton flavour violating
processes have a significant impact on the leptogenesis dynamics, in particular
they exclude the strong washout regime. Requiring successful leptogenesis then
constrains the otherwise largely unknown overall size of flavour-violating
observables, thus yielding testable predictions. In particular, the branching
ratio for mu -> e gamma lies within the reach of the MEG experiment if the
superpartner spectrum is accessible at the LHC, and the supersymmetric
contribution to epsilon_K can account for a significant part of the
experimental value. We show that this scenario can be realized in a consistent
SO(10) model achieving gauge symmetry breaking and doublet-triplet splitting in
agreement with the proton decay bounds, improving on the MSSM prediction for
alpha_3(m_Z), and reproducing the measured quark and lepton masses.
