The interaction of water with Fe$_3$O$_4$(001) is studied by density
functional theory (DFT) calculations including an on-site Coulomb term. For
isolated molecules dissociative adsorption is strongly promoted at surface
defect sites, while at higher coverages a hydrogen-bonded network forms with
alternating molecular and dissociated species. This mixed adsorption mode and a
suppression of the $(\sqrt{2}\times \sqrt{2})R45^{\circ}$-reconstruction are
confirmed by a quantitative low energy electron diffraction (LEED) analysis.
Adsorbate induced electron transfer processes add a new dimension towards
understanding the catalytic activity of magnetite(001).
