We present the first analytical inspiral-merger-ringdown gravitational
waveforms from binary black holes (BBHs) with non-precessing spins, that is
based on a description of the late-inspiral, merger and ringdown in full
general relativity. By matching a post-Newtonian description of the inspiral to
a set of numerical-relativity simulations, we obtain a waveform family with a
conveniently small number of physical parameters. These waveforms will allow us
to detect a larger parameter space of BBH coalescence, including a considerable
fraction of precessing binaries in the comparable-mass regime, thus
significantly improving the expected detection rates.
