We consider both theoretically and experimentally self-organization process
of quasi-equilibrium steady-state condensation of sputtered substance in
accumulative ion-plasma devices. The self-organization effect is shown to be
caused by self-consistent variations of the condensate temperature and the
supersaturation of depositing atoms. On the basis of the phase-plane method, we
find two different types of the self-organization process to be possible.
Experimental data related to aluminum condensates are discussed to confirm
self-organization nature of quasi-equilibrium steady-state condensation
process.
