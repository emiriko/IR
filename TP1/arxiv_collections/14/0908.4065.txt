We examine the appearance of a spontaneous bulk spin current in a triplet
superconductor in contact with a metallic ferromagnet. The spin current results
from the spin-flip of Cooper pairs upon reflection from the interface with the
ferromagnet, and is shown to display strong similarities to the spontaneous
charge current in a Josephson junction. We express the spin current in terms of
the Andreev reflection coefficients, which are derived by the construction of
the quasiclassical scattering wavefunctions. The dependence of the spin current
upon a number of parameters is investigated, in particular the orientation of
the magnetic moment of the ferromagnet, the exchange splitting, the
temperature, and the orbital pairing state of the triplet superconductor.
