The recently measured B -> tau nu branching ratio allows to test the Standard
Model by probing virtual effects of new heavy particles, such as a charged
Higgs boson. The accuracy of the test is currently limited by the experimental
error on BR(B -> tau nu) and by the uncertainty on the parameters fB and |Vub|.
The redundancy of the Unitarity Triangle fit allows to reduce the error on
these parameters and thus to perform a more precise test of the Standard Model.
Using the current experimental inputs, we obtain BR(B -> tau nu)_SM = (0.84 +-
0.11)x10^{-4}, to be compared with BR(B -> tau nu)_exp = (1.73 +-
0.34)x10^{-4}. The Standard Model prediction can be modified by New Physics
effects in the decay amplitude as well as in the Unitarity Triangle fit. We
discuss how to disentangle the two possible contributions in the case of
minimal flavour violation at large tan beta and generic loop-mediated New
Physics. We also consider two specific models with minimal flavour violation:
the Type-II Two Higgs Doublet Model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model.
