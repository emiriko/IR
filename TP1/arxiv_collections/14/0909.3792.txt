At the time large air Cherenkov arrays are being discussed for future
gamma-ray observatories, we review the relationship between the targeted
capabilities and the main design parameters taking into account construction
costs. As an example application, we describe a telescope array optimized for
observations between 1 TeV and a few 100 TeV and use detailed simulations to
estimate its performances in comparison to science objectives.
