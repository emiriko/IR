The culmination of the papers (arXiv:0905.0518, arXiv:0910.0909) was a proof
of the norm convergence in $L^2(\mu)$ of the quadratic nonconventional ergodic
averages \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N(f_1\circ T_1^{n^2})(f_2\circ
T_1^{n^2}T_2^n)\quad\quad f_1,f_2\in L^\infty(\mu) associated to an arbitrary
probability-preserving \bbZ^2-system (X,\mu,T_1,T_2). This is a special case of
the Bergelson-Leibman conjecture on the norm convergence of polynomial
nonconventional ergodic averages.
  That proof relied on some new machinery for extending probability-preserving
$\bbZ^d$-systems to obtain simplified asymptotic behaviour for various
nonconventional averages such as the above. The engine of this machinery is
formed by some detailed structure theorems for the `characteristic factors'
that are available for some such averages after ascending to a
suitably-extended system. However, these new structure theorems underwent two
distinct phases of development, separated by the discovery of some new
technical results in Moore's cohomology theory for locally compact groups
(arXiv:1004.4937). That discovery enabled a significant improvement to the main
structure theorem (Theorem 1.1 in (arXiv:0905.0518)), which in turn afforded a
much shortened proof of convergence. However, since the proof of convergence
using the original structure theorem required some quite different ideas that
are now absent from these other papers, I have recorded it here in case it has
some independent interest.
