Spin relaxation due to atom-atom collisions is measured for magnetically
trapped erbium and thulium atoms at a temperature near 500 mK. The rate
constants for Er-Er and Tm-Tm collisions are 3.0 times 10^-10 cm^3 s^-1 and 1.1
times 10^-10 cm^3 s^-1, respectively, 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than those
observed for highly magnetic S-state atoms. This is strong evidence for an
additional, dominant, spin relaxation mechanism, electrostatic anisotropy, in
collisions between these "submerged-shell" L > 0 atoms. These large spin
relaxation rates imply that evaporative cooling of these atoms in a magnetic
trap will be highly inefficient.
