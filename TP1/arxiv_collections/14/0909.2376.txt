Diverse recommendation techniques have been already proposed and encapsulated
into several e-business applications, aiming to perform a more accurate
evaluation of the existing information and accordingly augment the assistance
provided to the users involved. This paper reports on the development and
integration of a recommendation module in an agent-based transportation
transactions management system. The module is built according to a novel hybrid
recommendation technique, which combines the advantages of collaborative
filtering and knowledge-based approaches. The proposed technique and supporting
module assist customers in considering in detail alternative transportation
transactions that satisfy their requests, as well as in evaluating completed
transactions. The related services are invoked through a software agent that
constructs the appropriate knowledge rules and performs a synthesis of the
recommendation policy.
