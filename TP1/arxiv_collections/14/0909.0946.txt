We exploit a novel approximation scheme to obtain a new and compact formula
for the parameters underlying coherent-state control of the evolution of a pair
of entangled two-level systems. It is appropriate for long times and for
relatively strong external quantum control via coherent state irradiation. We
take account of both discrete-state and continuous-variable degrees of freedom.
The formula predicts the relative heights of entanglement revivals and their
timing and duration.
