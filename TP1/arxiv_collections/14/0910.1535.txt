We show that the LHC will be able to differentiate between a four-dimensional
model with quantum gravity at ~1 TeV where the (massless) graviton becomes
strongly coupled to standard model particles at 1 TeV and brane world type
models with a large extra-dimensional volume and massive Kaluza-Klein
gravitons. We estimate that the 14 TeV LHC could put a limit of the order of ~5
TeV on the four dimensional Planck mass in a model independent way.
