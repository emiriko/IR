The efficient placement of signal templates in source-parameter space is a
crucial requisite for exhaustive matched-filtering searches of modeled
gravitational-wave sources. Unfortunately, the current placement algorithms
based on regular parameter-space meshes are difficult to generalize beyond
simple signal models with few parameters. Various authors have suggested that a
general, flexible, yet efficient alternative can be found in randomized
placement strategies such as random placement and stochastic placement, which
enhances random placement by selectively rejecting templates that are too close
to others. In this article we explore several theoretical and practical issues
in randomized placement: the size and performance of the resulting template
banks; the effects of parameter-space boundaries; the use of quasi-random (self
avoiding) number sequences; most important, the implementation of these
algorithms in curved signal manifolds with and without the use of a Riemannian
signal metric, which may be difficult to obtain. Specifically, we show how the
metric can be replaced with a discrete triangulation-based representation of
local geometry. We argue that the broad class of randomized placement
algorithms offers a promising answer to many search problems, but that the
specific choice of a scheme and its implementation details will still need to
be fine-tuned separately for each problem.
