The Exceptional Supersymmetric Standard Model (E$_6$SSM) provides a low
energy alternative to the MSSM, with an extra gauged U(1)$_N$ symmetry, solving
the $\mu$-problem of the MSSM. Inspired by the possible embedding into an E$_6$
GUT, the matter content fills three generations of E$_6$ multiplets, thus
predicting exciting exotic matter such as diquarks or leptoquarks. We present
predictions from a constrained version of the model (cE$_6$SSM), with a
universal scalar mass $m_0$, trilinear mass $A$ and gaugino mass $M_{1/2}$. We
reveal a large volume of the cE$_6$SSM parameter space where the correct
breakdown of the gauge symmetry is achieved and all experimental constraints
satisfied. We predict a hierarchical particle spectrum with heavy scalars and
light gauginos, while the new exotic matter can be light or heavy depending on
parameters. We present representative cE$_6$SSM scenarios, demonstrating that
there could be light exotic particles, like leptoquarks and a U(1)$_N$ Z'
boson, with spectacular signals at the LHC.
