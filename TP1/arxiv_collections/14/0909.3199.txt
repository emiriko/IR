Elastic scattering data gained for proton-proton collisions at high energies
are being analyzed at the present practically only with the help of purely
phenomenological mathematical models. And the question exists whether in the
impact parameter plane the elastic processes may be interpreted as central or
peripheral. From realistic point of view the peripherality should be preferred
and one may expect that nucleon dimensions should manifest in some way in
elastic data. It will be demonstrated that the elastic pp data at the energy of
53 GeV in the interval |t| from (0., 4.) [GeV^2] may be interpreted well as the
superposition of mutual collisions of two internal structures with maximal
external dimensions; the approximate dimensions and frequencies of
corresponding structures being established on the basis of measured elastic
data.
