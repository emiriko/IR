We study FeO, a Mott insulator in GGA and GGA+U approximations. In the GGA we
find a multi-band metallic state with remarkable inter-band nesting between two
$t_{2g}$ bands of Fermi surface, which signals possible instability towards an
orbital ordered insulating phase. Such broken symmetry state, although has
lower energy than the underlying homogeneous metallic state, but the gap
magnitude is less than the experimentally observed optical gap. Therefore we
incorporate the calculated value of on-site Coulomb repulsion U on orbital
ordered state. We find that symmetry breaking and Coulomb correlations
cooperate together to stabilize the system and give an insulating orbital
ordered state, with the gap magnitude very close to the experimental value. We
propose this method as a possible indication of orbital ordering in LDA and GGA
calculations. We check our method with known examples of LiVO$_2$ and
LaMnO$_3$.
