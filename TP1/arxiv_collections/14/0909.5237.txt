We first report on possible measurements at the LHC using the first data and
a luminosity of 10 pb$^{-1}$ of $W$ and $Z$ pair production via two-photon
exchange. This measurement allows in particular to increase the present
sensitivity on $WW\gamma \gamma$ and $ZZ\gamma \gamma$ quartic anomalous
couplings from the LEP experiments by almost three orders of magnitude. We also
discuss the possible improvements on quartic and trilinear anomalous couplings
at high luminosity at the LHC using new forward proton taggers to be installed
at 220 and 420 m from the CMS or ATLAS detectors.
