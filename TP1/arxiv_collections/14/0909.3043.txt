We prove finite-time blowup for spherically symmetric and negative energy
solutions of Hartree-Fock and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov type equations, which
describe the evolution of attractive fermionic systems (e. g. white dwarfs).
Our main results are twofold: First, we extend the recent blowup result of
[Hainzl and Schlein, Comm. Math. Phys. \textbf{287} (2009), 705--714] to
Hartree-Fock equations with infinite rank solutions and a general class of
Newtonian type interactions. Second, we show the existence of finite-time
blowup for spherically symmetric solutions of a Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov model,
where an angular momentum cutoff is introduced. We also explain the key
difficulties encountered in the full Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory.
