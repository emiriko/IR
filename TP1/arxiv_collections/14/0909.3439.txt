We analyze the suppression of decoherence by means of dynamical decoupling in
the pure-dephasing spin-boson model for baths with power law spectra. The
sequence of ideal $\pi$ pulses is optimized according to the power of the bath.
We expand the decoherence function and separate the cancelling divergences from
the relevant terms. The proposed sequence is chosen to be the one minimizing
the decoherence function. By construction, it provides the best performance. We
analytically derive the conditions that must be satisfied. The resulting
equations are solved numerically. The solutions are very close to the
Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence for a soft cutoff of the bath while
they approach the Uhrig dynamical-decoupling (UDD) sequence as the cutoff
becomes harder.
