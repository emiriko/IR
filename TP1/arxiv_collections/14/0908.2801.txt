The computer simulations of the process of single pulse readout from the
flux-biased phase qubit is performed in the frame of one-dimensional
Schroedinger equation. It has been demonstrated that the readout error can be
minimized by choosing the optimal pulse duration and the depth of a potential
well, leading to the fidelity of 0.94 for 2ns and 0.965 for 12ns sinusoidal
pulses.
