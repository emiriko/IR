Spectral line surveys are useful since they allow identification of new
molecules and new lines in uniformly calibrated data sets. Nonetheless, large
portions of the sub-millimetre spectral regime remain unexplored due to severe
absorptions by H2O and O2 in the terrestrial atmosphere. The purpose of the
measurements presented here is to cover wavelength regions at and around 0.55
mm -- regions largely unobservable from the ground. Using the Odin
astronomy/aeronomy satellite, we performed the first spectral survey of the
Orion KL molecular cloud core in the bands 486--492 and 541--576 GHz with
rather uniform sensitivity (22--25 mK baseline noise). Odin's 1.1 m size
telescope, equipped with four cryo-cooled tuneable mixers connected to broad
band spectrometers, was used in a satellite position-switching mode. Two mixers
simultaneously observed different 1.1 GHz bands using frequency steps of 0.5
GHz (25 hours each). An on-source integration time of 20 hours was achieved for
most bands. The entire campaign consumed ~1100 orbits, each containing one hour
of serviceable astro-observation. We identified 280 spectral lines from 38
known interstellar molecules (including isotopologues) having intensities in
the range 80 to 0.05 K. An additional 64 weak lines remain unidentified. Apart
from the ground state rotational 1(1,0)--1(0,1) transitions of ortho-H2O, H218O
and H217O, the high energy 6(2,4)--7(1,7) line of para-H2O and the
HDO(2,0,2--1,1,1) line have been observed, as well as the 1,0--0,1 lines from
NH3 and its rare isotopologue 15NH3. We suggest assignments for some
unidentified features, notably the new interstellar molecules ND and SH-.
Severe blends have been detected in the line wings of the H218O, H217O and 13CO
lines changing the true linewidths of the outflow emission.
