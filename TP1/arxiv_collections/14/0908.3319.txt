The study of multiparticle dynamics in hadron-hadron collisions at Tevatron
and LHC could provide useful information on new physics in addition to the
expected signatures on the transverse plane. We suggest that an analysis of
inclusive correlations between emitted particles in $pp$ inelastic collisions,
and factorial moments of multiplicity distributions, may be helpful in
uncovering (un)particles from Hidden Sectors, using underlying events tagged by
hard products like high $p_T$ leptons and photons, and applying stringent
selection criteria like event shape variables, etc
