The neutrino oscillation data are well explained by the tri-bimaximal
pattern. Recently a paper appeared showing that also the bimaximal pattern
could be a very good starting point in order to describe the lepton mixing. In
this paper I review both the flavour structures and then I present an explicit
model based on the discrete symmetry group S4.
