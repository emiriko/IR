We have measured the positions of water masers in Sgr B2, a massive star
forming region in the Galactic center, relative to an extragalactic radio
source with the Very Long Baseline Array. The positions measured at 12 epochs
over a time span of one year yield the trigonometric parallax of Sgr B2 and
hence a distance to the Galactic center of Ro=7.9 (+0.8/-0.7) kpc. The proper
motion of Sgr B2 relative to Sgr A* suggests that Sgr B2 is about 0.13 kpc
nearer than the Galactic center, assuming a low-eccentricity Galactic orbit.
