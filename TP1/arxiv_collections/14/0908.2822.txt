For all non-symmetric discrete relativistic Toda type equations we establish
a relation to 3D consistent systems of quad-equations. Unlike the more simple
and better understood symmetric case, here the three coordinate planes of
$\mathbb Z^3$ carry different equations. Our construction allows for an
algorithmic derivation of the zero curvature representations and yields
analogous results also for the continuous time case.
