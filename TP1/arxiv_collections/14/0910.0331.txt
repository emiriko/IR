We provide an introduction to the power-counting issue in baryon chiral
perturbation theory and discuss some recent developments in the manifestly
Lorentz-invariant formulation of the one-nucleon sector. As explicit
applications we consider the chiral expansion of the nucleon mass, its
convergence properties, and calculations of the electromagnetic and axial form
factors of the nucleon.
