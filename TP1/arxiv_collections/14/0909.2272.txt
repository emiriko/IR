The van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity requires that the mass $m$
of the graviton is exactly zero, otherwise measurements of the deflection of
starlight by the Sun and the precession of Mercury's perihelion would conflict
with their theoretical values. This theoretical discontinuity is open to
question for numerous reasons. In this paper we show from a phenomenological
viewpoint that the $m>0$ hypothesis is in accord with Supernova Ia and CMB
observations, and that the large scale structure of the universe suggests that
$m \sim 10^{-30} $eV$/c^2$.
