Ultracold molecules offer entirely new possibilities for the control of
quantum processes due to their rich internal structure. Recently, near quantum
degenerate gases of molecules have been prepared in their rovibronic ground
state. For future experiments, it is crucial to also control their hyperfine
state. Here, we report the preparation of a rovibronic ground state molecular
quantum gas in a single hyperfine state and in particular in the absolute
lowest quantum state. The demonstrated and presented scheme is general for
bialkali polar molecules and allows the preparation of molecules in a single
hyperfine state or in an arbitrary coherent superposition of hyperfine states.
The scheme relies on electric-dipole, two-photon microwave transitions through
rotationally excited states and makes use of electric nuclear quadrupole
interactions to transfer molecular population between different hyperfine
states.
