The massless supermultiplet of eleven-dimensional supergravity can be
generated from the decomposition of certain representation of the exceptional
Lie group F4 into those of its maximal compact subgroup Spin(9). In an earlier
paper, a dynamical Kaluza-Klein origin of this observation is proposed with
internal space the Cayley plane, OP2, and topological aspects are explored. In
this paper we consider the geometric aspects and characterize the corresponding
forms which contribute to the action as well as cohomology classes, including
torsion, which contribute to the partition function. This involves
constructions with bilinear forms. The compatibility with various string
theories are discussed, including reduction to loop bundles in ten dimensions.
