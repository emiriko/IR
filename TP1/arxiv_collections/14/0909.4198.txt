Spherically symmetric, static model of the cosmological voids is constructed
in the framework of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equation with the
cosmological constant. Extension of the Tooper result (dimensionless form of
the TOV equation) is provided for non-zero $\Lambda$. Then, the equation is
simplified in $\alpha \to 0$, $\lambda \to 0$, $\lambda/\alpha = const$ regime,
suitable for largest structures in $\Lambda$-dominated universe. Voids are
treated as an underdensity regions in the static Einstein universe. Both
overdensity and underdensity (relative to static universe) solutions exist.
They are identified with standard astrophysical spherical objects and voids,
respectively. Model is tested against observed properties (the radius - the
central density relation) and density profiles of voids. Analytical formulae
for radial density contrast profile and radii of the voids are derived. Some
consequences for cosmological n-body simulations are suggested. Hints on the
dark matter/dark energy EOS filling the voids are provided.
