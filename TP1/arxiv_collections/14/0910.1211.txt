Recent spectro-polarimetric observations have provided detailed measurements
of magnetic field, velocity and intensity during events of magnetic field
intensification in the solar photosphere. We consider the temporal evolution of
the relevant physical quantities for three cases of magnetic field
intensification in a numerical simulation. We determine the evolution of the
intensity, magnetic flux density and zero-crossing velocity derived from the
synthetic Stokes parameters by taking into account the spectral and spatial
resolution of the spectropolarimeter (SP) on board Hinode. The three events
considered show a similar evolution: advection of magnetic flux to a granular
vertex, development of a strong downflow, evacuation of the magnetic feature,
increase of the field strength and the appearance of the bright point. We find
that synthetic and real observations are qualitatively consistent and, for one
of the cases considered, agree very well also quantitatively. The effect of
finite resolution (spatial smearing) is most pronounced in the case of small
features, for which the synthetic Hinode/SP observations miss the bright point
formation and also the high-velocity downflows during the formation of the
smaller magnetic features.
