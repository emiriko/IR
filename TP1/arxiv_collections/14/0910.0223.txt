Simultaneously with the turning-on of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) the
data taking for jet production rates will start. The study of these production
rates is an important test of the Standard Model in the new energy regime
accessible at the LHC. In order to discriminate possible extensions of the
Standard Model accurate theoretical predictions are needed. We investigate the
next-to-leading order weak corrections for bottom-quark jet and di-jet
production at the LHC and find detectable effects in transverse momentum
distributions.
