We calculate the tunneling current through long line junctions of a $\nu=5/2$
quantum Hall liquid and i) another $\nu=5/2$ liquid, ii) an integer quantum
Hall liquid and iii) a quantum wire. Momentum resolved tunneling provides
information about the number, propagation directions and other features of the
edge modes and thus helps distinguish several competing models of the 5/2
state. We investigate transport properties of two proposed Abelian states: $K=8
state and 331 state, and four possible non-Abelian states: Pfaffian,
edge-reconstructed Pfaffian, and two versions of the anti-Pfaffian state. We
also show that the non-equilibrated anti-Pfaffian state has a different
resistance from other proposed states in the bar geometry.
