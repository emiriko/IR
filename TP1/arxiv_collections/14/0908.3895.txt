It is known that Szpiro's conjecture, or equivalently the ABC-conjecture,
implies Lang's conjecture giving a uniform lower bound for the canonical height
of nontorsion points on elliptic curves. In this note we show that a
significantly weaker version of Szpiro's conjecture, which we call
"prime-depleted," suffices to prove Lang's conjecture.
