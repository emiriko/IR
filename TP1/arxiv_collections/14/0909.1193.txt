We report the first observation of the quantum Hall effect in epitaxial
graphene. The result described in the submitted manuscript fills the yawning
gap in the understanding of the electronic properties of this truly remarkable
material and demonstrate suitability of the silicon carbide technology for
manufactiring large area high quality graphene. Having found the quantum Hall
effect in several devices produced on distant parts of a single large-area
wafer, we can confirm that material synthesized on the Si-terminated face of
SiC promises a suitable platform for the implementations of quantum resistance
metrology at elevated temperatures and, in the longer term, opens bright
prospects for scalable electronics based on graphene.
