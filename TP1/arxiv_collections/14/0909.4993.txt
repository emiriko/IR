The SciBooNE Collaboration has measured neutral current neutral pion
production by the muon neutrino beam at a polystyrene target (C8H8). We
obtained (7.7+- 0.5(stat.)+0.4-0.5 (sys.)) x 10^-2 as cross section ratio of
the neutral current neutral pion production to total charged current cross
section at the mean neutrino energy of 1.16 GeV. This result is consistent with
the Monte Carlo prediction based on the Rein-Sehgal model
