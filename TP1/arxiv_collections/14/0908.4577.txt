To explore the correlation in the GeV band (i.e. the inverse-Compton
component) with the optical band (i.e. the synchrotron component) of blazars
that are bright in high energies, the light curves of a number of blazars
monitored with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST), were compared to the
corresponding light curves recorded with the Automatic Telescope for Optical
Monitoring (ATOM). The results are presented.
