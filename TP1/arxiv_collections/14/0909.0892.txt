We consider auctions in which greedy algorithms, paired with first-price or
critical-price payment rules, are used to resolve multi-parameter combinatorial
allocation problems. We study the price of anarchy for social welfare in such
auctions. We show for a variety of equilibrium concepts, including Bayes-Nash
equilibrium and correlated equilibrium, the resulting price of anarchy bound is
close to the approximation factor of the underlying greedy algorithm.
