We investigate the role of quantum coherence in tunneling conductance, where
quantum criticality turns out to suppress Fano resonance. Based on the
nonequilibrium noncrossing approximation, we show that the linear tunneling
conductance exhibits weak Fano line-shape with sharp cusp at zero energy in the
multichannel Kondo effect, resulting from incoherence associated with quantum
criticality of impurity dynamics. In particular, shift of the peak position in
the Fano resonance is predicted not to occur for the multichannel Kondo effect,
distinguished from the Fermi liquid theory in the single channel Kondo effect.
