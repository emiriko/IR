One of the main challenges of the Tevatron at Fermilab and the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) at CERN is the determination of Standard Model (SM) parameters
at the TeV scale. In this context various processes will be investigated which
involve bottom-quark jets in the final state, for example decays of top-quarks
or gauge bosons of the weak interaction. Hence the theoretical understanding of
processes with bottom-quark jets is necessary. In this paper analytic results
will be presented for the weak corrections to bottom-quark jet production --
neglecting purely photonic corrections. The results will be used to study
differential distributions, where sizeable effects are observed.
