The system of equations describing an ultrashort optical pulses propagation
in semiconductor superlattice with applied magnetic field was obtained based on
Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation for the single electron
distribution function and coupled Maxwell equations for the electromagnetic
field. It was demonstrated that an original linear-polarized optical pulse
initiates an orthogonal polarization in the field of a sample. The propagation
dynamics of initiated and initial pulses in the sample was investigated. The
effects of the lattice geometry have been elicited.
