We present a precise measurement of the ratio R_K =
\Gamma(Ke2(\gamma))/\Gamma(K\mu2(\gamma)) performed with the KLOE detector. The
results are based on data collected at the Frascati e^+e^- collider DAFNE for
an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb^{-1}. We find R_K =
(2.493\pm0.025_{stat}\pm0.019_{syst})\times 10^{-5}, in agreement with the
Standard Model expectation. This result is used to improve constraints on
parameters of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with lepton flavor
violation.
