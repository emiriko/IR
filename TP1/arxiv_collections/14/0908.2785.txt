I present a brief overview of some exciting possibilities for physics Beyond
the Standard Model. I include short discussions of neutrino physics, the strong
CP problem and axions, GUTs, large and warped extra dimensions, Little Higgs
models and supersymmetry. The chances appear excellent that in the next few
years-- as the LHC era gets underway-- data from a bevy of experiments will
point the way to a new paradigm for the laws of physics as we know them.
