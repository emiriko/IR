We use smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) models to study the large-scale
morphology and dynamical evolution of the intergalactic gas in Stephan's
Quintet, and compare to multiwavelength observations. Specifically, we model
the formation of the hot X-ray gas, the large-scale shock, and emission line
gas as the result of NGC 7318b colliding with the group. We also reproduce the
N-body model of Renaud and Appleton for the tidal structures in the group.
