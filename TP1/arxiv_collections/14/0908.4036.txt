Simulating frustrated quantum magnets is among the most challenging tasks in
computational physics. We apply String-Bond States, a recently introduced
ansatz which combines Tensor Networks with Monte Carlo based methods, to the
simulation of frustrated quantum systems in both two and three dimensions. We
compare our results with existing results for unfrustrated and two-dimensional
systems with open boundary conditions, and demonstrate that the method applies
equally well to the simulation of frustrated systems with periodic boundaries
in both two and three dimensions.
