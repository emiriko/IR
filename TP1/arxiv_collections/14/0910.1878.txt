The effect of the chosen analysis energy window on the results of a dark
matter experiment is exemplified by the curious intersection of the exclusion
plots of the XENON10 and the CDMS experiments. After proving that the narrow
energy window XENON10 chose to analyze is indeed the cause of such
intersection, a method to determine the high-energy extreme of the recoil
energy window an experiment should use is obtained.
