The aim of the present work is to introduce a thermodynamic model to describe
the growth of an oxide layer on a metallic substrate. More precisely, this
paper offers a study of oxygen dissolution into a solid, and its consequences
on the apparition of mechanical stresses. They strongly influence the oxidation
processes and may be, in some materials, responsible for cracking. To realize
this study, mechanical considerations are introduced into the classical
diffusion laws. Simulations were made for the particular case of uranium
dioxide, which undergoes the chemical fragmentation. According to our
simulations, the hypothesis of a compression stress field into the oxidised UO2
compound near the internal interface is consistent with the interpretation of
the mechanisms of oxidation observed experimentally.
