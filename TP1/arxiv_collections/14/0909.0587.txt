The nonlinear propagation of electromagnetic waves in pair plasmas, in which
the electrostatic potential plays a very important but subdominant role of a
"binding glue" is investigated. Several mechanisms for structure formation are
investigated, in particular, the "asymmetry" in the initial temperatures of the
constituent species. It is shown that the temperature asymmetry leads to a
(localizing) nonlinearity that is new and qualitatively different from the ones
originating in ambient mass or density difference. The temperature asymmetry
driven focusing-defocusing nonlinearity supports stable localized wave
structures in 1-3 dimensions, which, for certain parameters, may have flat-top
shapes.
