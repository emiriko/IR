A permutation p is realized by the shift on N symbols if there is an infinite
word on an N-letter alphabet whose successive left shifts by one position are
lexicographically in the same relative order as p. The set of realized
permutations is closed under consecutive pattern containment. Permutations that
cannot be realized are called forbidden patterns. It was shown in [Amigo,
Elizalde, Kennel, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 115 (2008) 485-504] that the
shortest forbidden patterns of the shift on N symbols have length N+2. In this
paper we give a characterization of the set of permutations that are realized
by the shift on N symbols, and we enumerate them according to their length.
