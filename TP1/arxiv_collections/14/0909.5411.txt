On a manifold with a projective connection we canonically assign a second
order differential operator acting on the algebra of all densities to any
tensor density $S^{ij}$ of fixed weight $\lambda$. In particular, this implies
that on any projectively connected manifold, a `bracket' (symmetric
biderivation) on the algebra of functions extends canonically to the algebra of
densities.
