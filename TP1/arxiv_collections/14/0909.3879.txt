Multi-photon states are widely applied in quantum information technology. By
the methods presented in this paper, the structure of a multi-photon state in
the form of multiple single photon qubit product can be mapped to a single
photon qudit, which could also be in separable product with other photons. This
makes the possible manipulation of such multi-photon states in the way of
processing single photon states. The optical realization of unknown qubit
discrimination [B. He, J. A. Bergou, and Y.-H. Ren, Phys. Rev. A 76, 032301
(2007)] is simplified with the transformation methods. Another application is
the construction of quantum logic gates, where the inverse transformations back
to the input state spaces are also necessary. We especially show that the
modified setups to implement the transformations can realize the deterministic
multi-control gates (including Toffoli gate) operating directly on the products
of single photon qubits.
