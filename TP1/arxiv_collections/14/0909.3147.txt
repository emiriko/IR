The Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) is a new generation of electronic radio
telescope based on aperture array technology and working in the frequency range
of 30-240 MHz. The telescope is being developed by ASTRON, and currently being
rolled-out across the Netherlands and other countries in Europe. The plan is to
build at least 36 stations in the Netherlands (with baseline lengths of up to
100 km), 5 stations in Germany, and 1 station in each of Sweden, France and the
UK. With baseline lengths of up to 2000 km, sub-arcsecond resolution will be
possible at the highest frequencies. The Key Science Projects being addressed
by the project include: deep, wide-field cosmological surveys, transients, the
epoch of re-ionisation and cosmic ray studies. We present the current status of
the project, including the development of the super-core in Exloo and the
completion of the first 3 stations. 'First fringes' from these stations is also
presented.
