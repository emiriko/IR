We analyze the density functional theory (DFT) description of weak
interactions by employing diffusion and reptation quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
calculations, for a set of benzene-molecule complexes. While the binding
energies depend significantly on the exchange correlation approximation
employed for DFT calculations, QMC calculations show that the electron density
is accurately described within DFT, including the quantitative features in the
reduced density gradient. We elucidate how the enhancement of the exchange
energy density at a large reduced density gradient plays a critical role in
obtaining accurate DFT description of weakly-interacting systems.
