The second-order Talbot effect is analyzed for a periodic object illuminated
by entangled photon pairs in both the quantum imaging and quantum lithography
configurations. The Klyshko picture is applied to describe the quantum imaging
scheme, in which self-images of the object that may or may not be magnified can
be observed nonlocally in the photon coincidences but not in the singles count
rate. In the quantum lithography setup, we find that the second-order Talbot
length is half that of the classical first-order case, thus the resolution may
be improved by a factor of two.
