In this work a classical linear harmonic oscillator, evolving during a small
time interval (so that simple non-linear, second order Taylor approximation of
the dynamics is satisfied) and restarting (by a mechanism) in a strictly chosen
series of the time moments, is considered. It is shown that given linear
oscillator behaves dynamically analogously to discrete logistic equation,
which, as an especial case, includes chaotic (fractal) behaviour too. (All this
refers too on the analogous quantum systems, e.g. ammonia molecule with simple
vibration dynamics of the atoms many times perturbed by measurements in
strictly defined time moments.
