The first generation of gravitational wave interferometric detectors has
taken data at, or close to, their design sensitivity. This data has been
searched for a broad range of gravitational wave signatures. An overview of
gravitational wave search methods and results are presented. Searches for
gravitational waves from unmodelled burst sources, compact binary coalescences,
continuous wave sources and stochastic backgrounds are discussed.
