After the Pierre Auger Observatory, it is likely that space-based experiments
might be required for next-generation studies of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic
Particles. An overview of this challenging task is presented, emphasizing the
main design issues, the criticalities and the intermediate steps required to
make this challenging task a reality.
