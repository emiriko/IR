Let $G$ be a complex semisimple simply connected algebraic group. Given two
irreducible representations $V_1$ and $V_2$ of $G$, we are interested in some
components of $V_1\otimes V_2$. Consider two geometric realizations of $V_1$
and $V_2$ using the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem. Namely, for $i=1, 2$, let $\Li_i$
be a $G$-linearized line bundle on $G/B$ such that ${\rm H}^{q_i}(G/B,\Li_i)$
is isomorphic to $V_i$. Assume that the cup product $$ {\rm
H}^{q_1}(G/B,\Li_1)\otimes {\rm H}^{q_2}(G/B,\Li_2)\longto {\rm
H}^{q_1+q_2}(G/B,\Li_1\otimes\Li_2) $$ is non zero. Then, ${\rm
H}^{q_1+q_2}(G/B,\Li_1\otimes\Li_2)$ is an irreducible component of $V_1\otimes
V_2$; such a component is said to be {\it cohomological}. Solving a
Dimitrov-Roth conjecture, we prove here that the cohomological components of
$V_1\otimes V_2$ are exactly the PRV components of stable multiplicity one.
Note that Dimitrov-Roth already obtained some particular cases. We also
characterize these components in terms of the geometry of the Eigencone of $G$.
Along the way, we prove that the structure coefficients of the Belkale-Kumar
product on ${\rm H}^*(G/B,\ZZ)$ in the Schubert basis are zero or one.
