Searches for lepton-flavor-violating decay of a tau lepton to a lighter mass
lepton and a photon have been performed with the entire dataset of (963 +- 7) x
10^6 tau decays collected by the BaBar detector near the Upsilon(4S),
Upsilon(3S) and Upsilon(2S) resonances. The searches yield no evidence of
signals and we set upper limits on the branching fractions of BR(tau -> e
gamma) < 3.3 x 10^-8 and BR(tau -> mu gamma) < 4.4 x 10^-8 at 90% confidence
level.
