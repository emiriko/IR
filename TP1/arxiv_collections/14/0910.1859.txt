We analyze the Bose-Hubbard model with a three-body hardcore constraint by
mapping the system to a theory of two coupled bosonic degrees of freedom. We
find striking features that could be observable in experiments, including a
quantum Ising critical point on the transition from atomic to dimer
superfluidity at unit filling, and a continuous supersolid phase for strongly
bound dimers.
