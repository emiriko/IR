We continue the discussion of a proposed model of hidden sector of the
Universe, consisting of sterile spin-1/2 Dirac fermions ("sterinos"), sterile
spin-0 bosons ("sterons") with spontaneously nonzero vacuum expectation value,
and sterile nongauge mediating bosons ("A bosons") described by an
antisymmetric-tensor field (of dimension one). The Standard-Model
electromagnetic field (of dimension two) multiplied by the steron vacuum
expectation value becomes in a spontaneous way a source of A-boson field
mediating new weak interactions in hidden sector and providing - due to the
action of electromagnetic field in both sectors - a weak coupling between
hidden and Standard-Model sectors ("photonic portal"). The proposed photonic
portal emphasizes even more the role of electromagnetic field in the structure
of the Universe.
