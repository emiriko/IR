Electro-coalescence is the application of an electric field onto coalescing
fluid bodies. The following fluid dynamics videos show a droplet coalescing
into a fluid bath while embedded into a viscous medium and subject to a very
high electric field. The concentration of electric stresses at the apex of the
droplet cause it to break apart. The droplet is glycerol and the viscous medium
is silicone oil.
