We describe the fabrication and characterization of a new surface-electrode
Paul ion trap designed for experiments in scalable quantum information
processing with Ca+. A notable feature is a symmetric electrode pattern which
allows rotation of the normal modes of ion motion, yielding efficient Doppler
cooling with a single beam parallel to the planar surface. We propose and
implement a technique for micromotion compensation in all directions using an
infrared repumper laser beam directed into the trap plane. Finally, we employ
an alternate repumping scheme that increases ion fluorescence and simplifies
heating rate measurements obtained by time-resolved ion fluorescence during
Doppler cooling.
