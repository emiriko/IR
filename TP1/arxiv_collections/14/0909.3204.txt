We study bound-state effects on the pair production of gluinos at hadron
colliders, in a context of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard
model. Due to the expected large mass and the octet color-charge of gluinos,
the bound-state effects can be substantial at the LHC. We find significant
deformation of the invariant-mass distributions of a gluino-pair near the mass
threshold, as well as an additional correction to the total cross-section. Both
the invariant-mass distribution and the correction to the total cross section
depend crucially on the decay width of the gluino.
