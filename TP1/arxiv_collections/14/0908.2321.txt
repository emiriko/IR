Atmospheric flows exhibit selfsimilar fractal spacetime fluctuations
manifested as the fractal geometry to global cloud cover pattern and inverse
power law form for power spectra of meteorological parameters such as
windspeed, temperature, rainfall etc. Inverse power law form for power spectra
indicate long-range spacetime correlations or non-local connections and is a
signature of selforganised criticality generic to dynamical systems in nature
such as river flows, population dynamics, heart beat patterns etc. The author
has developed a general systems theory which predicts the observed
selforganised criticality as a signature of quantumlike chaos in dynamical
systems. The model predictions are (i) The fractal fluctuations can be resolved
into an overall logarithmic spiral trajectory with the quasiperiodic Penrose
tiling pattern for the internal structure. (ii) The probability distribution
represents the power (variance) spectrum for fractal fluctuations and follows
universal inverse power law form incorporating the golden mean. Such a result
that the additive amplitudes of eddies when squared represent probability
distribution is observed in the subatomic dynamics of quantum systems such as
the electron or photon. Therefore the irregular or unpredictable fractal
fluctuations exhibit quantumlike chaos. (iii) Atmospheric aerosols are held in
suspension by the vertical velocity distribution (spectrum). The atmospheric
aerosol size spectrum is derived in terms of the universal inverse power law
characterizing atmospheric eddy energy spectrum. Model predicted spectrum is in
agreement with the following two experimentally determined atmospheric aerosol
data sets, (i) SAFARI 2000 CV-580 Aerosol Data, Dry Season 2000 (CARG) (ii)
World Data Centre Aerosols data sets for the three stations Ny {\AA}lesund,
Pallas and Hohenpeissenberg.
