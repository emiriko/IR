In this letter, we propose a novel three-dimensional conceptual model for an
emerging service-oriented simulation paradigm. The model can be used as a
guideline or an analytic means to find the potential and possible future
directions of the current simulation frameworks. In particular, the model
inspects the crossover between the disciplines of modeling and simulation,
service-orientation, and software/systems engineering. Finally, two specific
simulation frameworks are studied as examples.
