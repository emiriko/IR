The explanation is that in aortic tissue (both diseased and nondiseased) a
BAK1 pseudogene is expressed; while in the matching blood samples the actual
BAK1 gene is expressed. This explanation was reached after we realized that
BAK1 has two edited copies in human genome. These copies are probably BAK1
pseudogenes. One copy belongs to chromosome 11 (NG_005599.3) and the other to
chromosome 20 (NC_000850.5). The first copy has frameshifts which means that
probably it does not express any functional protein; by other hand, the
chromosome 20 copy has no frameshifts and what is more important contains all
the reported polymorphisms.
