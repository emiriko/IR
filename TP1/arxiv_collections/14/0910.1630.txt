Water clusters embedding a nitric acid molecule HNO3(H2O)_{n=1-10} are
investigated via electrostatic deflection of a molecular beam. We observe large
paraelectric susceptibilities that greatly exceed the electronic
polarizability, revealing the contribution of permanent dipole moments. The
moments derived from the data are also significantly higher than those of pure
water clusters. An enhancement in the susceptibility for n=5,6 and a rise in
cluster abundances setting in at n=6 suggest that dissociation of the solvated
acid molecule into ions takes place in this size range.
