We provide a new provably-secure steganographic encryption protocol that is
proven secure in the complexity-theoretic framework of Hopper et al. The
fundamental building block of our steganographic encryption protocol is a
"one-time stegosystem" that allows two parties to transmit messages of length
shorter than the shared key with information-theoretic security guarantees. The
employment of a pseudorandom generator (PRG) permits secure transmission of
longer messages in the same way that such a generator allows the use of
one-time pad encryption for messages longer than the key in symmetric
encryption. The advantage of our construction, compared to that of Hopper et
al., is that it avoids the use of a pseudorandom function family and instead
relies (directly) on a pseudorandom generator in a way that provides linear
improvement in the number of applications of the underlying one-way permutation
per transmitted bit. This advantageous trade-off is achieved by substituting
the pseudorandom function family employed in the previous construction with an
appropriate combinatorial construction that has been used extensively in
derandomization, namely almost t-wise independent function families.
