Affleck-Dine baryogenesis, accompanied by the formation and subsequent decay
of Q-balls, can generate both the baryon asymmetry of the universe and dark
matter in the form of gravitinos. The gravitinos from Q-ball decay dominate
over the thermally produced population if the reheat temperature is less than
10^7 GeV. We show that a gravitino with mass around 1 GeV is consistent with
all observational bounds and can explain the baryon-to-dark-matter ratio in the
gauge-mediated models of supersymmetry breaking for a wide range of
cosmological and Q-ball parameters. Moreover, decaying Q-balls can be the
dominant production mechanism for m_{3/2} < 1 GeV gravitinos if the Q-balls are
formed from a (B-L) = 0 condensate, which produces no net baryon asymmetry.
Gravitinos with masses in the range (50 eV - 100 keV) produced in this way can
act as warm dark matter and can have observable imprint on the small-scale
structure.
