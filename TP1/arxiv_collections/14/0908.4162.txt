The Gould Belt Legacy Survey will survey nearby star-forming regions (within
500 pc), using HARP (Heterodyne Array Receiver Programme), SCUBA-2
(Submillimetre Common- User Bolometer Array 2) and POL-2 (Polarimeter 2) on the
James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). This paper describes the initial data
obtained using HARP to observe 12CO, 13CO and C18O J = 3 - 2 towards two
regions in Orion B, NGC 2024 and NGC 2071. We describe the physical
characteristics of the two clouds, calculating temperatures and opacities
utilizing all three isotopologues. We find good agreement between temperatures
calculated from CO and from dust emission in the dense, energetic regions. We
determine the mass and energetics of the clouds, and of the high-velocity
material seen in 12CO emission, and compare the relative energetics of the
high- and low-velocity material in the two clouds. We present a CLUMPFIND
analysis of the 13CO condensations. The slope of the condensation mass
functions, at the high-mass ends, is similar to the slope of the initial mass
function.
