We have presented a novel technique of detecting intermittencies in a
financial time series of the foreign exchange rate data of U.S.- Euro
dollar(US/EUR) using a combination of both statistical and spectral techniques.
This has been possible due to Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) analysis which
has been popularly applied to fluctuating data in various fields science and
engineering and is also being tried out in finance and economics. We have been
able to qualitatively identify the presence of nonlinearity and chaos in the
time series of the foreign exchange rates for US/EURO (United States dollar to
Euro Dollar) and US/UK (United States dollar to United Kingdom Pound)
currencies. Interestingly we find that for the US-INDIA(United States dollar to
Indian Rupee) foreign exchange rates, no such chaotic dynamics is observed.
This could be a result of the government control over the foreign exchange
rates, instead of the market controlling them.
