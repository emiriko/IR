We explore the idea of using finite automata to implement new constraints for
local search (this is already a successful technique in constraint-based global
search). We show how it is possible to maintain incrementally the violations of
a constraint and its decision variables from an automaton that describes a
ground checker for that constraint. We establish the practicality of our
approach idea on real-life personnel rostering problems, and show that it is
competitive with the approach of [Pralong, 2007].
