An updated formulation of soft diffraction, compatible with $s$ and $t$
channel unitarity, is presented. Its consequent general soft scattering
features at high energies are explored. The critical interplay between theory
and data analysis and its consequent implications with regards to the
theoretical foundations of soft scattering theory are discussed.
