A novel general formalism for the maximal symetrization and reduction of
fields (MSRF) is proposed and applied to wavefunctions in solid state
nanostructures. Its primary target is to provide an essential tool for the
study and analysis of the electronic and optical properties of semiconductor
quantum heterostructures with relatively high point-group symmetry, and studied
with the $k\cdot p$ formalism. Nevertheless the approach is valid in a much
larger framework than $k\cdot p$ theory, it is applicable to arbitrary systems
of coupled partial differential equations (e.g. strain equations or Maxwell
equations). For spinless problems (scalar equations), one can use a systematic
Spatial Domain Reduction (SDR) technique which allows, for every irreducible
representation, to reduce the set of equations on a minimal domain with
automatic incorporation of the boundary conditions at the border, which are
shown to be non-trivial in general. For a vectorial or spinorial set of
functions, the SDR technique must be completed by the use of an optimal basis
in vectorial or spinorial space (in a crystal we call it the Optimal Bloch
function Basis - OBB). The advantages are numerous: sharper insights on the
symmetry properties of every eigenstate, minimal coupling schemes, analytically
and computationally exploitable at the component function level, minimal
computing domains. The formalism can be applied also as a postprocessing
operation, offering all subsequent analytical and computationnal advantages of
symmetrization. The specific case of a quantum wire (QWRs) with $C_{3v}$ point
group symmetry is used as a concrete illustration of the application of MSRF.
