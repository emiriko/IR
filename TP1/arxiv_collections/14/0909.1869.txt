I argue that questions of algorithmic decidability, computability and
complexity should play a larger role in deciding the "ultimate" theoretical
description of the Landscape of string vacua. More specifically, I examine the
notion of the average rank of the (unification) gauge group in the Landscape,
the explicit construction of Ricci-flat metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds as well
as the computability of fundamental periods to show that undecidability
questions are far more pervasive than that described in the work of Denef and
Douglas.
