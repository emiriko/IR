Sandhi means to join two or more words to coin new word. Sandhi literally
means `putting together' or combining (of sounds), It denotes all combinatory
sound-changes effected (spontaneously) for ease of pronunciation.
Sandhi-vicheda describes [5] the process by which one letter (whether single or
cojoined) is broken to form two words. Part of the broken letter remains as the
last letter of the first word and part of the letter forms the first letter of
the next letter. Sandhi- Vicheda is an easy and interesting way that can give
entirely new dimension that add new way to traditional approach to Hindi
Teaching. In this paper using the Rule based algorithm we have reported an
accuracy of 60-80% depending upon the number of rules to be implemented.
