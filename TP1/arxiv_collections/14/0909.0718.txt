The spin-liquid candidate $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$(CN)$_{3}$ has
been studied by measuring the uniaxial expansion coefficients $\alpha_{i}$, the
specific heat, and magnetic susceptibility. Special emphasis was placed on the
mysterious anomaly around 6 K - a potential spin-liquid instability. Distinct
and strongly anisotropic lattice effects have been observed at 6 K, clearly
identifying this feature as a second-order phase transition. Owing to the large
anomalies in $\alpha_{i}$, the application of Gr\"{u}neisen scaling has enabled
us to determine the corresponding specific heat contribution and the entropy
release. Comparison of the latter with available spin models suggests that spin
degrees of freedom alone cannot account for the phase transition. Scenarios,
involving charge degrees of freedom, are discussed. charge degrees of freedom,
are discussed.
