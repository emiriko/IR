The equilibrium configurations between a Schwarzschild black hole and a
hyperextreme Kerr object are shown to be described by a three-parameter
subfamily of the extended double-Kerr solution. For this subfamily, its Ernst
potential and corresponding metric functions, we provide a physical
representation which employs as arbitrary parameters the individual Komar
masses and relative coordinate distance between the sources. The calculation of
horizon's local angular velocity induced in the Schwarzschild black hole by the
Kerr constituent yields a simple expression inversely proportional to the
square of the distance parameter.
