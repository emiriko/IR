We study a system of D-branes localized near an intersection of Neveu-Schwarz
fivebranes, that is known to exhibit a landscape of supersymmetric and
(metastable) supersymmetry breaking vacua. We show that early universe
cosmology drives it to a particular long-lived supersymmetry breaking ground
state.
