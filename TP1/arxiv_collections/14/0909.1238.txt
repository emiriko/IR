We describe the development of a fitter to reconstruct $\nu_\mu$ induced
Charged-Current single $\pi^0$ (CC$\pi^0$) events in an oil Cherenkov detector
(CH$_2$). These events are fit using a generic muon and two photon extended
track hypothesis from a common event vertex. The development of ring finding
and particle identification are described. Comparisons between data and Monte
Carlo are presented for a few kinematic distributions.
