We go beyond the Standard Model guided by presymmetry, the discrete
electroweak quark-lepton symmetry hidden by topological effects which explain
quark fractional charges as in condense matter physics. Partners of the
particles of the Standard Model and the discrete symmetry associated with this
partnership appear as manifestations of a residual presymmetry and its
extension from matter to forces. This duplication of the spectrum of the
Standard Model keeps spin and comes nondegenerated about the TeV scale.
