Several models of new physics, such as grand unified theories, Pati-Salam
models, chiral color models, etc., predict the existence of an $SU(2)_L$
doublet of color-octet scalars (COS). In the Manohar-Wise model, the Yukawa
couplings of the COS are assumed to be consistent with Minimal Flavor Violation
ensuring constraints from flavor physics are satisfied even for relatively
light scalars. In this simple model we consider the production of color singlet
bound states of COS that we call octetonium. Octetonium are mainly produced via
gluon-gluon fusion and have significant production cross sections at the LHC.
They can decay to pairs of gluons or electroweak gauge bosons. If the masses of
the octetonia are 1 TeV or less, these states will be visible as resonances in
$\gamma \gamma, W^+W^-, ZZ$, and $ \gamma Z$.
