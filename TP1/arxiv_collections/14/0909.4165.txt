We have studied the relationship between the AGN radio-loudness and the mass
of the central black-hole by using the ~190 type 1 AGN selected in the
XMM-Newton Bright Survey (XBS). We find that radio-loud AGNs are much more
frequent at high black-hole masses being a factor ~10 times more common for
masses >10^9 Msun when compared to masses between 10^7-10^9 Msun.
