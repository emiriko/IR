The local moment approach is extended to the orbitally-degenerate [SU(2N)]
Anderson impurity model (AIM). Single-particle dynamics are obtained over the
full range of energy scales, focussing here on particle-hole symmetry in the
strongly correlated regime where the onsite Coulomb interaction leads to
many-body Kondo physics with entangled spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The
approach captures many-body broadening of the Hubbard satellites, recovers the
correct exponential vanishing of the Kondo scale for all N, and its universal
scaling spectra are found to be in very good agreement with numerical
renormalization group (NRG) results. In particular the high-frequency
logarithmic decays of the scaling spectra, obtained here in closed form for
arbitrary N, coincide essentially perfectly with available numerics from the
NRG. A particular case of an anisotropic Coulomb interaction, in which the
model represents a system of N `capacitively-coupled' SU(2) AIMs, is also
discussed. Here the model is generally characterised by two low-energy scales,
the crossover between which is seen directly in its dynamics.
