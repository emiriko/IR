We present archival Spitzer IRS spectra of 19 luminous 8 micron selected
sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The object classes derived from
these spectra and from an additional 24 spectra in the literature are compared
with classifications based on 2MASS/MSX (J, H, K, and 8 micron) colors in order
to test the "JHK8" classification scheme (Kastner et al. 2008). The IRS spectra
confirm the classifications of 22 of the 31 sources that can be classified
under the JHK8 system. The spectroscopic classification of 12 objects that were
unclassifiable in the JHK8 scheme allow us to characterize regions of the
color-color diagrams that previously lacked spectroscopic verification,
enabling refinements to the JHK8 classification system. The results of these
new classifications are consistent with previous results concerning the
identification of the most infrared-luminous objects in the LMC. In particular,
while the IRS spectra reveal several new examples of asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) stars with O-rich envelopes, such objects are still far outnumbered by
carbon stars (C-rich AGB stars). We show that Spitzer IRAC/MIPS color-color
diagrams provide improved discrimination between red supergiants and
oxygen-rich and carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars relative to those
based on 2MASS/MSX colors. These diagrams will enable the most luminous IR
sources in Local Group galaxies to be classified with high confidence based on
their Spitzer colors. Such characterizations of stellar populations will
continue to be possible during Spitzer's warm mission, through the use of IRAC
[3.6]-[4.5] and 2MASS colors.
