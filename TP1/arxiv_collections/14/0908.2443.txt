We investigate the collapse and fragmentation of low-mass, trans-sonically
turbulent prestellar cores, using SPH simulations. The initial conditions are
slightly supercritical Bonnor-Ebert spheres, all with the same density profile,
the same mass (M_O=6.1 Msun) and the same radius (R_O=17,000 AU), but having
different initial turbulent velocity fields. Four hundred turbulent velocity
fields have been generated, all scaled so that the mean Mach number is M=1.
Then a subset of these, having a range of net angular momenta, j, has been
evolved. The evolution of these turbulent cores is not strongly correlated with
j. Instead it is moderated by the formation of filamentary structures due to
converging turbulent flows. A high fraction (~ 82%) of the protostars forming
from turbulent cores are attended by protostellar accretion discs, but only a
very small fraction (~16%) of these discs is sufficiently cool and extended to
develop non-linear gravitational instabilities and fragment.
