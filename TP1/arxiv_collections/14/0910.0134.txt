The production of charmed and beauty hadrons in proton-proton collisions at
high energies are analyzed within the modified quark-gluon string model (QGSM)
including the internal motion of quarks in colliding hadrons. We present some
predictions for the future experiments on the beauty baryon production in $pp$
collisions at LHC energies. This analysis allows us to find interesting
information on the Regge trajectories of the heavy (b{\bar b}) mesons and the
sea beauty quark distributions in the proton.
