We investigate the solar flare of 20 October 2002. The flare was accompanied
by quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) of both thermal and nonthermal hard X-ray
emissions (HXR) observed by RHESSI in the 3-50 keV energy range. Analysis of
the HXR time profiles in different energy channels made with the Lomb
periodogram indicates two statistically significant time periods of about 16
and 36 seconds. The 36-second QPP were observed only in the nonthermal HXR
emission in the impulsive phase of the flare. The 16-second QPP were more
pronounced in the thermal HXR emission and were observed both in the impulsive
and in the decay phases of the flare. Imaging analysis of the flare region, the
determined time periods of the QPP and the estimated physical parameters of
magnetic loops in the flare region allow us to interpret the observations as
follows. 1) In the impulsive phase energy was released and electrons were
accelerated by successive acts with the average time period of about 36 seconds
in different parts of two spatially separated, but interacting loop systems of
the flare region. 2) The 36-second periodicity of energy release could be
caused by the action of fast MHD oscillations in the loops connecting these
flaring sites. 3) During the first explosive acts of energy release the MHD
oscillations (most probably the sausage mode) with time period of 16 seconds
were excited in one system of the flare loops. 4) These oscillations were
maintained by the subsequent explosive acts of energy release in the impulsive
phase and were completely damped in the decay phase of the flare.
