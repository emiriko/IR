In this review, we present and discuss the most recent results on inclusive
and exclusive diffractive processes at HERA and Tevatron colliders.
Measurements from fixed target experiments at HERMES and Jefferson laboratory
are also reviewed. The complementarity of all these results is analysed in the
context of perturbative QCD and new challenging issues in nucleon tomography
are studied. A first understanding of how partons are localised in the nucleon
to build orbital momenta can be addressed with these experimental results. Some
prospects are outlined for new measurements in fixed target kinematic, at
Jefferson laboratory and CERN, at COMPASS, or at the LHC. Of special interest
is the exclusive (coherent) production of Higgs boson and heavy objects at the
LHC. Based on the present knowledge, some perspectives are presented in this
direction.
