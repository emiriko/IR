A predictor variable or dose that is measured with substantial error may
possess an error-free milestone, such that it is known with negligible error
whether the value of the variable is to the left or right of the milestone.
Such a milestone provides a basis for estimating a linear relationship between
the true but unknown value of the error-free predictor and an outcome, because
the milestone creates a strong and valid instrumental variable. The inferences
are nonparametric and robust, and in the simplest cases, they are exact and
distribution free. We also consider multiple milestones for a single predictor
and milestones for several predictors whose partial slopes are estimated
simultaneously. Examples are drawn from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, in
which a BA degree acts as a milestone for sixteen years of education, and the
binary indicator of military service acts as a milestone for years of service.
