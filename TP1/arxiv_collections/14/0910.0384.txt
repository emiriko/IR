We investigate $\gamma p \to K^{*+} \Lambda$ reaction within a Regge
approach. For the gauge invariance of the scattering amplitude, we reggeize the
s-channel and contact term amplitudes as well as the $t$-channel amplitude. We
obtain the decreasing behavior of the total cross section as the CLAS's
preliminary data show. We also calculate spin density matrices, and find clear
differences between our Regge model and the previous Feynman (isobar) model.
