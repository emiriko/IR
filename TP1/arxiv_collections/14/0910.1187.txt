In the context of the AMIGA project, we used Fabry-Perot observations in
order to study the dynamics of the ionised gas in the isolated galaxy CIG 0314.
  From the Halpha observations, we could obtain the velocity field and rotation
curve of the galaxy. A detail analysis of the velocity field is done in order
to understand the kinematics of the gas to gather clues on the mechanisms which
favour or inhibit star formation, in particular along the bar. The visible and
dark matter content can be reached, as well as an estimation of the mass of the
galaxy.
