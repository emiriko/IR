Inspired by the Randall-Sundrum (RS) framework we consider a number of
phenomenologically relevant model building questions on a slice of compactified
AdS_d for d >5. Such spaces are interesting as they enable one to realize the
weak scale via warping. We perform the Kaluza-Klein (KK) reduction for
gravitons and bulk vectors in these spaces and for the case of AdS_6 consider
the KK spectrum of gauge-scalars. We further obtain the KK towers for bulk
fermions on a slice of AdS_7 and AdS_9 and show that the RS approach to flavor
generalizes to these spaces with the localization of chiral zero mode fermions
controlled by their bulk Dirac mass parameters. However for the
phenomenologically interesting case where the transverse radius is R^{-1}\sim
TeV we show that bulk Standard Model fields are not viable due to a resulting
volume suppression of the gauge coupling constants. A similar suppression
occurs for the case of UV localization. Thus it seems that the Standard Model
fields should be confined to the infrared brane in such spaces. Sterile fields
and extended gauge sectors may propagate in the bulk with the gauge-coupling
volume suppression experienced by the latter motivating a weak coupling to
Standard Model fields. We also discuss some issues regarding the effective 4D
theory description in these spaces.
