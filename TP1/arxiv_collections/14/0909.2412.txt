The mass and decay constant of the ground state strange tensor meson
$K_2^*(1430)$ with $I(J^P)=1/2(2^+)$ is calculated using the QCD sum rules
method. The results are consistent with the experimental data. It is found that
SU(3) symmetry breaking effect constitutes about $20^0/_0$ of the decay
constant.
