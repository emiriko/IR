It is proposed to develop a source of polarized ^3He^{++} ions for the JINR
Accelerator Complex on the basis of its polarized deuteron source by feeding
its radio-frequency dissociator with ^3He gas to produce metastable atoms,
using an existing sextupole magnet and adding a low-field rf transition units.
  The radio-frequency transitions of the atomic states of helium-3 in the
metastable state are studied. The Schroedinger equations in the uncoupled basis
|\psi_e,\psi_h> and also in the basis of stationary states are received.
Results of computer simulations agree with published data. The possibility to
use two types of the weak field transitions in the helium-3 with different
frequencies to get positive or negative values of the helion polarization is
shown.
