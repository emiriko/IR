We calculate finite-volume corrections to the low-energy constants $\Sigma$
and $F$ in the epsilon-regime of QCD using partially quenched chiral
perturbation theory in the supersymmetry formulation without a singlet
particle. We comment on how to minimize these corrections in lattice
simulations of QCD.
