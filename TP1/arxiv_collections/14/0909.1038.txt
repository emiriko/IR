The black hole information paradox is a very poorly understood problem. It is
often believed that Hawking's argument is not precisely formulated, and a more
careful accounting of naturally occurring quantum corrections will allow the
radiation process to become unitary. We show that such is not the case, by
proving that small corrections to the leading order Hawking computation cannot
remove the entanglement between the radiation and the hole. We formulate
Hawking's argument as a `theorem': assuming `traditional' physics at the
horizon and usual assumptions of locality we will be forced into mixed states
or remnants. We also argue that one cannot explain away the problem by invoking
AdS/CFT duality. We conclude with recent results on the quantum physics of
black holes which show the the interior of black holes have a `fuzzball'
structure. This nontrivial structure of microstates resolves the information
paradox, and gives a qualitative picture of how classical intuition can break
down in black hole physics.
