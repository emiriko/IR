We study exclusive non-leptonic two-body $B_c\to(D_{(s)},\eta_c,B_{(s)})+F$
decays with $F$(pseudoscalar or vector meson) being factored out in QCD
factorization approach. The non-leptonic decay amplitudes are related to the
product of meson decay constants and the form factors for semileptonic $B_c$
decays. As inputs in obtaining the branching ratios for a large set of
non-leptonic $B_c$ decays, we use the weak form factors for the semileptonic
$B_c\to(D_{(s)},\eta_c,B_{(s)})$ decays in the whole kinematical region and the
unmeasured meson decay constants obtained from our previous light-front quark
model. We compare our results of the branching ratios with those of other
theoretical studies.
