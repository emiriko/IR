The first phase of the ATLAS (Australia Telescope Large Area Survey) project
surveyed a total 7 square degrees down to 30 micro Jy rms at 1.4 GHz and is the
largest sensitive radio survey ever attempted. We report on the scientific
achievements of ATLAS to date and plans to extend the project as a path finder
for the proposed EMU (Evolutionary map of the Universe) project which has been
designed to use ASKAP (Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder).
