A zigzag graphene nanodisk can be interpreted as a quantum dot with an
internal degree of freedom. It is well described by the infinite-range
Heisenberg model. We have investigated its thermodynamical properties. There
exists a quasi-phase transition between the quasi-ferromagnet and
quasi-paramagnet states, as signaled by a sharp peak in the specific heat and
in the susceptability. We have also analyzed how thermodynamical properties are
affected when two leads are attached to the nanodisk. It is shown that lead
effects are described by the many-spin Kondo Hamiltonian. There appears a new
peak in the specific heat, and the multiplicity of the ground state becomes
just one half of the system without leads. Another lead effect is to enhance
the ferromagnetic order. Being a ferromagnet, a nanodisk can be used as a spin
filter. Furthermore, since the relaxation time is finite, it is possible to
control the spin of the nanodisk by an external spin current. We then propose a
rich variety of spintronic devices made of nanodisks and leads, such as spin
memory, spin amplifier, spin valve, spin-field-effect transistor, spin diode
and spin logic gates such as spin-XNOR gate and spin-XOR gate. Graphene
nanodisks could well be basic components of future nanoelectronic and
spintronic devices.
