The electronic transport of electrons and holes through stacks of
$\alpha$,$\ome ga$-dicyano-$\beta$,$\beta$'-dibutyl- quaterthiophene (DCNDBQT)
as part of a nov el organic ferroic field-effect transistor (OFFET) is
investigated. The novel ap plication of a ferroelectric instead of a dielectric
substrate provides the poss ibility to switch bit-wise the ferroelectric
domains and to employ the polarizat ion of these domains as a gate field in an
organic semiconductor. A device conta ining very thin DCNDBQT films of around
20 nm thickness is intended to be suitab le for logical as well as optical
applications. We investigate the device proper ties with the help of a
phenomenological model called multilayer organic light-e mitting diodes
(MOLED), which was extended to transverse fields. The results sho wed, that
space charge and image charge effects play a crucial role in these org anic
devices.
