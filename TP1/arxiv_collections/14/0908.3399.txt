We study the scenario of gravitino DM with a general neutralino NLSP in a
model independent way. We consider all neutralino decay channels and compare
them with the most recent BBN constraints. We check how those bounds are
relaxed for a Higgsino or a Wino NLSP in comparison to the Bino neutralino case
and look for possible loopholes in the general MSSM parameter space.We
determine constraints on the gravitino and neutralino NLSP mass and comment on
the possibility of detecting these scenarios at colliders.
