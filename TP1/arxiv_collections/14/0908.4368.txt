We detect the HD 32297 debris disk in scattered light at 1.6 and 2.05
\micron. We use these new observations together with a previous scattered light
image of the disk at 1.1 \micron to examine the structure and scattering
efficiency of the disk as a function of wavelength. In addition to surface
brightness asymmetries and a warped morphology beyond $\sim$1\farcs5 for one
lobe of the disk, we find that there exists an asymmetry in the spectral
features of the grains between the northeastern and southwestern lobes. The
mostly neutral color of the disk lobes imply roughly 1 \micron-sized grains are
responsible for the scattering. We find that the asymmetries in color and
morphology can plausibly be explained by HD 32297's motion into a dense ISM
cloud at a relative velocity of 15 km s$^{-1}$. We model the interaction of
dust grains with HI gas in the cloud. We argue that supersonic ballistic drag
can explain the morphology of the debris disks of HD 32297, HD 15115, and HD
61005.
