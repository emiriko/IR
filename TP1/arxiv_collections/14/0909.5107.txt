We have measured parity-violating asymmetries in elastic electron-proton and
quasi-elastic electron-deuteron scattering at Q^2 = 0.22 and 0.63 GeV^2. They
are sensitive to strange quark contributions to currents in the nucleon, and to
the nucleon axial current. The results indicate strange quark contributions of
< 10% of the charge and magnetic nucleon form factors at these four-momentum
transfers. We also present the first measurement of anapole moment effects in
the axial current at these four-momentum transfers.
