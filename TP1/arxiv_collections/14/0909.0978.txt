We investigate the eigenvalues statistics of ensembles of normal random
matrices when their order N tends to infinite. In the model the eigenvalues
have uniform density within a region determined by a simple analytic polynomial
curve. We study the conformal deformations of normal random ensembles to
Hermitian random ensembles and give sufficient conditions for the latter to be
a Wigner ensemble.
