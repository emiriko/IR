We show that a large class of two-dimensional spinless fermion models exhibit
topological superconducting phases characterized by a non-zero Chern number.
More specifically, we consider a generic one-band Hamiltonian of spinless
fermions that is invariant under both time-reversal, $\mathbb{T}$, and a group
of rotations and reflections, $\mathbb{G}$, which is either the dihedral
point-symmetry group of an underlying lattice, $\mathbb{G}=D_n$, or the
orthogonal group of rotations in continuum, $\mathbb{G}={\rm O}(2)$. Pairing
symmetries are classified according to the irreducible representations of $
\mathbb{T} \otimes \mathbb{G}$. We prove a theorem that for any two-dimensional
representation of this group, a time-reversal symmetry breaking paired state is
energetically favorable. This implies that the ground state of any spinless
fermion Hamiltonian in continuum or on a square lattice with a singly-connected
Fermi surface is always a topological superconductor in the presence of
attraction in at least one channel. Motivated by this discovery, we examine
phase diagrams of two specific lattice models with nearest-neighbor hopping and
attraction on a square lattice and a triangular lattice. In accordance with the
general theorem, the former model exhibits only a topological $(p + ip)$-wave
state, while the latter shows a doping-tuned quantum phase transition from such
state to a non-topological, but still exotic $f$-wave superconductor.
