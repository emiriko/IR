We report synthesis of high quality Fe1+y(Te1-xSx)z single crystals and a
comprehensive study of structural, magnetic and transport properties. There is
high sensitivity to material stoichiometry which includes vacancies on the
Te(S) site. Our results reveal competition and coexistence of magnetic order
and percolative superconductivity for x >= 0.03, while zero resistivity is
acheived for x >= 0.1.
