Previous observations have not been able to exclude the possibility that high
temperature active region loops are actually composed of many small scale
threads that are in various stages of heating and cooling and only appear to be
in equilibrium. With new observations from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS)
and X-ray Telescope (XRT) on \textit{Hinode} we have the ability to investigate
the properties of high temperature coronal plasma in extraordinary detail. We
examine the emission in the core of an active region and find three independent
lines of evidence for steady heating. We find that the emission observed in XRT
is generally steady for hours, with a fluctuation level of approximately 15% in
an individual pixel. Short-lived impulsive heating events are observed, but
they appear to be unrelated to the steady emission that dominates the active
region. Furthermore, we find no evidence for warm emission that is spatially
correlated with the hot emission, as would be expected if the high temperature
loops are the result of impulsive heating. Finally, we also find that
intensities in the "moss", the footpoints of high temperature loops, are
consistent with steady heating models provided that we account for the local
expansion of the loop from the base of the transition region to the corona. In
combination, these results provide strong evidence that the heating in the core
of an active region is effectively steady, that is, the time between heating
events is short relative to the relevant radiative and conductive cooling
times.
