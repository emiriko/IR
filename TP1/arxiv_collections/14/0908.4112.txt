The observation of the anomalous quantum Hall effect in exfoliated graphene
flakes triggered an explosion of interest in graphene. It was however not
observed in high quality epitaxial graphene multilayers grown on silicon
carbide substrates. The quantum Hall effect is shown on epitaxial graphene
monolayers that were deliberately grown over substrate steps and subjected to
harsh processing procedures, demonstrating the robustness of the epitaxial
graphene monolayers and the immunity of their transport properties to
temperature, contamination and substrate imperfections. The mobility of the
monolayer C-face sample is 19,000 cm^2/Vs. This is an important step towards
the realization of epitaxial graphene based electronics.
