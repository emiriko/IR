In coherent control, electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations usually cause
coherence loss through irreversible spontaneous emission. However, since the
dissipation via emission is essentially due to correlation of the fluctuations,
when emission ends in a superposition of multiple final states, correlation
between different pathways may build up if the "which-way" information is not
fully resolved (i.e., the emission spectrum is broader than the transition
energy range). Such correlation can be exploited for spin-flip control in a
$\Lambda$-type three-level system, which manifests itself as an all-optical
spin echo in nonlinear optics with two orders of optical fields saved as
compared with stimulated Raman processes. This finding represents a new class
of optical nonlinearity induced by electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations.
