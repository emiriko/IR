The data on high-precision flavour observables reveal certain puzzles when
compared to Standard Model expectations based on a global fit of the CKM
unitarity triangle and general theoretical estimates. The discussion of these
tensions in the channels B to J/psi K, B to phi K, and B to pi K, and the
deduced constraints for New Physics operators of the class (bs)(qq) form the
content of this talk.
