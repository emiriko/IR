We revisit the new-type of the Q ball (the gravity-mediation type of the Q
ball in the gauge-mediation), in order to clarify its properties and correct
some misunderstandings found in the recent literature. In addition, we
investigate the feature of the other kind of the hybrid-type of the Q ball,
which was considered in the context of the Q-ball capture by the neutron star.
