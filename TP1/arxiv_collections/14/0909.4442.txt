We consider disordered ladders of the transverse-field Ising model and study
their critical properties and entanglement entropy for varying width, $w \le
20$, by numerical application of the strong disorder renormalization group
method. We demonstrate that the critical properties of the ladders for any
finite $w$ are controlled by the infinite disorder fixed point of the random
chain and the correction to scaling exponents contain information about the
two-dimensional model. We calculate sample dependent pseudo-critical points and
study the shift of the mean values as well as scaling of the width of the
distributions and show that both are characterized by the same exponent,
$\nu(2d)$. We also study scaling of the critical magnetization, investigate
critical dynamical scaling as well as the behavior of the critical entanglement
entropy. Analyzing the $w$-dependence of the results we have obtained accurate
estimates for the critical exponents of the two-dimensional model:
$\nu(2d)=1.25(3)$, $x(2d)=0.996(10)$ and $\psi(2d)=0.51(2)$.
