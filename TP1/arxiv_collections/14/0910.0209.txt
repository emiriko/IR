The pion and nucleon mass differences generate a very pronounced cusp in the
photoproduction reaction of a single neutral pion on the proton. A
nonrelativistic effective field theory to describe this reaction is
constructed. The approach is rigorous in the sense that it is an effective
field theory with a consistent power counting scheme. Expressions for the S-
and P-wave multipole amplitudes at one loop are given. The relation of the
phase of the electric multipole E_0+ to the phase of the S-wave of pi^0 p -->
pi^0 p scattering is discussed.
