A systematic study of the effects of polarization mode dispersion on
broad-band and narrow-band, single pump, fiber parametric amplifiers is
realized through numerical solutions of the equations governing the
interaction. The nonlinear polarization rotation is shown to be a relevant
effect that can increase gain randomness when it mixes with polarization mode
dispersion. In unidirectionally spun fibers the signal-pump alignment can be
highly increased and the gain enhanced. However, in spite of the enhanced
alignment, large polarization mode dispersion phase-mismatches the interaction
and the gain decreases to zero.
