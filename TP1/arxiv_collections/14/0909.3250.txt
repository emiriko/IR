We study the structure of clusters in a model colloidal system with competing
interactions using Brownian dynamics simulations. A short-ranged attraction
drives clustering, while a weak, long-ranged repulsion is used to model
electrostatic charging in experimental systems. The former is treated with a
short-ranged Morse attractive interaction, the latter with a repulsive Yukawa
interaction. We consider the yield of clusters of specific structure as a
function of the strength of the interactions, for clusters with m=3,4,5,6,7,10
and 13 colloids. At sufficient strengths of the attractive interaction (around
10 kT), the average bond lifetime approaches the simulation timescale and the
system becomes nonergodic. For small clusters m<=5 where geometric frustration
is not relevant, despite nonergodicity, for sufficient strengths of the
attractive interaction the yield of clusters which maximise the number of bonds
approaches 100%. However for $m=7$ and higher, in the nonergodic regime we find
a lower yield of these structures where we argue geometric frustration plays a
significant role. $m=6$ is a special case, where two structures, of octahedral
and C2v symmetry compete, with the latter being favoured by entropic
contributions in the ergodic regime and by kinetic trapping in the nonergodic
regime. We believe that our results should be valid as far as the one-component
description of the interaction potential is valid. A system with competing
electrostatic repulsions and van der Waals attractions may be such an example.
However, in some cases, the one-component description of the interaction
potential may not be appropriate.
