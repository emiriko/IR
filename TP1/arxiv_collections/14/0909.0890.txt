Every time function on spacetime gives a (continuous) total preordering of
the spacetime events which respects the notion of causal precedence. The
problem of the existence of a (semi-)time function on spacetime and the problem
of recovering the causal structure starting from the set of time functions are
studied. It is pointed out that these problems have an analog in the field of
microeconomics known as utility theory. In a chronological spacetime the
semi-time functions correspond to the utilities for the chronological relation,
while in a K-causal (stably causal) spacetime the time functions correspond to
the utilities for the K^+ relation (Seifert's relation). By exploiting this
analogy, we are able to import some mathematical results, most notably Peleg's
and Levin's theorems, to the spacetime framework. As a consequence, we prove
that a K-causal (i.e. stably causal) spacetime admits a time function and that
the time or temporal functions can be used to recover the K^+ (or Seifert)
relation which indeed turns out to be the intersection of the time or temporal
orderings. This result tells us in which circumstances it is possible to
recover the chronological or causal relation starting from the set of time or
temporal functions allowed by the spacetime. Moreover, it is proved that a
chronological spacetime in which the closure of the causal relation is
transitive (for instance a reflective spacetime) admits a semi-time function.
Along the way a new proof avoiding smoothing techniques is given that the
existence of a time function implies stable causality, and a new short proof of
the equivalence between K-causality and stable causality is given which takes
advantage of Levin's theorem and smoothing techniques.
