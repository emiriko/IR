The development of Hybrid CMOS Detectors (HCDs) for X-Ray telescope focal
planes will place them in con- tention with CCDs on future satellite missions
due to their faster frame rates, flexible readout scenarios, lower power
consumption, and inherent radiation hardness. CCDs have been used with great
success on the current generation of X-Ray telescopes (e.g. Chandra, XMM,
Suzaku, and Swift). However their bucket-brigade read-out architecture, which
transfers charge across the chip with discrete component readout electronics,
results in clockrate limited readout speeds that cause pileup (saturation) of
bright sources and an inherent susceptibility to radiation induced displacement
damage that limits mission lifetime. In contrast, HCDs read pixels with low
power, on-chip multiplexer electronics in a random access fashion. Faster frame
rates achieved with multi-output readout design will allow the next
generation's larger effective area telescopes to observe bright sources free of
pileup. Radiation damaged lattice sites effect a single pixel instead of an
entire row. Random access, multi-output readout will allow for novel readout
modes such as simultaneous bright-source-fast/whole-chip-slow readout. In order
for HCDs to be useful as X-Ray detectors, they must show noise and energy
resolution performance similar to CCDs while retaining advantages inherent to
HCDs. We will report on readnoise, conversion gain, and energy resolution
measurements of an X-Ray enhanced Teledyne HAWAII-1RG (H1RG) HCD and describe
techniques of H1RG data reduction.
