We study the system of two localized anyons in the lowest Landau level and
show how anyonic signatures extrapolating between anti-bunching tendencies of
fermions and bunching tendencies of bosons become manifest in the two-particle
correlations. Towards probing these correlations, we discuss the influence of a
saddle potential on these anyons; we exploit analogies from quantum optics to
analyze the time-evolution of such a system. We show that the saddle potential
can act as a beam splitter akin to those in bosonic and fermionic systems and
can provide a means of measuring the derived anyonic signatures.
