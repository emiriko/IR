alpha-d coincidence data were studied for the 6Li + 59Co reaction at E(lab) =
29.6 MeV. By using a kinematic analysis, it was possible to identify which
process, leading to the same final state, has the major contribution for each
of the selected angular regions. Contributions of the 6Li sequential and direct
breakup to the incomplete fusion/transfer process were discussed by considering
the lifetimes obtained by using a semiclassical approach, for both breakup
components.
