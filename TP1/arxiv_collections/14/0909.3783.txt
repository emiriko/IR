In the framework of ion-trap quantum computing, we develop a characterization
of experimentally realistic imperfections which may affect the Cirac-Zoller
implementation of the CNOT gate. The CNOT operation is performed by applying a
protocol of five laser pulses of appropriate frequency and polarization. The
laser-pulse protocol exploits auxiliary levels, and its imperfect
implementation leads to unitary as well as non-unitary errors affecting the
CNOT operation. We provide a characterization of such imperfections, which are
physically realistic and have never been considered before to the best of our
knowledge. Our characterization shows that imperfect laser pulses unavoidably
cause a leak of information from the states which alone should be transformed
by the ideal gate, into the ancillary states exploited by the experimental
implementation.
