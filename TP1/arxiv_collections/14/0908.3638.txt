Single molecule transistors (SMTs) are currently attracting enormous
attention as possible quantum information processing devices. An intrinsic
limitation to the prospects of these however is associated to the presence of a
small number of quantized conductance channels, each channel having a high
access resistance of at best $R_{K}/2=h/2e^{2}$=12.9 k$\Omega$. When the
contacting leads become superconducting, these correlations can extend
throughout the whole system by the proximity effect. This not only lifts the
resistive limitation of normal state contacts, but further paves a new way to
probe electron transport through a single molecule. In this work, we
demonstrate the realization of superconducting SMTs involving a single C60
fullerene molecule. The last few years have seen gate-controlled Josephson
supercurrents induced in the family of low dimensional carbon structures such
as flakes of two-dimensional graphene and portions of one-dimensional carbon
nanotubes. The present study involving a full zero-dimensionnal fullerene
completes the picture.
