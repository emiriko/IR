We study QCD with two flavours of colour-sextet quarks as a candidate
walking-Technicolor theory. We simulate lattice QCD with two flavours of
colour-sextet staggered quarks at finite temperatures to observe the scales of
confinement and chiral-symmetry breaking. These should give us some indication
as to whether the massless theory has an infrared fixed point making it a
conformal field theory, or whether it exhibits confinement and chiral symmetry
breaking with a slowly varying coupling constant, i.e. `walks'. We find that
unlike the case with fundamental quarks, the deconfinement and chiral-symmetry
restoration transitions are far apart. The values of $\beta=6/g^2$ for both
transitions increase when $Ta$ is decreased from 1/4 to 1/6 as would be
expected for finite temperature transitions of an asymptotically-free field
theory. So far we see no suggestion of conformal behaviour.
