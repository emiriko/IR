We reformulate the Casimir force in the presence of a non-trivial background.
The force may be written in terms of loop variables, the loop being a curve
around the scattering sites. A natural path ordering of exponentials take place
when a particular representation of the scattering centres is given. The basic
object to be evaluated is a reduced (or abbreviated) classical pseudo-action
that can be operator valued.
