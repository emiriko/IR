We study the evolution of a perfect--fluid sphere coupled to a scalar
radiation field. By ensuring a Ricci invariant regularity as a conformally flat
spacetime at the central world line we find that the fluid coupled to the
scalar field satisfies the equation of state $\rho_c+3p_c=$ constant at the
center of the sphere, where the energy $\rho_c$ density and the pressure $p_c$
do not necessarily contain the scalar field contribution. The fluid can be
interpreted as anisotropic and radiant because of the scalar field, but it
becomes perfect and non radiative at the center of the sphere. These results
are being currently considered to build up a numerical relativistic
hydrodynamic solver.
