We give differential equations compatible with the rational qKZ equation with
boundary reflection. The total system contains the trigonometric degeneration
of the bispectral qKZ equation of type (C_{n}^{\vee}, C_{n}) which in the case
of type GL_{n} was studied by van Meer and Stokman. We construct an integral
formula for solutions to our compatible system in a special case.
