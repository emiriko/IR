Within the kt-factorization approach, we evaluate the impact factor of the
transition gamma* -> rhoT taking into account the twist 3 contributions. We
show that a gauge invariant expression is obtained with the help of QCD
equations of motion. More generally, relying on these equations and on the
invariance under rotation on the light-cone of the factorized amplitude, the
non-perturbative Distribution Amplitudes can be reduced to a minimal set. This
opens the way to a consistent treatment of factorization for exclusive
processes with a transversally polarized vector meson. We prove the equivalence
of two proposed parametrizations of the rhoT distribution amplitudes.
