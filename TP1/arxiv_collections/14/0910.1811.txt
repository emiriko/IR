We show that the Haldane phase of S=1 chains is characterized by a double
degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum. The degeneracy is protected by a set
of symmetries (either the dihedral group of $\pi$-rotations about two
orthogonal axes, time-reversal symmetry, or bond centered inversion symmetry),
and cannot be lifted unless either a phase boundary to another, "topologically
trivial", phase is crossed, or the symmetry is broken. More generally, these
results offer a scheme to classify gapped phases of one dimensional systems.
Physically, the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum can be observed by
adiabatically weakening a bond to zero, which leaves the two disconnected
halves of the system in a finitely entangled state.
