We develop an analytical theory for quantum phase transitions driven by
disorder in magnets and superconductors. We study these transitions with a
cavity approximation which becomes exact on a Bethe lattice with large
branching number. We find two different disordered phases, characterized by
very different relaxation rates, which both exhibit strong inhomogeneities
typical of glassy physics.
