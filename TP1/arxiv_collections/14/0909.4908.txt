We demonstrate a new type of quantum mechanical correlation where phase
modulators at distant locations, acting on the photons of an entangled pair,
interfere to determine the apparent depth of modulation. When the modulators
have the same phase, the modulation depth doubles; when oppositely phased, the
modulators negate each other.
