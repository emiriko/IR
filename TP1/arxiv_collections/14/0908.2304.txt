The low-momentum effective interaction $V_{low k}$ has been formulated in the
three-dimensional momentum-helicity representation as a function of the
magnitude of momentum vectors and the angle between them. As an application,
AV18 potential has been used in the model space of Lee-Suzuki method and it has
been shown that the low-momentum effective interaction, $V_{low k}$ reproduces
the same two-body observables obtained by the bare potential $V_{NN}$.
