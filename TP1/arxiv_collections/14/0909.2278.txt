Wavelength-scale, high Q-factor photonic crystal cavities have emerged as a
platform of choice for on-chip manipulation of optical signals, with
applications ranging from low-power optical signal processing and cavity
quantum electrodynamics, to biochemical sensing. Many of these applications,
however, are limited by the fabrication tolerances and the inability to
precisely control the resonant wavelength of fabricated structures. Various
techniques for post-fabrication wavelength trimming and dynamical wavelength
control -- using, for example, thermal effects, free carrier injection, low
temperature gas condensation, and immersion in fluids -- have been explored.
However, these methods are often limited by small tuning ranges, high power
consumption, or the inability to tune continuously or reversibly. In this
letter, by combining nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) and nanophotonics,
we demonstrate reconfigurable photonic crystal nanobeam cavities that can be
continuously and dynamically tuned using electrostatic forces. A tuning of ~10
nm has been demonstrated with less than 6 V of external bias and negligible
steady-state power consumption.
