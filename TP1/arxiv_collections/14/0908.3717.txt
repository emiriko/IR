We examine scattering properties of singular vertex of degree $n=2$ and
$n=3$, taking advantage of a new form of representing the vertex boundary
condition, which has been devised to approximate a singular vertex with finite
potentials. We show that proper identification of $\delta$ and $\delta'$
components in the connection condition between outgoing lines enables the
designing of quantum spectral branch-filters.
