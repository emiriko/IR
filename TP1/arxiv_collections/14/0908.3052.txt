We investigate the accuracy of two mean-field theories of the trapped
two-dimensional Bose gas at predicting transition region properties by
comparison to non-perturbative classical field calculations. To make these
comparisons we examine the density profiles and the predictions for the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless superfluid transition temperature over a
parameter range in which the degree of thermal activation in the tightly
trapped direction varies considerably. These results present an important test
of these mean-field theories, and provide a characterization of their typical
accuracy.
