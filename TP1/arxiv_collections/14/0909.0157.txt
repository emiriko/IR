We present the results on period search and modeling of the cool DAV star KUV
02464+3239. Our observations resolved the multiperiodic pulsational behaviour
of the star. In agreement with its position near the red edge of the DAV
instability strip, it shows large amplitude, long period pulsation modes, and
has a strongly non-sinusoidal light curve. We determined 6 frequencies as
normal modes and revealed remarkable short-term amplitude variations. A
rigorous test was performed for the possible source of amplitude variation:
beating of modes, effect of noise, unresolved frequencies or rotational
triplets. Among the best-fit models resulting from a grid search, we selected 3
that gave l=1 solutions for the largest amplitude modes. These models had
masses of 0.645, 0.650 and 0.680 M_Sun. The 3 `favoured' models have M_H
between 2.5x10^-5 - 6.3x10^-6 M_* and give 14.2 - 14.8 mas seismological
parallax. The 0.645 M_Sun (11400 K) model also matches the spectroscopic log g
and T_eff within 1 sigma. We investigated the possibility of mode trapping and
concluded that while it can explain high amplitude modes, it is not required.
