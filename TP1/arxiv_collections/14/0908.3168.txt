In light of recent experimental evidence of density wave order in the
cuprates, we consider a phenomenological model of a d-wave superconductor with
coexisting charge, spin or pair density wave order of various form and wave
vector. We study the evolution of the nodal structure of the quasiparticle
energy spectrum as a function of the amplitude of the coexisting order and
perform diagrammatic linear response calculations of the low-temperature
(universal-limit) thermal conductivity. The work described herein expands upon
our past studies, which focused on a particular unit-cell-doubling charge
density wave, generalizing our techniques to a wider class of coexisting order.
We find that the question of whether the nodes of the d-wave superconductor
survive amidst a reasonable level of coexisting order is sensitive to the form
and wave vector of the order. However, in cases where the nodes do become
gapped, we identify a signature of the approach to this nodal transition, in
the low-temperature thermal conductivity, that appears to be quite general. The
amplitude of this signature is found to be disorder-dependent, which suggests a
connection between the presence of coexisting order in the underdoped cuprates
and recent observations of deviations from universal (disorder-independent)
thermal conductivity in the underdoped regime.
