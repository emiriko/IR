We have implemented the new IR-improved
Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi-Callan-Symanzik (DGLAP-CS) kernels
recently developed by one of us in the HERWIG6.5 environment to generate a new
MC, HERWIRI1.0(31), for hadron-hadron scattering at high energies. We present
MC data that illustrate the comparison between the parton shower generated by
the standard DGLAP-CS kernels and that generated by the new IR-improved
DGLAP-CS kernels. We also show comparisons with FNAL data and we discuss
possible implications for LHC phenomenology.
