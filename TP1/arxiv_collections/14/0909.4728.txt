A rigorous formulation of Vessiot's vector field approach to the analysis of
general systems of partial differential equations is provided. It is shown that
this approach is equivalent to the formal theory of differential equations and
that it can be carried through if, and only if, the given system is involutive.
As a by-product, we provide a novel characterisation of transversal integral
elements via the contact map.
