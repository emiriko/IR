Galaxy clusters are valuable cosmological probes. However, cluster mass
estimates rely on observable quantities that are affected by complicated
baryonic physics in the intracluster medium (ICM), including feedback from
active galactic nuclei (AGN). Cosmological simulations have started to include
AGN feedback using subgrid models. In order to make robust predictions, the
systematics of different implementations and parametrizations need to be
understood. We have developed an AGN subgrid model in FLASH that supports a few
different black hole accretion models and feedback models. We use this model to
study the effect of AGN on X-ray cluster observables and its dependence on
model variations.
