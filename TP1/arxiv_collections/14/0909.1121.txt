One-loop corrections to the $Z^{\prime}$ decay width are derived and analyzed
in the framework of the general form of the 3-3-1 models. We identify two
important sources of corrections: oblique corrections asociated to the
$Z^{\prime}$ propagator through vacum polarizations induced by virtual
particle-antiparticle pairs of new heavy quarks $J$, and vertex corrections to
the $Z^{\prime}q\bar{q}$ vertex through virtual exchange of new $K^{Q_{1,2}}$
gauge bosons. Fixing an specific renormalization scheme, we obtain dominant
oblique corrections that exhibit a quadratic dependence on the $J$ quark mass,
which are absorbed into two oblique parameters: a global parameter $\rho
^{\prime}_f$ which modify the $Z^{\prime}$ decay width, and a parameter $\kappa
^{\prime}_{f}$ that define effective $Z^{\prime}$ couplings. Numerical results
in an specific 3-3-1 model gives a strong contribution of the oblique
corrections from about 1.3% in the $d(s)$ quark channel to 10.5% in the
neutrino channel, for $m_{J}=2$ TeV. The vertex corrections contribute to the
oblique corrections up to 1.4% for the same channel and $m_{J}$ value. For $pp$
collisions at the CERN LHC collider, we find that the corrections significantly
modify the shape of the cross section distributions for $e^{+}e^{-}$ and
$t\bar{t}$ final states, where the distributions including the radiative
corrections increases up to 1.23 times the tree-level distribution for the
dielectron events and to 1.07 for the top events when $m_{J}=3$ TeV.
