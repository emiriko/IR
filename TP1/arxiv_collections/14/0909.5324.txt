We study in detail the so-called looping case of Mozes's game of numbers,
which concerns the (finite) orbits in the reflection representation of affine
Weyl groups situated on the boundary of the Tits cone. We give a simple proof
that all configurations in the orbit are obtainable from each other by playing
the numbers game, and give a strategy for going from one configuration to
another. The strategy gives rise to a partition of the finite Weyl group into
finitely many graded posets, one for each extending vertex of the associated
extended Dynkin diagram. These are selfdual and mutually isomorphic, and dual
to the triangulation of the unit hypercube by reflecting hyperplanes, studied
by many authors. Unlike the weak and Bruhat orders, the top degree is cubic in
the number of vertices of the graph. We explicitly compute the Hilbert
polynomial of the poset.
