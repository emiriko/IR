Detection of defective members of large populations has been widely studied
in the statistics community under the name "group testing", a problem which
dates back to World War II when it was suggested for syphilis screening. There
the main interest is to identify a small number of infected people among a
large population using collective samples. In viral epidemics, one way to
acquire collective samples is by sending agents inside the population. While in
classical group testing, it is assumed that the sampling procedure is fully
known to the reconstruction algorithm, in this work we assume that the decoder
possesses only partial knowledge about the sampling process. This assumption is
justified by observing the fact that in a viral sickness, there is a chance
that an agent remains healthy despite having contact with an infected person.
Therefore, the reconstruction method has to cope with two different types of
uncertainty; namely, identification of the infected population and the
partially unknown sampling procedure.
  In this work, by using a natural probabilistic model for "viral infections",
we design non-adaptive sampling procedures that allow successful identification
of the infected population with overwhelming probability 1-o(1). We propose
both probabilistic and explicit design procedures that require a "small" number
of agents to single out the infected individuals. More precisely, for a
contamination probability p, the number of agents required by the probabilistic
and explicit designs for identification of up to k infected members is bounded
by m = O(k^2 (log n)/p^2) and m = O(k^2 (log n)^2 /p^2), respectively. In both
cases, a simple decoder is able to successfully identify the infected
population in time O(mn).
