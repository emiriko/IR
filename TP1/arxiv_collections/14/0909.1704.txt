Cohesive powders form agglomerates that can be very porous. Hence they are
also very fragile. Consider a process of complete fragmentation on a
characteristic length scale $\ell$, where the fragments are subsequently
allowed to settle under gravity. If this fragmentation-reagglomeration cycle is
repeated sufficiently often, the powder develops a fractal substructure with
robust statistical properties. The structural evolution is discussed for two
different models: The first one is an off-lattice model, in which a fragment
does not stick to the surface of other fragments that have already settled, but
rolls down until it finds a locally stable position. The second one is a
simpler lattice model, in which a fragment sticks at first contact with the
agglomerate of fragments that have already settled. Results for the fragment
size distribution are shown as well. One can distinguish scale invariant dust
and fragments of a characteristic size. Their role in the process of structure
formation will be addressed.
