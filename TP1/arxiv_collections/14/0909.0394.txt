There are either a near kinematic distance of 5.5 kpc or a far distance of
8.8 kpc for a Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G32.8$-$0.1 derived by using the
rotation curve of the Galaxy. Here we make sure that the remnant distance is
the farther one 8.8 kpc through solving a group of equations for the shell-type
remnants separately at the adiabatic-phase and the radiative-phase. For SNR
G346.6$-$0.2 we determine its distance also the farther one 11 kpc rather than
the nearer one 5.5 kpc.
