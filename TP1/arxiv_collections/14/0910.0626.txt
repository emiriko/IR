Workflow management systems allow the users to develop complex applications
at a higher level, by orchestrating functional components without handling the
implementation details. Although a wide range of workflow engines are developed
in enterprise environments, the open source engines available for scientific
applications lack some functionalities or are too difficult to use for
non-specialists. Our purpose is to develop a workflow management platform for
distributed systems, that will provide features like an intuitive way to
describe workflows, efficient data handling mechanisms and flexible fault
tolerance support. We introduce here an architectural model for the workflow
platform, based on the ActiveBPEL workflow engine, which we propose to augment
with an additional set of components.
