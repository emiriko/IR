Electronic transmission in bent quantum wires modeled by the tight binding
Hamiltonian, and clamped between ideal, semi-infinite leads is studied. The
effect of `bending' the chain is simulated by introducing a non-zero hopping
between the extremities of the wire. It is seen that the proximity of the two
ends gives rise to Falo line shapes in the transmission spectrum. Transmission
properties for both an ordered lattice and a Fibonacci quantum wire are
discussed. In the quasi-periodic Fibonacci chain, the proximity of the two ends
of the chain closes all the gaps in the spectrum and the spectrum loses it's
Cantor set character.
