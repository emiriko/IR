Super B factories that will further probe the flavor sector of the Standard
Model and physics beyond will demand excellent charged particle identification
(PID), particularly K/pi separation, for momenta up to 4 GeV/c, as well as the
ability to operate under beam backgrounds significantly higher than current B
factory experiments. We describe an Imaging Time-of-Propagation (iTOP) detector
which shows significant potential to meet these requirements. Photons emitted
from charged particle interactions in a Cerenkov radiator bar are internally
reflected to the end of the bar, where they are collected on a compact image
plane using photodetectors with fine spatial segmentation in two dimensions.
Precision measurements of photon arrival time are used to enhance the two
dimensional imaging, allowing the system to provide excellent PID capabilities
within a reduced detector envelope. Results of the ongoing optimization of the
geometric and physical properties of such a detector are presented, as well as
simulated PID performance. Validation of simulations is being performed using a
prototype in a cosmic ray test stand at the University of Hawaii.
