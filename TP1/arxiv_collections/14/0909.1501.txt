We present extensive, high-density Swift observations of V2491 Cyg (Nova Cyg
2008 No. 2). Observing the X-ray emission from only one day after the nova
discovery, the source is followed through the initial brightening, the
Super-Soft Source phase and back to the pre-outburst flux level. The evolution
of the spectrum throughout the outburst is demonstrated. The UV and X-ray
light-curves follow very different paths, although changes occur in them around
the same times, indicating a link between the bands. Flickering in the
late-time X-ray data indicates the resumption of accretion.
  We show that if the white dwarf is magnetic, it would be among the most
magnetic known; the lack of a periodic signal in our later data argues against
a magnetic white dwarf, however. We also discuss the possibility that V2491 Cyg
is a recurrent nova, providing recurrence timescale estimates.
