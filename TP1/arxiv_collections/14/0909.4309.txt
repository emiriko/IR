(Abridged) We present the first radiation-hydrodynamic model of a
protoplanetary disc irradiated with an X-EUV spectrum. In a model where the
total ionizing luminosity is divided equally between X-ray and EUV luminosity,
we find a photoevaporation rate of 1.4e-8 M_sun/yr, which is two orders of
magnitude greater than the case of EUV photoevaporation alone. Thus it is clear
that the X-rays are the dominant driving mechanism for photoevaporation. This
can be understood inasmuch as X-rays are capable of penetrating much larger
columns (~1e22 cm^-2) and can thus effect heating in denser regions and at
larger radius than the EUV can. The radial extent of the launching region of
the X-ray heated wind is 1-70AU compared with the pure EUV case where the
launch region is concentrated around a few AU. When we couple our wind
mass-loss rates with models for the disc's viscous evolution, we find that, as
in the pure EUV case, there is a photoevaporative switch, such that an inner
hole develops at ~ 1 AU at the point that the accretion rate in the disc drops
below the wind mass loss rate. At this point, the remaining disc material is
quickly removed in the final 15-20% of the disc's lifetime. This is consistent
with the 1e5 yr transitional timescale estimated from observations of T-Tauri
stars. We also caution that although our mass-loss rates are high compared to
some accretion rates observed in young stars, our model has a rather large
X-ray luminosity of 2e30 erg/s; further modeling is required in order to
investigate the evolutionary implications of the large observed spread of X-ray
luminosities in T-Tauri stars.
