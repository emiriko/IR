Understanding new superconductors requires high-quality epitaxial thin films
to explore intrinsic electromagnetic properties, control grain boundaries and
strain effects, and evaluate device applications. So far superconducting
properties of ferropnictide thin films appear compromised by imperfect
epitaxial growth and poor connectivity of the superconducting phase. Here we
report novel template engineering using single-crystal intermediate layers of
(001) SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 grown on various perovskite substrates that enables
genuine epitaxial films of Co-doped BaFe2As2 with high transition temperature
(zero resistivity Tc of 21.5K), small transition widths (delta Tc = 1.3K),
superior Jc of 4.5 MA/cm2 (4.2K, self field) and strong c-axis flux pinning.
Implementing SrTiO3 or BaTiO3 templates to match the alkaline earth layer in
the Ba-122 with the alkaline earth-oxygen layer in the templates opens new
avenues for epitaxial growth of ferropnictides on multi-functional single
crystal substrates. Beyond superconductors, it provides a framework for growing
heteroepitaxial intermetallic compounds on various substrates by matching
interfacial layers between templates and thin film overlayers.
