We give a "regularity lemma" for degree-d polynomial threshold functions
(PTFs) over the Boolean cube {-1,1}^n. This result shows that every degree-d
PTF can be decomposed into a constant number of subfunctions such that almost
all of the subfunctions are close to being regular PTFs. Here a "regular PTF is
a PTF sign(p(x)) where the influence of each variable on the polynomial p(x) is
a small fraction of the total influence of p.
  As an application of this regularity lemma, we prove that for any constants d
\geq 1, \eps \geq 0, every degree-d PTF over n variables has can be
approximated to accuracy eps by a constant-degree PTF that has integer weights
of total magnitude O(n^d). This weight bound is shown to be optimal up to
constant factors.
