Extensions of Fannes' inequality with partial sums of the Tsallis entropy are
obtained for both the classical and quantum cases. The definition of kth
partial sum under the prescribed order of terms is given. Basic properties of
introduced entropic measures and some applications are discussed. The derived
estimates provide a complete characterization of the continuity and stability
properties in the refined scale. The results are also reformulated in terms of
Uhlmann's partial fidelities.
