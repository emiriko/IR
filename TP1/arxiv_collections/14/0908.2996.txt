We report on HET and Palomar 5 m spectroscopy of recently identified
$\gamma$-ray blazars in the {\it Fermi} LAT Bright Source List. These data
provide identifications for 10 newly discovered $\gamma$-ray flat spectrum
radio quasars (FSRQ) and six new BL Lacs plus improved spectroscopy for six
additional BL Lacs. We substantially improve the identification completeness of
the bright LAT blazars and give new redshifts and $z$ constraints, new
estimates of the black hole masses and new measurements of the optical SED.
