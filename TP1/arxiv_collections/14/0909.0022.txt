In Phys. Rev. Lett. 67, 937 (1991) [1], Haldane introduced the fruitful
concept of fractional exclusion statistics (FES). One of the most influential
papers in which the thermodynamics of FES systems was deduced is Y.-S. Wu,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 73, 922 (1994). Unfortunately, some important, but eventually
subtle, properties of the exclusion statistics parameters were overlooked in
the original paper [1] and in all the papers after that, including [2]. This
omission makes the thermodynamics of FES systems inconsistent when mutual
exclusion statistics is manifesting in the system. By this Comment I want to
point-out this error--an error that persisted for such a long time--and to give
the correct statistical mechanics interpretation of FES.
