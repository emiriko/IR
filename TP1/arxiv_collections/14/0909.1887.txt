The Wigner function of a pure continuous-variable quantum state is
non-negative if and only if the state is Gaussian. Here we show that for the
canonical pair angle and angular momentum, the only pure states with
non-negative Wigner functions are the eigenstates of the angular momentum. Some
implications of this surprising result are discussed.
