A unified treatment of mass varying dark matter coupled to cosmon-{\em like}
dark energy is shown to result in {\em effective} generalized Chaplygin gas
(GCG) scenarios. The mass varying mechanism is treated as a cosmon field
inherent effect. Coupling dark matter with dark energy allows for reproducing
the conditions for the present cosmic acceleration and for recovering the
stability resulted from a positive squared speed of sound $c_{s}^{\2}$, as in
the GCG scenario. The scalar field mediates the nontrivial coupling between the
dark matter sector and the sector responsible for the accelerated expansion of
the universe. The equation of state of perturbations is the same as that of the
background cosmology so that all the effective results from the GCG paradigm
are maintained. Our results suggest the mass varying mechanism, when obtained
from an exactly soluble field theory, as the right responsible for the
stability issue and for the cosmic acceleration of the universe.
