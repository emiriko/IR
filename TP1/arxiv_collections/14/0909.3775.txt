We present a model to study the statistics of a single structureless quantum
particle freely moving in a space at a finite temperature. It is shown that the
quantum particle feels the temperature and can exchange energy with its
environment in the form of heat transfer. The underlying mechanism is
diffraction at the edge of the wave front of its matter wave. Expressions of
energy and entropy of the particle are obtained for the irreversible process.
