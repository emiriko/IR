Understanding the origin or absence of the R-parity violating interactions in
the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model is a vital and open issue. Here we
show that in the minimal B-L models, R-parity and B-L are spontaneously broken
at the TeV scale. We also briefly discuss the phenomenological and cosmological
aspects of these scenarios.
