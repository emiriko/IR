The autocorrelation function and the run structure are two basic notions for
binary sequences, and have been used as two independent postulates to test
randomness of binary sequences ever since Golomb 1955. In this paper, we prove
for binary sequence that the autocorrelation function is in fact completely
determined by its run structure.
