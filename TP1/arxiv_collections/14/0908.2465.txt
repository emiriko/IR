Trends in resonances, termed confinement resonances, in photoionization of
atoms A in endohedral fullerene anions A@C60^{z-} are theoretically studied and
exemplified by the photoionization of Ne in Ne@C{60}^{z-}. Remarkably, above a
particular nl ionization threshold of Ne in neutral Ne@C60 (I_{nl}^{z=0}),
confinement resonances in corresponding partial photoionization cross sections
sigma_{nl} of Ne in any charged Ne@C60^{z-} remain almost intact by a charge z
on the carbon cage, as a general phenomenon. At lower photon energies, omega <
I_{nl}^{z=0}, the corresponding photoionization cross sections develop
additional, strong, z-dependent resonances, termed Coulomb confinement
resonances, as a general occurrence. Furthermore, near the innermost 1s
ionization threshold, the 2p photoionization cross section sigma_{2p} of the
outermost 2p subshell of thus confined Ne is found to inherit the confinement
resonance structure of the 1s photoionization spectrum, via interchannel
coupling. As a result, new confinement resonances emerge in the 2p
photoionization cross section of the confined Ne atom at photoelectron energies
which exceed the 2p threshold by about a thousand eV, i.e., far above where
conventional wisdom said they would exist. Thus, the general possibility for
confinement resonances to resurrect in photoionization spectra of encapsulated
atoms far above thresholds is revealed, as an interesting novel general
phenomenon.
