Microwave transport experiments have been performed in a
quasi-two-dimensional resonator with randomly distributed scatterers, each
mimicking an $r^{-2}$ repulsive potential. Analysis of both stationary wave
fields and transient transport shows large deviations from Rayleigh's law for
the wave height distribution, which can only partially be described by existing
multiple-scattering theories. At high frequencies, the flow shows branching
structures similar to those observed previously in stationary imaging of
electron flow. Semiclassical simulations confirm that caustics in the ray
dynamics are likely to be responsible for the observed structures. Particular
conspicuous features observed in the stationary patterns are "hot spots" with
intensities far beyond those expected in a random wave field. Reinterpreting
the flow patterns as ocean waves in the presence of spatially varying currents
or depth variations in the sea floor, the branches and hot spots lead to
enhanced frequency of freak or rogue wave formation in these regions.
