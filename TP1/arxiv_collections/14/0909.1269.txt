Dwarf galaxies are the numerically dominating population in the dense regions
of the universe. Although they seem to be simple systems at first view, the
stellar populations of dwarf elliptical galaxies (dEs) might be fairly complex.
Nucleated dEs are of particular interest, since a number of objects exhibit
different stellar populations in their nuclei and host galaxy. We present
stellar population parameters obtained from integrated optical spectra using a
Lick index analysis of seven nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies and their
nuclei. After subtracting the scaled galaxy spectra from the nucleus spectra,
we compared them with one another and explore their stellar populations. As a
preliminary result, we find that the luminosity weighted ages of the nuclei
slightly lower than those of galaxies, however, we do not see any significant
difference in metallicity of the host galaxies and their nuclei.
