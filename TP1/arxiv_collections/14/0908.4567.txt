Low energy photon production is an important background to many current and
future precision neutrino experiments. We present a phenomenological study of
t-channel radiative corrections to neutral current neutrino nucleus scattering.
After introducing the relevant processes and phenomenological coupling
constants, we will explore the derived energy and angular distributions as well
as total cross-section predictions along their estimated uncertainties. This is
supplemented throughout with comments on possible experimental signatures and
implications. We conclude with a general discussion of the analysis in the
context of complimentary methodologies.
