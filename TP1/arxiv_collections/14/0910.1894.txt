We present results of optical spectroscopic and BVR_CI_C photometric
observations of 77 pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in the Cepheus flare region. A
total of 64 of these are newly confirmed PMS stars, originally selected from
various published candidate lists. We estimate effective temperatures and
luminosities for the PMS stars, and comparing the results with pre-main
sequence evolutionary models we estimate stellar masses of 0.2-2.4M_sun and
stellar ages of 0.1-15 Myr. Among the PMS stars, we identify 15 visual binaries
with separations of 2-10 arcsec. From archival IRAS, 2MASS, and Spitzer data,
we construct their spectral energy distributions and classify 5% of the stars
as Class I, 10% as Flat SED, 60% as Class II, and 3% as Class III young stellar
objects (YSOs). We identify 12 CTTS and 2 WTTS as members of NGC 7023, with
mean age of 1.6 Myr. The 13 PMS stars associated with L1228 belong to three
small aggregates: RNO 129, L1228A, and L1228S. The age distribution of the 17
PMS stars associated with L1251 suggests that star formation has propagated
with the expansion of the Cepheus flare shell. We detect sparse aggregates of
6-7 Myr old PMS stars around the dark clouds L1177 and L1219, at a distance of
400 pc. Three T Tauri stars appear to be associated with the Herbig Ae star SV
Cep at a distance of 600 pc. Our results confirm that the molecular complex in
the Cepheus flare region contains clouds of various distances and star forming
histories.
