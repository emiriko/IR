We experimentally measured higher order normalized correlation functions
(nCF) of pulsed light with a time-multiplexing-detector. We demonstrate
excellent performance of our device by verifying unity valued nCF up to the
eighth order for coherent light, and factorial dependence of the nCF for
pseudothermal light. We applied our measurement technique to a type-II
parametric downconversion source to investigate mutual two-mode correlation
properties and ascertain nonclassicality.
