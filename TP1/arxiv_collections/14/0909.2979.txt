At hadron colliders, new massive particles can be searched for by the
observation of high tranverse momentum objects forming high-mass resonances.
Searches for additional massive vector bosons (W',Z'), Randall-Sundrum
gravitons and sneutrinos in R-parity violating scenarios are performed in
dilepton, dijets and diboson final states. The most recent results from the CDF
and D0 experiments at the Tevatron are presented corresponding to integrated
luminosities between 1 and 4 fb^{-1}.
