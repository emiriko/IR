By introducing the s-parameterized generalized Wigner operator into
phase-space quantum mechanics we invent the technique of integration within
s-ordered product of operators (which considers normal ordered, antinormally
ordered and Weyl ordered product of operators as its special cases). The
s-ordered operator expansion formula of density operators is derived, and the
s-parameterized quantization scheme is thus completely established.
