Lack of any information on the CP violating phase $\dcp$ weakens our ability
to determine neutrino mass hierarchy. Magic baseline of 7500 km was proposed to
overcome this problem. However, to obtain large enough fluxes, at this very
long baseline, one needs new techniques of generating high intensity neutrino
beams. In this letter, we highlight the {\it magical} properties of a 2540 km
baseline. At such a baseline, using a narrow band neutrino superbeam whose flux
peaks around the energy 3.5 GeV, we can determine neutrino mass hierarchy {\bf
independent} of the CP phase. For $\sin^2 2 \theta_{13} \geq 0.05$, a very
modest exposure of 10 Kiloton-years is sufficient to determine the hierarchy.
For $0.02 \leq \sin^2 2 \theta_{13} \leq 0.05$, an exposure of about 100
Kiloton-years is needed.
