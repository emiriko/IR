Drop evaporation is a simple phenomena but still unclear concerning the
mechanisms of evaporation. A common agreement of the scientific community based
on experimental and numerical work evidences that most of the evaporation
occurs at the triple line. However, the rate of evaporation is still
empirically predicted due to the lack of knowledge on the convection cells
which develop inside the drop under evaporation. The evaporation of sessile
drop is more complicated than it appears due to the coupling by conduction with
the heating substrate, the convection and conduction inside the drop and the
convection and diffusion with the vapour phase. The coupling of heat transfer
in the three phases induces complicated cases to solve even for numerical
simulations. We present recent experimental fluid dynamics videos obtained
using a FLIR SC-6000 coupled with a microscopic lens of 10 micron of resolution
to observe the evaporation of sessile drops in infrared wavelengths. The range
of 3 to 5 micron is adapted to the fluids observed which are ethanol, methanol
and FC-72 since they are all half-transparent to the infrared.
