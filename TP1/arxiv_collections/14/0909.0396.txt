Deconfined quantum phase transition from N\'eel phase to Valence bond crystal
state in 2D Heisenberg model is under debate nowadays. One crucial issue is the
suppression of Haldane's instanton on quantum critical point which drives the
spinon deconfined. In this paper, by making use of the $\phi$-mapping
topological current theory, we reexamine the Haldane's instanton in an
alternative way along the direction of topology. We find that the the monopole
events are space-time singularities of N\'eel field $\vec{n}$, the
corresponding topological charges are the wrapping number of $\vec{n}$ around
the singularities which can be expressed in terms of the Hopf indices and
Brouwer degrees of $\phi$-mapping. The suppression of the monopole events can
only be guaranteed when the $\phi$-field possesses no zero points. Moreover,
the quadrapolarity of monopole events in the Heisenberg model due to the Berry
phase is also reproduced in this topological argument.
