We consider the semiclassical (zero-dispersion) limit of the one-dimensional
focusing Nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLS) with decaying potentials. If a
potential is a simple rapidly oscillating wave (the period has the order of the
semiclassical parameter epsilon) with modulated amplitude and phase, the
space-time plane subdivides into regions of qualitatively different behavior,
with the boundary between them consisting typically of collection of piecewise
smooth arcs (breaking curve(s)). In the first region the evolution of the
potential is ruled by modulation equations (Whitham equations), but for every
value of the space variable x there is a moment of transition (breaking), where
the solution develops fast, quasi-periodic behavior, i.e., the amplitude
becomes also fastly oscillating at scales of order epsilon. The very first
point of such transition is called the point of gradient catastrophe. We study
the detailed asymptotic behavior of the left and right edges of the interface
between these two regions at any time after the gradient catastrophe. The main
finding is that the first oscillations in the amplitude are of nonzero
asymptotic size even as epsilon tends to zero, and they display two separate
natural scales; of order epsilon in the parallel direction to the breaking
curve in the (x,t)-plane, and of order epsilon ln(epsilon) in a transversal
direction. The study is based upon the inverse-scattering method and the
nonlinear steepest descent method.
