A new Abelian gauge symmetry U(1)' is well motivated to extend the standard
model or supersymmetric standard model. Leptonic Z' resonances are clean
signals even at the hadron colliders. We discuss how 4-lepton and 6-lepton Z'
resonances can help the search for Supersymmetry and Higgs, respectively, at
the LHC.
