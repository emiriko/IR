We provide the unique affine crystal structure for type E_6^{(1)}
Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals corresponding to the multiples of fundamental
weights s Lambda_1, s Lambda_2, and s Lambda_6 for all s \geq 1 (in Bourbaki's
labeling of the Dynkin nodes, where 2 is the adjoint node). Our methods
introduce a generalized tableaux model for classical highest weight crystals of
type E and use the order three automorphism of the affine E_6^{(1)} Dynkin
diagram. In addition, we provide a conjecture for the affine crystal structure
of type E_7^{(1)} Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals corresponding to the adjoint
node.
