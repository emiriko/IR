Let F be a nonarchimedean local field of characterisitic 0 and odd residual
characteristic. We describe explicitly the two base change lifts of
supercuspidal representations of U(1,1)(F). This represents a step towards the
goal of describing base change of endoscopic supercuspidal L-packets of
U(2,1)(F).
