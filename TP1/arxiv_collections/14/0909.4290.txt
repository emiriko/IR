Since the original proposal of an unconventional chiral order parameter in
the ruthenate perovskite superconductor Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$, much attention has
been given to the possibility of out-of-plane nodal lines on the predominant
$\gamma$ cylindrical Fermi surface given evidence for low-lying quasiparticle
excitations in this material. Here I propose a tunneling spectroscopy
experiment to determine whether such nodal lines in fact exist.
