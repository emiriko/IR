We give an overview of the science case for spectroscopy of resolved stellar
populations beyond the Local Group with the European Extremely Large Telescope
(E-ELT). In particular, we present science simulations undertaken as part of
the EAGLE Phase A design study for a multi--integral-field-unit, near-infrared
spectrograph. EAGLE will exploit the unprecedented primary aperture of the
E-ELT to deliver AO-corrected spectroscopy across a large (38.5 sq. arcmin)
field, truly revolutionising our view of stellar populations in the Local
Volume.
