We present electronic structure calculations of few-layer epitaxial graphene
nanoribbons on SiC(0001). Trough an atomistic description of the graphene
layers and the substrate within the extended H\"{u}ckel Theory and
real/momentum space projections we argue that the role of the heterostructure's
interface becomes crucial for the conducting capacity of the studied systems.
The key issue arising from this interaction is a Fermi level pinning effect
introduced by dangling interface bonds. Such phenomenon is independent from the
width of the considered nanostructures, compromising the importance of
confinement in these systems.
