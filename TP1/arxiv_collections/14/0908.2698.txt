One of the unifying concepts in the iron-pnictide superconductors, both for
the mechanism of magnetic ordering and of unconventional order parameter
character, has been the electron and hole Fermi surfaces that are approximately
nested. Using the density functional methods that have predicted Fermi surfaces
correctly in SrFe$_2$P$_2$, we find that the recently reported superconducting
Sr$_2$VO$_3$FeAs, with $T_c$=37 K and no apparent competition between magnetism
and superconductivity, possesses different Fermi surface geometry and character
than previous classes of iron pnictides. The intervening layer (a V bilayer)
gives rise to bands that cross the Fermi level. Coupling to the FeAs layer is
small except for interaction along the zone boundary, however that coupling
degrades the Fermi surface nesting. Sr$_2$VO$_3$FeAs, with its alternating
layers of open shell atoms, deserves further close study that should help to
understand the origin of the properties of iron pnictide compounds.
