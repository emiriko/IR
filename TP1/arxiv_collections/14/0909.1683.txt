We perform finite-temperature dynamical simulations of the arrest of a
rotating Bose-Einstein condensate by a fixed trap anisotropy, using a
Hamiltonian classical-field method. We consider a quasi-two-dimensional
condensate containing a single vortex in equilibrium with a rotating thermal
cloud. Introducing an elliptical deformation of the trapping potential leads to
the loss of angular momentum from the system. We identify the condensate and
the complementary thermal component of the nonequilibrium field, and compare
the evolution of their angular momenta and angular velocities. By varying the
trap anisotropy we alter the relative efficiencies of the vortex-cloud and
cloud-trap coupling. For strong trap anisotropies the angular momentum of the
thermal cloud may be entirely depleted before the vortex begins to decay. For
weak trap anisotropies, the thermal cloud exhibits a long-lived steady state in
which it rotates at an intermediate angular velocity.
