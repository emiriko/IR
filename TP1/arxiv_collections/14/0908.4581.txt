The purpose of this work is to fabricate ribbon-like InGaAs and InAsP wires
embedded in InP ridge structures and investigate their transport properties.
The InP ridge structures that contain the wires are selectively grown by
chemical beam epitaxy (CBE) on pre-patterned InP substrates. To optimize the
growth and micro-fabrication processes for electronic transport, we explore the
Ohmic contact resistance, the electron density, and the mobility as a function
of the wire width using standard transport and Shubnikov-de Haas measurements.
At low temperatures the ridge structures reveal reproducible mesoscopic
conductance fluctuations. We also fabricate ridge structures with submicron
gate electrodes that exhibit non-leaky gating and good pinch-off
characteristics acceptable for device operation. Using such wrap gate
electrodes, we demonstrate that the wires can be split to form quantum dots
evidenced by Coulomb blockade oscillations in transport measurements.
