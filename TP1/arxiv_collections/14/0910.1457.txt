We describe local field theories with continuously distributed mass. Such
models can be realized as models in d space-time with Poincare invariance only
in four-dimensional space-time. We also discuss some possible phenomenological
consequences. Namely, we show that the Higgs boson phenomenology in the SM
extension with continuously distributed Higgs boson mass can differ in a
drastic way from the SM Higgs boson phenomenology.
