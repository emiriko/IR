Results are presented on an alternative cavity to the ILC baseline design of
TESLA-style SRF main accelerating linacs. This re-optimised shape enhances the
bandwidth of the accelerating mode and has reduced surface electric and
magnetic fields, compared to the baseline design and some current high gradient
designs. Detailed simulations on the e.m. fields for the New Low Surface Field
(NLSF) cavity, including end-cell and coupler designs, are reported. The
re-distributed dipole modes are also discussed.
