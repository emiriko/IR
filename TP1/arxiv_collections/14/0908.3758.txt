For many years, there seemed to be significant differences between the
continuum intensity distributions derived from observations and simulations of
the solar photosphere. In order to settle the discussion on these apparent
discrepancies, we present a detailed comparison between simulations and
seeing-free observations that takes into account the crucial influence of
instrumental image degradation. We use a set of images of quiet Sun granulation
taken in the blue, green and red continuum bands of the Broadband Filter Imager
of the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard Hinode. The images are deconvolved
with Point Spread Functions (PSF) that account for non-ideal contributions due
to instrumental stray-light and imperfections. In addition, synthetic intensity
images are degraded with the corresponding PSFs. The results are compared with
respect to spatial power spectra, intensity histograms, and the centre-to-limb
variation of the intensity contrast. The observational findings are well
matched with corresponding synthetic observables from three-dimensional
radiation (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations. We conclude that the intensity
contrast of the solar continuum intensity is higher than usually derived from
ground-based observations and is well reproduced by modern numerical
simulations. Properly accounting for image degradation effects is of crucial
importance for comparisons between observations and numerical models. It
finally settles the traditionally perceived conflict between observations and
simulations.
