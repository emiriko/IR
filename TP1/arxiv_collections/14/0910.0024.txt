We investigate the effect on the Hawking radiation given off during the time
of collapse of a Reisner-Nordstr\"om domain wall. Using the functional
Schr\"odinger formalism we are able to probe the time-dependent regime, which
is out of the reach of the standard approximations like the Bogolyubov method.
We calculate the occupation number of particles for a scalar field and complex
scalar field. We demonstrate that the particles from the scalar field are
unaffected by the charge of the Reisner-Nordstr\"om domain wall, as is expected
since the scalar field doesn't carry any charge, which would couple to the
charge of the Reisner-Nordstr\"om domain wall. Here the situation effectively
reduces to the uncharged case, a spherically symmetric domain wall. To take the
charge into account, we consider the complex scalar field which represents
charged particles and anti-particles. Here investigate two different cases,
first the non-extremal case and second the extremal case. In the non-extremal
case we demonstrate that when the particle (anti-particle) carries charge
opposite to that of the domain wall, the occupation number becomes suppressed
during late times of the collapse. Therefore the dominate occupation number is
when the particle (anti-particle) carries the same charge as the domain wall,
as expected due to the Coulomb potential carried by the domain walls. In the
extremal case we demonstrate that as time increases the temperature of the
radiation decreases until when the domain wall reaches the horizon and the
temperature then goes to zero. This is in agreement with the Hawking
temperature for charged black holes.
