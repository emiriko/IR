Both the Kelvin wave and the Kolmogorov turbulence interpretations presented
in the PRL, [v. 103, 084501 (2009) by J. Yepez, G. Vahala, L.Vahala and M. Soe,
arXiv:0905.0159] are misleading, and much more theoretical analysis needs to be
done for the interpretation of the important numerical results obtained by the
authors. A way to do this is suggested.
