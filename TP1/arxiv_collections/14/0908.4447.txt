We report a Molecular Dynamics study of homogenous bubble nucleation in a
Lennard-Jones fluid. The rate of bubble nucleation is estimated using
forward-flux sampling (FFS). We find that cavitation starts with compact
bubbles rather than with ramified structures as had been suggested by Shen and
Debenedetti (J. Chem. Phys. 111:3581, 1999). Our estimate of the
bubble-nucleation rate is higher than predicted on the basis of Classical
Nucleation Theory (CNT). Our simulations show that local temperature
fluctuations correlate strongly with subsequent bubble formation - this
mechanism is not taken into account in CNT.
