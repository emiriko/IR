We propose a performance evaluation method for security protocols. Based on
the informal specification, we construct a canonical model which includes,
alongside protocol messages, cryptographic operations performed by participants
in the process of message construction. Each cryptographic operation is
assigned a cost modeled as a function of the size of processed message
components. We model not only the size of regular message components but also
the size of ciphertext produced by various cryptographic operations. We
illustrate the applicability of our method by comparatively analyzing the
performance of the original CCITT X.509 protocol and a slightly modified
version of the same protocol.
