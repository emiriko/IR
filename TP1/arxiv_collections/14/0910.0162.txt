A broadband technique for robust adiabatic rotation and conversion of light
polarization is proposed. It uses the analogy between the equation describing
the polarization state of light propagating through an optically anisotropic
medium and the Schrodinger equation describing coherent laser excitation of a
three-state atom. The proposed techniques is analogous to the stimulated Raman
adiabatic passage (STIRAP) technique in quantum optics; it is applicable to a
wide range of frequencies and it is robust to variations in the ropagation
length.
