Parton luminosities are convenient for estimating how the physics potential
of Large Hadron Collider experiments depends on the energy of the proton beams.
I present parton luminosities, ratios of parton luminosities, and contours of
fixed parton luminosity for $gg$, $u\bar{d}$, and $qq$ interactions over the
energy range relevant to the Large Hadron Collider, along with example analyses
for specific processes.
