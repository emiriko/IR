In this lecture we review high-pressure phase transition sequences exhibited
by simple elements, looking at the examples of the main group I, II, IV, V, and
VI elements. General trends are established by analyzing the changes in
coordination number on compression. Experimentally found phase transitions and
crystal structures are discussed with a brief description of the present
theoretical picture.
