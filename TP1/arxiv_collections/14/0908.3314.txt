Topological insulators represent novel phases of quantum matter with an
insulating bulk gap and gapless edges or surface states. The two-dimensional
topological insulator phase was predicted in HgTe quantum wells and confirmed
by transport measurements. Recently, Bi2Se3 and related materials have been
proposed as three-dimensional topological insulators with a single Dirac cone
on the surface and verified by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
experiments. Here, we show unambiguous transport evidence of topological
surface states through periodic quantum interference effects in layered
single-crystalline Bi2Se3 nanoribbons. Pronounced Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in
the magnetoresistance clearly demonstrate the coverage of two-dimensional
electrons on the entire surface, as expected from the topological nature of the
surface states. The dominance of the primary h/e oscillation and its
temperature dependence demonstrate the robustness of these electronic states.
Our results suggest that topological insulator nanoribbons afford novel
promising materials for future spintronic devices at room temperature.
