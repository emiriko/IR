We consider the proton and neutron quasiparticle orbits around the
closed-shell 56Ni and 48Ca isotopes. It is found that large model spaces
(beyond the capability of shell-model applications) are necessary for
predicting the quenchings of spectroscopic factors.
  The particle-vibration coupling is identified as the principal mechanism.
Additional correlations--due to configuration with several particle-hole
excitations--are estimated using shell-model calculations and generate an extra
reduction which is < ~4% for most quasiparticle states. The theoretical
calculations nicely agree with (e,e'p) and heavy ion knock-out experiments.
These results open a new path for a microscopic understanding of the
shell-model.
