We propose a deterministic weighted scale-free small-world model for
considering pseudofractal web with the coevolution of topology and weight. In
the model, we have the degree distribution exponent $\gamma$ restricted to a
range between 2 and 3, simultaneously tunable with two parameters. At the same
time, we provide a relatively complete view of topological structure and weight
dynamics characteristics of the networks: weight and strength distribution;
degree correlations; average clustering coefficient and degree-cluster
correlations; as well as the diameter. We show that our model is particularly
effective at mimicing weighted scale-free small-world networks with a high and
relatively stable clustering coefficient, which rapidly decline with the
network size in most previous models.
