We have used the Odin satellite to obtain strip maps of the ground-state
rotational transitions of ortho-water and ortho-ammonia, as well as CO(5-4) and
13CO(5-4) across the PDR, and H218O in the central position. A physi-chemical
inhomogeneous PDR model was used to compute the temperature and abundance
distributions for water, ammonia and CO. A multi-zone escape probability method
then calculated the level populations and intensity distributions. These
results are compared to a homogeneous model computed with an enhanced version
of the RADEX code. H2O, NH3 and 13CO show emission from an extended PDR with a
narrow line width of ~3 kms. Like CO, the water line profile is dominated by
outflow emission, however, mainly in the red wing. The PDR model suggests that
the water emission mainly arises from the surfaces of optically thick, high
density clumps with n(H2)>10^6 cm^-3 and a clump water abundance, with respect
to H2, of 5x10^-8. The mean water abundance in the PDR is 5x10^-9, and between
~2x10^-8 -- 2x10^-7 in the outflow derived from a simple two-level
approximation. Ammonia is also observed in the extended clumpy PDR, likely from
the same high density and warm clumps as water. The average ammonia abundance
is about the same as for water: 4x10^-9 and 8x10^-9 given by the PDR model and
RADEX, respectively. The similarity of water and ammonia PDR emission is also
seen in the almost identical line profiles observed close to the bright rim.
Around the central position, ammonia also shows some outflow emission although
weaker than water in the red wing. Predictions of the H2O(110-101) and
(111-000) antenna temperatures across the PDR are estimated with our PDR model
for the forthcoming observations with the Herschel Space Observatory.
