We review the observational evidence for dust formation in Wolf-Rayet binary
systems and in Type II Supernova ejecta. Existing theoretical models describing
the condensation of solids in carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet stars and in Supernovae
close by and at high redshift are discussed. We describe new modeling of
carbon- and oxygen-based grain nucleation using a chemical kinetic approach
applied to the ejecta of massive pair-instability Supernovae in the early
universe. Finally, dust formation processes in colliding wind regions of WC
binary systems are discussed.
