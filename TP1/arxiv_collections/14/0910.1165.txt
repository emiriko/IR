We review the F(R) supergravity recently proposed in Phys. Lett. B674 (2009)
59 and Class. Quantum Grav. 26 (2009) 135006. Our construction supersymmetrizes
popular f(R) theories of modified gravity in four spacetime dimensions. We use
curved superspace of N=1 Poincar'e supergravity in its minimal (2nd order)
formulation so that our F(R) supergravity action is manifestly invariant under
local N=1 supersymmetry. We prove that the F(R) supergravity is classically
equivalent to the standard N=1 Poincar'e supergravity (minimally) coupled to a
dynamical chiral superfield, via a Legendre-Weyl transform in superspace. A
K"ahler potential, a superpotential and a scalar potential of the chiral
superfield are governed by a single holomorphic function. We find the
conditions of vanishing cosmological constant without fine-tuning, which define
a no-scale F(R) supergravity.
