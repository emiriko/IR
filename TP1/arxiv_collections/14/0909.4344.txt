The LHC physics era is about to commence; here we discuss a complementary
physics program that would be realized at a high luminosity flavor factory. A
flavor factory experiment can search for new physics in CP asymmetries,
inclusive decay processes, rare leptonic processes, absolute branching
fractions, and other measurements that are challenging or not feasible at the
LHC. Such measurements would provide good sensitivity to new physics phases,
the presence of a charged Higgs, and supersymmetric couplings. The charged
Higgs mass range probed is similar to that accessible at the LHC.
