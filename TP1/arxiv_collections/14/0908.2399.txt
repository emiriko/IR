We characterize epistemic consequences of truthful communication among
rational agents in a game-theoretic setting. To this end we introduce
normal-form games equipped with an interaction structure, which specifies which
groups of players can communicate their preferences with each other. We then
focus on a specific form of interaction, namely a distributed form of iterated
elimination of strictly dominated strategies (IESDS), driven by communication
among the agents. We study the outcome of IESDS after some (possibly all)
messages about players' preferences have been sent. The main result of the
paper provides an epistemic justification of this form of IESDS.
