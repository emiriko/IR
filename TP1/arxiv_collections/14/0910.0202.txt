The two-photon exclusive production of charged supersymmetric pairs at the
LHC has a clean and unique signature - two very forward scattered protons and
two opposite charged leptons produced centraly. For low-mass SUSY scenarios,
significant cross-sections are expected and background processes are well
controlled. Measurement of the forward proton energies would allow for mass
reconstruction of right-handed sleptons and the LSP with a few GeV resolution.
Methods to reduce backgrounds at high luminosity resulting from accidental
coincidences between events in the central and forward detectors are discussed.
