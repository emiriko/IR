We present a method for realizing efficiently Grover's search algorithm in an
array of coupled cavities doped with three-level atoms. We show that by
encoding information in the lowest two ground states of the dopants and through
the application of appropriately tuned global laser fields, the reflection
operator needed for the quantum search algorithm can be realized in a single
physical operation. Thus, the time steps in which Grover's search can be
implemented become equal to the mathematical steps ~ O(\sqrt{N}), where N is
the size of the register. We study the robustness of the implementation against
errors due to photon losses and fluctuations in the cavity frequencies and
atom-photon coupling constants.
