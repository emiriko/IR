A new kind of tripartite coherent-entangled state (CES) $\ket{\beta,\gamma,
x}_{\mu\nu\tau}$ is proposed, which exhibits the properties of both coherence
and entanglement. We investigate its completeness and orthogonality, and find
it can make up a representation of tripartite CES. A protocol for generating
the tripartite CES is proposed using asymmetric beam splitter. Applications of
the tripartite CES in quantum optics are also presented.
