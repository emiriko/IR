We introduce and address the problem of concurrent autonomic management of
different non-functional concerns in parallel applications build as a
hierarchical composition of behavioural skeletons. We first define the problems
arising when multiple concerns are dealt with by independent managers, then we
propose a methodology supporting coordinated management, and finally we discuss
how autonomic management of multiple concerns may be implemented in a typical
use case. The paper concludes with an outline of the challenges involved in
realizing the proposed methodology on distributed target architectures such as
clusters and grids. Being based on the behavioural skeleton concept proposed in
the CoreGRID GCM, it is anticipated that the methodology will be readily
integrated into the current reference implementation of GCM based on Java
ProActive and running on top of major grid middleware systems.
