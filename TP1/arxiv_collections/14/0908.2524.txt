We show for the first time that a planar metamaterial, an array of coupled
metal split-ring resonators with a unit cell lacking mirror symmetry, exhibits
asymmetric transmission of terahertz radiation (0.25-2.5 THz) propagating
through it in opposite directions. This intriguing effect, that is compatible
with Lorentz reciprocity and time-reversal, depends on a directional difference
in conversion efficiency of the incident circularly polarized wave into one of
opposite handedness, that is only possible in lossy low-symmetry planar chiral
metamaterials. We show that asymmetric transmission is linked to excitation of
enantiomerically sensitive plasmons, these are induced charge-field excitations
that depend on the mutual handedness of incident wave and metamaterial pattern.
Various bands of positive, negative and zero phase and group velocities have
been identified indicating the opportunity to develop polarization sensitive
negative index and slow light media based on such metamaterials.
