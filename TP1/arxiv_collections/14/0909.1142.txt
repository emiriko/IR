We address the problem of optimal Central Bank intervention in the exchange
rate market when interventions create feedback in the rate dynamics. In
particular, we extend the work done on optimal impulse control by Cadenillas
and Zapatero to incorporate temporary market reactions, of random duration and
level, to Bank interventions, and to establish results for more general rate
processes. We obtain new explicit optimal impulse control strategies that
account for these market reactions, and show that they cannot be obtained
simply by adjusting the intervention cost in a model without market reactions.
