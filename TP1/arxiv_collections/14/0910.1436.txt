Due to its unique long-term coverage and high photometric precision,
observations from the Kepler asteroseismic investigation will provide us with
the possibility to sound stellar cycles in a number of solar-type stars with
asteroseismology. By comparing these measurements with conventional
ground-based chromospheric activity measurements we might be able to increase
our understanding of the relation between the chromospheric changes and the
changes in the eigenmodes.
  In parallel with the Kepler observations we have therefore started a
programme at the Nordic Optical Telescope to observe and monitor chromospheric
activity in the stars that are most likely to be selected for observations for
the whole satellite mission. The ground-based observations presented here can
be used both to guide the selection of the special Kepler targets and as the
first step in a monitoring programme for stellar cycles. Also, the
chromospheric activity measurements obtained from the ground-based observations
can be compared with stellar parameters such as ages and rotation in order to
improve stellar evolution models.
