The most striking feature of quantum mechanics is the existence of
superposition states, where an object appears to be in different situations at
the same time. The existence of such states has been tested with small objects,
like atoms, ions, electrons and photons, and even with molecules. More
recently, it has been possible to create superpositions of collections of
photons, atoms, or Cooper pairs. Current progress in optomechanical systems may
soon allow us to create superpositions of even larger objects, like micro-sized
mirrors or cantilevers, and thus to test quantum mechanical phenomena at larger
scales. Here we propose a method to cool down and create quantum superpositions
of the motion of sub-wavelength, arbitrarily shaped dielectric objects trapped
inside a high--finesse cavity at a very low pressure. Our method is ideally
suited for the smallest living organisms, such as viruses, which survive under
low vacuum pressures, and optically behave as dielectric objects. This opens up
the possibility of testing the quantum nature of living organisms by creating
quantum superposition states in very much the same spirit as the original
Schr\"odinger's cat "gedanken" paradigm. We anticipate our essay to be a
starting point to experimentally address fundamental questions, such as the
role of life and consciousness in quantum mechanics.
