We present a first precision analysis of the transverse-momentum spectrum of
gaugino pairs produced at the LHC with center-of-mass energies of 10 or 14 TeV.
Our calculation is based on a universal resummation formalism at
next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, which is consistently matched to the
perturbative prediction at O(alpha_s). Numerical results are given for the
``gold-plated'' associated production of neutralinos and charginos for a
typical benchmark point in the constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model. We show that the matched resummation results differ considerably from
the Monte Carlo predictions employed traditionally in experimental analyses. We
also investigate in detail the theoretical uncertainties coming from scale and
parton-density function variations and non-perturbative effects.
