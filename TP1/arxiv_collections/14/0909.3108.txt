The Higgs sector of the Universal Extra Dimensions (UED) has a rather
involved setup. With one extra space dimension, the main ingredients to the
construct are the higher Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of the Standard Model
Higgs boson and the fifth components of the gauge fields which on
compactification appear as scalar degrees of freedom and can mix with the
former thus leading to physical KK-Higgs states of the scenario. In this work,
we explore in detail the phenomenology of such a Higgs sector of the UED with
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in focus. We work out relevant decay branching
fractions involving the KK-Higgs excitations. Possible production modes of the
KK-Higgs bosons are then discussed with an emphasis on their associated
production with the third generation KK-quarks and that under the cascade
decays of strongly interacting UED excitations which turn out to be the only
phenomenologically significant modes. It is pointed out that the collider
searches of such Higgs bosons face generic hardship due to soft end-products
which result from severe degeneracies in the masses of the involved excitations
in the minimal version of the UED (MUED). Generic implications of either
observing some or all of the KK-Higgs bosons at the LHC are discussed.
