In this paper we investigate the effect of a pinned superfluid component on
the gravitational wave emission of a steadily rotating deformed neutron star.
We show that the superfluid pinning allows the possibility for there to be
gravitational wave emission at both the stellar spin frequency $\Omega$ and its
first harmonic, $2\Omega$. This contrasts with the conventional case where
there is no pinned superfluidity, where either only the $2\Omega$ harmonic is
present, or else the star undergoes precession, a feature which is not believed
to be common in the known pulsar population. This work motivates the carrying
out of gravitational wave searches where both the $\Omega$ and $2\Omega$
harmonics are searched for, even in targeted searches for waves from known
pulsars which aren't observed to precess. Observation of such a two-component
signal would provide evidence in favour of pinned superfluidity inside the
star.
