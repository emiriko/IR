We employ a time-dependent synchrotron-self-Compton code for modeling
contemporaneous multiwavelength data of the blazar 1 ES 1218+30.4 The input
parameters of the model are used to infer physical parameters of the emitting
region. An acceptable fit to the data is obtained by taking into account a
stellar emission component in the optical regime due to the host galaxy. The
physical parameters inferred from the fit are in line with particle
acceleration due to the Fermi mechanism providing s = 2.1 spectra. From the
properties of the host galaxy in the optical, we estimate the central black
hole mass and thus confirm that the jet power injected into the emission region
is in the sub-Eddington regime, as expected for BL Lacertae objects.
