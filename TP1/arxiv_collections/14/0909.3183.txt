High-energy irradiation of the circumstellar material might impact the
structure and the composition of a protoplanetary disk and hence the process of
planet formation. In this paper, we present a study on the possible influence
of the stellar irradiation, indicated by X-ray emission, on the crystalline
structure of the circumstellar dust. The dust crystallinity is measured for 42
class II T Tauri stars in the Taurus star-forming region using a decomposition
fit of the 10 micron silicate feature, measured with the Spitzer IRS
instrument. Since the sample includes objects with disks of various
evolutionary stages, we further confine the target selection, using the age of
the objects as a selection parameter. We correlate the X-ray luminosity and the
X-ray hardness of the central object with the crystalline mass fraction of the
circumstellar dust and find a significant anti-correlation for 20 objects
within an age range of approx. 1 to 4.5 Myr. We postulate that X-rays represent
the stellar activity and consequently the energetic ions of the stellar winds
which interact with the circumstellar disk. We show that the fluxes around 1 AU
and ion energies of the present solar wind are sufficient to amorphize the
upper layer of dust grains very efficiently, leading to an observable reduction
of the crystalline mass fraction of the circumstellar, sub-micron sized dust.
This effect could also erase other relations between crystallinity and
disk/star parameters such as age or spectral type.
