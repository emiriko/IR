The rheology of dense amorphous materials under large shear strain is not
fully understood, partly due to the difficulty of directly viewing the
microscopic details of such materials. We use a colloidal suspension to
simulate amorphous materials, and study the shear-induced structural relaxation
with fast confocal microscopy. We quantify the plastic rearrangements of the
particles in several ways. Each of these measures of plasticity reveals
spatially heterogeneous dynamics, with localized regions where many particles
are strongly rearranging by these measures. We examine the shapes of these
regions and find them to be essentially isotropic, with no alignment in any
particular direction. Furthermore, individual particles are equally likely to
move in any direction, other than the overall bias imposed by the strain.
