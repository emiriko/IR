We present two universal models of quantum computation with a
time-independent, frustration-free Hamiltonian. The first construction uses
3-local (qubit) projectors, and the second one requires only 2-local
qubit-qutrit projectors. We build on Feynman's Hamiltonian computer idea and
use a railroad-switch type clock register. The resources required to simulate a
quantum circuit with L gates in this model are O(L) small-dimensional quantum
systems (qubits or qutrits), a time-independent Hamiltonian composed of O(L)
local, constant norm, projector terms, the possibility to prepare computational
basis product states, a running time O(L log^2 L), and the possibility to
measure a few qubits in the computational basis. Our models also give a
simplified proof of the universality of 3-local Adiabatic Quantum Computation.
