The Chiral Dilaton Model is a chiral lagrangian in which the breaking of
scale invariance is regulated by the expectation value of a scalar field,
called dilaton. Here we provide a Fortran code \cite{epaps,ind}, as a tool to
make calculations within the Chiral Dilaton Model at finite density and
temperature. The calculations are improved respect to previous works
[arXiv:0704.3707,arXiv:0805.4188] by including the thermal contributions of the
dilaton field.
