We investigate the time-dependent, coherent, and dissipative dynamics of
bound particles in single multilevel quantum dots in the presence of sequential
tunnelling transport. We focus on the nonequilibrium regime where several
channels are available for transport. Through a fully microscopic and
non-Markovian density matrix formalism we investigate transport-induced
decoherence and relaxation of the system. We validate our methodology by also
investigating the Markov limit on our model. We confirm that not only does this
limit neglect the coherent oscillations between system states as expected, but
also the rate at which the steady state is reached under this limit
significantly differs from the non-Markovian results. By a systematic analysis
of the decay constants and frequencies of coherent oscillations for the
off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix under various realistic
tunneling rate anisotropies and energy configurations, we outline a criteria
for extended decoherence times.
