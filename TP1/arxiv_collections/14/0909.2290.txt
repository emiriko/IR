Several anonymization techniques, such as generalization and bucketization,
have been designed for privacy preserving microdata publishing. Recent work has
shown that generalization loses considerable amount of information, especially
for high-dimensional data. Bucketization, on the other hand, does not prevent
membership disclosure and does not apply for data that do not have a clear
separation between quasi-identifying attributes and sensitive attributes.
  In this paper, we present a novel technique called slicing, which partitions
the data both horizontally and vertically. We show that slicing preserves
better data utility than generalization and can be used for membership
disclosure protection. Another important advantage of slicing is that it can
handle high-dimensional data. We show how slicing can be used for attribute
disclosure protection and develop an efficient algorithm for computing the
sliced data that obey the l-diversity requirement. Our workload experiments
confirm that slicing preserves better utility than generalization and is more
effective than bucketization in workloads involving the sensitive attribute.
Our experiments also demonstrate that slicing can be used to prevent membership
disclosure.
