In this paper we propose a deterministic algorithm for approximately counting
the $k$-colourings of sparse random graphs $G(n,d/n)$. In particular, our
algorithm computes in polynomial time a $(1\pm n^{-\Omega(1)})$approximation of
the logarithm of the number of $k$-colourings of $G(n,d/n)$ for $k\geq
(2+\epsilon) d$ with high probability over the graph instances.
  Our algorithm is related to the algorithms of A. Bandyopadhyay et al. in SODA
'06, and A. Montanari et al. in SODA '06, i.e. it uses {\em spatial correlation
decay} to compute {\em deterministically} marginals of {\em Gibbs
distribution}. We develop a scheme whose accuracy depends on {\em
non-reconstruction} of the colourings of $G(n,d/n)$, rather than {\em
uniqueness} that are required in previous works. This leaves open the
possibility for our schema to be sufficiently accurate even for $k<d$.
  The set up for establishing correlation decay is as follows: Given
$G(n,d/n)$, we alter the graph structure in some specific region $\Lambda$ of
the graph by deleting edges between vertices of $\Lambda$. Then we show that
the effect of this change on the marginals of Gibbs distribution, diminishes as
we move away from $\Lambda$. Our approach is novel and suggests a new context
for the study of deterministic counting algorithms.
