In the present work we propose that a one-dimensional quantum heterostructure
composed of magnetic and non-magnetic atomic sites can be utilized as a spin
filter for a wide range of applied bias voltage. A simple tight-binding
framework is given to describe the conducting junction where the
heterostructure is coupled to two semi-infinite one-dimensional non-magnetic
electrodes. Based on transfer matrix method all the calculations are performed
numerically which describe two-terminal spin dependent transmission probability
along with junction current through the wire. Our detailed analysis may provide
fundamental aspects of selective spin transport phenomena in one-dimensional
heterostructures at nano-scale level.
