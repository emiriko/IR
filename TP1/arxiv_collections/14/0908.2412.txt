The electric dipole moment of the electron (eEDM) is a signature of
CP-violating physics beyond the Standard Model. We describe an ongoing
experiment to measure or set improved limits to the eEDM, using a cold beam of
thorium monoxide (ThO) molecules. The metastable $H {}^3\Delta_1$ state in ThO
has important advantages for such an experiment. We argue that the statistical
uncertainty of an eEDM measurement could be improved by as much as 3 orders of
magnitude compared to the current experimental limit, in a first-generation
apparatus using a cold ThO beam. We describe our measurements of the $H$ state
lifetime and the production of ThO molecules in a beam, which provide crucial
data for the eEDM sensitivity estimate. ThO also has ideal properties for the
rejection of a number of known systematic errors; these properties and their
implications are described.
