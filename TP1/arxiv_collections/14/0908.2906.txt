The doping of Mn in Si is attracting research attentions due to the
possibility to fabricate Si-based diluted magnetic semiconductors. However, the
low solubility of Mn in Si favors the precipitation of Mn ions even at
non-equilibrium growth conditions. MnSi$_{1.7}$ nanoparticles are the common
precipitates, which show exotic magnetic properties in comparison with the
MnSi$_{1.7}$ bulk phase. In this paper we present the static and dynamic
magnetic properties of MnSi$_{1.7}$ nanoparticles. Using the Preisach model, we
derive the magnetic parameters, such as the magnetization of individual
particles, the distribution of coercive fields and the inter-particle
interaction field. Time-dependent magnetization measurements reveal a
spin-glass behavior of the system.
