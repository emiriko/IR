We investigate the transport properties of three-terminal graphene devices,
where one terminal is superconducting and two are normal metals. The terminals
are connected by nanoribbons. Electron transfer (ET) and crossed Andreev
reflection (CAR) are identified via the non-local signal between the two normal
terminals. Analytical expressions for ET and CAR in symmetric devices are
found. We compute ET and CAR numerically for asymmetric devices. ET dominates
CAR in symmetric devices, but CAR can dominate ET in asymmetric devices, where
only the zero-energy modes of the zigzag nanoribbons contribute to the
transport.
