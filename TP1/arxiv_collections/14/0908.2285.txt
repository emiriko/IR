We use the ellipsoidal collapse approximation to investigate the nonlinear
redshift space evolution of the density field with primordial non-Gaussianity
of the local f_{nl}-type. We utilize the joint distribution of eigenvalues of
the initial non-Gaussian shear field and evaluate the evolved redshift space
probability distribution function (PDF). It is shown that, similar to the real
space analysis, the underdense tail of the nonlinear redshift space PDF differs
significantly from that for Gaussian initial conditions. We also derive the
lowest order correction of the Kaiser's formulain the presence of a non-zero
f_{nl}.
