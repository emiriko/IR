The constrained electron density method of embedding a Kohn-Sham system in a
substrate system (first described by P. Cortona, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 44}, 8454
(1991) and T.A. Wesolowski and A. Warshel, J. Phys. Chem {\bf 97}, 8050 (1993))
is applied with a plane-wave basis and both local and non-local
pseudopotentials. This method divides the electron density of the system into
substrate and embedded electron densities, the sum of which is the electron
density of the system of interest. Coupling between the substrate and embedded
systems is achieved via approximate kinetic energy functionals. Bulk aluminium
is examined as a test case for which there is a strong interaction between the
substrate and embedded systems. A number of approximations to the
kinetic-energy functional, both semi-local and non-local, are investigated. It
is found that Kohn-Sham results can be well reproduced using a non-local
kinetic energy functional, with the total energy accurate to better than 0.1 eV
per atom and good agreement between the electron densities.
