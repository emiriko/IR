Amplitude representations of a binary phase field crystal model are developed
for a two dimensional triangular lattice and three dimensional BCC and FCC
crystal structures. The relationship between these amplitude equations and the
standard phase field models for binary alloy solidification with elasticity are
derived, providing an explicit connection between phase field crystal and phase
field models. Sample simulations of solute migration at grain boundaries,
eutectic solidification and quantum dot formation on nano-membranes are also
presented.
