We argue that the Standard Model contains stable bound states with a
sufficiently large number N of heavy quanta -top quarks and gauge bosons W,Z-
of the form of collective "bags", with a strongly depleted value of the Higgs
VEV inside. More specifically, we study one-loop quantum corrections to a
generic model of them, assuming "quanta" are described by a complex scalar
field. We follow the practical formalism developed by Farhi et al. for the N=1
case, i.e. one particle in a bag, who found that for a very large Yukawa
coupling the classical bags are destabilized by quantum effects. We instead
study the problem with a coupling constant in the range of the Standard Model
for a large number of quanta N=50..5000. We calculated both classical and
one-loop effects and found that for such bags quantum corrections are small, of
the order of a few percents or less.
