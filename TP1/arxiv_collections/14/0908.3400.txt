We derive the nonlinear equations satisfied by the coefficients of linear
combinations that maximize their skewness when their variance is constrained to
take a specific value. In order to numerically solve these nonlinear equations
we develop a gradient-type flow that preserves the constraint. In combination
with the Karhunen-Lo\`eve decomposition this leads to a set of orthogonal modes
with maximal skewness. For illustration purposes we apply these techniques to
atmospheric data; in this case the maximal-skewness modes correspond to
strongly localized atmospheric flows. We show how these ideas can be extended,
for example to maximal-flatness modes.
