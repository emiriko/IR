A new method for the construction of classical integrable systems, that we
call loop coproduct formulation, is presented. We show that the linear r-matrix
formulation, the Sklyanin algebras and the reflection algebras can be obtained
as particular subcases of this framework. We comment on the possible
generalizations of the r-matrix formalism introduced through this approach.
