We report the exchange bias (EB) effect along with tunneling
magnetoresistance (MR) in polycrystalline La_{0.88}Sr_{0.12}CoO_3. Analogous to
the shift in the magnetic hysteresis loop along the field (H)-axis a shift is
clearly observed in the MR-H curve when the sample is cooled in a static
magnetic field. Training effect (TE) is a significant manifestation of EB
effect which describes the decrease of EB effect when sample is successively
field-cycled at a particular temperature. We observe TE in the shift of the
MR-H curve which could be interpreted by the spin configurational relaxation
model. A strong field-cooled (FC) effect in the temperature as well as time
dependence of resistivity is observed below spin freezing temperature. The
unusual MR results measured in FC mode are interpreted in terms of
intragranular interface effect between short range ferromagnetic clusters and
spin-glass matrix giving rise to the EB effect. EB effect in MR has been
observed in bilayer or multilayer films which has not yet seen in a
polycrystalline compound. EB effect involved with tunneling MR and
semiconducting transport property attributed to the intragranular intrinsic
nanostructure is promising for the spintronic applications.
