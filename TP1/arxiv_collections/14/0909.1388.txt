This paper studies the relationships between the traditional Diffie-Hellman
key agreement protocol and the identity-based (ID-based) key agreement protocol
from pairings.
  For the Sakai-Ohgishi-Kasahara (SOK) ID-based key construction, we show that
identical to the Diffie-Hellman protocol, the SOK key agreement protocol also
has three variants, namely \emph{ephemeral}, \emph{semi-static} and
\emph{static} versions. Upon this, we build solid relations between
authenticated Diffie-Hellman (Auth-DH) protocols and ID-based authenticated key
agreement (IB-AK) protocols, whereby we present two \emph{substitution rules}
for this two types of protocols. The rules enable a conversion between the two
types of protocols. In particular, we obtain the \emph{real} ID-based version
of the well-known MQV (and HMQV) protocol.
  Similarly, for the Sakai-Kasahara (SK) key construction, we show that the key
transport protocol underlining the SK ID-based encryption scheme (which we call
the "SK protocol") has its non-ID counterpart, namely the Hughes protocol.
Based on this observation, we establish relations between corresponding
ID-based and non-ID-based protocols. In particular, we propose a highly
enhanced version of the McCullagh-Barreto protocol.
