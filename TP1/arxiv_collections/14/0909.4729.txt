We report specific heat and neutron scattering experiments performed on the
system Ce$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$Ru$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ on the magnetic side of its quantum
critical phase diagram. The Kondo temperature does not vanish at the quantum
phase transition and elastic scattering indicates a gradual localisation of the
magnetism when $x$ increases in the ordered phase.
