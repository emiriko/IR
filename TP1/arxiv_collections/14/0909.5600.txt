We integrate the MHD ideal equations to simulate dark void sunwardly moving
structures in post--flare supra--arcades. We study the onset and evolution of
the internal plasma instability to compare with observations and to gain
insight into physical processes and characteristic parameters of these
phenomena. The numerical approach uses a finite-volume Harten-Yee TVD scheme to
integrate the 1D1/2 MHD equations specially designed to capture supersonic flow
discontinuities. The integration is performed in both directions, the sunward
radial one and the transverse to the magnetic field. For the first time, we
numerically reproduce observational dark voids described in Verwichte et al.
(2005). We show that the dark tracks are plasma vacuums generated by the
bouncing and interfering of shocks and expansion waves, upstream an initial
slow magnetoacoustic shock produced by a localized deposition of energy modeled
with a pressure perturbation. The same pressure perturbation produces a
transverse to the field or perpendicular magnetic shock giving rise to
nonlinear waves that compose the kink--like plasma void structures, with the
same functional sunward decreasing phase speed and constancy with height of the
period, as those determined by the observations.
