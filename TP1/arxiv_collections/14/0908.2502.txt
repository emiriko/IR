For supersymmetric theories with gravitino dark matter, the maximal reheating
temperature consistent with big bang nucleosynthesis bounds arises when the
physical gaugino masses are degenerate. We consider the cases of a stau or
sneutrino next-to-lightest superpartner, which have relatively less constraint
from big bang nucleosynthesis. The resulting parameter space is consistent with
leptogenesis requirements, and can be reached in generalized gauge mediation
models. Such models illustrate a class of theories that overcome the well-known
tension between big bang nucleosynthesis and leptogenesis.
