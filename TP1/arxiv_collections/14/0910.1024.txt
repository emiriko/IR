A proof that continuous time quantum walks are universal for quantum
computation, using unweighted graphs of low degree, has recently been presented
by Childs [PRL 102 180501 (2009)]. We present a version based instead on the
discrete time quantum walk. We show the discrete time quantum walk is able to
implement the same universal gate set and thus both discrete and continuous
time quantum walks are computational primitives. Additionally we give a set of
components on which the discrete time quantum walk provides perfect state
transfer.
