Among the various means of available resource protection including
biometrics, password based system is most simple, user friendly, cost effective
and commonly used. But this method having high sensitivity with attacks. Most
of the advanced methods for authentication based on password encrypt the
contents of password before storing or transmitting in physical domain. But all
conventional cryptographic based encryption methods are having its own
limitations, generally either in terms of complexity or in terms of efficiency.
Multi-application usability of password today forcing users to have a proper
memory aids. Which itself degrades the level of security. In this paper a
method to exploit the artificial neural network to develop the more secure
means of authentication, which is more efficient in providing the
authentication, at the same time simple in design, has given. Apart from
protection, a step toward perfect security has taken by adding the feature of
intruder detection along with the protection system. This is possible by
analysis of several logical parameters associated with the user activities. A
new method of designing the security system centrally based on neural network
with intrusion detection capability to handles the challenges available with
present solutions, for any kind of resource has presented.
