We present an atlas of Spitzer/IRS high resolution (R~600) 10-37um spectra
for 24 well known starburst galaxies. The spectra are dominated by
fine-structure lines, molecular hydrogen lines, and emission bands of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Six out of the eight objects with a known AGN
component show emission of the high excitation [NeV] line. This line is also
seen in one other object (NGC4194) with, a priori, no known AGN component. In
addition to strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission features in this
wavelength range (11.3, 12.7, 16.4um), the spectra reveal other weak
hydrocarbon features at 10.6, 13.5, 14.2um, and a previously unreported
emission feature at 10.75um. An unidentified absorption feature at 13.7um is
detected in many of the starbursts. We use the fine-structure lines to derive
the abundance of neon and sulfur for 14 objects where the HI 7-6 line is
detected. We further use the molecular hydrogen lines to sample the properties
of the warm molecular gas. Several basic diagrams characterizing the properties
of the sample are also shown. We have combined the spectra of all the pure
starburst objects to create a high S/N template, which is available to the
community.
