Superconducting devices based on the Josephson effect are effectively used
for the implementation of qubits and quantum gates. The manipulation of
superconducting qubits is generally performed by using microwave pulses with
frequencies from 5 to 15 GHz, obtaining a typical operating clock from 100MHz
to 1GHz. A manipulation based on simple pulses in the absence of microwaves is
also possible. In our system a magnetic flux pulse modifies the potential of a
double SQUID qubit from a symmetric double well to a single deep well
condition. By using this scheme with a Nb/AlOx/Nb system we obtained coherent
oscillations with sub-nanosecond period (tunable from 50ps to 200ps), very fast
with respect to other manipulating procedures, and with a coherence time up to
10ns, of the order of what obtained with similar devices and technologies but
using microwave manipulation. We introduce the ultrafast manipulation
presenting experimental results, new issues related to this approach (such as
the use of a feedback procedure for cancelling the effect of "slow"
fluctuations), and open perspectives, such as the possible use of RSFQ logic
for the qubit control.
