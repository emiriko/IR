We report on an extensive analysis of FCNC and CPV effects in SUSY theories.
We present results for Delta F=2 and Delta F=1 processes governed by b --> s
transitions both in the low and high tanbeta regime, focussing in particular on
S_psi_phi, the phase of Bs mixing. We emphasize that while the MFV framework is
not suited to explain potentially large effects in S_psi_phi as indicated by
recent data from CDF and D0, models with large right-right mass insertions in
the 32 sector provide natural frameworks to account for such effects.
Exemplarily we consider two SUSY models based on an abelian and a non-abelian
flavor symmetry that show representative flavor structures in the soft SUSY
breaking terms and stress that the characteristic correlations among the
considered observables allow to distinguish between the different models.
