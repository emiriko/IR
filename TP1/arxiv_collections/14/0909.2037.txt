We introduce the Modular Algorithm for Relativistic Treatment of heavy IoN
Interactions (MARTINI), a comprehensive event generator for the hard and
penetrating probes in high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. Its main
components are a time evolution model for the soft background, PYTHIA 8.1 and
the McGill-AMY parton evolution scheme including radiative as well as elastic
processes. This allows us to generate full event configurations in the high p_T
region that take into account thermal QCD and QED effects as well as effects of
the evolving medium. We present results for the neutral pion nuclear
modification factor in Au+Au collisions at RHIC as a function of p_T for
different centralities, and also as a function of the angle with respect to the
reaction plane for non-central collisions. Furthermore, we study the production
of high transverse momentum photons incorporating a complete set of
photon-production channels.
