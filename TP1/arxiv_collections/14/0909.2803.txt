Little is known about the properties of extremely massive HI-galaxies. They
are extremely scarce and are - according to hierarchical structure formation -
only forming now (z < 1). The forthcoming deep HI SKA Pathfinders surveys will
uncover many more of them. This will lead to a better understanding of their
evolution and frequency, and the shape of the bright end of the HI mass
function.
  The recently discovered galaxy HIZOA J0836-43 is one of the most HI-rich
galaxies (M(HI)=7.5 x 10^10Msun - and the nearest of its kind. As such it is an
ideal local probe of these elusive galaxies. Results from a detailed
investigation in the near- (IRSF) and far-infrared (Spitzer) of this local
HI-massive galaxy are presented. Unlike other giant HI galaxies, it is not of
low surface brightness. The galaxy is found to be a luminous starbursting
galaxy at an unexpected early stage of stellar mass building, more typical of
star-forming galaxies at higher redshift (z~0.7). With regard to its
environment, hence possible clues to its formation, the near infrared imaging
survey finds HIZOAJ0836-43 to lie in a region underdense in L* galaxies -
consistent with the observation that HI-massive galaxies are preferentially
found in low density regions - in the presence, however, of an uncommonly large
number of low stellar mass galaxies.
