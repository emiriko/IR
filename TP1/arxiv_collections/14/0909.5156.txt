A model, based on Gribov's Reggeon calculus, is proposed and applied to
processes of soft diffraction at high energies. It is shown that by accounting
for absorptive corrections for all legs of triple-Regge and loop diagrams a
good description of experimental data on inelastic soft diffraction can be
obtained. In this paper we give a brief description of the model and of its
predictions for LHC energies.
