Femtoscopy measures space-time characteristics of the particle emitting
source created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. It is argued that
collective behavior of matter (radial flow) produces specific femtoscopic
signatures. The one that is best known, the m_T dependence of the pion ``HBT
radii'', can be explained by the alternative scenario of temperature gradients
in an initial state thermal model. We identify others that can invalidate such
alternatives, such as non-identical particle correlations and m_T scaling for
particles of higher mass. Studies with a simple rescattering code show that as
the interaction cross-section is increased the system develops collective
behavior and becomes more thermalized at the same time, the two effects being
the natural consequence of increased number of particle rescatterings.
Repeating calculations with a more realistic rescattering model confirmed all
of these conclusions and provided deeper insight into the mechanisms of
collectivity buildup, showing a preference for a thermal model with uniform
temperature.
