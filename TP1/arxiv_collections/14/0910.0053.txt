We present recent results on elastic deuteron Compton scattering calculations
for polarised beans and targets up to next-to-leading order within Chiral
Effective Field Theory in the Small Scale Expansion variant to implement a
dynamical \Delta(1232) degree of freedom. A simple power-counting argument
discloses that np-intermediate rescattering states must be explicitly included
at leading order already. This automatically results in the correct Thomson
limit and guarantees current conservation. In view of ongoing effort at MAXlab,
proposals at HIGS and plans at MAMI, we address in detail single- and
double-polarised observables with linearly or circularly polarised photons on
both unpolarised and vector-polarised deuterons. Our results indicate that
several of the polarisation observables can be instrumental to extract not only
spin-independent nucleon polarisabilities, but also the so-far practically
un-determined spin-dependent polarisabilities which parameterise the stiffness
of the nucleon spin in external electro-magnetic fields. Amongst the questions
addressed are: convergence of the expansion for including the \Delta, the role
of the np-rescattering contributions, and sensitivity to the deuteron wave
function. An interactive Mathematica 7.0 notebook of these findings is
available from the authors.
