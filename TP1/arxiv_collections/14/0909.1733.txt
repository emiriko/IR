Using a new description of Keum Naie surfaces and their fundamental group, we
prove the following main result: Let S be a smooth complex projective surface
which is homotopically equivalent to a Keum - Naie surface. Then S is a Keum -
Naie surface. The connected component of the Gieseker moduli space
corresponding to Keum - Naie surfaces is irreducible, normal, unirational of
dimension 6.
