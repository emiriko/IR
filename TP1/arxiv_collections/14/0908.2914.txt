It is argued that while quantum mechanics contains nonlocal or entangled
states, the instantaneous or nonlocal influences sometimes thought to be
present due to violations of Bell inequalities in fact arise from mistaken
attempts to apply classical concepts and introduce probabilities in a manner
inconsistent with the Hilbert space structure of standard quantum mechanics.
Instead, Einstein locality is a valid quantum principle: objective properties
of individual quantum systems do not change when something is done to another
noninteracting system. There is no reason to suspect any conflict between
quantum theory and special relativity.
