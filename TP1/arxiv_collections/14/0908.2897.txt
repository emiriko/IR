We propose a new geometric method of IR factorization in sector
decomposition. The problem is converted into a set of problems in convex
geometry. The latter problems are solved using algorithms in combinatorial
geometry. This method provides a deterministic algorithm and never falls into
an infinite loop. The number of resulting sectors depends on the algorithm of
triangulation. Our test implementation shows smaller number of sectors
comparing with other existing methods with iterations.
