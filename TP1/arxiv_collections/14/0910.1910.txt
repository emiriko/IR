We address estimation of one-parameter qubit gates in the presence of phase
diffusion. We evaluate the ultimate quantum limits to precision, seek for
optimal probes and measurements, and demonstrate an optimal estimation scheme
for polarization qubits. An adaptive method to achieve optimal estimation in
any working regime is also analyzed in details and experimentally implemented.
