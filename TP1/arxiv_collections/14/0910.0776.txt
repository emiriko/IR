In the pure large-N Yang-Mills theory there is a quasi-BPS sector that is
exactly solvable at large N. It follows an exact beta function and the glueball
spectrum in this sector. The main technical tool is a new holomorphic loop
equation for quasi-BPS Wilson loops, that occurs as a non-supersymmetric
analogue of Dijkgraaf-Vafa holomorphic loop equation for the glueball
superpotential of n=1 SUSY gauge theories. The new holomorphic loop equation is
localized, i.e. reduced to a critical equation, by a deformation of the loop
that is a vanishing boundary in homology, somehow in analogy with Witten's
cohomological localization by a coboundary deformation in SUSY gauge theories.
