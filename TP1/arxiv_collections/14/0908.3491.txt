We prove an explicit upper bound on the amount of entanglement required by
any strategy in a two-player cooperative game with classical questions and
quantum answers. Specifically, we show that every strategy for a game with
n-bit questions and n-qubit answers can be implemented exactly by players who
share an entangled state of no more than 5n qubits--a bound which is optimal to
within a factor of 5/2. Previously, no upper bound at all was known on the
amount of entanglement required even to approximate such a strategy. It follows
that the problem of computing the value of these games is in NP, whereas
previously this problem was not known to be computable.
