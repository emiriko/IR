In this paper, we study the optical properties of single defects emitting in
the near infrared in nanodiamonds at liquid helium temperature. The
nanodiamonds are synthesized using a microwave chemical vapor deposition method
followed by nickel implantation and annealing. We show that single defects
exhibit several striking features at cryogenic temperature: the
photoluminescence is strongly concentrated into a sharp zero-phonon line in the
near infrared, the radiative lifetime is in the nanosecond range and the
emission is perfectly linearly polarized. The spectral stability of the defects
is then investigated. An optical resonance linewidth of 4 GHz is measured using
resonant excitation on the zero-phonon line. Although Fourier-transform limited
emission is not achieved, our results show that it might be possible to use
consecutive photons emitted in the near infrared by single defects in diamond
nanocrystals to perform two photon interference experiments, which are at the
heart of linear quantum computing protocols.
