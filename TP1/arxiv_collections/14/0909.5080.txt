Phase-change materials (PCMs) are the subject of considerable interest
because they have been recognized as potential active layers for
next-generation non-volatile memory devices, known as Phase Change Random
Access Memories (PRAMs). By analyzing First Principles Molecular Dynamics
simulations we develop a new method for the enumeration of mechanical
constraints in the amorphous phase and show that the phase diagram of the most
popular system (Ge-Sb-Te) can be split into two compositional regions having a
well-defined mechanical character: a Tellurium rich flexible phase, and a
stressed rigid phase that encompasses the known PCMs. This sound atomic scale
insight should open new avenues for the understanding of PCMs and other complex
amorphous materials from the viewpoint of rigidity.
