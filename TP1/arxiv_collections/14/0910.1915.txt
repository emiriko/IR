The single-degenerate channel is widely accepted as the progenitors of type
Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Following the work of Meng, Chen and Han (2009), we
reproduced the birth rate and age of supernovae like SN 2006X by the
single-degenerate model (WD + MS) with an optically thick wind, which may imply
that the progenitor of SN 2006X is a WD + MS system.
