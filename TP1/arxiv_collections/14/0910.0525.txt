A study on North South (NS) asymmetry of different solar activity features
(DSAF) such as solar proton events, solar active prominences, H alpha flare
index, soft X ray flares, monthly mean sunspot area and monthly mean sunspot
number were carried out from 1996 to 2008. It is found in our result that solar
cycle 23 is magnetically weak compared to solar cycle 22. Study shows the
Southern dominance of DSAF during the time period of study. During the rising
phase of the cycle the numbers of DSAF approximately equal on the North and
South Hemisphere. However, these activities tend to shift from Northern
Hemisphere to Southern Hemisphere in between year 1998 to 1999. The statistical
significance of the asymmetry time series using a chi square test of goodness
of fit indicates that in most of the cases the asymmetry is highly significant,
i.e., the asymmetry is a real feature in the NS distribution of DSAF.
