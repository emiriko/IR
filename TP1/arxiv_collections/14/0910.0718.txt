In this article, we derive a system of functional relations called the
generalized harmonic product relations for hyperlogarithms on the moduli space
${\mathcal M}_{0,5}$ and show that the relations contain the harmonic product
of multiple polylogarithms. The generalized harmonic product relations are
equivalent to the relations which come from two decompositions of the
fundamental solution normalized at the origin of the KZ equation on ${\mathcal
M}_{0,5}$.
