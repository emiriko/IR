We simulate the quantum adiabatic algorithm (QAA) for the exact cover problem
for sizes up to N=256 using quantum Monte Carlo simulations incorporating
parallel tempering. At large N we find that some instances have a discontinuous
(first order) quantum phase transition during the evolution of the QAA. This
fraction increases with increasing N and may tend to 1 for N -> infinity.
