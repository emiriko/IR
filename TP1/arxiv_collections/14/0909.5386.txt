Squeezed states of light constitute an important nonclassical resource in the
field of high-precision measurements, e.g. gravitational wave detection, as
well as in the field of quantum information, e.g. for teleportation, quantum
cryptography, and distribution of entanglement in quantum computation networks.
Strong squeezing in combination with high purity, high bandwidth and high
spatial mode quality is desirable in order to achieve significantly improved
performances contrasting any classical protocols. Here we report on the
observation of the strongest squeezing to date of 11.5 dB, together with
unprecedented high state purity corresponding to a vacuum contribution of less
than 5%, and a squeezing bandwidth of about 170 MHz. The analysis of our
squeezed states reveals a significant production of higher-order pairs of
quantum-correlated photons, and the existence of strong photon number
oscillations.
