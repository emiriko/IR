Electron magnetic chiral dichroism (EMCD) is an emerging tool for
quantitative measurements of magnetic properties using the transmission
electron microscope (TEM), with the possibility of nanometer resolution. The
geometrical conditions, data treatment and electron gun settings are found to
influence the EMCD signal. In this article, particular care is taken to obtain
a reliable quantitative measurement of the ratio of orbital to spin magnetic
moment using energy filtered diffraction patterns. For this purpose, we
describe a method for data treatment, normalization and selection of mirror
axis. The experimental results are supported by theoretical simulations based
on dynamical diffraction and density functional theory. Special settings of the
electron gun, so called telefocus mode, enable a higher intensity of the
electron beam, as well as a reduction of the influence from artifacts on the
signal. Using these settings, we demonstrate the principle of acquiring real
space maps of the EMCD signal. This enables advanced characterization of
magnetic materials with superior spatial resolution.
