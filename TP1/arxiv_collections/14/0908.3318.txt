We calculate the full $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2\alpha)$ corrections to the
process of gluino pair production at hadron colliders in the framework of the
real MSSM. We show that these contributions can be neglected at the LHC
performing a scan over a wide region of the parameter space. The impact of
these corrections in the parameter range investigated at the Tevatron is small.
