We theoretically study macroscopic entanglement between a magnetically
trapped Bose-Einstein condensate and a superconducting loop. We treat the
superconducting loop in a quantum superposition of two different flux states
coupling with the magnetic trap to generate macroscopic entanglement. The
scheme also provides a platform to investigate interferometry with an entangled
Bose Einstein condensate and to explore physics at the quantum-classical
interface.
