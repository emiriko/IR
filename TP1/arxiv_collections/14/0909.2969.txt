We survey some of the recent promising developments in the search for the
theory behind neutrino mass and tri-bimaximal mixing, and indeed all fermion
masses and mixing. We focus in particular on models with discrete family
symmetry and unification, and show how such models can also solve the SUSY
flavour and CP problems. We also discuss the theoretical implications of the
measurement of a non-zero reactor angle, as hinted at by recent experimental
measurements.
