We show that, by using amplitude-based resummation techniques for Feynman's
formulation of Einstein's theory, we get quantum field theoretic 'first
principles' predictions for the UV fixed-point values of the dimensionless
gravitational and cosmological constants. Connections to the phenomenological
asymptotic safety analysis of Planck scale cosmology by Bonanno and Reuter are
discussed.
