Recently, new theoretical ideas have allowed the construction of lattice
actions which are explicitly invariant under one or more supersymmetries. These
theories are local and free of doublers and in the case of Yang-Mills theories
also possess exact gauge invariance. In this talk these ideas are reviewed with
particular emphasis being placed on ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory.
