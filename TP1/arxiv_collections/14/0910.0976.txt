Long-term trends in the solar spectral irradiance are important to determine
the impact on Earth's climate. These long-term changes are thought to be caused
mainly by changes in the surface area covered by small-scale magnetic elements.
The direct measurement of the contrast to determine the impact of these
small-scale magnetic elements is, however, limited to a few wavelengths, and
is, even for space instruments, affected by scattered light and instrument
defocus. In this work we calculate emergent intensities from 3-D simulations of
solar magneto-convection and validate the outcome by comparing with
observations from Hinode/SOT. In this manner we aim to construct the contrast
at wavelengths ranging from the NUV to the FIR.
