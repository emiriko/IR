We present results of ab-initio calculations of the electronic band
structure, lattice dynamical properties, and elastic constants of LaOFeAs, the
parent compound of the recently discovered superconducting iron-oxypnictide
(LaO1-xFxFeAs). The total and partial electronic density of states (EDOS) of
the undoped LaOFeAs (in the insulating or metallic state) are extracted from
the electronic band structure. The phonon dispersion and the phonon density of
states (PDOS) are also studied. Possible implications of the band structure,
EDOS, and PDOS of LaOFeAs on the eventual appearance of high-Tc
superconductivity upon carrier doping are discussed. The values of various
independent elastic constants for both insulating and metallic states are
estimated and discussed.
