Quantum measurement will inevitably cause backaction on the measured system,
resulting in the well known dephasing and relaxation. In this report, in the
context of solid--state qubit measurement by a mesoscopic detector, we show
that an alternative backaction known as renormalization is important under some
circumstances. This effect is largely overlooked in the theory of quantum
measurement.
