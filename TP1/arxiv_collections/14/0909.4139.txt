We present an investigation of the coherent coupling of various transverse
field modes of an optical cavity to ion Coulomb crystals. The obtained
experimental results, which include the demonstration of identical collective
coupling rates for different transverse modes of a cavity field to ions in the
same large Coulomb crystal, are in excellent agreement with theoretical
predictions. The results furthermore suggest that Coulomb crystals in the
future may serve as near-ideal media for highfidelity multi-mode quantum
information processing and communication purposes, including the generation and
storage of single photon qubits encoded in different transverse modes.
