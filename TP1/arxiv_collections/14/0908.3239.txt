We investigate the dissociation of O2 on Pb(111) surface using
first-principles calculations. It is found that in a practical high-vacuum
environment, the adsorption of molecular O2 takes place on clean Pb surfaces
only at low temperatures such as 100 K, but the O2 easily desorbs at (elevated)
room temperatures. It is further found that the Pb adatoms enhance the
molecular adsorption and activate the adsorbed O2 to dissociate during
subsequent room-temperature annealing. Our theory explains the observation of a
two-step oxidation process on the Pb surfaces by the unique role of Pb adatoms.
