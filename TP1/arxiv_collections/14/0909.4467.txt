We present an advanced interpolation method for estimating smooth
spatiotemporal profiles for local highway traffic variables such as flow, speed
and density. The method is based on stationary detector data as typically
collected by traffic control centres, and may be augmented by floating car data
or other traffic information. The resulting profiles display transitions
between free and congested traffic in great detail, as well as fine structures
such as stop-and-go waves. We establish the accuracy and robustness of the
method and demonstrate three potential applications: 1. compensation for gaps
in data caused by detector failure; 2. separation of noise from dynamic traffic
information; and 3. the fusion of floating car data with stationary detector
data.
