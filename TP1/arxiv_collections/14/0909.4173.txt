Electron transport through a three-electrode triple-quantum-dot ring with the
source electrode of spin-dependent splitting of chemical potentials (spin bias)
is theoretically investigated. We find clear charge and spin currents in the
drain electrodes driven by the spin bias, despite the absence of charge bias
between the source and drain electrodes, and their directions and amplitudes
can be adjusted by altering the structure parameters or magnetic field. The
distinct characteristics of spin-bias driven persistent charge and spin
currents in the ring are also shown. When an appropriate charge bias is
applied, the single-spin electron motion can be achieved in this structure.
