Within a dynamical coupled-channels model which has already been fixed from
analyzing the data of the pi N -> pi N and gamma N -> pi N reactions, we
present the predicted double pion photoproduction cross sections up to the
second resonance region, W< 1.7 GeV. The roles played by the different
mechanisms within our model in determining both the single and double pion
photoproduction reactions are analyzed, focusing on the effects due to the
direct gamma N -> pi pi N mechanism, the interplay between the resonant and
non-resonant amplitudes, and the coupled-channels effects. The model parameters
which can be determined most effectively in the combined studies of both the
single and double pion photoproduction data are identified for future studies.
