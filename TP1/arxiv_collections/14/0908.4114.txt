We calculate the intensity of photon emission from a trion in a single
quantum dot, as a function of energy and gate voltage, using the impurity
Anderson model and variational wave functions. Assuming a flat density of
conduction states and constant hybridization energy, the results agree with the
main features observed in recent experiments: non-monotonic dependence of the
energy on gate voltage, non-Lorentzian line shapes, and a line width that
increases near the regions of instability of the single electron final state to
occupations zero or two.
