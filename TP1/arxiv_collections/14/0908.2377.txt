Multiple hard interactions of partons in the same p+p(\bar p) collision are a
useful concept in the description of these collisions at collider energies. In
particular, they play a crucial role for the understanding of the background
(the so-called underlying event) in the reconstruction of jets. In
nucleus-nucleus collisions multiple hard parton interactions and the
corresponding production of mini-jets are expected to contribute significantly
to the total particle multiplicity. In this article a brief overview of results
on particle production at high-pT in proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus at RHIC
will be given. Moreover, the observed centrality dependence of the charged
particle multiplicity in Au+Au collisions will be discussed in light of
multiple partonic interactions.
