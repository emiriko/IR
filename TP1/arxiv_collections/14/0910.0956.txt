We investigate the charge density wave (CDW) instability in single and double
layers, as well as in the bulk 2H-NbSe$_{2}$. We demonstrate that the density
functional theory correctly describes the metallic CDW state in the bulk
2H-NbSe$_{2}$. We predict that both mono- and bilayer NbSe$_{2}$ undergo a CDW
instability. However, while in the bulk the instability occurs at a momentum
$\mathbf{q}_{CDW}\approx{2/3}\mathbf{\Gamma M}$, in free-standing layers it
occurs at $\mathbf{q}_{CDW}\approx{1/2}\mathbf{\Gamma M}$. Furthermore, while
in the bulk the CDW leads to a metallic state, in a monolayer the ground state
becomes semimetallic, in agreement with recent experimental data. We elucidate
the key role that an enhancement of the electron-phonon matrix element at
$\mathbf{q}\approx\mathbf{q}_{CDW}$ plays in forming the CDW ground state.
