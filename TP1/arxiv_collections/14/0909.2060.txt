Noise performance is one of the most crucial aspects of any detector.
Superconducting Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) have an "excess"
frequency noise that shows up as a small time dependent jitter of the resonance
frequency characterized by the frequency noise power spectrum measured in units
of Hz^2/Hz. Recent studies have shown that this noise almost certainly
originates from a surface layer of two-level system (TLS) defects on the
metallization or substrate. Fluctuation of these TLSs introduces noise in the
resonator due to coupling of the TLS electric dipole moments to the resonator's
electric field. Motivated by a semi-empirical quantitative theory of this noise
mechanism, we have designed and tested new resonator geometries in which the
high-field "capacitive" portion of the CPW resonator is replaced by an
interdigitated capacitor (IDC) structure with 10 - 20 micron electrode spacing,
as compared to the 2 micron spacing used for our more conventional CPW
resonators. Measurements show that this new IDC design has dramatically lower
TLS noise, currently by about a factor of ~29 in terms of the frequency noise
power spectrum, corresponding to an improvement of about a factor of 29^(1/2)
in NEP. These new devices are replacing the CPW resonators in our next design
iteration in progress for MKIDCam. Opportunities and prospects for future
reduction of the TLS noise will be discussed.
