The problem of absolute motion in the context of the twin paradox is
discussed. It is shown that the various versions of the clock paradox feature
some aspects which Mach might have been appreciated. However, the ultimate
cause of the behavior of the clocks must be attributed to the autonomous status
of spacetime, thereby proving the relational program advocated by Mach as
impracticable.
