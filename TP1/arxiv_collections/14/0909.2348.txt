We present a detailed analysis of the neutrino-induced muon signals coming
from neutralino pair-annihilations inside the Sun and the Earth with particular
emphasis for light neutralinos. The theoretical model considered is an
effective MSSM without gaugino-mass unification, which allows neutralinos of
light masses (below 50 GeV). The muon events are divided in through-going and
stopping muons, using the geometry of the Super-Kamiokande detector. In the
evaluation of the signals, we take into account the relevant hadronic and
astrophysics uncertainties and include neutrino oscillation and propagation
properties in a consistent way. We derive the ranges of neutralino masses which
could be explored at neutrino telescopes with a low muon-energy threshold
(around 1 GeV) depending on the category of events and on the values of the
various astrophysics and particle-physics parameters. A final analysis is
focussed to the upward muon fluxes which could be generated by those neutralino
configurations which are able to explain the annual modulation data of the
DAMA/LIBRA experiment. We show how combining these data with measurements at
neutrino telescopes could help in pinning down the features of the DM particle
and in restraining the ranges of the many quantities (of astrophysics and
particle-physics origins) which enter in the evaluations and still suffer from
large uncertainties.
