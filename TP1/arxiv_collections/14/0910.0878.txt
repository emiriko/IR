We compare the accuracy of various methods for determining the transfer of
the diffuse Lyman continuum in HII regions, by comparing them with a
high-resolution discrete-ordinate integration. We use these results to suggest
how, in multidimensional dynamical simulations, the diffuse field may be
treated with acceptable accuracy without requiring detailed transport
solutions. The angular distribution of the diffuse field derived from the
numerical integration provides insight into the likely effects of the diffuse
field for various material distributions.
