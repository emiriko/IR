The axial charges of the nucleon and the well-established N* resonances are
studied within a consistent framework. For the first time the axial charges of
the N* resonances are produced for the relativistic constituent quark model.
The axial charge of the nucleon is predicted close to experiment, and the ones
of N*(1535) and N*(1650), the only cases where such a comparison is possible,
agree well with results from quantum chromodynamics on the lattice that have
recently become available. The relevance of the magnitudes of the N* axial
charges for the low-energy behavior of quantum chromodynamics is discussed.
