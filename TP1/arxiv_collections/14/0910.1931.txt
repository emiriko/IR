The production of chargino-neutralino pairs and their subsequent leptonic
decays is one of the most promising supersymmetry (SUSY) signatures at the
Tevatron $p\bar{p}$ collider. We present here the most recent results on the
search for the three-lepton and missing-transverse-energy SUSY signature using
data collected with the CDF II detector. The results are interpreted within the
minimal supergravity (mSugra) scenario.
