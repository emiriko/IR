Biometrics based personal identification is regarded as an effective method
for automatically recognizing, with a high confidence a person's identity. A
multimodal biometric systems consolidate the evidence presented by multiple
biometric sources and typically better recognition performance compare to
system based on a single biometric modality. This paper proposes an
authentication method for a multimodal biometric system identification using
two traits i.e. face and palmprint. The proposed system is designed for
application where the training data contains a face and palmprint. Integrating
the palmprint and face features increases robustness of the person
authentication. The final decision is made by fusion at matching score level
architecture in which features vectors are created independently for query
measures and are then compared to the enrolment template, which are stored
during database preparation. Multimodal biometric system is developed through
fusion of face and palmprint recognition.
