We establish a polynomial recursion formula for linear Hodge integrals. It is
obtained as the Laplace transform of the cut-and-join equation for the simple
Hurwitz numbers. We show that the recursion recovers the Witten-Kontsevich
theorem when restricted to the top degree terms, and also the combinatorial
factor of the lambda_g formula as the lowest degree terms.
