This paper shows that the Seifert volume of each closed non-trivial graph
manifold is virtually positive.
  As a consequence, for each closed orientable prime 3-manifold $N$, the set of
mapping degrees $\c{D}(M,N)$ is finite for any 3-manifold $M$, unless $N$ is
finitely covered by either a torus bundle, or a trivial circle bundle, or the
3-sphere.
