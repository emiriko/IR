In a recent numerical investigation of the Coulomb glass, Surer et al. [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 102, 067205 (2009)] concluded that their simulation results are
consistent with the Efros Shklovskii prediction for the density of states in
the three-dimensional case. Here, we show that this statement has no relevance
concerning the problem of the asymptotic behavior in the Coulomb gap since it
is based on unjustified assumptions. Moreover, for the random-displacement
Coulomb glass model, we demonstrate that a part of the density of states data
by Surer et al. erroneously exhibit a broad gap. This is related to the
staggered occupation being instable contrary to their findings.
