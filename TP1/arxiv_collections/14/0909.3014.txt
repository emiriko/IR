We investigate analytically gravitational lensing by charged, stationary,
axially symmetric Kerr-Sen dilaton-axion black hole in the weak deflection
limit. Approximate solutions to the lightlike equations of motion are present
up to and including third-order terms in $M/b$, $a/b$ and $r_{\alpha}/b$, where
$M$ is the black hole mass, $a$ is the angular momentum, $r_{\alpha}=Q^2/M$,
$Q$ being the charge and $b$ is the impact parameter of the light ray. We
compute the positions of the two weak field images, the corresponding signed
and absolute magnifications up to post-Newtonian order. It is shown that there
are static post-Newtonian corrections to the signed magnification and their sum
as well as to the critical curves, which are functions of the charge. The shift
of the critical curves as a function of the lens angular momentum is found, and
it is shown that they decrease slightly with the increase of the charge. The
point-like caustics drift away from the optical axis and do not depend on the
charge. All of the lensing quantities are compared to particular cases as
Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes as well as the
Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger black hole.
