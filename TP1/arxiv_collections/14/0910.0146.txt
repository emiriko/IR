We propose a new supersymmetric left right model with Higgs doublets carrying
odd B-L charge, higgs bidoublet and heavy Higgs triplets with zero B-L charge
and a set of sterile neutrinos which are singlet under the gauge group. We show
that spontaneous parity violation can be achieved naturally in this model and
the neutrino masses arise from the so called type III seesaw mechanism. We also
discuss the possible phenomenology in the context of neutrino masses and dark
matter.
