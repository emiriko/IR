Haken proved that every resolution refutation of the pigeonhole formula has
at least exponential size. Groote and Zantema proved that a particular OBDD
computation of the pigeonhole formula has an exponential size. Here we show
that any arbitrary OBDD refutation of the pigeonhole formula has an exponential
size, too: we prove that the size of one of the intermediate OBDDs is at least
$\Omega(1.025^n)$.
