Coupled human balancing tasks are investigated based on both pseudo-neural
controllers characterized by time-delayed feedback with random gain and natural
human balancing tasks. It is shown numerically that, compared to single
balancing tasks, balancing tasks coupled by mechanical structures exhibit
enhanced stability against balancing errors in terms of both amplitude and
velocity and also improve the tracking ability of the controllers. We then
perform an experiment in which numerical pseudo-neural controllers are replaced
with natural human balancing tasks carried out using computer mice. The results
reveal that the coupling structure generates asymmetric tracking abilities in
subjects whose tracking abilities are nearly symmetric in their single
balancing tasks.
