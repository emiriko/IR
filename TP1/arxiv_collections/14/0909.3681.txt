We study the consequences which the presence of an elementary electric charge
in mu^(+-) and pi^(+-) has for the rest mass of mu^(+-) and pi^(+-). The
addition of the electric charges e^(+-) to the massive neutral bodies of these
particles does not increase the energy in the rest mass of the muon and pion,
but rather decreases their energy by the binding energy of the electric charge
to the neutral bodies of the muon and pion. The addition of a charge to the
neutral neutrino lattices of the muon or pion changes the simple cubic lattices
of the neutral particles to face-centered cubic lattices of the charged
particles, which is essential for the stability of the particles.
