The direct observation and full characterization of a Phase Space Electron
Hole (EH) generated by laser-matter interaction is presented. This structure
has been detected via proton radiography during the interaction between an
intense laser pulse (t=1ns temporally flat-top, I= 10^14W/cm^2) and a gold 26
micron thick hohlraum. This technique has allowed us the simultaneous detection
of propagation velocity, potential and electron density spatial profile across
the EH with fine spatial and temporal resolution providing an unprecedentedly
detailed experimental characterization.
