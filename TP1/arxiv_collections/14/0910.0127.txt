Optical/near-infrared observations for 14 globular cluster (GC) systems in
early- type galaxies are presented. We investigate the recent claims (Yoon, Yi
& Lee 2006) of colour bimodality in GC systems being an artefact of the non
linear colour - metallicity transformation driven by the horizontal branch
morphology. Taking the advantage of the fact that the combination of optical
and near-infrared colours can in principle break the age/metallicity degeneracy
we also analyse age distributions in these systems.
