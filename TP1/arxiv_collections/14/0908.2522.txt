The strength of parity violation effect can be characterized by correlator
value in the framework of local $\mathcal{TIP}$ hypothesis. The energy and
centrality dependencies of correlators for same and opposite charges are
discussed for heavy ion collisions in RHIC energy domain 62.4 -- 200 GeV. The
magnetic field shows a significant increasing at initial energy decreasing for
intermediate and large times. Two possible scenarios for initial time are
investigated in detail. Both scenarios predict the most close values for
initial time in ${Au+Au}$ collisions at 62.4 GeV. Disagreement between initial
time values obtained for two various scenarios increases with energy increasing
and for collisions of lighter ${Cu}$-nucleus. Boundary values for correlators
related with possible local $\mathcal{TIP}$ violation are calculated in the
framework of analytic approach of chiral magnetic effect for ${Au+Au}$
collisions at 62.4 and 200 GeV. The results are shown as function of collision
centrality. Preliminary experimental STAR data are compared with predictions of
chiral magnetic effect model directly. Experimental signals consistent with
model expectations for both same and opposite charge correlations in ${Au+Au}$
collisions at 62.4 GeV at all centralities. At higher energy 200 GeV the model
of chiral magnetic effect underestimates same charge correlator values for
central and midcentral events but the same charge correlations for peripheral
events as well as opposite charge correlations are in the boundaries predicted
by model calculations.
