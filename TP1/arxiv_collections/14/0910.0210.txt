We re-evaluate the electromagnetic corrections to eta --> 3 pi decays at
next-to-leading order in the chiral expansion, arguing that effects of order
e^2(m_d-m_u) disregarded so far are not negligible compared to other
contributions of order e^2 times a light quark mass. Despite the appearance of
the Coulomb pole in eta --> pi+ pi- pi0 and cusps in eta --> 3 pi0, the overall
corrections remain small.
