A general model is proposed to explain the relation between the extrasolar
planets (or exoplanets) detected until June 2008 and the main characteristics
of their host stars through statistical techniques. The main goal is to
establish a mathematical relation among the set of variables which better
describe the physical characteristics of the host star and the planet itself.
The host star is characterized by its distance, age, effective temperature,
mass, metallicity, radius and magnitude. The exoplanet is described through its
physical parameters (radius and mass) and its orbital parameters (distance,
period, eccentricity, inclination and major semiaxis). As a first approach we
consider that only the mass of the exoplanet is being determined by the
physical properties of its host star. The proposed model is then validated
through statistical analysis. Finally we discuss the categorical behavior of
the dependent variable through binary models.
