The formation and evolution of low-mass stars within dense halos of dark
matter (DM) leads to evolution scenarios quite different from the classical
stellar evolution. As a result of our detailed numerical work, we describe
these new scenarios for a range of DM densities on the host halo, a range of
scattering cross sections of the DM particles considered, and for stellar
masses from 0.7 to 3 M_{\odot}. For the first time, we also computed the
evolution of young low-mass stars in their Hayashi track in the pre-main
sequence phase and found that, for high DM densities, these stars stop their
gravitational collapse before reaching the main sequence, in agreement with
similar studies on first stars. Such stars remain indefinitely in an
equilibrium state with lower effective temperatures (|\Delta T_eff| > 10^3 K
for a star of one solar mass), the annihilation of captured DM particles in
their core being the only source of energy. In the case of lower DM densities,
these proto-stars continue their collapse and progress through the main
sequence burning hydrogen at a lower rate. A star of 1 M_{\odot} will spend a
time greater than the current age of the universe consuming all the hydrogen in
its core if it evolves in a halo with DM density \rho_{\chi}=10^9 GeV cm^-3. We
also show the strong dependence of the effective temperature and luminosity of
these stars on the characteristics of the DM particles and how this can be used
as an alternative method for DM research.
