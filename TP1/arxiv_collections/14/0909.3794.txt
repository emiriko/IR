We present a unified scaling theory for the structural behavior of polymers
embedded in a disordered energy substrate. An optimal polymer configuration is
defined as the polymer configuration that minimizes the sum of interacting
energies between the monomers and the substrate. The fractal dimension of the
optimal polymer in the limit of strong disorder (SD) was found earlier to be
larger than the fractal dimension in weak disorder (WD). We introduce a scaling
theory for the crossover between the WD and SD limits. For polymers of various
sizes in the same disordered substrate we show that polymers with a small
number of monomers, N << N*, will behave as in SD, while large polymers with
length N >> N* will behave as in WD. This implies that small polymers will be
relatively more compact compared to large polymers even in the same substrate.
The crossover length N* is a function of \nu and a, where \nu is the
percolation correlation length exponent and a is the parameter which controls
the broadness of the disorder. Furthermore, our results show that the crossover
between the strong and weak disorder limits can be seen even within the same
polymer configuration. If one focuses on a segment of size n << N* within a
long polymer (N >> N*) that segment will have a higher fractal dimension
compared to a segment of size n >> N*.
