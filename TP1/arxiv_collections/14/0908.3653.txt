In this paper we examine how simple agents similar to Braitenberg vehicles
can exhibit chaotic movement patterns. The agents are wall following robots as
described by Steve Mesburger and Alfred Hubler in their paper "Chaos in Wall
Following Robots". These agents uses a simple forward facing distance sensor,
with a limited field of view "phi" for navigation. An agent drives forward at a
constant velocity and uses the sensor to turn right when it is too close to an
object and left when it is too far away.
  For a flat wall the agent stays a fixed distance from the wall and travels
along it, regardless of the sensor's capabilities. But, if the wall represents
a periodic function, the agent drives on a periodic path when the sensor has a
narrow field of view. The agent's trajectory transitions to chaos when the
sensor's field of view is increased. Numerical experiments were performed with
square, triangle, and sawtooth waves for the wall, to find this pattern. The
bifurcations of the agents were analyzed, finding both border collision and
period doubling bifurcations. Detailed experimental results will be reported
separately.
