A recent paper [I. Klebanov et al. \emph{Mod. Phys. Lett. B} \textbf{22}
(2008) 3153; arXiv:0712.0433] claims that the exact solution of the
Percus-Yevick (PY) integral equation for a system of hard spheres plus a step
potential is obtained. The aim of this paper is to show that Klebanov et al.'s
result is incompatible with the PY equation since it violates two known cases:
the low-density limit and the hard-sphere limit.
