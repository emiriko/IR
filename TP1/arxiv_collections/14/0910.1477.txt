We investigate field-driven domain wall (DW) propagation in magnetic
nanowires in the framework of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We propose
a new strategy to speed up the DW motion in a uniaxial magnetic nanowire by
using an optimal space-dependent field pulse synchronized with the DW
propagation. Depending on the damping parameter, the DW velocity can be
increased by about two orders of magnitude compared the standard case of a
static uniform field. Moreover, under the optimal field pulse, the change in
total magnetic energy in the nanowire is proportional to the DW velocity,
implying that rapid energy release is essential for fast DW propagation.
