This paper describes the relationship between trading network and WWW network
from preferential attachment mechanism perspective. This mechanism is known to
be the underlying principle in the network evolution and has been incorporated
to formulate two famous web pages ranking algorithms, PageRank and HITS. We
point out the differences between trading network and WWW network in this
mechanism, derive the formulation of HITS-based ranking algorithm for trading
network as a direct consequence of the differences, and apply the same
framework when deriving the formulation back to the HITS formulation that turns
to become a technique to accelerate its convergences.
