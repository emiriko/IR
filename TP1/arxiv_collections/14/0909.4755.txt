In this paper the thermodynamical parameters of a condensed Boson gas are
calculated from the partial derivative of the grand potential. In particular,
the analytical expressions for some important parameters, such as the condensed
fraction, specific heat, critical temperature, effective size, and release
energy are investigated. The mean effects which can be altered the ideal Bose
gas, such as finite size, highly anisotropic of the external potential and
interatomic interaction effects are considered simultaneously. Some new
characteristics of the trapped interacting Bose gases in a highly anisotropic
trap are revealed. The calculated result for the condensed fraction is compared
with the ongoing Stuttgart experiment for 52Cr (Griesmaier et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 94, 160401(2005)) directly. Good agreement between both the theoretical
and experimental data are obtained.
