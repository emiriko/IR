The Next-To-Minimal-Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (NMSSM)
has been in the focus of extensive studies in the past two decades. In
anticipation of the LHC era, the interest in automatized tools that can
calculate collider signatures has grown. We present the implementation of the
NMSSM into the event generator WHIZARD. In addition to a brief review of the
implementation, we discuss the testing and validation procedure.
Phenomenological studies will not be presented here.
