We consider the dynamics of moduli fields in brane gas cosmology. By
calculating the effective potentials from brane gas and bulk RR field, we found
an attractor behavior that can fix both the radion and the dilaton. The
potentials for radion and dilaton show global minima that can provide the
stabilizing forces so that they can be stabilized dynamically. The effective
potential for the three-dimensional volume is runaway-type so that it can
inflate.
