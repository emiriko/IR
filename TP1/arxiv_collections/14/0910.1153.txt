We have experimentally demonstrated thermal rectification as bulk effect.
According to a theoretical design of a thermal rectifier, we have prepared an
oxide thermal rectifier made of two cobalt oxides with different thermal
conductivities, and have made an experimental system to detect the thermal
rectification. The rectifying coefficient of the device is found to be 1.43,
which is in good agreement with the numerical calculation.
