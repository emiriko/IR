We provide a bound on the minimum error when discriminating among quantum
states, using the no-signaling principle. The bound is general in that it
depends on neither dimensions nor specific structures of given quantum states
to be discriminated among. We show that the bound is tight for the
minimum-error state discrimination between symmetric (both pure and mixed)
qubit states. Moreover, the bound can be applied to a set of quantum states for
which the minimum-error state discrimination is not known yet. Finally, our
results strengthen the quantitative connection between two no-go theorems, the
no-signaling principle and the no perfect state estimation.
