Point contact Andreev reflection spectra have been taken as a function of
temperature and magnetic field on the polycrystalline form of the newly
discovered iron-based superconductor Sr2ScFePO3. A zero bias conductance peak
which disappears at the superconducting transition temperature, dominates all
of the spectra. Data taken in high magnetic fields show that this feature
survives until 7T at 2K and a flattening of the feature is observed in some
contacts. Here we inspect whether these observations can be interpreted within
a d-wave, or nodal order parameter framework which would be consistent with the
recent theoretical model where the height of the P in the Fe-P-Fe plane is key
to the symmetry of the superconductivity. However, in polycrystalline samples
care must be taken when examining Andreev spectra to eliminate or take into
account artefacts associated with the possible effects of Josephson junctions
and random alignment of grains.
