We present arcsecond-resolution Submillimeter Array (SMA) polarimetric
observations of the 880 um continuum emission from the protoplanetary disks
around two nearby stars, HD 163296 and TW Hydrae. Although previous
observations and theoretical work have suggested that a 2-3% polarization
fraction should be common for the millimeter continuum emission from such
disks, we detect no polarized continuum emission above a 3-sigma upper limit of
7 mJy in each arcsecond-scale beam, or <1% in integrated continuum emission. We
compare the SMA upper limits with the predictions from the exploratory Cho &
Lazarian (2007) model of polarized emission from T Tauri disks threaded by
toroidal magnetic fields, and rule out their fiducial model at the ~10-sigma
level. We explore some potential causes for this discrepancy, focusing on model
parameters that describe the shape, magnetic field alignment, and size
distribution of grains in the disk. We also investigate related effects like
the magnetic field strength and geometry, scattering off of large grains, and
the efficiency of grain alignment, including recent advances in grain alignment
theory, which are not considered in the fiducial model. We discuss the impact
each parameter would have on the data and determine that the suppression of
polarized emission plausibly arises from rounding of large grains, reduced
efficiency of grain alignment with the magnetic field, and/or some degree of
magnetic field tangling (perhaps due to turbulence). A poloidal magnetic field
geometry could also reduce the polarization signal, particularly for a face-on
viewing geometry like the TW Hya disk. The data provided here offer the most
stringent limits to date on the polarized millimeter-wavelength emission from
disks around young stars.
