Renormalization group equations are derived for the case when both valley
splitting and intervalley scattering are present in a two-valley system. A
third scaling parameter is shown to be relevant when the two bands are split
but otherwise distinct. The existence of this parameter changes the
quantitative behavior at finite temperatures, but the qualitative conclusions
of the two-parameter theory are shown to be unaffected for realistic choice of
parameters.
