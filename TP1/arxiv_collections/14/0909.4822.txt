Spin-boson models are essentially useful in the understanding of quantum
optics, nuclear physics, quantum dissipation, and quantum computation. We
discuss quantum phase transitions in various spin-boson Hamiltonians, compare,
and contrast them. We summarize the theoretical concepts and results, open
questions and implementations of those ideas in cold atomic and QED cavity
systems are also addressed.
