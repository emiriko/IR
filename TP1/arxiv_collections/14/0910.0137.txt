This article provides the mathematical foundation for stochastically
continuous affine processes on the cone of positive semidefinite symmetric
matrices. This analysis has been motivated by a large and growing use of
matrix-valued affine processes in finance, including multi-asset option pricing
with stochastic volatility and correlation structures, and fixed-income models
with stochastically correlated risk factors and default intensities.
