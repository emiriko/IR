The precision physics program of the ILC requires precise knowledge of the
state of beam polarisation. In fact the Compton polarimeters intended for the
ILC will have to measure the polarisation with error a factor of 2 smaller than
the previous best measurement at the SLAC SLD experiment. In order to further
reduce measurement error, spin tracking simulations in the ILC Beam Delivery
System subject to ground motion induced misalignment have been performed and
the expected variation in polarisation has been quantified. A prototype of a
high precision spectrometer to record Compton scattered electrons from the
interaction of a longitudinal laser and the charged beams has been developed.
The Compton electrons interact with a gas in the polarimeter channels to
produce Cherenkov radiation measured by photodetectors. The calibration of the
photodetectors is crucial and exhaustive bench tests of the photodetector
linearity have been performed. The polarimeter prototype itself will be tested
at the ELSA testbeam in Bonn in Spring 2009.
