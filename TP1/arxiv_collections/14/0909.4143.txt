The gravity-scalar field system in spherical symmetry provides a natural
setting for exploring gravitational collapse and its aftermath in quantum
gravity. In a canonical approach, we give constructions of the constraint and
Hamiltonian operators. Matter-gravity entanglement is an inherent feature of
physical states, whether or not there is a black hole. Matter fields alone are
an open system with a non-unitary evolution. However, if there is a successful
theory of quantum gravity, there is no information loss.
