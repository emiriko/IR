The NuWro Neutrino Event Generator developed by the Wroclaw Neutrino Group
(WNG) is lightweight but full featured. It handles all interaction types
important in neutrino-nucleus scattering as well as DIS hadronization and
intranuclear cascade. Its input file, by default params.txt, is a plain text
file and the output file, by default eventsout.root, is a root file which can
be analyzed by means of the included myroot program, or by standard root, after
loading supplied dictionary library event1.so.
