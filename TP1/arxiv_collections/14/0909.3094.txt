The Inert Doublet Model is one of the simplest and most versatile scenarios
for physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we examine the prospects
for detecting the additional fields of this model at the LHC in the dilepton
channel. We investigate a wide variety of theoretically- and
phenomenologically-motivated benchmark scenarios, and show that within regions
of model parameter space in which the dark-matter candidate is relatively light
(between 40 and 80 GeV) and the mass splitting between the neutral scalars is
also roughly 40 - 80 GeV, a signal at the 3 sigma to 12 sigma significance
level can be observed with 100 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity. In addition,
even if the mass splitting between the neutral scalars is larger than M_Z, a
signal of more than 3 sigma can be observed as long as the mass of the dark
matter candidate is around 40 GeV.
