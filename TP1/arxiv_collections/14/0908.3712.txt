We present GALEX ultraviolet images from a survey of strongly interacting
galaxy pairs, and compare with images at other wavelengths. The tidal features
are particularly striking in the UV images. Numerous knots of star formation
are visible throughout the disks and the tails and bridges. We also identify a
possible `Taffy' galaxy in our sample, which may have been produced by a
head-on collision between two disk galaxies.
