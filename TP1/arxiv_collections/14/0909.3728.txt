We study electron transport through a semiconductor quantum ring with one
input and two output terminals for an elastic scatterer present within one of
the arms of the ring. We demonstrate that the scatterer not only introduces
asymmetry in the transport probability to the two output leads but also reduces
the visibility of the Aharonov-Bohm conductance oscillations. This reduction
occurs in spite of the phase coherence of the elastic scattering and is due to
interruption of the electron circulation around the ring by the potential
defect. The results are in a qualitative agreement with a recent experiment by
Strambini et al. [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 79}, 195443 (2009)]. We also indicate that
the magnetic symmetry of the sum of conductance of both the output leads as
obtained in the experiment can be understood as resulting from the invariance
of backscattering to the input lead with respect to the magnetic field
orientation.
