Exclusive measurements of the reaction pp -> dpi+pi0 have been carried out at
T_p = 1.1 GeV at the CELSIUS storage ring using the WASA detector. The
isovector pi+pi0 channel exhibits no enhancement at low invariant pipi masses,
i. e. no ABC effect. The differential distributions are in agreement with the
conventional t-channel Delta-Delta excitation process, which also accounts for
the observed energy dependence of the total cross section. This is an update of
a previously published version -- see important note at the end of the article.
