Strongly nonlinear transport through Diluted Magnetic Semiconductor
multiquantum wells occurs due to the interplay between confinement, Coulomb and
exchange interaction. Nonlinear effects include the appearance of spin
polarized stationary states and self-sustained current oscillations as possible
stable states of the nanostructure, depending on its configuration and control
parameters such as voltage bias and level splitting due to an external magnetic
field. Oscillatory regions grow in size with well number and level splitting. A
systematic analysis of the charge and spin response to voltage and magnetic
field switching of II-VI Diluted Magnetic Semiconductor multiquantum wells is
carried out. The description of stationary and time-periodic spin polarized
states, the transitions between them and the responses to voltage or magnetic
field switching have great importance due to the potential implementation of
spintronic devices based on these nanostructures.
