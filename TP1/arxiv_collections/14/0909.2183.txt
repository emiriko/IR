The development of pervasive computing has put the light on a challenging
problem: how to dynamically compose services in heterogeneous and highly
changing environments? We propose a survey that defines the service composition
as a sequence of four steps: the translation, the generation, the evaluation,
and finally the execution. With this powerful and simple model we describe the
major service composition middleware. Then, a classification of these service
composition middleware according to pervasive requirements - interoperability,
discoverability, adaptability, context awareness, QoS management, security,
spontaneous management, and autonomous management - is given. The
classification highlights what has been done and what remains to do to develop
the service composition in pervasive environments.
