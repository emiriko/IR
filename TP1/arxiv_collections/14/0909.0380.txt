The X(3872) with quantum numbers J(PC) = 1(++) is considered as a composite
state containing both molecular hadronic and a c bar(c) component. Based on
this structure assumption we first constrain model parameters in order to
reproduce the predictions for the radiative decay widths of X(3872) to J/psi
gamma and X(3872) to psi(2S) gamma as obtained in c bar(c) potential models.
Depending on these predictions we find that further inclusion of the molecular
component can in principle lead to an improved description of the radiative
X(3872) decays. We also show that strong decay modes of the X(3872) and in
particular the ratio of radiative (J/psi gamma) to strong (J/psi pi(+) pi(-))
decays hint towards a subleading role of the c bar(c) component in the X(3872).
