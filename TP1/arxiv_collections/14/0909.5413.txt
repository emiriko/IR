We have developed a parallel algorithm for radial basis function (RBF)
interpolation that exhibits O(N) complexity,requires O(N) storage, and scales
excellently up to a thousand processes. The algorithm uses a GMRES iterative
solver with a restricted additive Schwarz method (RASM) as a preconditioner and
a fast matrix-vector algorithm. Previous fast RBF methods, --,achieving at most
O(NlogN) complexity,--, were developed using multiquadric and polyharmonic
basis functions. In contrast, the present method uses Gaussians with a small
variance (a common choice in particle methods for fluid simulation, our main
target application). The fast decay of the Gaussian basis function allows rapid
convergence of the iterative solver even when the subdomains in the RASM are
very small. The present method was implemented in parallel using the PETSc
library (developer version). Numerical experiments demonstrate its capability
in problems of RBF interpolation with more than 50 million data points, timing
at 106 seconds (19 iterations for an error tolerance of 10^-15 on 1024
processors of a Blue Gene/L (700 MHz PowerPC processors). The parallel code is
freely available in the open-source model.
