It is argued that all notions associated with the origin of life should be
related with the participatory anthropic principle of Wheeler and must be
extended into the realm of the multiverse. Also discussed is the notion that
life can only be possible in a given universe during a finite period along
which such a universe expands in an accelerated fashion. We advance finally the
idea that life, cosmic accelerated expansion and quantum theory are nothing but
three distinct faces from a single, unique coin which describes the physical
reality.
