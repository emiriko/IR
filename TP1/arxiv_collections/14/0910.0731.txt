We present a systematic study of quasi-one-dimensional density of states
(DOS) in electron accumulation layers near a Si-SiO2 interface. In the
experiments we have employed two conceptually different objects to probe DOS,
namely, a phosphorus donor and a quantum dot, both operating in the
single-electron tunneling regime. We demonstrate how the peaks in DOS can be
moved in the transport window independently of the other device properties, and
in agreement with the theoretical analysis. This method introduces a fast and
convenient way of identifying excited states in these emerging nanostructures.
