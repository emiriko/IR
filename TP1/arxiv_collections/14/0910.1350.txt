In the Bulk Randall-Sundrum model, the Kaluza-Klein excitations of the gauge
bosons are the primary signatures. In particular, the search for the
Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitation of the gluon at hadron colliders is of great
importance in testing this model. At the leading order in QCD, the production
of this KK-gluon proceeds only via q qbar-initial states. We study the
production of KK-gluons from gluon initial states at next-to-leading order in
QCD. We find that, even after including the sub-dominant KK-gluon loops at this
order, the next-to-leading order (NLO) cross-section is tiny compared to the
leading order cross-section and unlikely to impact the searches for this
resonance at hardon colliders.
