We consider a brane-world cosmological model coupled to a bulk scalar field.
Since the brane tension turns out to be proportional to Newton coupling $G$, in
such a model a time variation of $G$ naturally occurs. By resorting to
available bounds on the variation of $G$, the parameters of the model are
constrained. The constraints coming from nucleosynthesis and CMB result to be
the severest ones.
