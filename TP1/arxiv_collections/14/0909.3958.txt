Various phenomena related to geometric phases in quantum mechanics are
reviewed and explained by analyzing some examples.The concepts of 'parallelism'
,'connections' and 'curvatures' are applied to Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect, to
U(1)phase rotation, to SU(2) phase rotation and to holonomic quantum
computation (HQC). The connections in Schrodinger equations are treated by two
alternative approaches. Implementation of HQC is demonstrated by the use of
'dark states' including detailed calculations with the connections, for
implementing the quantum gates. 'Anyons' are related to the symmetries of the
wave functions,in a two-dimensional space, and the use of this concept is
demonstrated by analyzing an example taken from the field of Quantum Hall
effects.
