The 6307A emission line in the spectrum of Eta Car (Martin et al. 2006) is
blue-shifted [S III] 6313A emission originating from the outer wind structures
of the massive binary system. We realized the identification while analyzing
multiple forbidden emission lines not normally seen in the spectra of massive
stars. The high spatial and moderate spectral resolutions of HST/STIS resolve
forbidden lines of Fe+, N+, Fe++, S++, Ne++ and Ar++ into spatially and
velocity-resolved rope-like features originating from collisionally-excited
ions photo-ionized by UV photons or collisions. While the [Fe II] emission
extends across a velocity range of +/-500 km/s out to 0."7, more highly ionized
forbidden emissions are systematically blue-shifted (-500 to +200 km/s) and
extend only to 0."4. The [Fe II] defines the outer regions of the massive
primary wind. The [N II], [Fe III] emission define the the outer wind
interaction regions directly photo-ionized by far-UV radiation. Variations in
emission of [S III] 9533A, 9071A and 6313A suggest density ranges of 10^6 to
10^10 cm^-3 for electron temperatures ranging from 8,000 to 13,000K. Mapping
the temporal changes of the emission structure at critical phases of the
5.54-year period will provide important diagnostics of the interacting winds.
