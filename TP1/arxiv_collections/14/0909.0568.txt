We investigate the neutral hydrogen (HI) content of sixteen groups for which
we have multi-wavelength data including X-ray observations. Wide-field imaging
of the groups was obtained with the 20-cm multibeam system on the 64-m Parkes
telescope. We have detected ten previously uncatalogued HI sources, one of
which has no visible optical counterpart. We examine the HI properties of the
groups, compared to their X-ray characteristics, finding that those groups with
a higher X-ray temperature and luminosity contain less HI per galaxy. The HI
content of a group depends on its morphological make-up, with those groups
dominated by early-type galaxies containing the least total HI. We determined
the expected HI for the spiral galaxies in the groups, and found that a number
of the galaxies were HI deficient. The HI deficient spirals were found both in
groups with and without a hot intra-group medium. The HI deficient galaxies
were not necessarily found at the centre of the groups, however, we did find
that two thirds of HI deficient galaxies were found within about 1 Mpc from the
group centre, indicating that the group environment is affecting the gas-loss
from these galaxies. We determined the HI mass function for a composite sample
of 15 groups, and found that it is significantly flatter than the field HI mass
function. We also find a lack of high HI-mass galaxies in groups. One possible
cause of this effect is the tidal stripping of HI gas from spiral galaxies as
they are pre-processed in groups.
