Recent Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and elastic neutron scattering experiments
have revealed conclusively the presence of static incommensurate magnetism in
the field-induced B phase of CeCoIn5. We analyze the NMR data assuming the
hyperfine coupling to the In(2) nuclei is anisotropic and simulate the spectra
for several different magnetic structures. The NMR data are consistent with
ordered Ce moments along the [001] direction, but are relatively insensitive to
the direction of the incommensurate wavevector.
