We report slowed propagation and storage and retrieval of thermal light in
warm rubidium vapor using the effect of electromagnetically-induced
transparency (EIT). We first demonstrate slowed-propagation of the probe
thermal light beam through an EIT medium by measuring the second-order
correlation function of the light field using the Hanbury-Brown$-$Twiss
interferometer. We also report an experimental study on the effect of the EIT
slow-light medium on the temporal coherence of thermal light. Finally, we
demonstrate the storage and retrieval of thermal light beam in the EIT medium.
The direct measurement of the photon number statistics of the retrieved light
field shows that the photon number statistics is preserved during the storage
and retrieval process.
