We study the variation of the electronic properties at the surface of a high
temperature superconductor as a function of vacuum conditions in angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments. Normally, under less than ideal
vacuum conditions the carrier concentration of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O{8+x} (Bi2212)
increases with time due to the absorption of oxygen from CO2 and CO molecules
that are prime contaminants present in ultra high vacuum (UHV) systems. We find
that in a high quality vacuum environment at low temperatures, the surface of
Bi2212 is quite stable (the carrier concentration remains constant), however at
elevated temperatures the carrier concentration decreases due to the loss of
oxygen atoms from the Bi-O layer. These two effects can be used to control the
carrier concentration in-situ. Our finding opens the possibility of studying
the electronic properties of the cuprates as a function of doping across the
phase diagram on the same piece of sample (i.e. with the same impurities and
defects). We envision that this method could be utilized in other surface
sensitive techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy.
