One important prediction of acceleration of particles in the supernova caused
shock in the magnetic wind of exploding Wolf Rayet and Red Super Giant stars is
the production of an energetic particle component with an E^-2 spectrum, at a
level of a few percent in flux at injection. After allowing for transport
effects, so steepening the spectrum to E^-7/3, this component of electrons
produces electromagnetic radiation and readily explains the WMAP haze from the
Galactic Center region in spectrum, intensity and radial profile. This requires
the diffusion time scale for cosmic rays in the Galactic Center region to be
much shorter than in the Solar neighborhood: the energy for cosmic ray
electrons at the transition between diffusion dominance and loss dominance is
shifted to considerably higher particle energy. We predict that more precise
observations will find a radio spectrum of \nu^-2/3, at higher frequencies
\nu^-1, and at yet higher frequencies finally \nu^-3/2.
