We analyze a vast light curve database by obtaining mean rotational
properties of the entire sample, determining the spin frequency distribution
and comparing those data with a simple model based on hydrostatic equilibrium.
For the rotation periods, the mean value obtained is 6.95 h for the whole
sample, 6.88 h for the Trans-neptunian objects (TNOs) alone and 6.75 h for the
Centaurs. From Maxwellian fits to the rotational frequencies distribution the
mean rotation rates are 7.35 h for the entire sample, 7.71 h for the TNOs alone
and 8.95 h for the Centaurs. These results are obtained by taking into account
the criteria of considering a single-peak light curve for objects with
amplitudes lower than 0.15 mag and a double-peak light curve for objects with
variability >0.15mag. The best Maxwellian fits were obtained with the threshold
between 0.10 and 0.15mag. The mean light-curve amplitude for the entire sample
is 0.26 mag, 0.25mag for TNOs only, and 0.26mag for the Centaurs. The amplitude
versus Hv correlation clearly indicates that the smaller (and collisionally
evolved) objects are more elongated than the bigger ones. From the model
results, it appears that hydrostatic equilibrium can explain the statistical
results of almost the entire sample, which means hydrostatic equilibrium is
probably reached by almost all TNOs in the H range [-1,7]. This implies that
for plausible albedos of 0.04 to 0.20, objects with diameters from 300km to
even 100km would likely be in equilibrium. Thus, the great majority of objects
would qualify as being dwarf planets because they would meet the hydrostatic
equilibrium condition. The best model density corresponds to 1100 kg/m3.
