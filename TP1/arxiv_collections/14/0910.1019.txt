We introduce a class of interatomic potential models that can be
automatically generated from data consisting of the energies and forces
experienced by atoms, derived from quantum mechanical calculations. The
resulting model does not have a fixed functional form and hence is capable of
modeling complex potential energy landscapes. It is systematically improvable
with more data. We apply the method to bulk carbon, silicon and germanium and
test it by calculating properties of the crystals at high temperatures. Using
the interatomic potential to generate the long molecular dynamics trajectories
required for such calculations saves orders of magnitude in computational cost.
