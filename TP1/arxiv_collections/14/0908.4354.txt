Let G be a semisimple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of
positive characteristic. In this note, we show that an irreducible closed
subvariety of the flag variety of G is compatibly split by the unique canonical
Frobenius splitting if and only if it is a Richardson variety, i.e. an
intersection of a Schubert and an opposite Schubert variety.
