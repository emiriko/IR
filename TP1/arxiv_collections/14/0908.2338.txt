We determine the solvent mediated contribution to the effective potentials
for model colloidal or nano- particles dispersed in a binary solvent that
exhibits fluid-fluid phase separation. Using a simple density functional theory
we calculate the density profiles of both solvent species in the presence of
the `colloids', which are treated as external potentials, and determine the
solvent mediated (SM) potentials. Specifically, we calculate SM potentials
between (i) two colloids, (ii) a colloid and a planar fluid-fluid interface,
and (iii) a colloid and a planar wall with an adsorbed wetting film. We
consider three different types of colloidal particles: colloid A which prefers
the bulk solvent phase rich in species 2, colloid C which prefers the solvent
phase rich in species 1, and `neutral' colloid B which has no strong preference
for either phase, i.e. the free energies to insert the colloid into either of
the coexisting bulk phases are almost equal. When a colloid which has a
preference for one of the two solvent phases is inserted into the disfavored
phase at statepoints close to coexistence a thick adsorbed `wetting' film of
the preferred phase may form around the colloids. The presence of the adsorbed
film has a profound influence on the form of the SM potentials.
