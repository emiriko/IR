The pionless effective field theory (EFT) is the appropriate low-energy EFT
for short-range interactions that display a large scattering length. It has
been successfully applied in atomic, nuclear and particle physics. We give an
overview over recent calculations employing the pionless effective field theory
and lay emphasis on applications in the three- and four-body sector where the
most exciting developments have occurred.
