The elliptic genera of two-dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories can
be twisted by the action of the integral Heisenberg group if their U(1) charges
are fractional. The basic properties of the resulting twisted elliptic genera
and the associated twisted Witten indices are investigated with due attention
to their behaviors in orbifoldization. Our findings are illustrated by and
applied to several concrete examples. We give a better understanding of the
duality phenomenon observed long before for certain Landau-Ginzburg models. We
revisit and prove an old conjecture of Witten which states that every ADE
Landau-Ginzburg model and the corresponding minimal model share the same
elliptic genus. Mathematically, we establish ADE generalizations of the
quintuple product identity.
