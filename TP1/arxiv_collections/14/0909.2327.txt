It is shown that due to the dissociation of the molecular oxygen it is
possible to obtain inverted population in low pressure air by heating. As a
result of the quenching of the corresponding levels of the atomic oxygen the
thermal superluminescent radiation is generated. It has been found that the
threshold of the overpopulation is exceeded at the air temperature 2300-3000 K.
Using this effect a possible mechanism for the generation of the flashes of the
radiation in air observed on the airframe of the space shuttle during its
descent and reentry in the atmosphere is suggested.
