The photometric, structural and kinematical properties of the centers of
elliptical galaxies, harbor important information of the formation history of
the galaxies. In the case of non active elliptical galaxies these properties
are linked in a way that surface brightness, break radius and velocity
dispersion of the core lie on a fundamental plane similar to that found for
their global properties. We construct the Core Fundamental Plane (CFP) for a
sizeable sample of low redshift radio galaxies and compare it with that of non
radio ellipticals. To pursue this aim we combine data obtained from high
resolution HST images with medium resolution optical spectroscopy to derive the
photometric and kinematic properties of ~40 low redshift radio galaxies. We
find that the CFPs of radio galaxies is indistinguishable from that defined by
non radio elliptical galaxies of similar luminosity. The characteristics of the
CFP of radio galaxies are also consistent (same slope) with those of the
Fundamental Plane (FP) derived from the global properties of radio (and non
radio) elliptical galaxies. The similarity of CFP and FP for radio and non
radio ellipticals suggests that the active phase of these galaxies has minimal
effects for the structure of the galaxies.
