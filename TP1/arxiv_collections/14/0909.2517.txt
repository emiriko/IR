In this paper we have defined one function that has been used to construct
different fractals having fractal dimensions between 1.58 and 2. Also, we tried
to calculate the amount of increment of fractal dimension in accordance with
the base of the number systems. Further, interestingly enough, these very
fractals could be a frame of lyrics for the musicians, as we know that the
fractal dimension of music is around 1.65 and varies between a high of 1.68 and
a low of 1.60. Further, at the end we conjecture that the switching from one
music fractal to another is nothing but enhancing a constant amount fractal
dimension which might be equivalent to a kind of different sets of musical
notes in various orientations.
