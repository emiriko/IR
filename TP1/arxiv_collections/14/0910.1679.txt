We present a novel phase diagram for the antiferromagnetism and
superconductivity in Ce$_2$RhIn$_8$ probed by In-NQR studies under pressure
($P$). The quasi-2D character of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in the
paramagnetic state at $P$ = 0 evolves into a 3D character because of the
suppression of antiferromagnetic order for $P > P_{\rm QCP}\sim$ 1.36 GPa (QCP:
antiferromagnetic quantum critical point). Nuclear-spin-lattice-relaxation rate
$1/T_1$ measurements revealed that the superconducting order occurs in the $P$
range 1.36 -- 1.84 GPa, with maximum $T_c\sim$ 0.9 K around $P_{\rm QCP}\sim$
1.36 GPa.
