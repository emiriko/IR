Automated search for star clusters in J,H,K_s data from 2MASS catalog has
been performed using the method developed by Koposov et. al (2008). We have
found and verified 153 new clusters in the interval of the galactic latitude
-24 < b < 24 degrees. Color excesses E(B-V), distance moduli and ages were
determined for 130 new and 14 yet-unstudied known clusters. In this paper, we
publish a catalog of coordinates, diameters, and main parameters of all the
clusters under study. A special web-site available at http://ocl.sai.msu.ru has
been developed to facilitate dissemination and scientific usage of the results.
