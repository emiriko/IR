We propose a Randall-Sundrum model with a bulk family symmetry based on the
double tetrahedral group, T', which generates the tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing
pattern and a realistic CKM matrix. The T' symmetry forbids tree-level
flavor-changing-neutral-currents in both the quark and lepton sectors, as
different generations of fermions are unified into multiplets of T'. This
results in a low first KK mass scale and thus the model can be tested at
collider experiments.
