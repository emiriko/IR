The first purpose of this paper is to shed some new light on the old question
of selecting the number of beams in intensity-modulated radiation therapy
(IMRT). The second purpose is to illuminate the related issue of discrete
static beam angles vs. rotational techniques, which has recently re-surfaced
due to the advancement of volumetric arc therapy (VMAT). A specific objective
is to find analytical expressions that allow one to address the points raised
above. To make the problem mathematically tractable, it is assumed that the
depth dose is flat and that the lateral dose profile can be approximated by
polynomials, specifically Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, of finite
degree. The application of methods known from image reconstruction then allows
one to answer the first question above as follows: The required number of beams
is determined by the maximum degree of the polynomials used in the
approximation of the beam profiles, which is a measure of the dose variability.
There is nothing to be gained by using more beams. In realistic cases, in which
the variability of the lateral dose profile is restricted in several ways, the
required number of beams is of the order of 10 to 20. The consequence of
delivering the beams with a `leaf sweep' technique during continuous rotation
of the gantry, as in VMAT, is also derived in analytical form. The main effect
is that the beams fan out, but the effect near the axis of rotation is small.
This result can serve as a theoretical justification of VMAT. Overall the
analytical derivations in this paper, albeit based on strong simplifications,
provide new insights into, and a deeper understanding of, the beam angle
problem in IMRT.
