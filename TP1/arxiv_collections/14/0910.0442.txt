The WGLA of the AAS (http://www.aas.org/labastro/) promotes collaboration and
exchange of knowledge between astronomy and planetary sciences and the
laboratory sciences (physics, chemistry, and biology). Laboratory data needs of
ongoing and next generation planetary science missions are carefully evaluated
and recommended in this white paper submitted by the WGLA to Planetary Decadal
Survey.
