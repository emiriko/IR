We employ the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB) equation to investigate
current-induced domain wall motion at finite temperatures by numerical
micromagnetic simulations. We extend the LLB equation with spin torque terms
that account for the effect of spin-polarized currents and we find that the
velocities depend strongly on the interplay between adiabatic and non-adiabatic
spin torque terms. As a function of temperature, we find non-monotonous
behavior, which might be useful to determine the relative strengths of the spin
torque terms experimentally.
