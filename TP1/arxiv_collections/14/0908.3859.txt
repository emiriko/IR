This review examines progress on the Pop I, fundamental-mode Cepheid distance
scale with emphasis on recent developments in geometric and quasi-geometric
techniques for Cepheid distance determination. Specifically I examine the
surface brightness method, interferometric pulsation method, and trigonometric
measurements. The three techniques are found to be in excellent agreement for
distance measures in the Galaxy. The velocity p-factor is of crucial importance
in the first two of these methods. A comparison of recent determinations of the
p-factor for Cepheids demonstrates that observational measures of p and
theoretical predictions agree within their uncertainties for Galactic Cepheids.
