Microtubules (MTs) are self-assembled hollow protein tubes playing important
functions in live cells. Their building block is a protein called tubulin,
which self-assembles in a particulate 2 dimensional lattice. We study the
vibrational modes of this lattice and find Dirac points in the phonon spectrum.
We discuss a splitting of the Dirac points that leads to phonon bands with
nonzero Chern numbers, signaling the existence of topological vibrational modes
localized at MTs edges, which we indeed observe after explicit calculations.
Since these modes are robust against the large changes occurring at the edges
during the dynamic cycle of the MTs, we can build a simple mechanical model to
illustrate how they would participate in this phenomenon.
