We demonstrate that hard branching 2\to 3 particle processes with nuclei
provide an effective way to determine the momentum transfers needed for effects
of point-like configurations to dominate large angle 2\to 2 processes. In
contrast with previously proposed approaches, the discussed reaction allows the
effects of the transverse size of configurations to be decoupled from effects
of the space-time evolution of these configurations.
