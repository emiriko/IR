In [8] it was shown that the transplant operator transforms solutions of one
Vekua equation into solutions of another Vekua equation, related to the first
via a Schr\"odinger equation. In this paper we demonstrate a fundamental
property of this operator: it transforms formal powers of the first Vekua
equation into formal powers of the same order for the second Vekua equation.
This property allows us to obtain positive formal powers and a generating
sequence of a "complicated" Vekua equation from positive formal powers and a
generating sequence of "simpler" Vekua equation. Similar results is obtained
regarding construction of Cauchy kernels. Elliptic and hyperbolic
pseudoanalytic function theory are considered and examples are given to
illustrate the procedure.
