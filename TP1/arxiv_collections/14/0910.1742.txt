We explain how an analytic continuation we have developed recently is applied
to determine the residues of the nucleon resonance poles within a dynamical
coupled-channel model of meson-baron reactions. A procedure for evaluating the
electromagnetic N-N^* transition form factors at resonance poles is developed.
Illustrative results of the obtained N^* -> pi N, gamma N transition form
factors for P_{11}, P_{33}, and D_{13} nucleon resonances are presented and
compared with previous results.
