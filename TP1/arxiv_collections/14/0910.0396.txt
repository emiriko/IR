The second quantized approach to geometric phases is reviewed. The second
quantization generally induces a hidden local (time-dependent) gauge symmetry.
This gauge symmetry defines the parallel transport and holonomy, and thus it
controls all the known geometric phases, either adiabatic or non-adiabatic, in
a unified manner. The transitional region from the adiabatic to non-adiabatic
phases is thus analyzed in a quantitative way. It is then shown that the
topology of the adiabatic Berry's phase is trivial in a precise sense and also
the adiabatic phase is rather fragile against the non-adiabatic deformation. In
this formulation, the notion such as the projective Hilbert space does not
appear.
