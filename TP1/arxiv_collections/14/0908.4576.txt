We analyze the relationship between the bound and the free waves in the
noncollinear SHG scheme, along with the vectorial conservation law for the
different components arising when there are two pump beams impinging on the
sample with two different incidence angles. The generated power is
systematically investigated, by varying the polarization state of both
fundamental beams, while absorption is included via the Herman and Hayden
correction terms. The theoretical simulations, obtained for samples which are
some coherence length thick show that the resulting polarization mapping is an
useful tool to put in evidence the interference between bound and free waves,
as well as the effect of absorption on the interference pattern
