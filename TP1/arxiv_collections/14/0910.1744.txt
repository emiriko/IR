Hanle effect is ubiquitous in the study of spin-related phenomena and has
been used to determine spin lifetime, precession and transport in
semiconductors. Here, we report an experimental observation of anomalous Hanle
effect in individual self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots where we find that a
sizeable photo-created electron spin polarization can be maintained in
transverse fields as high as 1T until it abruptly collapses. The striking
broadening of the Hanle curve by a factor of ~20 and its bistability upon
reversal of the magnetic sweep direction points to a novel dynamical nuclear
spin polarization mechanism where the effective nuclear magnetic field
compensates the transverse applied field. This interpretation is further
supported by the measurement of actual electron Zeeman splitting which exhibits
an abrupt increase at the Hanle curve collapse. Strong inhomogeneous
quadrupolar interactions typical for strained quantum dots are likely to play a
key role in polarizing nuclear spins perpendicular to the optically injected
spin orientation.
