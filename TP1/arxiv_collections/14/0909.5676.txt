We prove that an alternating e-form on a vector space over a
quasi-algebraically closed field always has a singular (e-1)-dimensional
subspace, provided that the dimension of the space is strictly greater than e.
Here an (e-1)-dimensional subspace is called singular if pairing it with the
e-form yields zero. By the theorem of Chevalley and Warning our result applies
in particular to finite base fields. Our proof is most interesting in the case
where e=3 and the space has odd dimension n; then it involves a beautiful
equivariant map from alternating trilinear forms to polynomials of degree
(n-3)/2. We also give a sharp upper bound on the dimension of subspaces all of
whose 2-dimensional subspaces are singular for a non-degenerate trilinear form.
In certain binomial dimensions the trilinear forms attaining this upper bound
turn out to form a single orbit under the general linear group, and we classify
their singular lines.
