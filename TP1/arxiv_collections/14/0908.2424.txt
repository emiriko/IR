We analyze the constraints on the the vacuum polarization of the standard
model gauge bosons from a minimal set of flavor observables valid for a general
class of models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. We will show that
the constraints have a strong impact on the self-coupling and masses of the
lightest spin-one resonances. Our analysis is applicable to any four and higher
dimensional extension of the standard model reducing to models of dynamical
electroweak symmetry breaking.
