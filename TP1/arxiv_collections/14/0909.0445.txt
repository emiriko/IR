We propose to explore the so-far poorly measured cosmic ray and gamma-ray sky
(accelerator sky) in the energy range from 10 TeV to 1 EeV. New physics
questions might be addressed in this last remaining observation window of
gamma-ray astronomy. The very high beam-energies provided by Cosmic
accelerators and the air-shower detection technique naturally imply an
entanglement between fundamental questions of astroparticle physics and
particle physics. The new large-area (10 km$^2$) wide-angle (1 sr) air
Cherenkov detector SCORE (Study for a Cosmic ORigin Explorer) is based on
non-imaging Cherenkov light-front sampling with sensitive large-area detector
modules of the order of 1 m$^2$. The lateral photon density and arrival-time
distribution will be sampled up to large distances from the shower core. The
physics motivations, the detector concept and first simulation results will be
presented.
