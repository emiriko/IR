The performance of the ALICE detector in searches for new heavy stable
charged particles in pp collisions is discussed in this paper. Gluino R-hadron
was chosen as an example of a candidate, and cross sections and kinematic
properties were obtained from PYTHIA simulations for various gluino masses
($100-500 GeV/c^2$). Detector response simulations for R-hadrons in the TPC
acceptance ($|\eta|<1$) were performed for $100 GeV/c^2$ R-hadron mass.
