Though QCD Factorization(QCDF) could produce sufficiently large $B\to K\pi$
branching ratios close to experiments, the predicted direct CP asymmetry in
${\bar B}^{0}\to K^{+}\pi^{-}$ decay is however still quite below experiment,
even with a large negative phase in the annihilation term, according to
existing calculations. This suggests the presence of an additional strong phase
in the decay amplitude which could come from the long-distance final state
interactions(FSI) like charming penguin. In this paper, we show that, by adding
to the $B\to K\pi$ decay QCDF amplitude, a real part and an absorptive part
with a strength 10% and 30% of the penguin amplitude, respectively, we could
bring the
  $B\to K\pi$ branching ratios and the ${\bar B}^{0}\to K^{-}\pi^{+}$ CP
asymmetry close to the measured values. We also find that the color-allowed
electroweak penguin is appreciable and that from the QCDF electroweak-strong
penguin interference terms and the measured $B^{-}\to {\bar K}^{0}\pi^{-}$ we
obtain $(9.0\pm 0.3)\times 10^{-6}$ for the ${\bar B}^{0}\to {\bar
K}^{0}\pi^{0}$ branching ratio, a bit lower than experiment. Similarly, the
predicted value for $B^{-}\to K^{-}\pi^{0}$ in terms of the ${\bar B}^{0}\to
K^{-}\pi^{+}$ branching ratio agrees well with experiment. This suggests that
the measured value for ${\bar B}^{0}\to {\bar K}^{0}\pi^{0}$ in fact should be
lower than the current measured value.
