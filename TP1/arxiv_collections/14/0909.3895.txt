As our capacity to study ever-expanding domains of our science has increased
(including the time domain, non-electromagnetic phenomena, magnetized plasmas,
and numerous sky surveys in multiple wavebands with broad spatial coverage and
unprecedented depths), so have the horizons of our understanding of the
Universe been similarly expanding. This expansion is coupled to the exponential
data deluge from multiple sky surveys, which have grown from gigabytes into
terabytes during the past decade, and will grow from terabytes into Petabytes
(even hundreds of Petabytes) in the next decade. With this increased vastness
of information, there is a growing gap between our awareness of that
information and our understanding of it. Training the next generation in the
fine art of deriving intelligent understanding from data is needed for the
success of sciences, communities, projects, agencies, businesses, and
economies. This is true for both specialists (scientists) and non-specialists
(everyone else: the public, educators and students, workforce). Specialists
must learn and apply new data science research techniques in order to advance
our understanding of the Universe. Non-specialists require information literacy
skills as productive members of the 21st century workforce, integrating
foundational skills for lifelong learning in a world increasingly dominated by
data. We address the impact of the emerging discipline of data science on
astronomy education within two contexts: formal education and lifelong
learners.
