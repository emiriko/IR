Non-adiabatic pumping of discrete charges, realized by a dynamical quantum
dot in an AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure, is studied under influence of a
perpendicular magnetic field. Application of an oscillating voltage in the
GHz-range to one of two top gates, crossing a narrow wire and confining a
quantum dot, leads to quantized pumped current plateaus in the gate
characteristics. The regime of pumping one single electron is traced back to
the diverse tunneling processes into and out-of the dot. Extending the theory
to multiple electrons allows to investigate conveniently the pumping
characteristics in an applied magnetic field. In this way, a qualitatively
different behavior between pumping even or odd numbers of electrons is
extracted.
