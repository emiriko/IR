The current-phase relation (CPR) for a short Josephson junction placed in the
nonuniform field of a small ferromagnetic particle is studied. The effect of
the particle produced on the junction appears to be strong due to the formation
of the pair of oppositely directed Abrikosov vortices which pierce the thin
film superconducting electrode and cause a small--scale inhomogeneity of
Josephson phase difference. The induced phase difference inhomogeneity is shown
to result in the nonzero fixed phase drop $\phi_0$ across the junction. The
equilibrium value $\phi_0$ corresponding to the ground state of the junction
depends the configuration of the vortex--antivortex pair. The possibility to
tune the ground state phase difference $\phi_0$ is discussed.
