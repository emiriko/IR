We discuss shell-model calculations based on the use of low-momentum
interactions derived from the free-space nucleon-nucleon potential. A main
feature of this approach is the construction of a smooth potential, V-low-k,
defined within a given momentum cutoff. As a practical application of the
theoretical framework, we present some selected results of our current study of
nuclei around doubly magic 132Sn and 208Pb which have been obtained starting
from the CD-Bonn potential. Focusing attention on the similarity between the
spectroscopy of these two regions, we show that it emerges quite naturally from
our effective interactions without use of any adjustable parameter.
