We study tunneling properties of collective excitations in spin-1
Bose-Einstein condensates. In the absence of magnetic fields, the total
transmission in the long wavelength limit occurs in all kinds of excitations
but the quadrupolar spin mode in the ferromagnetic state. The quadrupolar spin
mode alone shows the total reflection. A difference between those excitations
comes from whether the wavefunction of an excitation corresponds to that of the
condensate in the long wavelength limit. The correspondence results in the
total transmission as in the spinless BEC.
