This paper addresses efficient hardware/software implementation approaches
for the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm and describes the design
and performance testing algorithm for embedded system. Also, with the spread of
reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Array) embedded
cryptographic hardware became cost-effective. Nevertheless, it is worthy to
note that nowadays, even hardwired cryptographic algorithms are not so safe.
  From another side, the self-reconfiguring platform is reported that enables
an FPGA to dynamically reconfigure itself under the control of an embedded
microprocessor. Hardware acceleration significantly increases the performance
of embedded systems built on programmable logic. Allowing a FPGA-based
MicroBlaze processor to self-select the coprocessors uses can help reduce area
requirements and increase a system's versatility. The architecture proposed in
this paper is an optimal hardware implementation algorithm and takes dynamic
partially reconfigurable of FPGA. This implementation is good solution to
preserve confidentiality and accessibility to the information in the numeric
communication.
