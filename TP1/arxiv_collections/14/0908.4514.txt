The present paper is based on the assumption that heavy quarks bound states
exist in the Standard Model (SM). Considering New Bound States (NBS) of
top-anti-top quarks (named T-balls) we have shown that: 1) there exists the
scalar 1S-bound state of 6t+6\bar t; 2) the forces which bind the top-quarks
are very strong and almost completely compensate the mass of the twelve
top-anti-top-quarks in the scalar NBS; 3) such strong forces are produced by
the Higgs-top-quarks interaction with a large value of the top-quark Yukawa
coupling constant g_t\simeq 1. Theory also predicts the existence of the NBS 6t
+ 5\bar t, which is a color triplet and a fermion similar to the t'-quark of
the fourth generation. We have also considered the "b-quark-replaced" NBS. We
have estimated the masses of the lightest fermionic NBS: M_{NBS}\gtrsim 300
GeV, and discussed the larger masses of T-balls. Searching for heavy quarks
bound states at the Tevatron and LHC is discussed.
