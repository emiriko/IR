In this letter we present the result of the cross correlation between the 4th
INTEGRAL/IBIS soft gamma-ray catalog, in the range 20-100 keV, and the Fermi
LAT bright source list of objects emitting in the 100 MeV - 100 GeV range. The
main result is that only a minuscule part of the more than 720 sources detected
by INTEGRAL and the population of 205 Fermi LAT sources are detected in both
spectral regimes. This is in spite of the mCrab INTEGRAL sensitivity for both
galactic and extragalactic sources and the breakthrough, in terms of
sensitivity, achieved by Fermi at MeV-GeV energies. The majority of the 14
Fermi LAT sources clearly detected in the 4th INTEGRAL/IBIS catalog are
optically identified AGNs (10) complemented by 2 isolated pulsars (Crab and
Vela) and 2 High Mass X-Ray Binaries (HMXB, LS I +61 303 and LS 5039). Two more
possible associations have been found: one is 0FGL J1045.6-5937, possibly the
counterpart at high energy of the massive colliding wind binary system Eta
Carinae, discovered to be a soft gamma ray emitter by recent INTEGRAL
observations and 0FGL J1746.0-2900 coincident with IGR J17459-2902, but still
not identified with any known object at lower energy. For the remaining 189
Fermi LAT sources no INTEGRAL counterpart was found and we report the 2 sigma
upper limit in the energy band 20-40 keV.
