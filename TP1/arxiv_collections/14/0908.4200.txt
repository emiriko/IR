A complete irreversible adiabatic transport of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
in a double-well trap is investigated within the mean field approximation. The
transfer is driven by time-dependent (Gaussian) coupling between the wells and
their relative detuning. The protocol successfully works in a wide range of
both repulsive and attractive BEC interaction. The nonlinear effects caused by
the interaction can be turned from detrimental into favorable for the
transport. The results are compared with familiar Landau-Zener scenarios using
the constant coupling. It is shown that the pulsed Gaussian coupling provides a
new transport regime where coupling edges are decisive and convenient switch of
the transport is possible.
