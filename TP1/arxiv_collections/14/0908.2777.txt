Proton rapidity distributions have been measured by the NA49 collaboration in
40 and 158 GeV/nucleon Pb+Pb collisions as function of collision centrality. We
find that the shape and the yield per wounded nucleon in the mid-rapidity
region vary little with centrality and are similar to the distributions
obtained from inelastic p+p interactions. This observation is satisfactorily
described by the transport models HSD and UrQMD, although there are significant
differences in the details of the spectral shape between the experimental data
and the models as well as between the models. The approximate invariance of the
normalized proton spectrum in the vicinity of mid-rapidity suggests that
multiple nucleon-nucleon interactions in nuclear collisions at SPS energies
have little effect on the spectra of those final state protons which are slowed
down the most.
