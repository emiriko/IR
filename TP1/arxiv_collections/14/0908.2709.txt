Thermal Hilbert moment QCD sum rules are used to obtain the temperature
dependence of the hadronic parameters of charmonium in the vector channel, i.e.
the $J$ / $\psi$ resonance mass, coupling (leptonic decay constant), total
width, and continuum threshold. The continuum threshold $s_0$, which signals
the end of the resonance region and the onset of perturbative QCD (PQCD),
behaves as in all other hadronic channels, i.e. it decreases with increasing
temperature until it reaches the PQCD threshold $s_0 = 4 m_Q^2$, with $m_Q$ the
charm quark mass, at $T\simeq 1.22 T_c$. The rest of the hadronic parameters
behave very differently from those of light-light and heavy-light quark
systems. The $J$ / $\psi$ mass is essentially constant in a wide range of
temperatures, while the total width grows with temperature up to $T \simeq 1.04
T_c$ beyond which it decreases sharply with increasing T. The resonance
coupling is also initially constant and then begins to increase monotonically
around $T \simeq T_c$. This behaviour of the total width and of the leptonic
decay constant provides a strong indication that the $J$ / $\psi$ resonance
might survive beyond the critical temperature for deconfinement.
