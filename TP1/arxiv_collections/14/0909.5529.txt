We show how parton distributions unintegrated over the parton transverse
momentum, k_t, may be generated, at NLO accuracy, from the known integrated
(DGLAP-evolved) parton densities determined from global data analyses. A few
numerical examples are given, which demonstrate that sufficient accuracy is
obtained by keeping only the LO splitting functions together with the NLO
integrated parton densities. However, it is important to keep the precise
kinematics of the process, by taking the scale to be the virtuality rather than
the transverse momentum, in order to be consistent with the calculation of the
NLO splitting functions.
