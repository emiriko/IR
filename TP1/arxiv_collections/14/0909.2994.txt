I present an overview of the methods involved in the computation of the
scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational self-forces acting on a point
particle moving in a curved spacetime. For simplicity, the focus here will be
on the scalar self-force. The lecture follows closely my review article on this
subject published in Living Reviews in Relativity. I begin with a review of
geometrical elements (Synge's world function, the parallel propagator). Next I
introduce useful coordinate systems (Fermi normal coordinates and retarded
light-cone coordinates) in a neighborhood of the particle's world line. I then
present the wave equation for a scalar field in curved spacetime and the
equations of motion for a particle endowed with a scalar charge. The wave
equation is solved by means of a Green's function, and the self-force is
constructed from the field gradient. Because the retarded field is singular on
the world line, the self-force must involve a regularized version of the field
gradient, and I describe how the regular piece of the self-field can be
identified. In the penultimate section of the lecture I put the construction of
the self-force on a sophisticated axiomatic basis, and in the concluding
section I explain how one can do better by abandoning the dangerous fiction of
a point particle
