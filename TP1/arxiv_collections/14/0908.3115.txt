We report the observation of nonlinearity-induced broadening of resonances in
dynamically modulated directional couplers. When the refractive index of the
guiding channels in the coupler is harmonically modulated along the propagation
direction and out-of-phase in two channels, coupling can be completely
inhibited at resonant modulation frequencies. We observe that nonlinearity
broadens such resonances and that localization can be achieved even in detuned
systems at power levels well below those required in unmodulated couplers.
