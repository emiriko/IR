We explore the possibility to trap polynitrogen clusters inside C60 fullerene
cage, opening a new direction of developing nitrogen-rich high energy
materials. We found that a maximum of 13 nitrogen atoms can be encapsulated in
a C60 cage. The nitrogen clusters in confinement exhibit unique stable
structures in polymeric form which possess a large component of (~ 70-80%)
single bond character. The Nn@C60 molecules retain their structure at 300K for
n<12. The Mulliken charge analysis shows very small charge transfer in N@C60,
consistent with the quartet spin state of N. However, for 2<n<10, charge
transfer take place from cage surface to Nn compounds and inverse polarization
thereafter. These nitrogen clusters when allowed to relax to N2 molecules which
are triply bonded are capable of releasing a large amount of energy.
