For a hermitian line bundle over an arithmetic variety, we construct a convex
continuous function on the Okounkov body associated to the generic fibre of the
line bundle. The integration of the continuous function gives the growth of the
Euler characteristic of the hermitian line bundle. It is the global version of
the recent work of Nystrom.
