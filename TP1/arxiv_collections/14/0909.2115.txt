Recently a second type of spicules was discovered at the solar limb with the
Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard the Japanese Hinode spacecraft. These
previously unrecognized type II spicules are thin chromospheric jets that are
shorter-lived (10-60 s) and that show much higher apparent upward velocities
(of order 50-100 km/s) than the classical spicules. Since they have been
implicated in providing hot plasma to coronal loops, their formation, evolution
and properties are important ingredients for a better understanding of the mass
and energy balance of the low solar atmosphere. Here we report on the discovery
of the disk counterparts of type II spicules using spectral imaging data in the
Ca II 854.2 nm and Halpha lines with the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter
(CRISP) at the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST) in La Palma. We find rapid
blueward excursions in the line profiles of both chromospheric lines that
correspond to thin, jet-like features that show apparent velocities of order 50
km/s. These blueward excursions seem to form a separate absorbing component
with Doppler shifts of order 20 and 50 km/s for the Ca II 854.2 nm and Halpha
line respectively. We show that the appearance, lifetimes, longitudinal and
transverse velocities and occurrence rate of these rapid blue excursions on the
disk are very similar to those of the type II spicules at the limb. A detailed
study of the spectral line profiles in these events suggests that plasma is
accelerated along the jet, and plasma is being heated throughout the short
lifetime of the event.
