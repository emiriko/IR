Zero-energy Majorana bound states in superconductors have been proposed to be
potential building blocks of a topological quantum computer, because quantum
information can be encoded in the fermion occupation of a pair of {\it
spatially separated} Majorana bound states. However, despite intensive
theoretical efforts, non-local signatures of Majorana bound states have not
been found in charge transport. In this work, we predict a striking non-local
phase-coherent electron transfer process by virtue of tunneling in and out of a
pair of Majorana bound states. This teleportation phenomena only exists in a
mesoscopic superconductor because of an all-important but previously
over-looked charging energy. We propose an experimental setup to detect this
phenomena in a superconductor/quantum spin Hall insulator/magnetic insulator
hybrid system.
