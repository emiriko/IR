Quantum random walk in a two-dimensional lattice with randomly distributed
traps is investigated. Distributions of quantum walkers are evaluated
dynamically for the cases of Hadamard, Fourier, and Grover coins, and quantum
to classical transition is examined as a function of the density of the traps.
It is shown that traps act as a serious and additional source of quantum
decoherence. Furthermore, non-trivial temporal dependence of the standard
deviation of the probability distribution of the walker is found when the
trapping imperfections are introduced.
