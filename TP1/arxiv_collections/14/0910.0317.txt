Load balancing is the process of improving the Performance of a parallel and
distributed system through is distribution of load among the processors [1-2].
Most of the previous work in load balancing and distributed decision making in
general, do not effectively take into account the uncertainty and inconsistency
in state information but in fuzzy logic, we have advantage of using crisps
inputs. In this paper, we present a new approach for implementing dynamic load
balancing algorithm with fuzzy logic, which can face to uncertainty and
inconsistency of previous algorithms, further more our algorithm shows better
response time than round robin and randomize algorithm respectively 30.84
percent and 45.45 percent.
