A beta-decay study of Cu-77 has been performed at the ISOLDE mass separator
with the aim to deduce its beta-decay properties and to obtain spectroscopic
information on Zn-77. Neutron-rich copper isotopes were produced by means of
proton- or neutron-induced fission reactions on U-238. After the production,
Cu-77 was selectively laser ionized, mass separated and sent to different
detection systems where beta-gamma and beta-n coincidence data were collected.
We report on the deduced half-live, decay scheme, and possible spin assignment
of 77Cu.
