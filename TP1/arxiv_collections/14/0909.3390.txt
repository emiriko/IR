We consider propagation of light pulses detuned from the atomic resonance in
a dense two-level medium and photonic structures with it. The large density of
the medium is important to decrease spatial scale of such nonlinear effects as
pulse compression, though it does not provide any fundamentally new phenomena
as compared to dilute media. Frequency detuning decreases the effectivity of
such nonlinear phenomena as pulse compression and dispersion spreading
compensation as well. We propose simple logic gates based on interaction
between two pulses in one-dimensional nonlinear photonic crystal. It turned
out, that frequency detuning is necessary to obtain ultrafast AND gate, while
OR and NOT gates can be realized in the system without detuning.
