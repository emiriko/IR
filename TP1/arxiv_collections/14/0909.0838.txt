We investigate charged and neutral current neutrino-induced incoherent pion
production off nuclei within the GiBUU model at energies relevant for the
MiniBooNE and K2K experiments. Special attention is paid to the entanglement
between measured CCQE and CC1pi+ cross sections. We further give predictions
and compare to recent data measured at MiniBooNE.
