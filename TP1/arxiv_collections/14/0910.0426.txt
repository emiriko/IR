We consider lattice gas diffusive dynamics with creation-annihilation in the
bulk and maintained out of equilibrium by two reservoirs at the boundaries.
This stochastic particle system can be viewed as a toy model for granular gases
where the energy is injected at the boundary and dissipated in the bulk. The
large deviation functional for the particle currents flowing through the system
is computed and some physical consequences are discussed: the mechanism for
local current fluctuations, dynamical phase transitions, the
fluctuation-relation.
