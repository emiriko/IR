We propose a partial fraction decomposition scheme to the construction of
hierarchical equations of motion theory for bosonic quantum dissipation
systems. The expansion of Bose--Einstein function in this scheme shows similar
properties as it applies for Fermi function. The performance of the resulting
quantum dissipation theory is exemplified with spin--boson systems. In all
cases we have tested the new theory performs much better, about an order of
magnitude faster, than the best available conventional theory based on
Matsubara spectral decomposition scheme.
