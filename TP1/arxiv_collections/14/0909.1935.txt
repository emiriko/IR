Ring topologies of repressing genes have qualitatively different long-term
dynamics if the number of genes is odd (they oscillate) or even (they exhibit
bistability). However, these attractors may not fully explain the observed
behavior in transient and stochastic environments such as the cell. We show
here that even repressilators possess quasi-stable, travelling-wave periodic
solutions that are reachable, long-lived and robust to parameter changes. These
solutions underlie the sustained oscillations observed in even rings in the
stochastic regime, even if these circuits are expected to behave as switches.
The existence of such solutions can also be exploited for control purposes:
operation of the system around the quasi-stable orbit allows us to turn on and
off the oscillations reliably and on demand. We illustrate these ideas with a
simple protocol based on optical interference that can induce oscillations
robustly both in the stochastic and deterministic regimes.
