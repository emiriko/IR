We summarize the results from analyzing six clusters of galaxies at 0.14 < z
< 0.40 observed with the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys. We
derive deep composite luminosity functions in B,g,V,r,i and z down to an
absolute magnitude of -14 +5 log h mag. The luminosity functions are fitted by
a single Schechter function with M^*=-19.8,-20.9,-21.9, -22.0,-21.7 and -22.3 i
B,g,V.r,i,z respectively and alpha=-1.3 for all bands. The data suggest that
the red sequence dominates the luminosity function down to more than 6 mag.
below L*, the dwarf spheroidal regime. Hence, at least at z=0.3 the red
sequence is well established and galaxies down to dwarf spheroidals are fully
assembled within these clusters. We do not detect the faint-end upturn (M >
-16) that is observed in lower redshift clusters. If this is real, the
faint-end population has originated since z = 0.3.
