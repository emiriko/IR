We focus on the influence of the Coriolis acceleration on the stochastic
excitation of oscillation modes in convective regions of rotating stars. Our
aim is to estimate the asymmetry between excitation rates of prograde and
retrograde modes. We extend the formalism derived for obtaining stellar $p$-
and $g$-mode amplitudes (Samadi & Goupil 2001, Belkacem et al. 2008) to include
the effect of the Coriolis acceleration. We then study the special case of
uniform rotation for slowly rotating stars by performing a perturbative
analysis. This allows us to consider the cases of the Sun and the CoRoT target
HD 49933. We find that, in the subsonic regime, the influence of rotation as a
direct contribution to mode driving is negligible in front of the Reynolds
stress contribution. In slow rotators, the indirect effect of the modification
of the eigenfunctions on mode excitation is investigated by performing a
perturbative analysis of the excitation rates. It turns out that the excitation
of solar $p$ modes is affected by rotation with excitation rates asymmetries
between prograde and retrograde modes of the order of several percents. Solar
low-order $g$ modes are also affected by uniform rotation and their excitation
rates asymmetries are found to reach up to 10 %. The CoRoT target HD 49933 is
rotating faster than the Sun ($\Omega / \Omega_\odot \approx 8$) and we show
that the resulting excitation rates asymmetry is about 10 % for the excitation
rates of $p$ modes. We have then demonstrated that $p$ and $g$ mode excitation
rates are modified by uniform rotation through the Coriolis acceleration. Study
of the effect of differential rotation is dedicated to a forthcoming paper.
