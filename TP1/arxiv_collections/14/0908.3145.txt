One can determine antiquark polarizations in proton using the information
from deep inelastic scattering, $\beta$ decays of baryons, orbital angular
momenta of quarks, as well as their integrated magnetic distributions. The last
quantities were determined previously by us performing a fit to magnetic
moments of baryon octet. However, because of the SU(3) symmetry our results
depend on two parameters. The quantity $\Gamma_{V}$, measured recently in a
COMPASS experiment, gives the relation between these parameters. We can fix the
last unknown parameter using the ratio of up and down quark magnetic moments
which one can get from the fit to radiative vector meson decays. We calculate
antiquark polarizations with the orbital momenta of valence quarks that follow
from lattice calculations. The value of difference for up and down antiquark
polarizations obtained in our calculations is consistent with the result
obtained in a HERMES experiment.
