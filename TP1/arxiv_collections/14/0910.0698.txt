Theoretical work predicts that the strong dependence of Tc on pure shear
strain within the a-b plane of optimally doped YBa2Cu3O{7-delta} results in
heterogenous columnar pins of vortex lines about dislocation lines and about
nano-columns inclusions aligned in parallel to the c axis. The critical current
of a rigid vortex lattice driven by the Lorentz force in the presence of such
clusters of pin/antipin lines is computed using two-dimensional (2D) collective
pinning theory and by numerical simulation of the corresponding 2D vortex
dynamics. Both theory and computer calculation find that the antipin component
of the heterogenous columnar pins contributes substantially to the net in-field
critical current.
