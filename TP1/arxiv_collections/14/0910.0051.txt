The entanglement spectrum of a pure state of a bipartite system is the full
set of eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix obtained from tracing out one
part. Such spectra are known in several cases to contain important information
beyond that in the entanglement entropy. This paper studies the entanglement
spectrum for a variety of critical and near-critical quantum lattice models in
one dimension, chiefly by the iTEBD numerical method, which enables both
integrable and non-integrable models to be studied. We find that the
distribution of eigenvalues in the entanglement spectra agrees with an
approximate result derived by Calabrese and Lefevre to an accuracy of a few
percent for all models studied. This result applies whether the correlation
length is intrinsic or generated by the finite matrix size accessible in iTEBD.
For the transverse Ising model, the known exact results for the entanglement
spectrum are used to confirm the validity of the iTEBD approach. For more
general models, no exact result is available but the iTEBD results directly
test the hypothesis that all moments of the reduced density matrix are
determined by a single parameter.
