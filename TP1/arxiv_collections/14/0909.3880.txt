Both wire-wound solenoids and cylindrical magnets can be approximately
modeled as ideal, azimuthally symmetric solenoids. We present here an exact
solution for the magnetic field of an ideal solenoid in an especially easy to
use form. The field is expressed in terms of a single function that can be
rapidly computed by means of a compact, highly efficient algorithm, which can
be coded as an add-in function to a spreadsheet, making field calculations
accessible even to introductory students. In computational work these
expressions are not only accurate but also just as fast as most approximate
expressions. We demonstrate their utility by numerically simulating the
experiment of dropping a cylindrical magnet through a nonmagnetic conducting
tube and then comparing the calculation with data obtained from experiments
suitable for an undergraduate laboratory.
