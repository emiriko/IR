Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra at the Fe K-edge were
measured for a single crystal of the iron oxypnictide superconductor PrFeAsO0.7
(Tc=42 K). They disclose a weak, broad feature centered around 4.5 eV energy
loss, which is slightly resonantly enhanced when the incident energy is tuned
in the vicinity of the 4p white line. We tentatively ascribe it to the
charge-transfer excitation between As 4p and Fe 3d.
