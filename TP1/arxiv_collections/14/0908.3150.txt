The b -> ssdbar and b -> ddsbar decays are highly suppressed in the SM, and
are thus good probes of new physics (NP) effects. We discuss in detail the
structure of the relevant SM effective Hamiltonian pointing out the presence of
nonlocal contributions which can be about \lambda^{-4} (m_c^2/m_t^2) ~ 30% of
the local operators (\lambda = 0.21 is the Cabibbo angle). The matrix elements
of the local operators are computed with little hadronic uncertainty by
relating them through flavor SU(3) to the observed \Delta S = 0 decays. We
identify a general NP mechanism which can lead to the branching fractions of
the b\to ss\bar d modes at or just below the present experimental bounds, while
satisfying the bounds from K-Kbar and B_{(s)}-Bbar_{(s)} mixing. It involves
the exchange of a NP field carrying a conserved charge, broken only by its
flavor couplings. The size of branching fractions within MFV, NMFV and general
flavor violating NP are also predicted. We show that in the future energy
scales higher than 10^3 TeV could be probed without hadronic uncertainties even
for b-> s and b-> d transitions, if enough statistics becomes available.
