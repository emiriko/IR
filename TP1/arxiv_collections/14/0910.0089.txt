We consider an integrable infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system in a
Hilbert space $H=\{u=(u_1^+,u_1^-; u_2^+,u_2^-;....)\}$ with integrals $I_1,
I_2,...$ which can be written as $I_j={1/2}|F_j|^2$, where $F_j:H\to \R^2$,
$F_j(0)=0$ for $j=1,2,...$ . We assume that the maps $F_j$ define a germ of an
analytic diffeomorphism $F=(F_1,F_2,...):H\to H$, such that dF(0)=id$, $(F-id)$
is a $\kappa$-smoothing map ($\kappa\geq 0$) and some other mild restrictions
on $F$ hold. Under these assumptions we show that the maps $F_j$ may be
modified to maps $F_j^\prime$ such that $F_j-F_j^\prime=O(|u|^2)$ and each
$\frac12|F'_j|^2$ still is an integral of motion. Moreover, these maps jointly
define a germ of an analytic symplectomorphism $F^\prime: H\to H$, the germ
$(F^\prime-id)$ is $\kappa$-smoothing, and each $I_j$ is an analytic function
of the vector $(\frac12|F'_j|^2,j\ge1)$. Next we show that the theorem with
$\kappa=1$ applies to the KdV equation. It implies that in the vicinity of the
origin in a functional space KdV admits the Birkhoff normal form and the
integrating transformation has the form `identity plus a 1-smoothing analytic
map'.
