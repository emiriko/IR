We reconsider the construction and matching of the vector and axial currents
in Wilson Chiral Perturbation Theory (WChPT), the low-energy effective theory
for lattice QCD with Wilson fermions. In particular, we discuss in detail the
impact of the finite renormalization of the currents on their matching from the
lattice theory to WChPT.We explicitly show that imposing chiral Ward-Takahashi
identities on the currents leads, in general, to additional terms of O(a) in
the axial current. We illustrate the impact on physical quantities by computing
the pion decay constant to one-loop order in the two flavor theory. Our result
differs from previously published ones.
