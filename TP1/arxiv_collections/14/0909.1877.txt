We compute the Euler characteristics of the moduli spaces of abelian vortices
on curves with nodal and cuspidal singularities. This generalizes our previous
work where only nodes were taken into account. The result we obtain is again
consistent with the expected reconciliation between the vortex picture of D2-D0
branes and the proposal by Gopakumar and Vafa.
