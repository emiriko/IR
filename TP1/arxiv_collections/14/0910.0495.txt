In this comprehensible article we develop, following Fantoni and Rosati
formalism, a hypernetted chain approximation for one dimensional systems of
fermions. Our scheme differs from previous treatments in the form that the
whole set of diagrams is grouped: we do it in terms of non-nodal, non-composite
and elementary graphs. This choice makes the deduction of equations more
transparent. Equations for the pair distribution functions of one component
systems as well as binary mixtures are obtained. We apply they to
experimentally realizable quasi-one dimensional systems, the so called quantum
wires which we model, within Sommerfeld-Pauli spirit, as a 1D electron gas or
as an electron-hole mixture. In order to use our one-dimensional equations we
consider pair potentials that depend on the wires width.
