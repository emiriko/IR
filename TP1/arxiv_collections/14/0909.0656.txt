We discuss a two-fold extension of QED assuming the presence of strong
external fields provided by an ultra-intense laser and noncommutativity of
spacetime. While noncommutative effects leave the electron's intensity induced
mass shift unchanged, the photons change significantly in character: they
acquire a quasi-momentum that is no longer light-like. We study the
consequences of this combined noncommutative strong-field effect for basic
lepton-photon interactions.
