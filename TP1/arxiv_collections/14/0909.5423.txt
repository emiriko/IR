Here we give a brief overview of some investigations of the gravitational
microlensing influence on broad absorption spectral lines of lensed QSOs.
Especially, we consider the microlensing influence on the Fe K$\alpha$ broad
absorption lines using a model of an accretion disk covered by an absorption
region. Gravitational microlensing is modeled by ray shooting method which
enables us to obtain realistic microlensing patterns. We obtain that
microlensing can affect both emission and absorption component of line that
depends on dimensions on emission and absorption line regions. Here we give
detailed analysis of emission and absorption line shape variations due to
gravitational microlensing.
