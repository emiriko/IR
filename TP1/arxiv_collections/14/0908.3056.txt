The symmetric group $S_{2n}$ and the hyperoctaheadral group $H_{n}$ is a
Gelfand triple for an arbitrary linear representation $\phi$ of $H_{n}$. Their
$\phi$-spherical functions can be caught as transition matrix between suitable
symmetric functions and the power sums. We generalize this triplet in the term
of wreath product. It is shown that our triplet are always to be a Gelfand
triple. Furthermore we study the relation between their spherical functions and
multi-partition version of the ring of symmetric functions.
