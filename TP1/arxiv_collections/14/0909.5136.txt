By the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we find that
energetically the most favorable cleaved $A$Fe$_2$As$_2$(001) surface ($A$=Ba,
Sr, or Ca) is $A$-terminated with a $(\sqrt{2}\times \sqrt{2})R45^{\circ}$ or
$(1\times 2)$ order. The $(1\times 2)$ ordered structure yields a $(1\times 2)$
dimerized STM image, in agreement with the experimental observation. The $A$
atoms are found to diffuse on the surface with a small energy barrier so that
the cleaving process may destroy the $A$ atoms ordering. At the very low
temperatures this may result in an As-terminated surface with the $A$ atoms in
randomly assembling. The As-terminated BaFe$_2$As$_2$ surface in orthorhombic
phase is $(\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2})R45^{\circ}$ buckled, giving rise to a
switchable $(\sqrt{2}\times \sqrt{2})R45^{\circ}$ STM pattern upon varying the
applied bias. No any reconstruction is found for the other As-terminated
surfaces. There are surface states crossing or nearby the Fermi energy in the
As-terminated and $(1\times 2)$ $A$-terminated surfaces. A unified physical
picture is thus established to help understand the cleaved $A$Fe$_2$As$_2$(001)
surfaces.
