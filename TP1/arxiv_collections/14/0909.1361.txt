This paper is the longer version of the extended abstract with the same name
published in FM 06. We describe in detail the algorithm to generate
verification conditions from statechart structures implemented in the iState
tool. This approach also suggests us a novel method to define a version of
predicate semantics for statecharts analogous to how we assign predicate
semantics to programming languages.
