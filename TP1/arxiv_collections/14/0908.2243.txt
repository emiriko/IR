While tested to a high level of accuracy in the Solar system, general
relativity is under the spotlight of both theoreticians and observers on larger
scales, mainly because of the need to introduce dark matter and dark energy in
the cosmological model. This text reviews the main tests of general relativity
focusing on the large scale structure and more particularly weak lensing. The
complementarity with other tests (including those on Solar system scales and
the equivalence principle) is discussed.
