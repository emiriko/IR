The quark spin densities related to generalized parton distributions in
impact-parameter space and to transverse-momentum dependent parton
distributions are reviewed within a light-cone quark model, with focus on the
role of the different spin-spin and spin-orbit correlations of quarks.Results
for azimuthal spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering due
to T-even transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions are also
discussed.
