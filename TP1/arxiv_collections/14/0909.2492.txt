The propagation of polarization-entangled states of light through fluctuating
loss channels in the turbulent atmosphere is studied, including the situation
of strong losses. We consider violations of Bell inequalities by light, emitted
by a parametric down-conversion source, after transmission through the
turbulent atmosphere. It is shown by analytical calculations, that in the
presence of background radiation and dark counts, fluctuating loss channels may
preserve entanglement properties of light even better than standard loss
channels, when postselected measurements are applied.
