The large survey programs being performed nowadays, being the SDSS their
flagship, provide us with morphological parameters which allow for extraction
of large galaxy samples. We will analyze the methodology for obtaining an
AMIGA-like catalogue of isolated galaxies from the SDSS DR5 photometric
catalogue of galaxy objects, together with the roadblocks found in the process,
and suggested workarounds.
