Using the system-bath model Hamiltonian this thesis covers the equilibrium
and out of equilibrium properties of quantum open systems. Topics included are
the calculation of thermodynamical quantities of open systems, derivation of
quantum master equations, phase space and numerical methods and Linear and non
Linear Response Theory. Applications are the transport in periodic potentials
and the dynamics of spins.
