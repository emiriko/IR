The collective atomic recoil lasing is studied for an ultra-cold and
collisionless atomic gas in a partially coherent pump with a colored noise.
Compared to white noise, correlations in colored noise are found to be able to
greatly enhance or suppress the growth rate, above or below a critical
detuning. Effects on cooperative scattering of light for noise correlation
time, noise intensity and pump-probe detuning are discussed. This result is
consistent with our simulation and linear analysis about the evolution
equations in the regions of instability.
