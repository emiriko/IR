The ESO Supernova Ia Progenitor Survey (SPY) took high-resolution spectra of
more than 1000 white dwarfs and pre-white dwarfs. About two thirds of the stars
observed are hydrogen-dominated DA white dwarfs. Here we present a catalog and
detailed spectroscopic analysis of the DA stars in the SPY. Atmospheric
parameters effective temperature and surface gravity are determined for normal
DAs. Double-degenerate binaries, DAs with magnetic fields or dM companions, are
classified and discussed. The spectra are compared with theoretical model
atmospheres using a chi^2 fitting technique. Our final sample contains 615 DAs,
which show only hydrogen features in their spectra, although some are
double-degenerate binaries. 187 are new detections or classifications. We also
find 10 magnetic DAs (4 new) and 46 DA+dM pairs (10 new).
