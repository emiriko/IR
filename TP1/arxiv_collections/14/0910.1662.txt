The possibility to use Cherenkov light measurements with Cherenkov telescope
to study atmospheric processes is shown. Cherenkov light from extensive air
showers is obtained using Monte Carlo simulations with CORSIKA code. Different
atmospheric profiles are considered and compared. Several experimental results
are shown and the scientific potential is discussed.
