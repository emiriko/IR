The Rosen-Zener model for association of atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate
is studied. Using a nonlinear Volterra integral equation, we obtain an analytic
formula for final probability of the transition to the molecular state for weak
interaction limit. Considering the strong coupling limit of high field
intensities, we show that the system reveals two different time-evolution
pictures depending on the detuning of the frequency of the associating field.
For both limit cases we derive highly accurate formulas for the molecular state
probability valid for the whole range of variation of time. Using these
formulas, we show that at large detuning regime the molecule formation process
occurs almost non-oscillatory in time and a Rosen-Zener pulse is not able to
associate more than one third of atoms at any time point. The system returns to
its initial all-atomic state at the end of the process and the maximal
transition probability is achieved when the field intensity reaches its peak.
In contrast, at small detuning the evolution of the system displays
large-amplitude oscillations between atomic and molecular populations. We find
that the shape of the oscillations in the first approximation is defined by the
field detuning only. Finally, a hidden singularity of the Rosen-Zener model due
to the specific time-variation of the field amplitude at the beginning of the
interaction is indicated. It is this singularity that stands for many of the
qualitative and quantitative properties of the model. The singularity may be
viewed as an effective resonance-touching.
