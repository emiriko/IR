In the article it is considered the extension of Weinberg-Salam theory from
SU(2) group to the octonionic algebra. The extended octonionic algebra is used
as particle wave function instead of spinors on su(2). It is shown, that leads
to appearance of a new neutral massive vector C and E-bosons (peculiar property
of the E-boson is that it does not interact with matter), and two charged
massive vector $D$ and $D^*$ bosons.
