In order to satisfy current FCNC and CP violation bounds, SUSY flavour
structures cannot be generic. An interesting solution to these SUSY Flavour and
CP Problems lies on the use of an SU(3) family symmetry which spontaneously
breaks CP symmetry. Typical observables of such a model are electric dipole
moments and LFV processes. In addition, these models can give contributions to
CP violation in neutral meson mixing. We show how the latter can be used to
restrict the allowed SUSY parameter space, and induce correlations between LFV
and EDM predictions.
