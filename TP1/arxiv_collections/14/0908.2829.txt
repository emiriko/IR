Approximate analytical energy formulas for N-body relativistic Hamiltonians
with one- and two-body interactions are obtained within the framework of the
auxiliary field method. This method has already been proved to be a powerful
technique in the case of two-body problems. A general procedure is given and
applied to various Hamiltonians of interest, in atomic and hadronic physics in
particular. A test of formulas is performed for baryons described as a
three-quark system.
