We review here the prospects of a long-term upgrade programme for the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC), CERN laboratory's new proton-proton collider. The
super-LHC, which is currently under evaluation and design, is expected to
deliver of the order of ten times the statistics of the LHC. In addition to a
non-technical summary of the principal physics arguments for the upgrade, I
present a pedagogical introduction to the technological challenges on the
accelerator and experimental fronts, and a review of the current status of the
planning.
