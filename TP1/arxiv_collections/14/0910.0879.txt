The recent results on various Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) Higgs boson
searches performed by the DZERO experiment at the Tevatron are presented here.
In particular, the Higgs bosons in supersymmetric models and fermiophobic
scenario have been investigated. No significant excess over the Standard Model
(SM) expectations have been observed and accordingly limits have been
established on the corresponding model parameters.
