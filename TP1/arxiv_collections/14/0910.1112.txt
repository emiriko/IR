After the work of Rindler and Ishak, it is now well established that the
bending of light is influenced by the cosmological constant {\Lambda} appearing
in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. We show that their method, when
applied to the galactic halo gravity parametrized by a constant {\gamma},
yields exactly the same {\gamma}- correction to Schwarzschild bending as
obtained by standard methods. Different cases are analyzed, which include some
corrections to the special cases considered in the original paper by Rindler
and Ishak.
