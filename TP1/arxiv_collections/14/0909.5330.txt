We explore the LHC phenomenology of an extension of warped higgsless models.
The model is supersymmetric in the bulk and on the IR brane as introduced in
[arXiv:0805.1379], corresponding to an emergence of a supersymmetric spectrum
in the composite sector of the higgsless model. In particular, the lightest
neutralino is rendered stable by an R parity and serves as a realistic cold
dark matter candidate. The observation of missing energy signals at the LHC
from LSP and NLSP production in association with third generation quarks is
discussed based on simulations using WHIZARD.
