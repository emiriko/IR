Ferromagnetic resonance in conducting magnetic bilayers was studied using
microstrip transducers. It was found that excitation or suppression of standing
spin waves could be achieved through enhanced inhomogeneity of eddy currents in
the bilayer caused by finite thickness. This effect is observable in films with
thicknesses below the magnetic skin depth and can be used to study standing
spin wave modes in heterostructures.
