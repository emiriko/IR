Recently, a substantial amount of debate has grown up around a proposed
quantum resolution to the `arrow of time dilemma' that is based on the role of
classical memory records of entropy-decreasing events. In this note we show
that the argument is incomplete and furthermore, by providing a
counter-example, argue that it is incorrect. Instead of quantum mechanics
providing a resolution in the manner suggested, it allows enhanced classical
memory records of entropy-decreasing events.
