In magnetic systems with reduced dimensionality, the effects of dipolar
interactions allow the existence of long-range ordered phases. Long-range
magnetic-dipolar interactions are at the heart of the explanation of many
peculiar phenomena observed in nuclear magnetic resonance, ferromagnetic
resonance, and Bose-Einstein-condensate structures. In this paper we show that
magnetic-dipolar-modes (MDMs) in quasi-2D ferrite disks are characterized by
symmetry breaking effects. Our analysis is based on postulates about a physical
meaning of the magnetostatic-potential function as a complex scalar wave
function, which presumes the long-range phase correlations. An important
feature of the MDM oscillations in a ferrite disk concerns the fact that a
structure with symmetric parameters and symmetric basic equations goes into
eigenstates that are not space-time symmetric. The proper solutions are found
based on an analysis of magnetostatic-wave propagation in a helical coordinate
system. For a ferrite disk, we show that while a composition of two helical
waves may acquire a geometrical phase over-running of during a period, every
separate helical wave has a dynamical phase over-running of and so behaves as a
double-valued function. We demonstrate that unique topological structures of
the fields in a ferrite disk are intimately related to the symmetry breaking
properties of MDM oscillations. The solutions give the MDM power-flow-density
vortices with cores at the disk center and azimuthally running waves of
magnetization. One can expect that the proposed models of long-range ordered
phases and space-time violation properties of magnetic-dipolar interactions can
be used in other magnetic structures, different from the
ferromagnetic-resonance system with reduced dimensionality.
