We present a comprehensive phenomenological analysis of the allowed hybrid
textures of neutrinos. Out of a total of sixty hybrid textures with one
equality between the elements of neutrino mass matrix and one texture zero only
twenty three are found to be viable at 99% C.L. whereas the earlier analysis
found fifty four to be viable. We examine the phenomenological implications of
the allowed hybrid textures including Majorana type CP-violating phases, 1-3
mixing angle and Dirac type CP-violating phase, $\delta$. We, also, obtain
lower bound on effective Majorana mass for all the allowed hybrid textures.
