We study the potential to observe CP-violating effects in SUSY cascade decay
chains at the LHC. We consider squark and gluino production followed by
subsequent decays into neutralinos with a three-body leptonic decay in the
final step. Asymmetries composed by triple products of momenta of the final
state particles are sensitive to CP-violating effects. Due to large boosts
these asymmetries can be difficult to observe at a hadron collider. We show
that using all available kinematic information one can reconstruct the decay
chains on an event-by-event basis even in the case of 3-body decays, neutrinos
and LSPs in the final state. We also discuss the most important experimental
effects like major backgrounds and momentum smearing due to finite detector
resolution. We show that with 300 fb$^{-1}$ of collected data, CP violation may
be discovered at the LHC for a wide range of the phase of the bino mass
parameter $M_1$.
