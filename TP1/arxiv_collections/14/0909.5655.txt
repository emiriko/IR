We have studied the formation of Hall-qubit (LLL state) in Quantum Hall
effect due to the Aharonov-Bhom oscillation of quasiparticles.The spin echo
method plays the key role in the topological entanglement of qubits. The proper
ratio of fluxes for maximally entangling qubits has also been pointed out. The
generation of higher Quantum Hall state may be possible with the help of
quantum teleportation.
