We investigate diffractive events in hadron-hadron collisions, in which two
jets are produced and separated by a large rapidity gap. Using a
renormalisation-group improved NLL kernel implemented in the HERWIG Monte Carlo
program, we show that the BFKL predictions are in good agreement with the
Tevatron data, and present predictions which could be tested at the LHC.
