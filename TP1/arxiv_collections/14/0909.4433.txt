We present a thorough analysis of the effects of the tensor interaction on
the multipole response of magic nuclei, using the fully self-consistent Random
Phase Approximation (RPA) model with Skyrme interactions. We disentangle the
modifications to the static mean field induced by the tensor terms, and the
specific features of the residual particle-hole (p-h) tensor interaction, for
quadrupole (2+), octupole (3-), and also magnetic dipole (1+) responses. It is
pointed out that the tensor force has a larger effect on the magnetic dipole
states than on the natural parity states 2+ and 3-, especially at the mean
field level. Perspectives for a better assessment of the tensor force
parameters are eventually discussed.
