Spin-one color superconductor is a viable candidate phase of dense matter in
the interiors of compact stars. Its low-energy excitations will influence the
transport properties of such matter and thus have impact on late-stage
evolution of neutron stars. It also provides a good example of spontaneous
symmetry breaking with rich breaking patterns. In this contribution, we
reanalyze the phase diagram of a spin-one color superconductor and point out
that a part of it is occupied by noninert states, which have been neglected in
literature so far. We classify the collective Nambu--Goldstone modes, which are
essential to the transport phenomena.
