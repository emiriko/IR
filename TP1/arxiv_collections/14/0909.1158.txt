The dynamics of an initially localized Anderson mode is studied in the
framework of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation in the presence of disorder.
It is shown that the dynamics can be described in the framework of the
Liouville operator. An analytical expression for a wave function of the initial
time dynamics is found by a perturbation approach. As follows from a
perturbative solution the initially localized wave function remains localized.
At asymptotically large times the dynamics can be described qualitatively in
the framework of a phenomenological probabilistic approach by means of a
probability distribution function. It is shown that the probability
distribution function may be governed by the fractional Fokker-Planck equation
and corresponds to subdiffusion.
