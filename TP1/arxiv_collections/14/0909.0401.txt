Shear-induced cross-correlations of particle fluctuations perpendicular and
along stream-lines are investigated experimentally and theoretically. Direct
measurements of the Brownian motion of micron-sized beads, held by optical
tweezers in a shear-flow cell, show a strong time-asymmetry in the
cross-correlation, which is caused by the non-normal amplification of
fluctuations. Complementary measurements on the single particle probability
distribution substantiate this behavior and both results are consistent with a
Langevin model. In addition, a shear-induced anti-correlation between
orthogonal random-displacements of two trapped and hydrodynamically interacting
particles is detected, having one or two extrema in time, depending on the
positions of the particles.
