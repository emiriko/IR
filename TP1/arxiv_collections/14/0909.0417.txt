Using a combination of neutron, muon and synchrotron techniques we show how
the magnetic state in NaFeAs can be tuned into superconductivity by replacing
Fe by either Co or Ni. Electron count is the dominant factor, since Ni-doping
has double the effect of Co-doping for the same doping level. We follow the
structural, magnetic and superconducting properties as a function of doping to
show how the superconducting state evolves, concluding that the addition of 0.1
electrons per Fe atom is sufficient to traverse the superconducting domain, and
that magnetic order coexists with superconductivity at doping levels less than
0.025 electrons per Fe atom.
