Differential cross sections for eta photoproduction off protons have been
measured at E_gamma = 1.6 - 2.4 GeV in the backward direction. A bump structure
has been observed above 2.0 GeV in the total energy. No such bump is observed
in cross sections for eta', omega and pi0 photoproductions. It is inferred that
this unique structure in eta photoproduction is due to a baryon resonance with
a large portion of ss-bar strongly coupled to the etaN channel.
