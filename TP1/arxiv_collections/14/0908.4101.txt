We define a family of four-point invariants for Shilov boundaries of bounded
symmetric domains of tube type, which generalizes the classical four-point
cross ratio on the unit circle. This generalization, which is based on a
similar construction of Clerc and {\O}rsted, is functorial and well-behaved
under products; these two properties determine our extension uniquely. Our
generalized cross ratios can be used to estimate translation lengths of a large
class of isometries of the underlying bounded symmetric domain. Our main
application concerns maximal representations of surface groups with Hermitian
target. For any such representation we can construct a strict cross ratio on
the circle in the sense of Labourie via pullback of our generalized cross ratio
along a suitable limit curve. In this context our translation length estimates
then imply that maximal representations with Hermitian target are
well-displacing; this implies in particular that the action of the mapping
class group on the moduli space of maximal representations into a Hermitian Lie
group is proper.
