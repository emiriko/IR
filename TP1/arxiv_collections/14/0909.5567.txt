We identify a new kind of elementary excitations, spin-rotons, in the doped
Mott insulator. They play a central role in deciding the superconducting
transition temperature Tc, resulting in a simple Tc formula,Tc=Eg/6, with Eg as
the characteristic energy scale of the spin rotons. We show that the degenerate
S=1 and S=0 rotons can be probed by neutron scattering and Raman scattering
measurements, respectively, in good agreement with the magnetic resonancelike
mode and the Raman A1g mode observed in the high-Tc cuprates.
