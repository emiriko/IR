The paper CERN-PH-EP-2009-015 (arXiv:0903.4762) by A. Bagulya et al. violates
standards of quality of work and scientific ethics on several counts. The paper
contains assertions that contradict established detector physics. The paper
falls short of proving the correctness of the authors' concepts and results.
The paper ignores or quotes misleadingly pertinent published work. The paper
ignores the fact that the authors' concepts and results have already been shown
wrong in the published literature. The authors seem unaware that cross-section
results from the 'HARP Collaboration' that are based on the paper's concepts
and algorithms are in gross disagreement with the results of a second analysis
of the same data, and with the results of other experiments.
