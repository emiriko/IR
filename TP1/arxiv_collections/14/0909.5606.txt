A systematic connection between QCD and nuclear few- and many-body properties
in the form of the Effective Field Theory "without pions" is applied to $A\le
6$ nuclei to determine its range of applicability. We present results at
next-to-leading order for the Tjon correlation and for a correlation between
the singlet S-wave $^3$He-neutron scattering length and the triton binding
energy. In the A=6 sector we performed leading order calculations for the
binding energy and the charge and matter radii of the halo nucleus $^6$He. Also
at leading order, the doublet S-wave 4-He-neutron phase shifts are compared
with R-matrix data. These analysis provide evidence for a sufficiently fast
convergence of the effective field theory, in particular, our results in $A\le
4$ predict an expansion parameter of about 1/3, and they converge to data
within the predicted uncertainty band at this order. A properly adjusted
three-body contact force which we include together with the Coulomb interaction
in all calculations is found to correctly renormalize the pion-less theory at
leading- and next-to-leading order, i.e. the power counting does not require
four-body forces at the respective order.
