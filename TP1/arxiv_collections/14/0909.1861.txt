It is often said that in general relativity time does not exist. This is
because the Einstein equations generate motion in time that is a symmetry of
the theory, not true time evolution. In quantum gravity, the timelessness of
general relativity clashes with time in quantum theory and leads to the
``problem of time'' which, in its various forms, is the main obstacle to a
successful quantum theory of gravity. I argue that the problem of time is a
paradox, stemming from an unstated faulty premise. Our faulty assumption is
that space is real. I propose that what does not fundamentally exist is not
time but space, geometry and gravity. The quantum theory of gravity will be
spaceless, not timeless. If we are willing to throw out space, we can keep time
and the trade is worth it.
