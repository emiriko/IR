The local quasiparticle density of states in the current-carrying d-wave
superconducting structures was studied theoretically. The density of states can
be accessed through the conductance of the scanning tunnelling microscope. Two
particular situations were considered: the current state of the homogeneous
film and the weak link between two current-carrying d-wave superconductors.
