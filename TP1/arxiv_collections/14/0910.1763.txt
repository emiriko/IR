This article formalizes an abstraction of input/output relations, based on
parameterized zonotopes, which we call affine sets. We describe the abstract
transfer functions and prove their correctness, which allows the generation of
accurate numerical invariants. Other applications range from compositional
reasoning to proofs of user-defined complex invariants and test case
generation.
