We propose a novel method for constructing Hilbert transform (HT) pairs of
wavelet bases based on a fundamental approximation-theoretic characterization
of scaling functions--the B-spline factorization theorem. In particular,
starting from well-localized scaling functions, we construct HT pairs of
biorthogonal wavelet bases of L^2(R) by relating the corresponding wavelet
filters via a discrete form of the continuous HT filter. As a concrete
application of this methodology, we identify HT pairs of spline wavelets of a
specific flavor, which are then combined to realize a family of complex
wavelets that resemble the optimally-localized Gabor function for sufficiently
large orders.
  Analytic wavelets, derived from the complexification of HT wavelet pairs,
exhibit a one-sided spectrum. Based on the tensor-product of such analytic
wavelets, and, in effect, by appropriately combining four separable
biorthogonal wavelet bases of L^2(R^2), we then discuss a methodology for
constructing 2D directional-selective complex wavelets. In particular,
analogous to the HT correspondence between the components of the 1D
counterpart, we relate the real and imaginary components of these complex
wavelets using a multi-dimensional extension of the HT--the directional HT.
Next, we construct a family of complex spline wavelets that resemble the
directional Gabor functions proposed by Daugman. Finally, we present an
efficient FFT-based filterbank algorithm for implementing the associated
complex wavelet transform.
