User experience (UX) evaluation is gaining increased interest lately, both
from academia and industry. In this paper we argue that UX evaluation needs to
fulfill two important requirements: scalability, i.e. the ability to provide
useful feedback in different stages of the design, and diversity, i.e. the
ability to reflect the di-versity of opinions that may exist in different
users. We promote the use of the Repertory Grid Technique as a promising UX
evaluation technique and discuss some of our concerns regarding the
quantitative side of its use.
