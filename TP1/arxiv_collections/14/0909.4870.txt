We have investigated and experimentally proved the robustness of the Bloch
vector for one-dimensional, nonlinear, finite, dissipative systems. The case
studied is the second harmonic generation from metallo-dielectric filters.
Nowadays metallic based nanostructures play a fundamental role in nonlinear
nano-photonics and nano-plasmonics. Our results clearly suggest that even in
these forefront fields the Bloch vector continues to play an essential role.
