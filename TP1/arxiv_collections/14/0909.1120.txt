We experimentally demonstrate thermo-optic locking of a semiconductor laser
to an integrated toroidal optical microresonator. The lock is maintained for
time periods exceeding twelve hours, without requiring any electronic control
systems. Fast control is achieved by optical feedback induced by scattering
centers within the microresonator, with thermal locking due to optical heating
maintaining constructive interference between the cavity and the laser.
Furthermore, the optical feedback acts to narrow the laser linewidth, with
ultra high quality microtoroid resonances offering the potential for ultralow
linewidth on-chip lasers.
