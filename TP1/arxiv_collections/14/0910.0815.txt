The main result of this note is an effective uniform bound for the number of
deformation types of certain nonisotrivial families of canonically polarized
manifolds. It extends the author's earlier such bound for the classical
Shafarevich Conjecture over function fields to the case of higher dimensional
fibers, but without the disadvantageous iterated use of Chow or Hilbert
varieties that was the core of the proofs in the earlier approaches.
