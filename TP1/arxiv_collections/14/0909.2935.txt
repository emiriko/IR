Let $U_q$ denote the quantum group associated with a finite dimensional
semisimple Lie algebra. Assume that $q$ is a complex root of unity of odd order
and that $U_q$ is %the quantum group version obtained via Lusztig's $q$-divided
powers construction. We prove that all regular projective (tilting) modules for
$U_q$ are rigid, i.e., have identical radical and socle filtrations. Moreover,
we obtain the same for a large class of Weyl modules for $U_q$. On the other
hand, we give examples of non-rigid indecomposable tilting modules as well as
non-rigid Weyl modules. These examples are for type $B_2$ and in this case as
well as for type $A_2$ we calculate explicitly the Loewy structure for all
regular Weyl modules.
  We also demonstrate that these results carry over to the modular case when
the highest weights in question are in the so-called Jantzen region. At the
same time we show by examples that as soon as we leave this region non-rigid
tilting modules do occur.
