In the framework of the modern theory of polarization, we rigorously
establish the microscopic nature of the electric displacement field D. In
particular, we show that the longitudinal component of D is preserved at a
coherent and insulating interface. To motivate and elucidate our derivation, we
use the example of LAO/STO interfaces and superlattices, where the validity of
the above conservation law is not immediately obvious. Our results generalize
the "locality principle" of constrained-D density functional theory to the
first-principles modeling of charge-mismatched systems.
