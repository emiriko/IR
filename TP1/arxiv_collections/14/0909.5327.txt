We provide the first theoretical study of a novel variable, $a_T$, proposed
in Ref.[1] as a more accurate probe of the region of low transverse momentum
$p_T$, for the $Z$ boson $p_T$ distribution at hadron colliders. The $a_T$ is
the component of $p_T$ transverse to a suitably defined axis. Our study
involves resummation of large logarithms in $a_T$ up to the next-to--leading
logarithmic accuracy and we compare the results to those for the well-known
$p_T$ distribution, identifying important physical differences between the two
cases. We also test our resummed result at the two-loop level by comparing its
expansion to order $\alpha_s^2$ with the corresponding fixed-order results and
find agreement with our expectations.
