We discuss on the electromagnetic response of a polycrystalline sample of
LaO_0.94F_0.06FeAs exposed to DC magnetic fields up to 10 kOe. The low- and
high-frequency responses have been investigated by measuring the AC
susceptibility at 100 kHz and the microwave surface resistance at 9.6 GHz. At
low as well as high DC magnetic fields, the susceptibility strongly depends on
the amplitude of the AC driving field, highlighting enhanced nonlinear effects.
The field dependence of the AC susceptibility exhibits a magnetic hysteresis
that can be justified considering the intragrain-field-penetration effects on
the intergrain critical current density. The microwave surface resistance
exhibits a clockwise magnetic hysteresis, which cannot be justified in the
framework of the critical-state models of the Abrikosov-fluxon lattice; it may
have the same origin as that detected in the susceptibility.
