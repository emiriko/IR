Inelastic neutron scattering and susceptibility measurements have been
performed on the optimally-doped Fe-based superconductor FeTe(0.5)Se(0.5),
which has a critical temperature, Tc of 14 K. The magnetic scattering at the
stripe antiferromagnetic wave-vector Q = (0.5,0.5) exhibits a "resonance" at ~
6 meV, where the scattering intensity increases abruptly when cooled below Tc.
In a 7-T magnetic field parallel to the a-b plane, Tc is slightly reduced to ~
12 K, based on susceptibility measurements. The resonance in the neutron
scattering measurements is also affected by the field. The resonance intensity
under field cooling starts to rise at a lower temperature ~ 12 K, and the low
temperature intensity is also reduced from the zero-field value. Our results
provide clear evidence for the intimate relationship between superconductivity
and the resonance measured in magnetic excitations of Fe-based superconductors.
