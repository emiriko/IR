We propose a technique for design of quantum Fourier transforms, and ensuing
quantum algorithms, in a single interaction step by engineered Hamiltonians of
circulant symmetry. The method uses adiabatic evolution and is robust against
fluctuations of the interaction parameters as long as the Hamiltonian retains a
circulant symmetry.
