According to our modal-Hamiltonian interpretation (MHI) of quantum mechanics,
the Hamiltonian of the closed system defines the set of its definite-valued
observables. This definition seems to be incompatible with the pointer basis
selected by the environment-induced decoherence (EID) of the open system. In
this paper we argue that decoherence can be understood from a closed system
perspective which (i) shows that the incompatibility between MHI and EID is
only apparent, and (ii) solves certain conceptual challenges that the EID
program still has to face.
