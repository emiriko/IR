Electromagnetic properties of hadrons can be computed by lattice simulations
of QCD in background fields. We demonstrate new techniques for the
investigation of charged hadron properties in electric fields. Our current
calculations employ large electric fields, motivating us to analyze chiral
dynamics in strong QED backgrounds, and subsequently uncover surprising
non-perturbative effects present at finite volume.
