In this paper we study the magnetic susceptibility and other thermodynamic
properties of the polarized nuclear matter at finite temperature using the
lowest order constrained variational (LOCV) method employing the $AV_{18}$
potential. Our results show a monotonic behavior for the magnetic
susceptibility which indicates that the spontaneous transition to the
ferromagnetic phase does not occur for this system.
