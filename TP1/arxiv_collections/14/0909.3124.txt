We present a technique to calculate the spin relaxation of hot electrons
during their energy thermalization in the Gamma-valley of zinc-blende
semiconductors. The results of this model match recent experimental data and
they can be used to check the applicability of spin related boundary conditions
across a semiconductor/ferromagnet junction in reverse bias conditions (spin
injection).
