We investigate the consequences of replacing the continuous flavour symmetry
of minimal flavour violation by a discrete group. Goldstone bosons, resulting
from the breaking of the continuous flavour symmetry, generically lead to
bounds on new flavour structure by many orders of magnitude above the
TeV-scale. The absence of Goldstone bosons for discrete symmetries constitutes
the primary motivation of our work. The four crystal-like groups Sigma(168),
Sigma(72phi), Sigma(216phi) and Sigma(360phi)$ provide enough protection for a
discrete TeV-scale MFV scenario in the case where Delta F = 2 processes are
generated by two subsequent Delta F = 1 transitions.
