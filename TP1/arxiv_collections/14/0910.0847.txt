The ATLAS pixel detector is the innermost detector of the ATLAS experiment at
the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. With approximately 80 million readout
channels, the ATLAS silicon pixel detector is a high-acceptance,
high-resolution, low-noise tracking device. Providing the desired refinement in
charged track pattern recognition capability in order to meet the stringent
track reconstruction requirements, the pixel detector largely defines the
ability of ATLAS to effectively resolve primary and secondary vertices and
perform efficient flavor tagging essential for discovery of new physics.
  Being the last sub-system installed in ATLAS by July 2007, the pixel detector
was successfully connected, commissioned, and tested in situ while meeting an
extremely tight schedule, and was ready to take data upon the projected turn-on
of the LHC. Since fall 2008, the pixel detector has been included in the
combined ATLAS detector operation, collecting cosmic muon data. Details from
the pixel detector installation and commissioning, as well as details on
calibration procedures and the results obtained with collected cosmic data, are
presented along with a summary of the detector status.
