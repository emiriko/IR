In this study, the quantum state depression (QSD) in semiconductor quantum
well (QW) is investigated. The QSD emerge from the ridged geometry of the QW
boundary. Ridges impose additional boundary conditions on the electron wave
function and some quantum states become forbidden. State density reduces in all
energy bands, including conduction band (CB). Hence, electrons, rejected from
the filled bands, must occupy quantum states in the empty bands due to Pauli
Exclusion principle. Both the electron concentration in CB and Fermi energy
increases as in the case of donor doping. Since quantum state density is
reduced, the ridged quantum well (RQW) exhibits quantum properties at widths
approaching 200 nm. Wide RQW can be used to improve photon confinement in
QW-based optoelectronics devices. Reduction in the state density increases the
carrier mobility and makes the ballistic transport regime more pronounced in
the semiconductor QW devices. Furthermore, the QSD doping does not introduce
scattering centers and can be used for power electronics.
