Here we consider the possibility that the Fermi arcs observed in ARPES
experiments result from interaction of valence band electrons with negative-U
centers (NUCs) which are formed under doping on the pairs of neighboring Cu
cations in CuO2 plane. This interaction results in two-particle hybridization
and vanishing of the gap over the part of Fermi contour. Furthermore the
transitions of electrons to NUCs result in the generation of free hole
carriers. Just these carriers rather than doping induced charges provide
conduction in the normal state.
