Hypercomputation is a relatively new branch of computer science that emerged
from the idea that the Church--Turing Thesis, which is supposed to describe
what is computable and what is noncomputable, cannot possible be true. Because
of its apparent validity, the Church--Turing Thesis has been used to
investigate the possible limits of intelligence of any imaginable life form,
and, consequently, the limits of information processing, since living beings
are, among others, information processors. However, in the light of
hypercomputation, which seems to be feasibly in our universe, one cannot impose
arbitrary limits to what intelligence can achieve unless there are specific
physical laws that prohibit the realization of something. In addition,
hypercomputation allows us to ponder about aspects of communication between
intelligent beings that have not been considered before
