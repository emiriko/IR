We have determined the CMB temperature, $T(z)$, at redshifts in the range
0.023-0.546, from multi-frequency measurements of the S-Z effect towards 13
clusters. We extract the parameter $\alpha$ in the redshift scaling
$T(z)=T_{0}(1+z)^{1-\alpha}$, which contrasts the prediction of the standard
model ($\alpha=0$) with that in non-adiabatic evolution conjectured in some
alternative cosmological models. The statistical analysis is based on two main
approaches: using ratios of the S-Z intensity change, $\Delta I$, thus taking
advantage of the weak dependence of the ratios on IC gas properties, and using
directly the $\Delta I$ measurements. In the former method dependence on the
Thomson optical depth and gas temperature is only second order in these
quantities. In the second method we marginalize over these quantities which
appear to first order in the intensity change. The marginalization itself is
done in two ways - by direct integrations, and by a Monte Carlo Markov Chain
approach. Employing these different methods we obtain two sets of results that
are consistent with $\alpha=0$, in agreement with the prediction of the
standard model.
