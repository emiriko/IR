Because the TeV-scale to be probed at the Large Hadron Collider should shed
light on the naturalness, hierarchy, and dark matter problems, most searches to
date have focused on new physics signatures motivated by possible solutions to
these puzzles. In this paper, we consider some candidates for new states that
although not well-motivated from this standpoint are obvious possibilities that
current search strategies would miss. In particular we consider vector
representations of fermions in multiplets of $SU(2)_L$ with a lightest neutral
state. Standard search strategies would fail to find such particles because of
the expected small one-loop-level splitting between charged and neutral states.
