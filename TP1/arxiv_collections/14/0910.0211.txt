This is not a new result. Purpose of this work is to describe a method to
search the analytical expression of the general real solution of the
two-dimensional Laplace differential equation. This thing is not easy to find
in scientific literature and, if present, often it is justified with the
assertion that an arbitrary analytic complex function is a solution of Laplace
equation, so introducing the condition of complex-differentiability which is
not really necessary for the existence of a real solution. The question of the
knowledge of real exact solutions to Laplace equation is of great importance in
science and engineering.
