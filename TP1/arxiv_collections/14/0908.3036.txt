Time-resolved Raman spectroscopy has been applied to probe the anharmonic
coupling and electron-phonon interaction of optical phonons in graphite. From
the decay of the transient anti-Stokes scattering of the G-mode following
ultrafast excitation, we measured a lifetime of 2.2+/-0.1ps for zone-center
optical phonons. We also observed a transient stiffening of G-mode phonons, an
effect attributed to the reduction of the electron-phonon coupling for high
electronic temperatures.
