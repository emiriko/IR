The possibility that QED and recently developed non-Hermitian, or magnetic,
versions of QED are equivalent is considered. Under this duality the
Hamiltonians and anomalous axial currents of the two theories are identified. A
consequence of such a duality is that particles described by QED carry magnetic
as well as electric charges. The proposal requires a vanishing zero bare
fermion mass in both theories; Dirac mass terms are incompatible with the
conservation of magnetic charge much as Majorana masses spoil the conservation
of electric charge. The physical spectrum comprises photons and massless
spin-1/2 particles carrying equal or opposite electric and magnetic charges.
The four particle states described by the Dirac fermion correspond to the four
possible charge assignments of elementary dyons. This scale invariant spectrum
indicates that the quantum field theory is finite. The Johnson Baker Willey
eigenvalue equation for the fine structure constant in finite spinor QED is
interpreted as a Dirac-like charge quantisation condition for dyons.
