The AdS/CFT correspondence provides a new perspective on recurrent questions
in General Relativity such as the allowed boundary conditions at infinity and
the definition of gravitational conserved charges. Here we review the main
insights obtained in this direction over the last decade and apply the new
techniques to Topologically Massive Gravity. We show that this theory is dual
to a non-unitary CFT for any value of its parameter mu and becomes a
Logarithmic CFT at mu = 1.
