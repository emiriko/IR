Using a sample of 122 million Upsilon(3S) decays collected with the BaBar
detector at the PEP-II asymmetric energy collider at the SLAC National
Accelerator Laboratory, we measure the ratio
R_taumu=BR(Upsilon(1S)->tau^+tau^-)/BR(Upsilon(1S)->mu^+mu^-); the measurement
is intended as a test of lepton universality and as a possible search for a
light pseudoscalar Higgs boson in Next to Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(NMSSM) scenarios. Such a boson could appear in a deviation of the ratio
R_taumu from the Standard Model expectation, that is 1, except for small lepton
mass corrections. The analysis exploits the decays Upsilon(3S) -> Upsilon(1S)
pi^+pi^-, Upsilon(1S) -> l^+l^-, where l = mu, tau.
