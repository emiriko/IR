We study three-dimensional massive gravity formulated as a theory with two
dynamical metrics, like the f-g theories of Isham-Salam and Strathdee. The
action is parity preserving and has no higher derivative terms. The spectrum
contains a single massive graviton. This theory has several features discussed
recently in TMG and NMG. We find warped black holes, a critical point, and
generalized Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions.
