Electron transport properties of a non-interacting mesoscopic ring sandwiched
between two metallic electrodes are investigated by the use of Green's function
formalism. We introduce a parametric approach based on the tight-binding model
to study the transport properties. The electronic transport characteristics are
investigated in three aspects: (a) ring-electrode interface geometry, (b)
coupling strength of the ring to the electrodes and (c) magnetic flux threaded
by the ring.
