Adiabatic quantum optimization has attracted a lot of attention because small
scale simulations gave hope that it would allow to solve NP-complete problems
efficiently. Later, negative results proved the existence of specifically
designed hard instances where adiabatic optimization requires exponential time.
In spite of this, there was still hope that this would not happen for random
instances of NP-complete problems. This is an important issue since random
instances are a good model for hard instances that can not be solved by current
classical solvers, for which an efficient quantum algorithm would therefore be
desirable. Here, we will show that because of a phenomenon similar to Anderson
localization, an exponentially small eigenvalue gap appears in the spectrum of
the adiabatic Hamiltonian for large random instances, very close to the end of
the algorithm. This implies that unfortunately, adiabatic quantum optimization
also fails for these instances by getting stuck in a local minimum, unless the
computation is exponentially long.
