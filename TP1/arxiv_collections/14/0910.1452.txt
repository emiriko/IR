The Savage-Dickey ratio is known as a specialised representation of the Bayes
factor (O'Hagan and Forster, 2004) that allows for a functional plugging
approximation of this quantity. We demonstrate here that the Savage-Dickey
representation is in fact a generic representation of the Bayes factor that
relies on specific measure-theoretic versions of the densities involved in the
ratio, instead of a special identity imposing the above constraints on the
prior distributions. We completely clarify the measure-theoretic foundations of
the representation as well as the generalisation of Verdinelli and Wasserman
(1995) and propose a comparison of this new approximation with their version,
as well as with bridge sampling and Chib's approaches.
