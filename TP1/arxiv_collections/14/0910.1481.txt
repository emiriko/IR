FCNC processes are expected to offer us a deep insight into the physics at
very short distance scales. We present a list of 20 goals in quark and lepton
flavour physics that could be reached already in the next decade. This list
includes also flavour conserving observables like electric dipole moments of
the neutron and leptons and (g-2)_\mu. Subsequently we will present some
aspects of these goals by concentrating on supersymmetric flavour models. A
much more extensive presentation of this material can be found in my recent
EPS09 talk.
