The MEG experiment is designed to search the Lepton Flavor Violating process
$\mu \to e^+\gamma$ \cite{mori-1999,meg2007-baldini}. This search requires a
high intensity muon beam stopping in a thin target with the maximum rate
compatible with the background from combinatorial events.
  The events are analyzed by a high resolution and fast liquid xenon
calorimeter and by a spectrometer composed by an array of ultra-light drift
chambers (DCH) for momentum measurement and a double layered timing counter
(TC) for measuring the $e^+$ time.
  The design parameters and performance of the spectrometer during the 2008
physics run are described.
