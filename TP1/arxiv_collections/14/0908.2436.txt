We study the transformation into a baryon asymmetry of a charge initially
stored in a complex (waterfall) scalar field at the end of a hybrid inflation
phase as described in Ref[1]. The waterfall field is coupled to right-handed
neutrinos, and is also responsible for their Majorana masses. The charge is
finally transferred to the leptons of the Standard Model through the decay of
the right-handed neutrinos without introducing new CP violating interactions.
Other needed processes, like the decay of the inflaton field and the reheating
of the Universe are also discussed in detail.
