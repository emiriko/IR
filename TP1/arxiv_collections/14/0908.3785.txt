A general method for tight focusing of waves, based on compensation of the
angular spectrum, is established. We apply the method to monochromatic,
polychromatic and diffusive waves. Diffusive and monochromatic waves may form
spatially localized waves in free space, whereas polychromatic waves form light
sheets or non-decaying traveling evanescent modes confined to subwavelength
regions in media where the frequency depends on the wave vector. We suggest an
analogy between our compensation method and the transformation of frequencies
between inertial, relativistic coordinate systems.
