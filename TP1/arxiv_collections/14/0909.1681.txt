A good correlation between the growth rate of the cave speleothems and the
annual precipitation at the cave site allow quantitative reconstruction of the
precipitation. Measuring the growth rate of a speleothem from Duhlata Cave,
Bulgaria we found that around 7500 B.P. the speleothem growth rate (averaged
for 120 years) exceeds 53 times its recent value suggesting that enormous
precipitation flooded the Black Sea basin at that time. Its possible connection
with the Bible (Noahs) Flood is discussed. We propose a possible mechanism of
the flooding of the Black Sea during the Flood involving production of a super-
Tsunami by pushing of the Black Sea water towards the Crimea cost by
Mediterranean waters. We propose also an Astronomical Theory of the origin of
the Bible Flood. We attribute higher water evaporation and rainfall to be
caused by rapid increasing of the solar radiation resulting from a collision of
a large asteroid or comet with the Sun.
