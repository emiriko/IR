Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations of pure SU(2)xU(1) lattice gauge theory
show a (zero temperature) deconfining phase transition in the SU(2) gluon
sector when a term is added to the SU(2) and U(1) Wilson actions, which
requires joint U(2) gauge transformations of the SU(2) and U(1) vector fields.
Investigations of this deconfined phase are of interest as it could provide an
alternative to the Higgs mechanism.
