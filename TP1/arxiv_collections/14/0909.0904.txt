In this work we discuss a theory for entanglement generation,
characterization and detection in fermionic two-particle interferometers at
finite temperature. The motivation for our work is provided by the recent
experiment by the Heiblum group, Neder et al, Nature 448, 333 (2007), realizing
the two particle interferometer proposed by Samuelsson, Sukhorukov, and
Buttiker, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 026805 (2004). The experiment displayed a clear
two-particle Aharonov-Bohm effect, however with an amplitude suppressed due to
finite temperature and dephasing. This raised qualitative as well quantitative
questions about entanglement production and detection in mesoscopic conductors
at finite temperature. As a response to these questions, in our recent work,
Samuelsson, Neder, and Buttiker, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 106804 (2009) we
presented a general theory for finite temperature entanglement in mesoscopic
conductors. Applied to the two-particle interferometer we showed that the
emitted two-particle state in the experiment was clearly entangled. Moreover,
we demonstrated that the entanglement of the reduced two-particle state,
reconstructed from measurements of average currents and current cross
correlations, constitutes a lower bound to the entanglement of the emitted
state. The present work provides an extended and more detailed discussion of
these findings.
