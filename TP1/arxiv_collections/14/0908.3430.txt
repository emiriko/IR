This is the second installment to the project initiated in [Ma3]. In the
first Part, I argued that both philosophy and technique of the perturbative
renormalization in quantum field theory could be meaningfully transplanted to
the theory of computation, and sketched several contexts supporting this view.
  In this second part, I address some of the issues raised in [Ma3] and provide
their development in three contexts: a categorification of the algorithmic
computations; time cut--off and Anytime Algorithms; and finally, a Hopf algebra
renormalization of the Halting Problem.
