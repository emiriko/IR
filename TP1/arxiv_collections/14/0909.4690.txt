In this article we study compact K\"ahler manifolds $X$ admitting
non-singular holomorphic vector fields with the aim of extending to this
setting the classical birational classification of projective varieties with
tangent vector fields. We prove that any such a K\"ahler manifold $X$ admits an
arbitrarily small deformation of a particular type which is a suspension over a
torus; that is, a quotient of $F\times \mbb C^s$ fibering over a torus $T=\mbb
C^s/\Lambda$. We derive some results dealing with the structure of such
manifolds. In particular, we prove an extension of Calabi's theorem describing
the structure of compact K\"ahler manifolds with $c_1(X)=0$ to general K\"ahler
manifolds with non-vanishing vector fields. A complete classification when $X$
is a projective manifold or when $\dim X\leq s+2$ is also given. As an
application, it is shown that the study of the dynamics of holomorphic tangent
fields on compact K\"ahler manifolds reduces to the case of rational manifolds.
