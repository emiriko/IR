We consider the gravity dual of strongly coupled system at a Lifshitz-fixed
point and finite temperature, which was constructed in a recent work
arXiv:0909.0263. We construct an Abelian Higgs model in that background and
calculate condensation and conductivity using holographic techniques. We find
that condensation happens and DC conductivity blows up when temperature turns
below a critical value.
