We study the hydrogen storage properties of planar boron sheets and compare
them to those of graphene. The binding of molecular hydrogen to the boron sheet
(0.05 eV) is stronger than that to graphene. We find that dispersion of alkali
metal (AM = Li, Na, and K) atoms onto the boron sheet markedly increases
hydrogen binding energies and storage capacities. The unique structure of the
boron sheet presents a template for creating a stable lattice of strongly
bonded metal atoms with a large nearest neighbor distance. In contrast, AM
atoms dispersed on graphene tend to cluster to form a bulk metal. In particular
the boron-Li system is found to be a good candidate for hydrogen storage
purposes. In the fully loaded case this compound can contain up to 10.7 wt. %
molecular hydrogen with an average binding energy of 0.15 eV/H2.
