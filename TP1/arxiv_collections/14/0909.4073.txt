We address the asymptotic and approximate distributions of a large class of
test statistics with quadratic forms used in association studies. The
statistics of interest do not necessarily follow a chi-square distribution and
take the general form $D=X^T A X$, where $X$ follows the multivariate normal
distribution, and $A$ is a general similarity matrix which may or may not be
positive semi-definite. We show that $D$ can be written as a linear combination
of independent chi-square random variables, whose distribution can be
approximated by a chi-square or the difference of two chi-square distributions.
In the setting of association testing, our methods are especially useful in two
situations. First, for a genome screen, the required significance level is much
smaller than 0.05 due to multiple comparisons, and estimation of p-values using
permutation procedures is particularly challenging. An efficient and accurate
estimation procedure would therefore be useful. Second, in a candidate gene
study based on haplotypes when phase is unknown a computationally expensive
method-the EM algorithm-is usually required to infer haplotype frequencies.
Because the EM algorithm is needed for each permutation, this results in a
substantial computational burden, which can be eliminated with our mathematical
solution. We assess the practical utility of our method using extensive
simulation studies based on two example statistics and apply it to find the
sample size needed for a typical candidate gene association study when phase
information is not available. Our method can be applied to any quadratic form
statistic and therefore should be of general interest.
