We prove that a smooth complex projective threefold with a K\"ahler metric of
negative holomorphic sectional curvature has ample canonical line bundle. In
dimensions greater than three, we prove that, under equal assumptions, the nef
dimension of the canonical line bundle is maximal. With certain additional
assumptions, ampleness is again obtained. The methods used come from both
complex differential geometry and complex algebraic geometry.
