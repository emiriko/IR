We consider the resummation of soft gluon emission for squark and gluino
hadroproduction at next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL) accuracy in the framework
of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. We present analytical results for
squark-squark and squark-gluino production and provide numerical predictions
for all squark and gluino pair-production processes at the Tevatron and at the
LHC. The size of the soft-gluon corrections and the reduction in the scale
uncertainty are most significant for processes involving gluino production. At
the LHC, where the sensitivity to squark and gluino masses ranges up to 3 TeV,
the corrections due to NLL resummation over and above the NLO predictions can
be as high as 35% in the case of gluino-pair production, whereas at the
Tevatron, the NLL corrections are close to 40% for squark-gluino final states
with sparticle masses around 500 GeV.
