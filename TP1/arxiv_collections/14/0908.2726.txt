[Abridged] We study the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect
associated with superclusters of galaxies using the MareNostrum Universe SPH
simulation. We consider superclusters similar to the Corona Borealis
Supercluster (CrB-SC). This paper is motivated by the detection at 33GHz of a
strong temperature decrement in the CMB towards the core of this supercluster.
Multifrequency observations with VSA and MITO suggest the existence of a
thermal SZ effect component in the spectrum of this cold spot, which would
account for roughly 25% of the total observed decrement. We identify nine
regions containing superclusters similar to CrB-SC, obtain the associated SZ
maps and calculate the probability of finding such SZ signals arising from hot
gas within the supercluster. Our results show that WHIM produces a thermal SZ
effect much smaller than the observed value. Neither can summing the
contribution of small clusters and galaxy groups in the region explain the
amplitude of the SZ signal. When we take into account the actual posterior
distribution from the observations, the probability that WHIM can cause a
thermal SZ signal like the one observed is <1%, rising up to a 3.2% when the
contribution of small clusters and galaxy groups is included. If the
simulations provide a suitable description of the gas physics, then we conclude
that the thermal SZ component of the CrB spot most probably arises from an
unknown galaxy cluster along the line of sight. The simulations also show that
the kinetic SZ signal associated with the supercluster cannot provide an
explanation for the remaining 75% of the observed cold spot in CrB.
