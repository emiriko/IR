The carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen abundances and trends in the bulge are
discussed in the context of our recent analysis of these elements in an
on-going project based on near-IR spectra (Ryde et al. 2009). We obtained these
using the CRIRES spectrometer on the VLT. The formation and evolution of the
Milky Way bulge can be constrained by studying elemental abundances of bulge
stars. Due to the large and variable visual extinction in the line-of-sight
towards the bulge, an analysis in the near-IR is preferred.
