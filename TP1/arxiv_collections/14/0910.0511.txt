We present the data processing and analysis techniques we are using to
determine structural and photometric properties of galaxies in our Gemini/HST
Galaxy Cluster Project sample. The goal of this study is to understand cluster
galaxy evolution in terms of scaling relations and structural properties of
cluster galaxies at redshifts 0.15 < z < 1.0. To derive parameters such as
total magnitude, half-light radius, effective surface brightness, and Sersic n,
we fit r^{1/4} law and Sersic function 2-D surface brightness profiles to each
of the galaxies in our sample. Using simulated galaxies, we test how the
assumed profile affects the derived parameters and how the uncertainties affect
our Fundamental Plane results. We find that while fitting galaxies which have
Sersic index n < 4 with r^{1/4} law profiles systematically overestimates the
galaxy radius and flux, the combination of profile parameters that enter the
Fundamental Plane has uncertainties that are small. Average systematic offsets
and associated random uncertainties in magnitude and log r_e for n > 2 galaxies
fitted with r^{1/4} law profiles are -0.1+-0.3 and 0.1+-0.2 respectively. The
combination of effective radius and surface brightness, log r_e - \beta log
<I>_e, that enters the Fundamental Plane produces offsets smaller than
-0.02+-0.10. This systematic error is insignificant and independent of galaxy
magnitude or size. A catalog of photometry and surface brightness profile
parameters is presented for three of the clusters in our sample, RX
J0142.0+2131, RX J0152.7-1357, and RX J1226.9+3332 at redshifts 0.28, 0.83, and
0.89 respectively.
