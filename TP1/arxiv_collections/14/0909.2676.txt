The possible mechanisms of communications between distant bio-systems by
means of optical and UV photons are studied. It is argued that their main
production mechanism is owed to the biochemical reactions, occurring during the
cell division.. In the proposed model the bio-systems perform such
communications, radiating the photons in form of short periodic bursts, which
were observed experimentally for fish and frog eggs1. For experimentally
measured photon rates the communication algorithm is supposedly similar to the
exchange of binary encoded data in computer net via optical channels
