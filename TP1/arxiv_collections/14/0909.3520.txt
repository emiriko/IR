We introduce the $k$-peg Hanoi automorphisms and Hanoi self-similar groups, a
generalization of the Hanoi Towers groups, and give conditions for them to be
contractive. We analyze the limit spaces of a particular family of contracting
Hanoi groups, $H_c^{(k)}$, and show that these are the unique maximal
contracting Hanoi groups under a suitable symmetry condition. Finally, we
provide partial results on the contraction of Hanoi groups with weaker
symmetry.
