The relativistic nature of the electron motion underlies the intrinsic part
of the anomalous Hall effect, believed to dominate in ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As.
In this paper, we concentrate on the crystal band structure as an important
facet to the description of this phenomenon. Using different k.p and
tight-binding computational schemes, we capture the strong effect of the bulk
inversion asymmetry on the Berry curvature and the anomalous Hall conductivity.
At the same time, we find it not to affect other important characteristics of
(Ga,Mn)As, namely the Curie temperature and uniaxial anisotropy fields. Our
results extend the established theories of the anomalous Hall effect in
ferromagnetic semiconductors and shed new light on its puzzling nature.
