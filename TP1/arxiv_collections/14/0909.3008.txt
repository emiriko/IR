A new way for finding analytical solutions of the three-dimensional
sine-Gordon equation is presented. The method is based on the established
relation between the solutions of the three-dimensional wave equation and
solutions of the three-dimensional sine-Gordon equation. Some examples of the
solutions thus obtained are show.
