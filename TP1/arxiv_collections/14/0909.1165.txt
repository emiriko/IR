We present an analysis of regular timing observations of the
high-magnetic-field Rotating Radio Transient (RRAT) J1819$-$1458 obtained using
the 64-m Parkes and 76-m Lovell radio telescopes over the past five years.
During this time, the RRAT has suffered two significant glitches with
fractional frequency changes of $0.6\times10^{-6}$ and $0.1\times10^{-6}$.
Glitches of this magnitude are a phenomenon displayed by both radio pulsars and
magnetars. However, the behaviour of J1819$-$1458 following these glitches is
quite different to that which follows glitches in other neutron stars, since
the glitch activity resulted in a significant long-term net decrease in the
slow-down rate. If such glitches occur every 30 years, the spin-down rate, and
by inference the magnetic dipole moment, will drop to zero on a timescale of a
few thousand years. There are also significant increases in the rate of pulse
detection and in the radio pulse energy immediately following the glitches.
