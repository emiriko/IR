We report the recent results on rare kaon decays from the NA48/2 experiment.
The precise measurement of direct photon emission (DE) in the decay K+- -> pi+-
pi0 gamma and its interference (INT), with the INT amplitude being observed for
the first time, has been finalized. This study is based on the full NA48/2 data
set with about 600k reconstructed K+- -> pi+- pi0 gamma decays which is factor
of 30 larger than for previous experiments. Samples of about 7200 reconstructed
K+- -> pi+- e+ e-, and more than 3000 K+- -> pi+- mu+ mu- events, with very
small background contamination, have been collected. The latter is exceeding
the total existing statistics by a factor of five. A precise measurement of the
branching fractions and the form factors of the rare decays K+- -> pi+- l+ l-
has been performed using different theoretical models. The CP violating
asymmetry between K+ and K- in this channel is also measured.
