We have measured the abundances of Fe, Si, Ni, Ti, and Na in 20 Pleiads with
\teff values near solar and with low \vsini using high-resolution, high
signal-to-noise echelle spectra. We have validated our procedures by also
analyzing 10 field stars of a range of temperatures and metallicities that were
observed by \citet{Vale05}. Our result for the Pleiades is [Fe/H] =
$+0.03\pm0.02\pm0.05$ (statistical and systematic). The average of published
measurements for the Pleiades is $+0.042\pm0.021$.
