In this paper, we show that if we extend D-term hybrid inflation by adding a
light scalar field which couples to a waterfall field, large non-Gaussianity
can be generated at the end of inflation. Contribution of cosmic strings
generated after D-term inflation to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
angular power spectrum can be as low as 10% and this also evade the spectral
index problem.
