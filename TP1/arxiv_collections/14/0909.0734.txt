We use the general statement of the second law applied to an isolated system,
the glass in an extremely large medium, to prove that the entropy of the glass
must decrease with time during its relaxation towards the supercooled liquid
state. This result contradicts the claim of Mauro et al and their computational
result of the entropy, according to which their entropy of the glass increases.
Our approach using the isolated system completely bypasses the issue of
ergodicity loss in glasses, as discussed in the comment.
