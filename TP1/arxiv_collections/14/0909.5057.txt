The very short time scale variability of TeV $\gamma$-ray emission from
active galaxies suggests that the acceleration process of particles and the
production of primary $\gamma$-rays likely occurs relatively close to the
accretion disk. We calculate the $\gamma$-ray spectra produced in an Inverse
Compton $e^\pm$ pair cascade initiated by primary $\gamma$-rays which are
injected close to the surface of the accretion disk. Possible synchrotron
energy losses of secondary cascade $e^\pm$ pairs are also taken into account.
Since the soft radiation field is anisotropic, the resulting $\gamma$-ray
spectra strongly depend on the observation angle. We investigate their basic
properties for different parameters describing such a model. The model is
applied to the misaligned blazar Cen A recently detected in the TeV
$\gamma$-rays. We conclude on the site of the $\gamma$-ray emission region in
Cen A based on the comparison of the model with the observations of this source
in the GeV-TeV energy range.
