I outline why the renormalisation group is needed to analyse the scale
dependence and hence determine the power counting for effective theories of
strongly interacting systems. I summarise the results of several such analyses
for two- and three-body forces in nuclear physics. These show that a number of
terms should be significantly promoted relative to naive dimensional analysis.
