Using the China unitary principle to test the Dirac theoryfor the hydrogen
atomic spectrum shows that the standard Dirac function withthe Dirac energy
levels is only one the formal solutions of theDirac-Coulomb equation, which
conceals some pivotal mathematicalcontradictions. The theorem of existence of
solution of the Dirac equationrequires an important modification to the Dirac
angular momentum constantthat was defined by Dirac's algebra. It derives the
modified radial Diracequation which has the consistency solution involving the
quantum neutronradius and the neutron binding energy. The inevitable solution
for otheratomic energy states is only equivalent to the Bohr solution. It
concludesthat the Dirac equation is more suitable to describe the structure
ofneutron. How to treat the difference between the unitary energy levels andthe
result of the experimental observation of the atomic spectrums for thehydrogen
atom needs to be solved urgently.
