We propose a minimal model Hamiltonian for the electronic structure of a
monomethine dye, in order to describe the photoisomerization of such dyes. The
model describes interactions between three diabatic electronic states, each of
which can be associated with a valence bond structure. Monomethine dyes are
characterized by a charge-transfer resonance; the indeterminacy of the
single-double bonding structure dictated by the resonance is reflected in a
duality of photoisomerization pathways corresponding to the different methine
bonds. The possible multiplicity of decay channels complicates mechanistic
models of the effect of the environment on fluorescent quantum yields, as well
as coherent control strategies. We examine the extent and topology of
intersection seams between the electronic states of the dye, and how they
relate to charge localization and selection between different decay pathways.
We find that intersections between the S1 and S0 surfaces only occur for large
twist angles. In contrast, S2/S1 intersections can occur near the Franck-Condon
region. When the molecule has left-right symmetry, all intersections are
associated with con- or dis-rotations and never with single bond twists. For
asymmetric molecules (i.e. where the bridge couples more strongly to one end)
then the S2 and S1 surfaces bias torsion about different bonds. Charge
localization and torsion pathway biasing are correlated. We relate our
observations to several recent experimental and theoretical results, which have
been obtained for dyes with similar structure.
