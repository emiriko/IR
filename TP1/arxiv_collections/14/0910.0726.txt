In this outlook we describe what could be the next steps of the direct
characterization of habitable exoplanets after first the medium and large
mission projects and investigate the benefits of the spectroscopic and direct
imaging approaches. We show that after third and fourth generation missions
foreseeable for the next 100 years, we will face a very long era before being
able to see directly the morphology of extrasolar organisms.
