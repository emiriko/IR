A suspended carbon nanotube can act as a nanoscale resonator with remarkable
electromechanical properties and the ability to detect adsorption on its
surface at the level of single atoms. Understanding adsorption on nanotubes and
other graphitic materials is key to many sensing and storage applications. Here
we show that nanotube resonators offer a powerful new means of investigating
fundamental aspects of adsorption on carbon, including the collective behaviour
of adsorbed matter and its coupling to the substrate electrons. By monitoring
the vibrational resonance frequency in the presence of noble gases, we observe
the formation of monolayers on the cylindrical surface and phase transitions
within these monolayers, and simultaneous modification of the electrical
conductance. The monolayer observations also demonstrate the possibility of
studying the fundamental behaviour of matter in cylindrical geometry.
