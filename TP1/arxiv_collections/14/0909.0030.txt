I introduce an ansatz for the exclusion statistics parameters of fractional
exclusion statistics (FES) systems and I apply it to calculate the statistical
distribution of particles from both, bosonic and fermionic perspectives. Then,
to check the applicability of the ansatz, I calculate the FES parameters in
three well-known models: in a Fermi liquid type of system, a one-dimensional
quantum systems described in the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and quasiparticle
excitations in the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems. The FES parameters of
the first two models satisfy the ansatz, whereas those of the third model,
although close to the form given by the ansatz, represent an exception. With
this ocasion I also show that the general properties of the FES parameters,
deduced elsewhere (EPL 87, 60009, 2009), are satisfied also by the parameters
of the FQH liquid.
