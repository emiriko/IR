We use linear response theory to study the transverse force generated by an
external electric field and hence possible charge Hall effect in spin-orbit
coupled systems. In addition to the Lorentz force that is parallel to the
electric field, we find that the transverse force perpendicular to the applied
electric field may not vanish in a system with an anisotropic energy
dispersion. Surprisingly, in contrast to the previous results, the transverse
force generated by the electric field does not depend on the spin current, but
in general, it is related to the second derivative of energy dispersion only.
Furthermore, we find that the transverse force does not vanish in the
Rashba-Dresselhaus system. Therefore, the non-vanishing transverse force acts
as a driving force and results in charge imbalance at the edges of the sample.
The estimated ratio of the Hall voltage to the longitudinal voltage is $\sim
10^{-3}$. The disorder effect is also considered in the study of the
Rashba-Dresselhaus system. We find that the transverse force vanishes in the
presence of impurities in this system because the vertex correction and the
anomalous velocity of the electron accidently cancel each other.
