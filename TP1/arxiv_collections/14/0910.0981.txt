We study the electronic structure within a system of phase-decoupled
one-dimensional superconductors coexisting with stripe spin and charge density
wave order. This system has a nodal Fermi surface (Fermi arc) in the form of a
hole pocket and an antinodal pseudogap. The spectral function in the antinodes
is approximately particle-hole symmetric contrary to the gapped regions just
outside the pocket. We find that states at the Fermi energy are extended
whereas states near the pseudogap energy have localization lengths as short as
the inter-stripe spacing. We consider pairing which has either local d-wave or
s-wave symmetry and find similar results in both cases, consistent with the
pseudogap being an effect of local pair correlations. We suggest that this
state is a stripe ordered caricature of the pseudogap phase in underdoped
cuprates with coexisting spin-, charge-, and pair-density wave correlations.
Lastly, we also model a superconducting state which 1) evolves smoothly from
the pseudogap state, 2) has a signature subgap peak in the density of states,
and 3) has the coherent pair density concentrated to the nodal region.
