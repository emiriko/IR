A simple statistical model in terms of light-front kinematic variables is
used to explain the nuclear EMC effect in the range $x \in [0.2,~0.7]$, which
was constructed by us previously to calculate the parton distribution functions
(PDFs) of the nucleon. Here, we treat the temperature $T$ as a parameter of the
atomic number $A$, and get reasonable results in agreement with the
experimental data. Our results show that the larger $A$, the lower $T$ thus the
bigger volume $V$, and these features are consistent with other models.
Moreover, we give the predictions of the quark distribution ratios,
\emph{i.e.}, $q^A(x) / q^D(x)$, $\bar{q}^A(x) / \bar{q}^D(x)$, and $s^A(x) /
s^D(x)$, and also the gluon ratio $g^A(x) / g^D(x)$ for iron as an example. The
predictions are different from those by other models, thus experiments aiming
at measuring the parton ratios of antiquarks, strange quarks, and gluons can
provide a discrimination of different models.
