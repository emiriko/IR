We add relaxation mechanisms that mimic the effect of temperature and
non-equilibrium driving to the recently-proposed spiral model which jams at a
critical density rho_c < 1. This enables us to explore unjamming by temperature
or driving at rho_c < rho < 1. We numerically calculate the relaxation time of
the persistence function and its spatial heterogeneity. We disentangle the
three different relaxation mechanisms responsible for unjamming when varying
density, temperature, and driving strength, respectively. We show that the
spatial scale of dynamic heterogeneity depends on density much more strongly
than on temperature and driving.
