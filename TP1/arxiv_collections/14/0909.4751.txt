This is a historical note. In 1993 we calculated space, time and temperature
dependent correlation function in isotropic version of one dimensional XY spin
chain. The correlation function decays exponentially with time and space
separation. The rate of exponential decay was evaluated explicitly. Since that
time similar results were obtained in other models: Bose gas with delta
interaction, Ising model and strongly correlated electrons.
