In this paper we present a compact source of narrow-band energy-time
entangled photon pairs in the telecom regime based on a Ti-indiffused
Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) waveguide resonator, i.e. a waveguide
with end-face dielectric multi-layer mirrors. This is a monolithic doubly
resonant Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) far below threshold, which
generates photon pairs by Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) at
around 1560nm with a 117MHz (0.91 pm)- bandwidth. A coherence time of 2.7 ns is
estimated by a time correlation measurement and a high quality of the entangled
states is confirmed by a Bell-type experiment. Since highly coherent
energy-time entangled photon pairs in the telecom regime are suitable for long
distance transmission and manipulation, this source is well suited to the
requirements of quantum communication.
