Geometric frustration in quantum magnetism refers to that magnetic
interactions on different bonds cannot be simultaneously minimized. The usual
Cooper pairing systems favor the uniform distribution of the pairing phase
among lattice sites without frustration. In contrast, we propose "frustrated
Cooper pairing" in non-bipartite lattices which leads to frustrated supersolid
states with non-uniform distributions of the Cooper pair phase and density.
This exotic pairing state naturally occurs in the $p$-orbital band in optical
lattices with ultra-cold spinless fermions. In the triangular lattice, it
exhibits an unconventional supersolid state with the $f$-wave symmetry.
