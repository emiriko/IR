To a link L in the 3-sphere, we associate a spectral sequence whose E^2 page
is the reduced Khovanov homology of L and which converges to a version of the
monopole Floer homology of the branched double cover. The pages E^k for k > 1
depend only on the mutation equivalence class of L. We define a mod 2 grading
on the spectral sequence which interpolates between the delta-grading on
Khovanov homology and the mod 2 grading on Floer homology. We also derive a new
formula for link signature that is well-adapted to Khovanov homology.
  More generally, we construct new bigraded invariants of a framed link in a
3-manifold as the pages of a spectral sequence modeled on the surgery exact
triangle. The differentials count monopoles over families of metrics
parameterized by permutohedra. We utilize a connection between the topology of
link surgeries and the combinatorics of graph associahedra. This also yields
simple realizations of permutohedra and associahedra, as refinements of
hypercubes.
