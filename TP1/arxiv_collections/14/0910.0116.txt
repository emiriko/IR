Context. Near-Earth asteroid-comet transition object 107P/ (4015)
Wilson-Harrington is a possible target of the joint European Space Agency (ESA)
and Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Marco Polo sample return
mission. Physical studies of this object are relevant to this mission, and also
to understanding its asteroidal or cometary nature. Aims. Our aim is to obtain
significant new constraints on the surface thermal properties of this object.
Methods. We present mid-infrared photometry in two filters (16 and 22 microns)
obtained with NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope on February 12, 2007, and results
from the application of the Near Earth Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM).We
obtained high S/N in two mid-IR bands allowing accurate measurements of its
thermal emission. Results. We obtain a well constrained beaming parameter (eta
= 1.39 +/- 0.26) and obtain a diameter and geometric albedo of D = 3.46 +/-
0.32 km, and pV = 0.059 +/- 0.011. We also obtain similar results when we apply
this best-fitting thermal model to single-band mid-IR photometry reported by
Campins et al. (1995), Kraemer et al. (2005) and Reach et al. (2007).
Conclusions. The albedo of 4015 Wilson-Harrington is low, consistent with those
of comet nuclei and primitive C-, P-, D-type asteorids. We establish a rough
lower limit for the thermal inertia of W-H of 60 Jm^-2s^(-0.5)K^-1 when it is
at r=1AU, which is slightly over the limit of 30 Jm^-2s^(-0.5)K-1 derived by
Groussin et al. (2009) for the thermal inertia of the nucleus of comet
22P/Kopff.
