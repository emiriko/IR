We study the related questions: (i) when Feynman amplitudes in massless
$\phi^4$ theory evaluate to multiple zeta values, and (ii) when their
underlying motives are mixed Tate. More generally, by considering
configurations of singular hypersurfaces which fiber linearly over each other,
we deduce sufficient geometric and combinatorial criteria on Feynman graphs for
both (i) and (ii) to hold. These criteria hold for some infinite classes of
graphs which essentially contain all cases previously known to physicists.
Calabi-Yau varieties appear at the point where these criteria fail.
