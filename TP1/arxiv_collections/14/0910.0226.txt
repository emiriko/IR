We study numerically the formation of dSph galaxies. Intense star bursts,
e.g. in gas-rich environments, typically produce a few to a few hundred young
star clusters, within a region of just a few hundred pc. The dynamical
evolution of these star clusters may explain the formation of the luminous
component of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph). Here we perform a numerical
experiment to show that the evolution of star clusters complexes in dark matter
haloes can explain the formation of the luminous components of dSph galaxies.
