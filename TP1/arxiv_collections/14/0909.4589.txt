Sequences with good correlation properties are widely used in engineering
applications, especially in the area of communications. Among the known
sequences, cyclotomic families have the optimal autocorrelation property. In
this paper, we decide the cross-correlation function of the known cyclotomic
sequences completely. Moreover, to get our results, the relations between the
multiplier group and the decimations of the characteristic sequence are also
established for an arbitrary difference set.
