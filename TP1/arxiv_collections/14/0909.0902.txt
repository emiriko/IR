We analyse four light curves obtained at high time resolution (~ 0.1 s) with
the 11-m Southern African Large Telescope, at the ends of two normal outbursts
and one superoutburst of the dwarf nova VW Hyi. All of these contain at least
some Dwarf Nova Oscillations (DNOs), which, when at their highest amplitudes,
are seen in unprecedented detail. In addition to the expected DNOs with periods
> 20 s we find a previously unknown modulation at 13.39 s, but none at shorter
periods. The various DNOs and their interaction with the longer period
Quasi-periodic Oscillations are interpreted in terms of the model of
magnetically controlled flow from an accretion disc proposed earlier in this
series of papers. Our observations include rare DNOs very late in outburst; we
find that the fundamental period does not increase beyond ~ 90 s, which is the
same value that the independent ``longer period DNOs'' converge on.
