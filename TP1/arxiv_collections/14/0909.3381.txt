We explore heat transfer in molecular junctions between two leads in the
absence of a finite net thermal bias. The application of an unbiased,
time-periodic temperature modulation of the leads entails a dynamical breaking
of reflection symmetry, such that a directed heat current may emerge (ratchet
effect). In particular, we consider two cases of adiabatically slow driving,
namely (i) periodic temperature modulation of only one lead and (ii)
temperature modulation of both leads with an ac driving that contains a second
harmonic, thus generating harmonic mixing. Both scenarios yield sizeable
directed heat currents which should be detectable with present techniques.
Adding a static thermal bias, allows one to compute the heat current-thermal
load characteristics which includes the ratchet effect of negative thermal bias
with positive-valued heat flow against the thermal bias, up to the thermal
stop-load. The ratchet heat flow in turn generates also an electric current. An
applied electric stop-voltage, yielding effective zero electric current flow,
then mimics a solely heat-ratchet-induced thermopower (``ratchet Seebeck
effect''), although no net thermal bias is acting. Moreover, we find that the
relative phase between the two harmonics in scenario (ii) enables steering the
net heat current into a direction of choice.
