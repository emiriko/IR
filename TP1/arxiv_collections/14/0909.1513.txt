[Abridged] We have computed a grid of 900 numeric dynamic model atmospheres
(DMAs) using a well-tested computer code. This grid of models covers most of
the expected combinations of stellar parameters, which are made up of the
stellar temperature, the stellar luminosity, the stellar mass, the abundance of
condensible carbon, and the velocity amplitude of the pulsation. The resultant
mass-loss rates and wind speeds are clearly affected by the choice of stellar
temperature, mass, luminosity and the abundance of available carbon. In certain
parts of the parameter space there is also an inevitable mass-loss threshold,
below which a dust-driven wind is not possible. Contrary to some previous
studies, we find a strong dependence on the abundance of free carbon, which
turns out to be a critical parameter. Furthermore, we have found that the dust
grains that form in the atmosphere may grow too large for the commonly used
small particle approximation of the dust opacity to be strictly valid. This may
have some bearing on the wind properties, although further study of this
problem is needed before quantitative conclusions can be drawn. The wind
properties show relatively simple dependences on stellar parameters above the
mass-loss threshold, while the threshold itself is of a more complicated
nature. Hence, we chose not to derive any simplistic mass-loss formula, but
rather provide a mass-loss prescription in the form of an easy-to-use FORTRAN
routine. Since this mass-loss routine is based on data coming from an
essentially self-consistent model of mass loss, it may therefore serve as a
better mass-loss prescription for stellar evolution calculations than empirical
formulae. Furthermore, we conclude that there are still some issues that need
to be investigated, such as the role of grain-sizes.
