We report ^{11}B NMR measurements in non-centrosymmetric superconductors
Mg_{9.3}Ir_{19}B_{16.7} (T_c=5.8 K) and Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1} (T_c=4.8 K).
The spin lattice relaxation rate and the Knight shift indicate that the Cooper
pairs are predominantly in the spin-singlet state with an isotropic gap.
However, Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1} is found to have more defects and the spin
susceptibility remains finite even in the zero-temperature limit. We interpret
this result as that the defects enhance the spin-orbit coupling and bring about
more spin-triplet component.
