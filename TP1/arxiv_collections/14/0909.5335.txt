The structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the superconducting
NdFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$ phases ($T_C=43 {\rm K}$ for $x=0.15$) have been
investigated experimentally by high-resolution synchrotron x-ray powder
diffraction, magnetization and $^{75}$As NMR measurements. Density-functional
calculations were performed to calculate and analyze the electric field
gradient and the density of states. Compared to LaFeAsO family, the NdFeAsO
family shows a contraction of the lattice parameters with shorter rare-earth
(RE)-As bond distances, an increased thickness of the As-Fe$_2$-As layer, and
less distorted Fe-As$_4$ tetrahedra. The $^{75}$As quadrupole frequencies are
enhanced with respect to the La analogs. This is due to a more prolate As $4p$
electron distribution mainly caused by the reduced lattice parameters and not
by the presence of Nd $4f$ electrons. A non-negligible hyperfine coupling
between the $^{75}$As nuclei and the Nd $4f$ states indicates a weak coupling
between the REO and FeAs layer and possibly opens the channel for a
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)-type interaction between localized Nd $4f$
moments mediated by itinerant Fe 3d and/or Nd $5d$ states.
