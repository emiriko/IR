A resolution of the Abraham-Minkowski dilemma is presented that other
constant velocities can play the role of c in the theory of relativity. For
example, in 2005 electrons of graphene were discovered to behave as if the
coefficient is a Fermi velocity. Then we propose a conjecture for neutrinos to
avoid the contradiction among two-component theory, negative rest mass-square
and oscillation.
