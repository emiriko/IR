The LHCb experiment, bolstered up by the 10^12 b-hadrons to be produced
yearly in its interaction region, is an excellent place to study rare B decays.
Flavor-changing neutral currents are forbidden at tree level in the Standard
Model. They proceed through loop diagrams and hence are indirectly sensitive to
New Physics through the effect of new particles on observable quantities. In
this paper, we present preparation studies of the three most promising B rare
decay analyzes. These aim at the observation of the photon polarization in B_s
to phi gamma, the measurement of the angular distribution of the B^0 to K* mu^+
mu^- decay, and the search for the yet unobserved B_s to mu^+ mu^- decay. The
current analysis strategies and the expected sensitivities are presented.
