A minimal candidate for dark matter is provided by a stable standard model
singlet hermitian scalar field. The quantum mechanical effects of this singlet
are explored in a model where the standard model Higgs boson has a large
non-minimal coupling to the Ricci scalar and plays the role of the inflaton.
Imposition of the slow roll inflation cosmological constraints restricts the
allowed values of the Higgs boson mass, its coupling to the dark matter and the
dark matter self-coupling.
