The Belle and Babar experiments have measured the branching fractions for B+
-> tau+ nu and Ds+ -> mu+ nu decays. From these measurements one can extract
the B+ and Ds+ decay constants, which can be compared to lattice QCD
calculations. For the Ds+ decay constant, there is currently a 2.1 sigma
difference between the calculated value and the measured value.
