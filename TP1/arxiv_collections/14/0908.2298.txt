Using a Wang-Landau entropic sampling scheme, we investigate the effects of
quenched bond randomness on a particular case of a triangular Ising model with
nearest- ($J_{nn}$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($J_{nnn}$) antiferromagnetic
interactions. We consider the case $R=J_{nnn}/J_{nn}=1$, for which the pure
model is known to have a columnar ground state where rows of nearest-neighbor
spins up and down alternate and undergoes a weak first-order phase transition
from the ordered to the paramagnetic state. With the introduction of quenched
bond randomness we observe the effects signaling the expected conversion of the
first-order phase transition to a second-order phase transition and using the
Lee-Kosterlitz method, we quantitatively verify this conversion. The emerging,
under random bonds, continuous transition shows a strongly saturating specific
heat behavior, corresponding to a negative exponent $\alpha$, and belongs to a
new distinctive universality class with $\nu=1.135(11)$, $\gamma/\nu=1.744(9)$,
and $\beta/\nu=0.124(8)$. Thus, our results for the critical exponents support
an extensive but weak universality and the emerged continuous transition has
the same magnetic critical exponent (but a different thermal critical exponent)
as a wide variety of two-dimensional (2d) systems without and with quenched
disorder.
