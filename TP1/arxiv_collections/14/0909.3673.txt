A rigorous derivation of the density functional via the effective action in
the Hohenberg-Kohn theory is outlined. Using the auxiliary field method, in
which the electric coupling constant $e^2$ need not be small, we show that the
loop expansion of the exchange-correlation functional can be reorganized so as
to be expressed entirely in terms of the Kohn-Sham single-particle orbitals and
energies.
