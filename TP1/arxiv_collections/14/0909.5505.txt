The combination of continuum Many-Body Quantum physics and Monte Carlo
methods provide a powerful and well established approach to first principles
calculations for large systems. Replacing the exact solution of the problem
with a statistical estimate requires a measure of the random error in the
estimate for it to be useful. Such a measure of confidence is usually provided
by assuming the Central Limit Theorem to hold true. In what follows it is
demonstrated that, for the most popular implementation of the Variational Monte
Carlo method, the Central Limit Theorem has limited validity, or is invalid and
must be replaced by a Generalised Central Limit Theorem. Estimates of the total
energy and the variance of the local energy are examined in detail, and shown
to exhibit uncontrolled statistical errors through an explicit derivation of
the distribution of the random error. Several examples are given of estimated
quantities for which the Central Limit Theorem is not valid. The approach used
is generally applicable to characterising the random error of estimates, and to
Quantum Monte Carlo methods beyond Variational Monte Carlo.
