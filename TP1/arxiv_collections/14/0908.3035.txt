We determine the characters of the simple composition factors and the
submodule lattices of certain Weyl modules for classical groups. The results
have several applications. The simple modules arise in the study of incidence
systems in finite geometries and knowledge of their dimensions yields the
$p$-ranks of these incidence systems.
