With the motivation of improving the performance and reliability of
aggressively scaled nano-patterned graphene field-effect transistors, we
present the first systematic experimental study on charge and current
distribution in multilayer graphene field-effect transistors. We find a very
particular thickness dependence for Ion, Ioff, and the Ion/Ioff ratio, and
propose a resistor network model including screening and interlayer coupling to
explain the experimental findings. In particular, our model does not invoke
modification of the linear energy-band structure of graphene for the multilayer
case. Noise reduction in nano-scale few-layer graphene transistors is
experimentally demonstrated and can be understood within this model as well.
