In this letter, the number-phase entropic uncertainty relation and the
number-phase Wigner function of generalized coherent states associated to a few
solvable quantum systems with nondegenerate spectra are studied. We also
investigate time evolution of number-phase entropic uncertainty and Wigner
function of the considered physical systems with the help of temporally stable
Gazeau-Klauder coherent states.
