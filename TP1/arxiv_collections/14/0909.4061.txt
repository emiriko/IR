Low-rank matrix approximations, such as the truncated singular value
decomposition and the rank-revealing QR decomposition, play a central role in
data analysis and scientific computing. This work surveys and extends recent
research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for
performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern
computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the
possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets.
  This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized
algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random
sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix.
The input matrix is then compressed---either explicitly or implicitly---to this
subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the
desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its
classical competitors in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness. These claims
are supported by extensive numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis.
