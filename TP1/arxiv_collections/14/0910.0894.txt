An outgrowth of the idea of inflation is advanced. In the inflation regime,
the singularity condition is broken. Equations which govern inflation are
invariant under time reversal, so that they describe deflation as well. Those
two observations suggest that inflation may be extended to the following
process: deflation (t<0)--minimum radius >0 (t=0)--inflation (t>0), with no
singularity. A relevant construction is carried out in the framework both of
classical and of reductive semiclassical gravity. The construction results in
an eternal (-\infty<t<\infty) contracting-expanding closed universe.
