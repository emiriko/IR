Component-oriented and service-oriented approaches have gained a strong
enthusiasm in industries and academia with a particular interest for
service-oriented approaches. A component is a software entity with given
functionalities, made available by a provider, and used to build other
application within which it is integrated. The service concept and its use in
web-based application development have a huge impact on reuse practices.
Accordingly a considerable part of software architectures is influenced; these
architectures are moving towards service-oriented architectures. Therefore
applications (re)use services that are available elsewhere and many
applications interact, without knowing each other, using services available via
service servers and their published interfaces and functionalities. Industries
propose, through various consortium, languages, technologies and standards.
More academic works are also undertaken concerning semantics and formalisation
of components and service-based systems. We consider here both streams of works
in order to raise research concerns that will help in building quality
software. Are there new challenging problems with respect to service-based
software construction? Besides, what are the links and the advances compared to
distributed systems?
