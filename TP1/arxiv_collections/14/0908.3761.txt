Appreciating the classical understanding of the elementary particle the
"dynamical" Poincare algebra is developed. It is shown that the "dynamical"
Poincare algebra and the equations of motion of particles with arbitrary spin
are gauge invariant and that gauge invariance and relativistic invariance stand
on equal footings. A "dynamical" non-minimal interaction is constructed
explicitly and the Rarita-Schwinger equation is considered in the framework of
this "dynamical" interaction.
