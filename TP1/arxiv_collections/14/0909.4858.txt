Mobile IPv6 will be an integral part of the next generation Internet
protocol. The importance of mobility in the Internet gets keep on increasing.
Current specification of Mobile IPv6 does not provide proper support for
reliability in the mobile network and there are other problems associated with
it. In this paper, we propose Virtual Private Network (VPN) based Home Agent
Reliability Protocol (VHAHA) as a complete system architecture and extension to
Mobile IPv6 that supports reliability and offers solutions to the security
problems that are found in Mobile IP registration part. The key features of
this protocol over other protocols are: better survivability, transparent
failure detection and recovery, reduced complexity of the system and workload,
secure data transfer and improved overall performance.
