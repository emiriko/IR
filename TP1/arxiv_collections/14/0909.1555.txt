We present a thorough literature study of the most-massive star, m_max, in
several young star clusters in order to assess whether or not star clusters are
populated from the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by random sampling over
the mass range 0.01 < m < 150 M_sol without being constrained by the cluster
mass, M_ecl. The data reveal a partition of the sample into lowest mass objects
(M_ecl < 10^2 M_sol), moderate mass clusters (10^2 M_sol < M_ecl < 10^3 M_sol)
and rich clusters above 10^3 M_sol. Additionally, there is a plateau of a
constant maximal star mass (m_max ~ 25 M_sol) for clusters with masses between
10^3 M_sol and 4 10^3 M_sol. Statistical tests of this data set reveal that the
hypothesis of random sampling from the IMF between 0.01 and 150 M_sol is highly
unlikely for star clusters more massive than 10^2 M_sol with a probability of p
~ 2 10^-7 for the objects with M_ecl between 10^2 M_sol and 10^3 M_sol and p ~
3 10^-9 for the more massive star clusters. Also, the spread of m_max values at
a given M_ecl is smaller than expected from random sampling. We suggest that
the basic physical process able to explain this dependence of stellar inventory
of a star cluster on its mass may be the interplay between stellar feedback and
the binding energy of the cluster-forming molecular cloud core. Given these
results, it would follow that an integrated galactic initial mass function
(IGIMF) sampled from such clusters would automatically be steeper in comparison
to the IMF within individual star clusters.
