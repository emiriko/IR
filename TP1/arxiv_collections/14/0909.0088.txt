Jaynes-Cummings model is a typical model in quantum optics and has been
realized with various physical systems (e.g, cavity QED, trapped ions, and
circuit QED etc..) of two-level atoms interacting with quantized bosonic
fields. Here, we propose a new implementation of this model by using a single
classical laser beam to drive an electron floating on liquid Helium. Two lowest
levels of the {\it vertical} motion of the electron acts as a two-level "atom",
and the quantized vibration of the electron along one of the {\it parallel}
directions, e.g., $x$-direction, serves the bosonic mode. These two degrees of
freedom of the trapped electron can be coupled together by using a classical
laser field. If the frequencies of the applied laser fields are properly set,
the desirable Jaynes-Cummings models could be effectively realized.
