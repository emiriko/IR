Let f: A^N \to A^N be a regular polynomial automorphism defined over a number
field K. For each place v of K, we construct the v-adic Green functions G_{f,v}
and G_{f^{-1},v} (i.e., the v-adic canonical height functions) for f and
f^{-1}. Next we introduce for f the notion of good reduction at v, and using
this notion, we show that the sum of v-adic Green functions over all v gives
rise to a canonical height function for f that satisfies the Northcott-type
finiteness property. Using previous results, we recover results on arithmetic
properties of f-periodic points and non f-periodic points. We also obtain an
estimate of growth of heights under f and f^{-1}, which is independently
obtained by Lee by a different method.
