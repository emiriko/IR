An asymmetric multi-quantum state magnetic lattice is proposed to host
excitons formed in a quantum degenerate gas of ultracold fermionic atoms to
simulate Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of excitons. A Quasi-two dimensional
degenerate gas of excitons can be collected in the in-plane asymmetric magnetic
bands created at the surface of the proposed magnetic lattice, where the
ultracold fermions simulate separately direct and indirect confined
electronhole pairs (spin up fermions-spin down fermions) rising to the
statistically degenerate Bose gas and eventually through controlled tunnelling
to BEC of excitons. The confinement of the coupled magnetic quantum well
(CMQWs) system may significantly improve the condition for long lived exciton
BEC. The exciton BEC, formed in CMQWs can be regarded as a suitable host for
the multi-qubits (multipartite) systems to be used in quantum information
processors.
