The conference 'Photon 2009' on the structure and the interactions of the
photon included sessions on photon-photon collisions and a future high-energy
photon linear collider. This summary of theoretical contributions to the
conference therefore has two parts. I will discuss the physics potential of
photon colliders with an emphasis on the study of electroweak physics and the
search for physics beyond the standard model. Secondly, I will describe a few
highlights in recent progress in the understanding of the properties and the
interaction of the photon, comprising the production of prompt photons, the
photon structure and exclusive hadron production, small-x and total cross
sections of deep inelastic scattering. Finally, I will review the status of the
comparison of measurement and theory for the muon anomalous magnetic moment
g-2.
