In this paper, we develop an analytical approach to predict the field-induced
alignment of cantilevered graphene nanoribbons. This approach is validated
through molecular simulations using a constitutive atomic electrostatic model.
Our results reveal that graphene's field-oriented bending angle is roughly
proportional to the square of field strength or the graphene length for small
deformations, while is roughly independent of graphene width. The effective
bending stiffness and the longitudinal polarizability are also found to be
approximately proportional to the square of graphene length. Compared with
carbon nanotubes, graphene nanoribbons are found to be more mechanically
sensitive to an external electric field.
