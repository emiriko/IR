An event-based partial wave analysis (PWA) of the reaction gamma p -> p omega
has been performed on a high-statistics dataset obtained using the CLAS at
Jefferson Lab for center-of-mass energies from threshold up to 2.4 GeV. This
analysis benefits from access to the world's first high precision spin density
matrix element measurements, available to the event-based PWA through the decay
distribution of omega-> pi+ pi - pi0. The data confirm the dominance of the
t-channel pi0 exchange amplitude in the forward direction. The dominant
resonance contributions are consistent with the previously identified states
F[15](1680) and D[13](1700) near threshold, as well as the G[17](2190) at
higher energies. Suggestive evidence for the presence of a J(P)=5/2(+) state
around 2 GeV, a "missing" state, has also been found. Evidence for other states
is inconclusive.
