Recent data on e(-)+e(+)-->b+anti-b by the BABAR Collaboration [B. Aubert et
al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 012001 (2009), arXiv:0809.4120] in the energy range
delimited by the B+anti-B and Lambda(b)(+)+Lambda(b)(-) thresholds are analyzed
in a multichannel formalism that incorporates the usual Breit-Wigner
resonances, but interfering with a background signal due to the opening of
open-bottom thresholds. In particular, the Upsilon(4S) resonance is determined
to have a mass of 10.735 GeV and a width of 38 MeV. Also two higher Upsilon
resonances are identified, parametrized, and classified.
  Moreover, it is found that near the B+anti-B threshold open-bottom production
in electron-positron annihilation is dominated by the reaction chain
e(-)+e(+)-->n+anti-n-->B+anti-B (n=u/d) rather than
e(-)+e(+)-->b+anti-b-->B+anti-B whereas near the B(s)+anti-B(s) threshold the
reaction chain e(-)+e(+)-->s+anti-s-->B+anti-B dominates the production
amplitude.
  The vital role played in this analysis by the universal confinement
frequency, defined in 1980 [E. van Beveren, C. Dullemond, and G. Rupp, Phys.
Rev. D21, 772 (1980)] and accurately determined in 1983 [E. van Beveren, G.
Rupp, T.A. Rijken, and C. Dullemond, Phys. Rev. D27, 1527 (1983)], is further
confirmed.
