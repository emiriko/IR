We study the heating of charged test particles in three-dimensional numerical
simulations of weakly compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence
(``Alfvenic turbulence''); these results are relevant to particle heating and
acceleration in the solar wind, solar flares, accretion disks onto black holes,
and other astrophysics and heliospheric environments. The physics of particle
heating depends on whether the gyrofrequency of a particle is comparable to the
frequency of a turbulent fluctuation that is resolved on the computational
domain. Particles with these frequencies nearly equal undergo strong
perpendicular heating (relative to the local magnetic field) and pitch angle
scattering. By contrast, particles with large gyrofrequency undergo strong
parallel heating. Simulations with a finite resistivity produce additional
parallel heating due to parallel electric fields in small-scale current sheets.
Many of our results are consistent with linear theory predictions for the
particle heating produced by the Alfven and slow magnetosonic waves that make
up Alfvenic turbulence. However, in contrast to linear theory predictions,
energy exchange is not dominated by discrete resonances between particles and
waves; instead, the resonances are substantially ``broadened.'' We discuss the
implications of our results for solar and astrophysics problems, in particular
the thermodynamics of the near-Earth solar wind. We conclude that Alfvenic
turbulence produces significant parallel heating via the interaction between
particles and magnetic field compressions (``slow waves''). However, on scales
above the proton Larmor radius, Alfvenic turbulence does not produce
significant perpendicular heating of protons or minor ions.
