High-sensitivity measurements of the linearly-polarized solar limb spectrum
produced by scattering processes in quiet regions of the solar atmosphere
showed that the Q/I profile of the lithium doublet at 6708 A has an amplitude
~10^{-4} and a curious three-peak structure, qualitatively similar to that
found and confirmed by many observers in the Na I D_2 line. Given that a
precise measurement of the scattering polarization profile of the lithium
doublet lies at the limit of the present observational possibilities, it is
worthwhile to clarify the physical origin of the observed polarization, its
diagnostic potential and what kind of Q/I shapes can be expected from theory.
To this end, we have applied the quantum theory of atomic level polarization
taking into account the hyperfine structure of the two stable isotopes of
lithium, as well as the Hanle effect of a microturbulent magnetic field of
arbitrary strength. We find that quantum interferences between the sublevels
pertaining to the upper levels of the D_2 and D_1 line transitions of lithium
do not cause any observable effect on the emergent Q/I profile. Our theoretical
calculations show that only two Q/I peaks can be expected, with the strongest
one caused by the D_2 line of ^7Li I and the weakest one due to the D_2 line of
^6Li I. Interestingly, we find that these two peaks in the theoretical Q/I
profile stand out clearly only when the kinetic temperature of the thin
atmospheric region that produces the emergent spectral line radiation is lower
than 4000 K. The fact that such region is located around a height of 200 km in
standard semi-empirical models, where the kinetic temperature is about 5000 K,
leads us to suggest that the most likely Q/I profile produced by the sun in the
lithium doublet should be slightly asymmetric and dominated by the ^7Li I peak.
