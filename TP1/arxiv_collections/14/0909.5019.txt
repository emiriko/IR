The appearance of the self-sustained vibrations corresponds to the dynamic
instability of the machine tool. An experimental device and a model were
designed to characterize the cutting system, the block part. This analysis
shows the need for knowing more details of it the behavior of the coin at the
time of the cut, and for envisaging for the continuation the appearance of
vibrations.
