We present measurements of the gamma gamma* --> pi0 transition form factor
for the momentum transfer range Q^2=4-40 GeV^2 and the gamma gamma* --> eta_c
transition form factor for the range Q^2=2-50 GeV^2. The results of the
measurement of the eta_c mass, total and two-photon widths are also presented.
