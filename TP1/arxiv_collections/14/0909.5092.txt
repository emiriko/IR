We introduce a new method for reconstructing the primordial power spectrum,
$P(k)$, directly from observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We
employ Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to invert the radiation perturbation
transfer function. The degeneracy of the multipole $\ell$ to wavenumber $k$
linear mapping is thus reduced. This enables the inversion to be carried out at
each point along a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) exploration of the combined
$P(k)$ and cosmological parameter space. We present best--fit $P(k)$ obtained
with this method along with other cosmological parameters.
