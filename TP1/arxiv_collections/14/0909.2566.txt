We describe the modern approach to quantum cosmology, as initiated by Hartle
and Hawking, Linde, Vilenkin and others. The primary aim is to explain how one
determines the consequences for the late universe of a given quantum theory of
cosmological initial or boundary conditions. An extensive list of references is
included, together with a guide to the literature. It also includes a detailed
treatment of the WKB interpretation, which is relevant to a forthcoming article
by the author on the decoherent histories approach to quantum cosmology.
