Spam messages are an increasing threat to mobile communication. Several
mitigation techniques have been proposed, including white and black listing,
challenge-response and content-based filtering. However, none are perfect and
it makes sense to use a combination rather than just one. We propose an
anti-spam framework based on the hybrid of content-based filtering and
challenge-response. There is the trade-offs between accuracy of anti-spam
classifiers and the communication overhead. Experimental results show how,
depending on the proportion of spam messages, different filtering %%@
parameters should be set.
