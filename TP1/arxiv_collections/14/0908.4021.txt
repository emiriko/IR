We compute for the first time full elastic deformations, as well as length,
of self-trapped electronic states in carbon nanotubes of general radius and
chirality, within the unifying framework of a recently introduced two field
model for electromechanics of carbon nano-structures. We find that deformations
are highly non monotonic in the chiral angle, whereas the length of the polaron
is not. Applications include nano-mechanical devices as electrically or
optically driven nano-actuators.
