Recent formulation of the Zaller model of mass opinion is generalized to
include the interaction between agents. The mechanism of interaction is close
to the bounded confidence model. The outcome of the simulation is the
probability distribution of opinions on a given issue as dependent on the
mental capacity of agents. Former result was that a small capacity leads to a
strong belief. Here we show that an intensive interaction between agents also
leads to a consensus, accepted without doubts.
