A theoretical method with the quaternion algebra was presented to derive the
mass continuity equation from the linear momentum. It predicts that the
strength of electromagnetic field and the velocity have the impact on the mass
continuity equation. In the gravitational field and electromagnetic field, the
mass continuity equation will change with the electromagnetic field strength,
gravitational field strength, linear momentum, electric current, and the speed
of light. The deduction can explain why the field strength has an influence on
the anomalous transport about the mass continuity equation in the plasma and
electrolytes etc.
