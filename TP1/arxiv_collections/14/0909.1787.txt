Among many remarkable qualities of graphene, its electronic properties
attract particular interest due to a massless chiral character of charge
carriers, which leads to such unusual phenomena as metallic conductivity in the
limit of no carriers and the half-integer quantum Hall effect (QHE) observable
even at room temperature [1-3]. Because graphene is only one atom thick, it is
also amenable to external influences including mechanical deformation. The
latter offers a tempting prospect of controlling graphene's properties by
strain and, recently, several reports have examined graphene under uniaxial
deformation [4-8]. Although the strain can induce additional Raman features
[7,8], no significant changes in graphene's band structure have been either
observed or expected for realistic strains of approx. 10% [9-11]. Here we show
that a designed strain aligned along three main crystallographic directions
induces strong gauge fields [12-14] that effectively act as a uniform magnetic
field exceeding 10 T. For a finite doping, the quantizing field results in an
insulating bulk and a pair of countercirculating edge states, similar to the
case of a topological insulator [15-20]. We suggest realistic ways of creating
this quantum state and observing the pseudo-magnetic QHE. We also show that
strained superlattices can be used to open significant energy gaps in
graphene's electronic spectrum.
