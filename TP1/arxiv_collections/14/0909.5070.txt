A technique to simulate the spex-mixer/mill system as a macroscopic ensemble
rather than a pure dynamical system is proposed. The treatment is suitable
especially for comminution processes generating the nanomaterial up to
nanometers scale where the geometrical displacements are unobservable. It is
argued that the method is simple and experimentally verifiable since relevant
physical observables can be extracted using partition function without solving
the equation of motions.
