We present the first observations of a global coronal wave ("EIT wave") from
the two Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) satellites in quadra-
ture. The wave's initiation site was at the disk center in STEREO-B and
precisely on the limb in STEREO-A. These unprecedented observations from the
STEREO Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging (EUVI) instruments enable us to gain insight
into the wave's kinematics, initiation and 3D structure. The wave propagates
globally over the whole solar hemisphere visible to STEREO-B with a constant
velocity of 263+/-16 km/s. From the two STEREO observations we derive a height
of the wave in the range of 80-100 Mm. Comparison of the wave kinematics with
the early phase of the erupting CME structure indicates that the wave is
initiated by the CME lateral expansion, and then propagates freely with a
velocity close to the fast magnetosonic speed in the quiet solar corona.
