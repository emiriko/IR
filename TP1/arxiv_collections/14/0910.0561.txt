We report on studies of the structure and dynamics of the (001)surface of
single crystal LiCu2O2, investigated by He beam scattering at room temperature,
and with lattice dynamical models. The best fit surface corrugation to measured
diffraction patterns shows that the surface termination is exclusively a
Li+1Cu+2O-2 plane. Lattice dynamics fits to inelastic He scattering spectra
reveal the presence of two low-lying surface phonon modes, identified with the
motion of Cu+2, Li+1 surface ions normal to the surface.
