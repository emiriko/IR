Dynamical 2+1 flavor lattice QCD is used to calculate the masses of bottom
hadrons, including B mesons, singly and doubly bottom baryons, and for the
first time also the triply-bottom baryon Omega_bbb. The domain wall action is
used for the up-, down-, and strange quarks (both valence and sea), while the
bottom quark is implemented with non-relativistic QCD. A calculation of the
bottomonium spectrum is also presented.
