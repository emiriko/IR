We report appearance of the net magnetization in Mn-based antiperovskite
compounds as a result of the external strain gradient (flexomagnetic effect).
In particular, we describe the mechanism of the magnetization induction in the
Mn_{3}GaN at the atomic level in terms of the behavior of the local magnetic
moments (LMM) of the Mn atoms. We show that the flexomagnetic effect is linear
and results from the non-uniformity of the strain, i.e. it is absent not only
in the ground state but also when the applied external strain is uniform. We
estimate the flexomagnetic coefficient to be 1.95 mu_{B}*angstrom. We show that
at the moderate values of the strain gradient (~ 0.1%) the flexomagnetic
contribution is the only non-vanishing input to the induced magnetization.
