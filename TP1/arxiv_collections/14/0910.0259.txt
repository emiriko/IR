Two Single crystals of Nb3Sn presenting the martensitic anomaly at different
temperature and shape, as observed with specific heat measurements, were used
to study structural features in the electronic density of states with point
contact spectroscopy. At high temperature below the martensitic anomaly, we
observed different spectroscopic characteristics. One sample displaying a well
marked specific heat peak, shows a clear defined structure in the differential
conductance that evolves with temperature and may be associated with changes on
the density of states due to the opening of a charge density wave gap. Those
features are very depending on the crystallographics characteristics of the
single crystal examined.
