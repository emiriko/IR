Implications of the recent results on neutrino masses and mixing to
underlying new physics are considered. Various approaches to physics behind
neutrino mass are described which include the tri-bimaximal mixing and flavor
symmetries, the quark-lepton complementarity and weak complementarity, the
quark-lepton universality and unification. Some recent results from string
phenomenology are discussed and the issue of model building versus "string
engineering" is outlined.
