Epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) suffers from strong intrinsic n-type doping.
We demonstrate that the excess negative charge can be fully compensated by
non-covalently functionalizing graphene with the strong electron acceptor
tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ). Charge neutrality can be reached
in monolayer graphene as shown in electron dispersion spectra from angular
resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). In bilayer graphene the band gap
that originates from the SiC/graphene interface dipole increases with
increasing F4-TCNQ deposition and, as a consequence of the molecular doping,
the Fermi level is shifted into the band gap. The reduction of the charge
carrier density upon molecular deposition is quantified using electronic Fermi
surfaces and Raman spectroscopy. The structural and electronic characteristics
of the graphene/F4-TCNQ charge transfer complex are investigated by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy
(UPS). The doping effect on graphene is preserved in air and is temperature
resistant up to 200\degree C. Furthermore, graphene non-covalent
functionalization with F4-TCNQ can be implemented not only via evaporation in
ultra-high vacuum but also by wet chemistry.
