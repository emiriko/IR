The Balloon-borne Large-Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST) carried out
a 250, 350 and 500 micron survey of the galactic plane encompassing the Vela
Molecular Ridge, with the primary goal of identifying the coldest dense cores
possibly associated with the earliest stages of star formation. Here we present
the results from observations of the Vela-D region, covering about 4 square
degrees, in which we find 141 BLAST cores. We exploit existing data taken with
the Spitzer MIPS, IRAC and SEST-SIMBA instruments to constrain their
(single-temperature) spectral energy distributions, assuming a dust emissivity
index beta = 2.0. This combination of data allows us to determine the
temperature, luminosity and mass of each BLAST core, and also enables us to
separate starless from proto-stellar sources. We also analyze the effects that
the uncertainties on the derived physical parameters of the individual sources
have on the overall physical properties of starless and proto-stellar cores,
and we find that there appear to be a smooth transition from the pre- to the
proto-stellar phase. In particular, for proto-stellar cores we find a
correlation between the MIPS24 flux, associated with the central protostar, and
the temperature of the dust envelope. We also find that the core mass function
of the Vela-D cores has a slope consistent with other similar (sub)millimeter
surveys.
