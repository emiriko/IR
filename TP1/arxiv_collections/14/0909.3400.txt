The existence and stability of dissipative breathers in rf SQUID
(Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) arrays is investigated
numerically. In such arrays, the nonlinearity which is intrinsic to each SQUID,
along with the weak magnetic coupling of each SQUID to its nearest neighbors,
result in the formation of discrete breathers. We analyze several discrete
breather excitations in rf SQUID arrays driven by alternating flux sources in
the presence of losses. The delicate balance between internal power losses and
input power, results in the formation of dissipative discrete breather (DDB)
structures up to relatively large coupling parameters. It is shown that DDBs
may locally alter the magnetic response of an rf SQUID array from paramagnetic
to diamagnetic or vice versa.
