We started a program to construct several grids of suitable model atmospheres
and synthetic spectra for hot subdwarf O stars computed, for comparative
purposes, in LTE, NLTE, with and without metals. For the moment, we use our
grids to perform fits on our spectrum of SDSS J160043.6+074802.9 (J1600+0748
for short), this unique pulsating sdO star. Our best fit is currently obtained
with NLTE model atmospheres including carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in solar
abundances, which leads to the following parameters for SDSS J1600+0748 : Teff
= 69 060 +/- 2080 K, log g = 6.00 +/- 0.09 and log N(He)/N(H) = -0.61 +/- 0.06.
Improvements are needed, however, particularly for fitting the available He II
lines. It is hoped that the inclusion of Fe will help remedy the situation.
