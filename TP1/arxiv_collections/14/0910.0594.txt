Ho$\check{\textbf{r}}$ava proposed a non-relativistic renormalizable theory
of gravitation, which is reduced to general relativity (GR) in large distances
(infra-red regime (IR)). It is believed that this theory is an ultra-violet
(UV) completion for the classical theory of gravitation. In this paper, after a
brief review of some fundamental features of this theory, we investigate it for
a static cylindrical symmetric solution which describes \emph{Cosmic string} as
a special case. We have also investigated some possible solutions, and have
seen that how the classical GR field equations are modified for generic
potential $V (g)$. In one case there is an algebraic constraint on the values
of three coupling constants. Finally as a pioneering work we deduce the most
general \emph{cosmic string} in this theory. We explicitly show that how the
\emph{coupling constants} distort the mass parameter of \emph{cosmic string}.
We deduce an explicit function for mass per unit length of the space-time as a
function of the \emph{coupling constants}. We compare this function with
another which Aryal et al [58] have found in GR.Also we calculate the
self-force on a massive particle near Ho$\check{\textbf{r}}$ava-Lifshitz
straight string and we give a typical order for the \emph{coupling constants}
$g_{9}$. This order of magnitude proposes a cosmological test for validity of
this theory.
