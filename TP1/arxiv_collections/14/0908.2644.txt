A given set of data-points in some feature space may be associated with a
Schrodinger equation whose potential is determined by the data. This is known
to lead to good clustering solutions. Here we extend this approach into a
full-fledged dynamical scheme using a time-dependent Schrodinger equation.
Moreover, we approximate this Hamiltonian formalism by a truncated calculation
within a set of Gaussian wave functions (coherent states) centered around the
original points. This allows for analytic evaluation of the time evolution of
all such states, opening up the possibility of exploration of relationships
among data-points through observation of varying dynamical-distances among
points and convergence of points into clusters. This formalism may be further
supplemented by preprocessing, such as dimensional reduction through singular
value decomposition or feature filtering.
