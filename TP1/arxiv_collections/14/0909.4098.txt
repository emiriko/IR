We study the dynamics of pure phase decoherence for a particle hopping around
an N-site ring, coupled both to a spin bath and to an Aharonov-Bohm flux which
threads the ring. Analytic results are found for the dynamics of the influence
functional and of the reduced density matrix of the particle, both for initial
single wave-packet states, and for states split initially into 2 separate
wave-packets moving at different velocities. We also give results for the
dynamics of the current as a function of time.
