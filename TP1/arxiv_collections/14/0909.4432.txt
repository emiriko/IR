In order to clarify the mechanism of spin polarization in potassium-loaded
zeolite A, we perform {\em ab initio} density-functional calculations. We find
that (i) the system comprising only non-magnetic elements (Al, Si, O and K) can
indeed exhibit ferromagnetism, (ii) while the host cage makes a confining
quantum-well potential in which $s$- and $p$-like states are formed, the
potassium-4$s$ electrons accommodated in the p-states are responsible for the
spin polarization, and (iii) the size of the magnetic moment sensitively
depends on the atomic configuration of the potassium atoms. We show that the
spin polarization can be described systematically in terms of the confining
potential and the crystal field splitting of the p-states.
