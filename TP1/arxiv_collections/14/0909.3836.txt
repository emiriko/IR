Northern hemisphere TeV gamma-ray observatories such as Milagro and Tibet
AS$\gamma$ have demonstrated the importance of all-sky instruments by
discovering previously unidentified sources that may be the PeVatrons producing
cosmic rays up to the "knee" in the cosmic ray spectrum. We evaluate the
potential of IceCube to identify similar sources in the southern sky by
detailing an analytic approach to determine fluxes of muons from TeV gamma-ray
showers. We apply this approach to known gamma-ray sources such as supernova
remnants. We find that, similar to Milagro, detection is possible in 10 years
for point-like PeVatrons with fluxes stronger than several 10^{-11} particles
TeV^{-1} cm^{-2} s^{-1}.
