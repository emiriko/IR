The main objective of this presentation is to point out that the Upper bound
on the cutoff in lattice Electroweak theory is still unknown. The consideration
of the continuum theory is based on the perturbation expansion around trivial
vacuum. The internal structure of the lattice Weinberg - Salam model may appear
to be more complicated especially in the region of the phase diagram close to
the phase transition between the physical Higgs phase and the unphysical
symmetric phase of the lattice model, where the continuum physics is to be
approached. We represent the results of our numerical investigation of the
quenched model at infinite bare scalar self coupling $\lambda$. These results
demonstrate that at $\lambda = \infty$ the upper bound on the cutoff is around
$\frac{\pi}{a} = 1.4$ Tev. The preliminary results for finite $\lambda$ are
also presented. Basing on these results we cannot yet make a definite
conclusion on the maximal value of the cutoff admitted in the lattice model,
although we have found that the cutoff cannot exceed the value around $1.4 \pm
0.2$ Tev for a certain particular choice of the couplings ($\lambda = 0.009$,
$\beta = 12$, $\theta_W = 30^o$) for the lattices of sizes up to
$12^3\times16$. We also observe that the topological defects, which are to be
identified with quantum Nambu monopoles, dominate in vacuum in the vicinity of
the transition. This indicates that the vacuum of the model is different from
the trivial one. In addition we remind the results of the previous numerical
investigations of the SU(2) gauge - Higgs model, where the maximal reported
value of the cutoff was around 1.5 Tev.
