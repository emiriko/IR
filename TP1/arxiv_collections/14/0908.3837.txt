We have developed a dynamical model for a unified description of the
pion-nucleus scattering and photo- and neutrino-induced coherent pion
production on nuclei. Our approach is based on a combined use of the Sato-Lee
model for the electroweak pion production on a single nucleon and the
Delta-hole model of pion-nucleus scattering. Numerical calculations are carried
out for the case of the C12 target. After testing our model with the use of the
pion photo-production data, we confront our predictions of the neutrino-induced
coherent pion production reactions with the recent data from K2K and MiniBooNE.
