Several early spyglasses are depicted in five paintings by Jan Brueghel the
Elder completed between 1608 and 1625, as he was court painter of Archduke
Albert VII of Habsburg. An optical tube that appears in the Extensive Landscape
with View of the Castle of Mariemont, dated 1608-1612, represents the first
painting of a telescope whatsoever. We collected some documents showing that
Albert VII obtained spyglasses very early directly from Lipperhey or Sacharias
Janssen. Thus the painting likely reproduces one of the first man-made
telescopes ever. Two other instruments appear in two Allegories of Sight made
in the years 1617 and 1618. These are sophisticated instruments and the
structure suggests that they may be keplerian, but this is about two decades
ahead this mounting was in use.
