Systems of hydrodynamic type equations derived from the Navier-Stokes
equations and the boundary layer equations are considered. A transformation of
the Crocco type reducing the equation order for the longitudinal velocity
component is described. The issues of nonlinear stability of the obtained
solutions are studied. It is found that a specific feature of many solutions of
the Navier-Stokes equations is instability. The nonlinear instability of
solutions is proved by a new exact method, which may be useful for the analysis
of other nonlinear physical models and phenomena.
