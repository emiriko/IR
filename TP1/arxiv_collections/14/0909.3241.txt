We have designed and constructed a second-generation version of the Dispersed
Fourier Transform Spectrograph, or dFTS. This instrument combines a spectral
interferometer with a dispersive spectrograph to provide high-accuracy,
high-resolution optical spectra of stellar targets. The new version, dFTS2, is
based upon the design of our prototype, with several modifications to improve
the system throughput and performance. We deployed dFTS2 to the Steward
Observatory 2.3-meter Bok Telescope from June 2007 to June 2008, and undertook
an observing program on spectroscopic binary stars, with the goal of
constraining the velocity amplitude K of the binary orbits with 0.1% accuracy,
a significant improvement over most of the orbits reported in the literature.
We present results for radial velocity reference stars and orbit solutions for
single-lined spectroscopic binaries.
