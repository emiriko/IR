We briefly describe some recent observational results, mainly at X-ray
wavelengths, on the winds of luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs). These
winds likely play a significant role in galaxy feedback. Topics covered include
(1) Relations between X-ray and UV absorption in Broad Absorption Line (BAL)
and mini-BAL quasars; (2) X-ray absorption in radio-loud BAL quasars; and (3)
Evidence for relativistic iron K BALs in the X-ray spectra of a few bright
quasars. We also mention some key outstanding problems and prospects for future
advances; e.g., with the International X-ray Observatory (IXO).
