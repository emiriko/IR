In this work we calculate the branching ratios of semi-leptonic and
non-leptonic decays of $\Lambda_b$ into light baryons ($p$ and $\Lambda$), as
well as the measurable asymmetries which appear in the processes, in the light
front quark model (LFQM). In the calculation, we adopt the diquark picture and
discuss the justifiability of applying the picture in our case. Our result on
the branching ratio of $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda+J/\psi$ is in good agreement with
data. More predictions are made in the same model and the results will be
tested in the future experiments which will be conducted at LHCb and even ILC.
