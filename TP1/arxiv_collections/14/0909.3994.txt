Results are presented for the two-body decays of mesons into light
neutralinos and from the first complete calculation of the loop-induced decays
of kaons to pions plus light neutralinos and of B mesons to kaons plus light
neutralinos. The branching ratios are shown to be strongly suppressed within
the MSSM with minimal flavor violation, and no bounds on the neutralino mass
can be inferred from experimental data, i.e. a massless neutralino is allowed.
