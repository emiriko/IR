We study the properties of graphene wormholes in which a short nanotube acts
as a bridge between two graphene sheets, where the honeycomb carbon lattice is
curved from the presence of 12 heptagonal defects. By taking the nanotube
bridge with very small length compared to the radius, we develop an effective
theory of Dirac fermions to account for the low-energy electronic properties of
the wormholes in the continuum limit, where the frustration induced by the
heptagonal defects is mimicked by a line of fictitious gauge flux attached to
each of them. We find in particular that, when the effective gauge flux from
the topological defects becomes maximal, the zero-energy modes of the Dirac
equation can be arranged into two triplets, that can be thought as the
counterpart of the two triplets of zero modes that arise in the dual instance
of the continuum limit of large spherical fullerenes. We further investigate
the graphene wormhole spectra by performing a numerical diagonalization of
tight-binding hamiltonians for very large lattices realizing the wormhole
geometry. The correspondence between the number of localized electronic states
observed in the numerical approach and the effective gauge flux predicted in
the continuum limit shows that graphene wormholes can be consistently described
by an effective theory of two Dirac fermion fields in the curved geometry of
the wormhole, opening the possibility of using real samples of the carbon
material as a playground to experiment with the interaction between the
background curvature and the Dirac fields.
