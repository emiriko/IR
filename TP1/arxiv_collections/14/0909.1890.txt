The CMIP3 multi-model ensemble spread most likely underestimates the real
model uncertainty in future climate predictions because of the similarity, and
shared defects, of the models in the ensemble. To generate an appropriate level
of uncertainty, the spread needs inflating. We derive the mathematical
connection between an assumed level of correlation between the model output and
the necessary inflation of the spread, and illustrate the connection by making
temperature predictions for the UK for the 21st century using four different
correlation scenarios.
