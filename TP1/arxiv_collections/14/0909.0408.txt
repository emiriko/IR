We investigate the semigroup structure of bosonic Gaussian quantum channels.
Particular focus lies on the sets of channels which are divisible, idempotent
or Markovian (in the sense of either belonging to one-parameter semigroups or
being infinitesimal divisible). We show that the non-compactness of the set of
Gaussian channels allows for remarkable differences when comparing the
semigroup structure with that of finite dimensional quantum channels. For
instance, every irreversible Gaussian channel is shown to be divisible in spite
of the existence of Gaussian channels which are not infinitesimal divisible. A
simpler and known consequence of non-compactness is the lack of generators for
certain reversible channels. Along the way we provide new representations for
classes of Gaussian channels: as matrix semigroup, complex valued positive
matrices or in terms of a simple form describing almost all one-parameter
semigroups.
