In this fluid dynamics video, we demonstrate the microscale mixing
enhancement of passive tracer particles in suspensions of swimming microalgae,
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. These biflagellated, single-celled eukaryotes (10
micron diameter) swim with a "breaststroke" pulling motion of their flagella at
speeds of about 100 microns/s and exhibit heterogeneous trajectory shapes.
Fluorescent tracer particles (2 micron diameter) allowed us to quantify the
enhanced mixing caused by the swimmers, which is relevant to suspension feeding
and biogenic mixing. Without swimmers present, tracer particles diffuse slowly
due solely to Brownian motion. As the swimmer concentration is increased, the
probability density functions (PDFs) of tracer displacements develop strong
exponential tails, and the Gaussian core broadens. High-speed imaging (500 Hz)
of tracer-swimmer interactions demonstrates the importance of flagellar beating
in creating oscillatory flows that exceed Brownian motion out to about 5 cell
radii from the swimmers. Finally, we also show evidence of possible cooperative
motion and synchronization between swimming algal cells.
