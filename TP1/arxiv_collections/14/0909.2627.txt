We study pulse propagation in one-dimensional chains of spherical granules
decorated with small grains placed between large granules. The effect of the
small granules can be captured by replacing the decorated chains by undecorated
chains of large granules of appropriately renormalized mass and effective
interaction between the large granules. This allows us to obtain simple
analytic expressions for the pulse propagation properties using a
generalization of the binary collision approximation introduced in our earlier
work [Phys. Rev. E in print (2009); Phys. Rev. E {\bf 69}, 037601 (2004)]
