Under which conditions do outcome probabilities of measurements possess a
quantum-mechanical model? This kind of problem is solved here for the case of
two dichotomic von Neumann measurements which can be applied repeatedly to a
quantum system with trivial dynamics. The solution uses methods from the theory
of operator algebras and the theory of moment problems. The ensuing conditions
reveal surprisingly simple relations between certain quantum-mechanical
probabilities. It also shown that generally, none of these relations holds in
general probabilistic models. This result might facilitate further experimental
discrimination between quantum mechanics and other general probabilistic
theories.
