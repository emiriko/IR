The present status of Chiral Perturbation Theory in the meson sector is
discussed concentrating on recent developments. This write-up contains short
discussions on a listing a few historical papers, the principles behind ChPT,
two-flavour ChPT including some comments about the pion polarizability,
three-flavour ChPT with a discussion of the recently found relations as tests
of ChPT and preliminary results of a new fit of the NLO low-energy-constants
(LECs). It discusses somewhat deeper $\eta\to3\pi$ and the arguments for the
existence of a ``hard pion ChPT'' and its application to $K\to2\pi$.
