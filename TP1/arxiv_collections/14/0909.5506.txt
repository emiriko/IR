Quantum Monte Carlo and quantum chemistry techniques are used to investigate
pseudopotential models of the lithium hydride (LiH) molecule. Interatomic
potentials are calculated and tested by comparing with the experimental
spectroscopic constants and well depth. Two recently-developed pseudopotentials
are tested, and the effects of introducing a Li core polarization potential are
investigated. The calculations are sufficiently accurate to isolate the errors
from the pseudopotentials and core polarization potential. Core-valence
correlation and core relaxation are found to be important in determining the
interatomic potential.
