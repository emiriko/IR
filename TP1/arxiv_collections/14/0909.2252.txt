Using deep Chandra observations of the Hydra A galaxy cluster, we examine the
metallicity structure near the central galaxy and along its powerful radio
source. We show that the metallicity of the intracluster medium is enhanced by
up to 0.2 dex along the radio jets and lobes compared to the metallicity of the
undisturbed gas. The enhancements extend from a radius of 20 kpc from the
central galaxy to a distance of ~ 120 kpc. We estimate the total iron mass that
has been transported out of the central galaxy to be between 2 x 10^7 M_sun and
7 x 10^7 M_sun which represents 10% - 20% of the iron mass within the central
galaxy. The energy required to lift this gas is roughly 1% to 5% of the total
energetic output of the AGN. Evidently, Hydra A's powerful radio source is able
to redistribute metal-enriched, low entropy gas throughout the core of the
galaxy cluster. The short re-enrichment time scale < 10^9 yr implies that the
metals lost from the central galaxy will be quickly replenished.
