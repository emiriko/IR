The goal of this note is to show that the analysis of the minimum output
p-Renyi entropy of a typical quantum channel essentially amounts to applying
Milman's version of Dvoretzky's Theorem about almost Euclidean sections of
high-dimensional convex bodies. This conceptually simplifies the
(nonconstructive) argument by Hayden-Winter disproving the additivity
conjecture for the minimal output p-Renyi entropy (for p>1).
