Spin accumulation in a 2D electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit interaction
subject to an electric field can take place without bulk spin currents (edge
spin Hall effect). This is demonstrated for the collisional regime using the
non-equilibrium distribution function determined from the standard Boltzmann
equation. Spin accumulation originates from interference of incident and
reflected electron waves at the sample boundary.
