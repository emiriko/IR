We present a new method to accelerate the HITS algorithm by exploiting
hyperlink structure of the web graph. The proposed algorithm extends the idea
of authority and hub scores from HITS by introducing two diagonal matrices
which contain constants that act as weights to make authority pages more
authoritative and hub pages more hubby. This method works because in the web
graph good authorities are pointed to by good hubs and good hubs point to good
authorities. Consequently, these pages will collect their scores faster under
the proposed algorithm than under the standard HITS. We show that the authority
and hub vectors of the proposed algorithm exist but are not necessarily be
unique, and then give a treatment to ensure the uniqueness property of the
vectors. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can improve
HITS computations, especially for back button datasets.
