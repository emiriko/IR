We study the metal-insulator transition in a tight-binding one-dimensional
(1D) model with long-range correlated disorder. In the case of diagonal
disorder with site energy within $[-\frac{W}{2},\frac{W}{2}]$ and having a
power-law spectral density $S(k)\propto k^{-\alpha}$, we investigate the
competition between the disorder and correlation. Using the transfer-matrix
method and finite-size scaling analysis, we find out that there is a finite
range of extended eigenstates for $\alpha>2$, and the mobility edges are at
$\pm E_{c}=\pm|2-W/2|$. Furthermore, we find the critical exponent $\nu$ of
localization length ($\xi \sim |E-E_{c}|^{-\nu}$) to be
$\nu=1+1.4e^{2-\alpha}$. Thus our results indicate that the disorder strength
$W$ determines the mobility edges and the degree of correlation $\alpha$
determines the critical exponents.
