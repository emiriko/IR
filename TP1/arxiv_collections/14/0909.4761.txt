We describe and illustrate a simple procedure for identifying a liquid
interface from atomic coordinates. In particular, a coarse grained density
field is constructed, and the interface is defined as a constant density
surface for this coarse grained field. In applications to a molecular dynamics
simulation of liquid water, it is shown that this procedure provides
instructive and useful pictures of liquid-vapor interfaces and of
liquid-protein interfaces.
