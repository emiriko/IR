In the context of exploring mass distributions of dark matter haloes in giant
ellipticals, we extend the analysis carried out Merrifield and Kuijken (1998)
for stellar line profiles of shells created in nearly radial mergers of
galaxies. We show that line-of-sight velocity distributions are more complex
than previously predicted. We simulate shell formation and analyze the
detectability of spectroscopic signatures of shells after convolution with
spectral PSFs.
