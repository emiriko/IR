A significant and growing portion of systematic error on a number of
fundamental parameters in astrophysics and cosmology is due to uncertainties
from absolute photometric and flux standards. A path toward achieving major
reduction in such uncertainties may be provided by satellite-mounted light
sources, resulting in improvement in the ability to precisely characterize
atmospheric extinction, and thus helping to usher in the coming generation of
precision results in astronomy. Toward this end, we have performed a campaign
of observations of the 532 nm pulsed laser aboard the CALIPSO satellite, using
a portable network of cameras and photodiodes, to precisely measure atmospheric
extinction.
