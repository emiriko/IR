We study the character change of the pionic condensation at finite isospin
chemical potential \mu_\mathrm{I} by adopting the linear sigma model as a
non-local interaction between quarks. At low |\mu_\mathrm{I}| the condensation
is purely bosonic, then the Cooper pairing around the Fermi surface grows
gradually as |\mu_\mathrm{I}| increases. This q-\bar q pairing is weakly
coupled in comparison with the case of the q-q pairing that leads to color
superconductivity.
