In a recent paper (Svanda et al., 2008, A&A 477, 285) we pointed out that,
based on the tracking of Doppler features in the full-disc MDI Dopplergrams,
the active regions display two dynamically different regimes. We speculated
that this could be a manifestation of the sudden change in the active regions
dynamics, caused by the dynamic disconnection of sunspots from their magnetic
roots as proposed by Schuessler & Rempel (2005, A&A 441, 337). Here we
investigate the dynamic behaviour of the active regions recorded in the
high-cadence MDI data over the last solar cycle in order to confirm the
predictions in the Schuessler's & Rempel's paper. We find that, after drastic
reduction of the sample, which is done to avoid disturbing effects, a large
fraction of active regions displays a sudden decrease in the rotation speed,
which is compatible with the mechanism of the dynamic disconnection of sunspots
from their parental magnetic structures.
