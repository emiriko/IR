Quantum fluctuations concerning the shape of nuclei are treated within the
framework of covariant density functional theory. Long range correlations
beyond mean field are taken into account by configuration mixing of wave
functions with triaxial shapes and the restoration of spontaneously broken
rotational symmetries through three-dimensional angular momentum projection.
The "controversial" nucleus 16C is treated as an example and it is found that
its ground state has a triaxial shape but with large shape fluctuations. They
are of crucial importance for a proper description of the spectroscopic
properties of such nuclei.
