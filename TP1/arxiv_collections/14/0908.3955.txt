It is a general point of view that in the absence of an external field, the
nucleus of an atom is at the center of the electron cloud, so that all kinds of
atoms do not have permanent electric dipole moment (EDM). In the fact, the idea
is untested. Using two special capacitors containing Potassium vapor we
discovered that the electric susceptibility Xe of K atoms is directly
proportional to the density N, and inversely to the temperature T, as polar
molecules. The experimental K material with purity 0.9995 is supplied by Strem
Chemicals Co. USA. We have distinguished between permanent and induced dipole
moments carefully. There is good evidence that a ground state neutral K atom is
polar atom and has a large permanent EDM, d (K) =2.53\times10-29C.m. New
example of time-reversal violation occurred in K atoms. Why has the linear
Stark effect of K atoms not been observed? The article discussed the question
thoroughly. The most linear Stark shift of K atoms is only 0.0041nm. It is so
small, in fact, that a direct observation of the shifts is not possible! These
results can be repeated in other laboratories. Our experimental apparatus are
still kept, we welcome anyone who is interested in the experiments to visit and
examine it.
