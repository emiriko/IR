We report on study of the vortex liquid in Pb-doped Bi-2223 single crystal
using the in-plane resistivity measurements as a function of temperature and
magnetic field up to 6T applied perpendicular to CuO planes. Below Tc at the
upper part of superconducting transition we found Arrhenius-like resistivity
behavior. With further temperature decrease close to resistivity onset
resistivity shows power law dependence on temperature signaling approaching
vortex-glass transition. The critical exponents nu(z-1)=4.6 plus-minus 0.5 are
found to be field independent within experimental errors. We also present
magnetic phase diagram defining region of nonzero critical current for Pb-doped
Bi-2223 single crystal.
