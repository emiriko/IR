In a collider final focus (FF) system chromaticity generated by FF
quadrupoles is compensated by sextupole pairs with -I map in between to cancel
geometrical aberrations. However, it works perfectly only for zero-length
sextupole kicks; for realistic thick magnets only quadratic aberrations are
cancelled exactly while higher order terms appear and may deteriorate the
transverse dynamic aperture. The latter is particularly important for
prospective projects of the future circular colliders based on the Crab-Waist
collision approach where extremely low beta at IP generates very large
chromatic effects. In the present paper, we study these high aberrations by the
power series technique and propose the method of the dynamic aperture recover.
Results of analytic study are compared with those obtained by tracking.
