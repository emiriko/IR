The model of space in the form of a static gas of wormholes is considered. It
is shown that the scattering on such a gas gives rise to the formation of a
specific diffuse halo around every discrete source. Properties of the halo are
determined by the distribution of wormholes in space and the halo has to be
correlated with the distribution of dark matter. This allows to explain the
absence of dark matter in intergalactic gas clouds. Numerical estimates for
parameters of the gas of wormholes are also obtained.
