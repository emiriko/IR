The new phenomenon of symbiotic symmetries is described in the context of the
Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (THDM). The quartic potential has two or more separate
sectors with unequal symmetries, but these unequal symmetries persist even
though the different sectors are renormalized by one another. We discuss all
such symmetries of the THDM, consistent with the SU(2) x U(1) gauge
interactions, using the Pauli formalism.
