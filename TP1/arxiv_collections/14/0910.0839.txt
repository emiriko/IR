I describe the conceptual and mathematical basis of an approach which
describes gravity as an emergent phenomenon. Combining principle of equivalence
and principle of general covariance with known properties of local Rindler
horizons, perceived by observers accelerated with respect to local inertial
frames, one can prove that the field equations describing gravity in any
diffeomorphism invariant theory can be given a thermodynamic re-interpretation.
This fact, in turn, leads us to the possibility of deriving the field equations
of gravity by maximising a suitably defined entropy functional, without using
the metric tensor as a dynamical variable. The approach synthesises concepts
from quantum theory, thermodynamics and gravity leading to a fresh perspective
on the nature of gravity. The description is presented here in the form of a
dialogue, thereby addressing several frequently-asked-questions.
