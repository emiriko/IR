Near-field force and energy exchange between two objects due to quantum
electrodynamic fluctuations give rise to interesting phenomena such as Casimir
and van der Waals forces, and thermal radiative transfer exceeding Planck's
theory of blackbody radiation. Although significant progress has been made in
the past on the precise measurement of Casimir force related to zero-point
energy, experimental demonstration of near-field enhancement of radiative heat
transfer is difficult. In this work, we present a sensitive technique of
measuring near-field radiative transfer between a microsphere and a substrate
using a bi-material atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever, resulting in
"heat transfer-distance" curves. Measurements of radiative transfer between a
sphere and a flat substrate show the presence of strong near-field effects
resulting in enhancement of heat transfer over the predictions of the Planck
blackbody radiation theory.
