Upward through-going muons in the Lake Baikal Neutrino Experiment arriving
from the ecliptic plane have been analyzed using NT200 data samples of the
years 1998-2002 (1007 live days). We derive upper limits on muon fluxes from
annihilation processes of hypothetical WIMP dark matter particles in the center
of the Sun.
