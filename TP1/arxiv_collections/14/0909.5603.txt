It can be computationally advantageous to perform computer simulations in a
Lorentz boosted frame for a certain class of systems. However, even if the
computer model relies on a covariant set of equations, it has been pointed out
that algorithmic difficulties related to discretization errors may have to be
overcome in order to take full advantage of the potential speedup. We summarize
the findings, the difficulties and their solutions, and show that the technique
enables simulations important to several areas of accelerator physics that are
otherwise problematic, including self-consistent modeling in three-dimensions
of laser wakefield accelerator stages at energies of 10 GeV and above.
