A new method is proposed for the analysis of specular and off-specular
reflectivity from supported lipid bilayers. Both thermal fluctuations and the
"static" roughness induced by the substrate are carefully taken into account.
Examples from supported bilayers and more complex systems comprising a bilayer
adsorbed or grafted on the substrate and another "floating" bilayer are given.
The combined analysis of specular and off-specular reflectivity allows the
precise determination of the structure of adsorbed and floating bilayers, their
tension, bending rigidity and interaction potentials. We show that this new
method gives a unique opportunity to investigate phenomena like protusion modes
of adsorbed bilayers and opens the way to the investigation of more complex
systems including different kinds of lipids, cholesterol or peptides.
