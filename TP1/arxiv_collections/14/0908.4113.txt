We propose and experimentally verify a scheme to engineer arbitrary states of
traveling light field up to the two-photon level. The desired state is remotely
prepared in the signal channel of spontaneous parametric down-conversion by
means of conditional measurements on the idler channel. The measurement
consists of bringing the idler field into interference with two ancilla
coherent states, followed by two single-photon detectors, which, in
coincidence, herald the preparation event. By varying the amplitudes and phases
of the ancillae, we can prepare any arbitrary superposition of zero- one- and
two-photon states.
