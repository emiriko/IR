There exists multiple branch points in the energy spectrum for some
\emph{PT}-symmetric periodic potentials, where the real eigenvalues turn into
complex ones. By studying the transmission amplitude for a localized complex
potential, we elucidate the physical origin of the breakdown of perturbation
method and Born approximation. Mostly importantly, we derive an analytic
criteria to determine why, when and where the bifurcation will occur.
