In those cases where charge stripe order has been observed in cuprates, the
crystal structure is such that the average rotational symmetry of the CuO2
planes is reduced from four-fold to two-fold. As a result, one could argue that
the reduced lattice symmetry is essential to the existence of stripe order. We
use pressure to restore the average four-fold symmetry in a single crystal of
La(1.875)Ba(0.125)CuO(4), and show by x-ray diffraction that charge stripe
order still occurs. Thus, electronically-driven stripe order can spontaneously
break the lattice symmetry.
