Shubnikov-de Haas and angular dependent magnetoresistance oscillations have
been used to explore the role of anion size, magnetic moment, and disorder in
the organic conductors kappa-(BETS)_2GaBr_{4} and kappa-(BETS)_2FeCl_{2}_Br_{2}
in the isomorphic class kappa-(BETS)_2Ga_{1-x}Fe_{x}Cl_{4-y}_Br_{y}. The
results, combined with previous work, show correlations between the anion
composition (Ga_{1-x}Fe_{x}Cl_{4-y}_Br_{y}) and the superconducting transition
temperature, effective mass, Fermi surface topology, and the mean free path.
