We report on the detection of diffuse radio emission in the X-ray luminous
and massive galaxy cluster A1351 (z=0.322) using archival Very Large Array data
at 1.4 GHz. Given its central location, morphology, and Mpc-scale extent, we
classify the diffuse source as a giant radio halo. X-ray and weak lensing
studies show A1351 to be a system undergoing a major merger. The halo is
associated with the most massive substructure. The presence of this source is
explained assuming that merger-driven turbulence may re-accelerate high-energy
particles in the intracluster medium and generate diffuse radio emission on the
cluster scale. The position of A1351 in the logP$_{1.4 GHz}$ - logL$_{X}$ plane
is consistent with that of all other radio-halo clusters known to date,
supporting a causal connection between the unrelaxed dynamical state of massive
($>10^{15} M_{\odot}$) clusters and the presence of giant radio halos.
