GX 339-4 has been one of the key sources for unravelling the accretion
ejection coupling in accreting stellar mass black holes. After a long period of
quiescence between 1999 and 2002, GX 339-4 underwent a series of 4 outbursts
that have been intensively observed by many ground based observatories [radio,
infrared(IR), optical] and satellites (X-rays). Here, we present results of
these broad-band observational campaigns, focusing on the optical-IR
(OIR)/X-ray flux correlations over the four outbursts. We found tight OIR/X-ray
correlations over four decades with the presence of a break in the IR/X-ray
correlation in the hard state. This correlation is the same for all four
outbursts. This can be interpreted in a consistent way by considering a
synchrotron self-Compton origin of the X-rays in which the break frequency
varies between the optically thick and thin regime of the jet spectrum. We also
highlight the similarities and differences between optical/X-ray and IR/X-ray
correlations which suggest a jet origin of the near-IR emission in the hard
state while the optical is more likely dominated by the blackbody emission of
the accretion disc in both hard and soft state. However we find a non
negligible contribution of 40 per cent of the jet emission in the V-band during
the hard state.
  We finally concentrate on a soft-to-hard state transition during the decay of
the 2004 outburst by comparing the radio, IR, optical and hard X-rays light
curves. It appears that unusual delays between the peak of emission in the
different energy domains may provide some important constraints on jet
formation scenario.
