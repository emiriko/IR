We present an analysis of the \delta-Scuti star object HD 174936 (ID 7613)
observed by CoRoT during the first short run SRc01 (27 days). A total number of
422 frequencies we are extracted from the light curve using standard
prewhitening techniques. This number of frequencies was obtained by considering
a spectral significance limit of sig = 10 using the software package SigSpec.
Our analysis of the oscillation frequency spectrum reveals a spacing
periodicity of around 52 \muHz. Although modes considered here are not in the
asymptotic regime, a comparison with stellar models confirms that this
signature may stem from a quasi-periodic pattern similar to the so-called large
separation in solar-like stars.
