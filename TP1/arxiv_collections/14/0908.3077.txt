In the study of black-hole transients, an important problem that still needs
to be answered is how the high-energy part of the spectrum evolves from the
low-hard to the high-soft state, given that they have very different
properties. Recent results obtained with RXTE and INTEGRAL have given
inconsistent results. With RXTE, we have found that the high-energy cutoff in
GX 339-4 during the transition first decreases (during the low-hard state),
then increases again across the Hard-Intermediate state, to become unmeasurable
in the soft states (possibly because of statistical limitations). We show
Simbol-X will be able to determine the spectral shape with superb accuracy. As
the high-energy part of the spectrum is relatively less known than the one
below 20 keV, Simbol-X will provide important results that will help out
understanding of the extreme physical conditions in the vicinity of a
stellar-mass black hole.
