We describe phenomenologically well-known effects in close binary systems.
The uniform precession of an elliptical orbit is described by the adding of an
inverse cube to an inverse square of the distance. If the precession is small,
then the inverse cube contribution is small as compared to the one of inverse
square. At some value of the distance these contributions become equal.
