Radiative corrections to high energy scattering processes were given
previously in terms of universal soft and collinear functions. This paper gives
the collinear functions for all standard model particles, the general form of
the soft function, and explicit expressions for the soft functions for
fermion-fermion scattering, longitudinal and transverse gauge boson production,
single W/Z production, and associated Higgs production. An interesting subtlety
in the use of the Goldstone boson equivalence theorem for longitudinal W+
production is discussed.
