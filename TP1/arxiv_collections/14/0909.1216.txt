We prove a parametric generalization of the classical Poincare-Perron theorem
on stabilizing recurrence relations where we assume that the varying
coefficients of a recurrence depend on auxiliary parameters and converge
uniformly in these parameters to their limiting values. As an application we
study convergence of the ratios of families of functions satisfying finite
recurrence relations with varying functional coefficients. For example, we
explicitly describe the asymptotic ratio for sequences of biorthogonal
polynomials introduced by Ismail and Masson.
