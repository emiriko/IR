The Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule and related dispersive integrals connect
real and virtual Compton scattering to inclusive photo- and electroproduction.
Being based on universal principles as causality, unitarity, and gauge
invariance, these relations provide a unique testing ground to study the
internal degrees of freedom that hold a system together. The present
contribution reviews the spin-dependent sum rules and cross sections of the
nucleon. At small momentum transfer, the data sample information on the long
range phenomena (Goldstone bosons and collective resonances), whereas the
primary degrees of freedom (quarks and gluons) become visible at large momentum
transfer (short distance). The rich body of new data covers a wide range of
phenomena from coherent to incoherent processes, and from the generalized spin
polarizabilities on the low-energy side to higher twist effects in deep
inelastic scattering.
