We propose a novel method for observing the gravitational wave signature of
super-massive black hole (SMBH) mergers. This method is based on detection of a
specific type of gravitational waves, namely gravitational wave burst with
memory (BWM), using pulsar timing. We study the unique signature produced by
BWM in anomalous pulsar timing residuals. We show that the present day pulsar
timing precision allows one to detect BWM due to SMBH mergers from distances up
to 1 Gpc (for case of equal mass 10^8 Msun SMBH). Improvements in precision of
pulsar timing together with the increase in number of observed pulsars should
eventually lead to detection of a BWM signal due to SMBH merger, thereby making
the proposed technique complementary to the capabilities of the planned LISA
mission.
