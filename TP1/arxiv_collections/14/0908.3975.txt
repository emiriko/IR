We constrain the physical composition of the outflows of GRBs 080916C and
090510 with the prompt emission data and find that the former is likely
magnetic while the latter may be baryonic. The X-ray and optical afterglow
emission of both GRBs can be reasonably fitted using the standard external
shock model but the density profiles of the circum-burst medium are different.
We also propose a simple method to estimate the number of the seed photons
suppose the GeV afterglow photons are due to the inverse Compton radiation of
external forward shock electrons. The seed photons needed in the modeling are
too many to be realistic for both events. The synchrotron radiation of the
forward shock seems able to account for the GeV afterglow data.
