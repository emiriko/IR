From the preliminary stage of software engineering, selection of appropriate
enforcement of standards remained a challenge for stakeholders during entire
cycle of software development, but it can lead to reduce the efforts desired
for software maintenance phase. Corrective maintenance is the reactive
modification of a software product performed after delivery to correct
discovered faults. Studies conducted by different researchers reveal that
approximately 50 to 75 percent of the effort is spent on maintenance, out of
which about 17 to 21 percent is exercised on corrective maintenance. In this
paper, authors proposed a RCM (Reduce Corrective Maintenance) model which
represents the implementation process of number of checklists to guide the
stakeholders of all phases of software development. These check lists will be
filled by corresponding stake holder of all phases before its start. More
precise usage of the check list in relevant phase ensures successful
enforcement of analysis, design, coding and testing standards for reducing
errors in operation stage. Moreover authors represent the step by step
integration of checklists in software development life cycle through RCM model.
