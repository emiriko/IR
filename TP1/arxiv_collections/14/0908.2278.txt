We carry out relativistic many-body calculations of the static and dynamic
dipole polarizabilities of the ground $6s^2 ^1S_0$ and the first excited $6s6p
^3P^o_0$ states of Yb. With these polarizabilities, we compute several
properties of Yb relevant to optical lattice clocks operating on the $6s^2
^1S_0 - 6s6p ^3P^o_0$ transition. We determine (i) the first four {\em magic}
wavelengths of the laser field for which the frequency of the clock transition
is insensitive to the laser intensity. While the first magic wavelength is
known, we predict the second, the third and the forth magic wavelengths to be
551 nm, 465 nm, and 413 nm. (ii) We reevaluate the effect of black-body
radiation on the frequency of the clock transition, the resulting clock shift
at $T=300 \mathrm{K}$ being $-1.41(17)$ Hz. (iii) We compute long-range
interatomic van der Waals coefficients (in a.u.) $C_6(6s^2 ^1S_0 +6s^2 ^1S_0) =
1909(160)$, $C_6(6s^2 ^1S_0 + 6s6p ^3P_0) =2709(338) $, and $C_6(6s6p ^3P_0 +
6s6p ^3P_0) =3886(360) $. Finally, we determine the atom-wall interaction
coefficients (in a.u.), $C_3 (6s^2 ^1S_0) =3.34$ and $C_3 (6s6p ^3P_0) =3.68$.
We also address and resolve a disagreement between previous calculations of the
static polarizability of the ground state.
