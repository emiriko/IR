We derive density-dependent corrections to the in-medium nucleon-nucleon
interaction from the leading-order chiral three-nucleon force. To this order
there are six distinct one-loop diagrams contributing to the in-medium
nucleon-nucleon scattering T-matrix. Analytic expressions are presented for
each of these in both isospin-symmetric nuclear matter as well as nuclear
matter with a small isospin asymmetry. The results are combined with the
low-momentum nucleon-nucleon potential V(low-k) to obtain an effective
density-dependent interaction suitable for nuclear structure calculations. The
in-medium interaction is decomposed into partial waves up to orbital angular
momentum L = 2. Our results should be particularly useful in calculations where
an exact treatment of the chiral three-nucleon force would otherwise be
computationally prohibitive.
