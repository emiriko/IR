GRB 070610, which is also named Swift J195509.6+261406, is a peculiar
Galactic transient with significant variability on short timescales in both
X-ray and optical light curves. One possible explanation is that GRB
070610/Swift J195509.6 + 261406 is a soft gamma-ray repeater (SGR) in our
Galaxy. Here we use the fireball model which is usually recognized as the
standard model of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, and the energy injection
hypothesis to interpret the X-ray and optical afterglow light curves of GRB
070610/Swift J195509.6 + 261406. It is found that the model is generally
consistent with observations.
