Recent experiments have demonstrated a remarkable progress in implementing
and use of the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and particle tracking
techniques for the study of turbulence in He4. However, an interpretation of
the experimental data in the superfluid phase requires understanding how the
motion of tracer particles is affected by the two components, the viscous
normal fluid and the inviscid superfluid. Of a particular importance is the
problem of particle interactions with quantized vortex lines which may not only
strongly affect the particle motion, but, under certain conditions, may even
trap particles on quantized vortex cores. The article reviews recent
theoretical, numerical, and experimental results in this rapidly developing
area of research, putting critically together recent results, and solving
apparent inconsistencies. Also discussed is a closely related technique of
detection of quantized vortices negative ion bubbles in He4.
