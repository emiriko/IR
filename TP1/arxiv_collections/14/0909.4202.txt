In aerospace and defense, training is being carried out on the web by viewing
PowerPoint presentations, manuals and videos that are limited in their ability
to convey information to the technician. Interactive training in the form of 3D
is a more cost effective approach compared to creation of physical simulations
and mockups. This paper demonstrates how training using interactive 3D
simulations in elearning achieves a reduction in the time spent in training and
improves the efficiency of a trainee performing the installation or removal.
