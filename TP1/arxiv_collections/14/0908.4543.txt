A quantum version of the action principle in a simple covariant dynamical
theory of two relativistic particles is formulated. The central object of this
new formulation of quantum theory is a stationary eigenvalue of the quantum
action. This quantity defines a quantum geometry in a configuration space. In
the presence of "probe" fields it plays the role of a generation function of
observables.
