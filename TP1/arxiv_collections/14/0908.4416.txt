We argue that certain specific gluon excitations, other than conventional
glueballs, can propagate freely outside of hadrons and glueballs. We begin with
the result that the Abelian generators of $SU(N)$ QCD can be meaningfully
isolated by the Cho-Faddeev-Niemi-Shabanov decomposition. It has already been
shown by Cho \emph{et. al.} that the corresponding gluon excitations have a
gauge transformation whose form indicates that they are physical entities of
neutral colour charge. We contend that this colour neutrality permits them to
propagate freely, albeit with an effective mass due to interaction with the
confining chromomonopole condensate. According to the dual-superconductor model
of the QCD vacuum, this mass has an upper bound of $k_B T_c \sqrt{2}$. We
conclude with some expected experimental signatures.
