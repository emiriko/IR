We theoretically analyze Fermi-Bose mixtures consisting of light fermions and
heavy bosons that are loaded into optical lattices (ignoring the trapping
potential). To describe such mixtures, we consider the Fermi-Bose version of
the Falicov-Kimball model on a periodic lattice. This model can be exactly
mapped onto the spinless Fermi-Fermi Falicov-Kimball model at zero temperature
for all parameter space as long as the mixture is thermodynamically stable. We
employ dynamical mean-field theory to investigate the evolution of the
Fermi-Bose Falicov-Kimball model at higher temperatures. We calculate spectral
moment sum rules for the retarded Green's function and self-energy, and use
them to benchmark the accuracy of our numerical calculations, as well as to
reduce the computational cost by exactly including the tails of infinite
summations or products. We show how the occupancy of the bosons,
single-particle many-body density of states for the fermions, momentum
distribution, and the average kinetic energy evolve with temperature. We end by
briefly discussing how to experimentally realize the Fermi-Bose Falicov-Kimball
model in ultracold atomic systems.
