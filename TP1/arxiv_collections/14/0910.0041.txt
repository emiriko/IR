We demonstrate tunable frequency-converted light mediated by a chi-(2)
nonlinear photonic crystal nanocavity. The wavelength-scale InP-based cavity
supports two closely-spaced localized modes near 1550 nm which are resonantly
excited by a 130 fs laser pulse. The cavity is simultaneously irradiated with a
non-resonant probe beam, giving rise to rich second-order scattering spectra
reflecting nonlinear mixing of the different resonant and non-resonant
components. In particular, we highlight the radiation at the sum frequencies of
the probe beam and the respective cavity modes. This would be a useful,
minimally-invasive monitor of the joint occupancy state of multiple cavities in
an integrated optical circuit.
