To study the evolution of binary star clusters we have imaged 7 systems in
the Small Magellanic Cloud with SOAR 4-m telescope using B and V filters. The
sample contains pairs with well-separated components (d < 30 pc) as well as
systems that apparently merged, as evidenced by their unusual structures. By
employing isochrone fittings to their CMDs we have determined reddening, age
and metallicity and by fitting King models to their radial stellar density
profile we have estimated core radius. Disturbances of the density profile are
interpreted as an evidence of interaction. Circunstances as distances between
components and their age difference are addressed in terms of the timescales
involved to access the physical connection of the system. In two cases the age
difference is above 50 Myr, which suggests chance alignment, capture or
sequential star formation.
