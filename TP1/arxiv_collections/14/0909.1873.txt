A detailed study of the photophysical properties of several novel color
centers in chemical vapor deposition diamond is presented. These emitters show
narrow luminescence lines in the near infra-red. Single photon emission was
verified with continuous and pulsed excitation with emission rates at
saturation in the MHz regime, whilst direct lifetime measurements reveal
excited state lifetimes ranging from 1-14 ns. In addition, a number of quantum
emitters demonstrate two level behavior with no bunching present in the second
order correlation function. An improved method of evaluating the quantum
efficiency through the direct measurement of the collection efficiency from two
level emitters is presented and discussed. \
