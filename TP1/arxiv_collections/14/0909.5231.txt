One spin excitation states are involved in the transmission of quantum states
and entanglement through a quantum spin chain, the localization properties of
these states are crucial to achieve the transfer of information from one
extreme of the chain to the other. We investigate the bipartite entanglement
and localization of the one excitation states in a quantum $XX$ chain with one
impurity. The bipartite entanglement is obtained using the Concurrence and the
localization is analyzed using the inverse participation ratio. Changing the
strength of the exchange coupling of the impurity allows us to control the
number of localized or extended states. The analysis of the inverse
participation ratio allows us to identify scenarios where the transmission of
quantum states or entanglement can be achieved with a high degree of fidelity.
In particular we identify a regime where the transmission of quantum states
between the extremes of the chain is executed in a short transmission time
$\sim N/2$, where $N$ is the number of spins in the chain, and with a large
fidelity.
