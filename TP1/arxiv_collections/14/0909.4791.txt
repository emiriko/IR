In this work a lattice formulation of a supersymmetric theory is proposed and
tested that preserves the complete supersymmetry on the lattice. The results of
a one-dimensional nonperturbative simulation show the realization of the full
supersymmetry and the correct continuum limit of the theory. It is proven that
the violation of supersymmetry due to the absence of the Leibniz rule on the
lattice can be amended only with a nonlocal derivative and nonlocal interaction
term. The fermion doubling problem is also discussed, which leads to another
important source of supersymmetry breaking on the lattice. This problem is also
solved with a nonlocal realization.
