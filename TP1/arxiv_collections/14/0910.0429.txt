The presence of clusters of rare codons is known to negatively impact the
efficiency and accuracy of protein production. In this paper, we demonstrate a
statistical method of identifying such clusters in the coding sequence of a
gene. Using E. coli as our model organism, we show that genes having denser
clusters tend to have lower protein yields.
