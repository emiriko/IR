In molecular crystals like MePTCDI and PTCDA the molecule are regularly
arranged creating quasi-one-dimensional molecular stacks. The intermolecular
distance in a stack (about 3.3 A) is comparable with the electron--hole
distance in the excited molecule. The mixing between Frenkel excitons (FEs) and
charge-transfer excitons (CTEs) is very essential for the excitonic and
vibronic spectra of both crystals. In this paper, we make simulations of the
linear absorption spectra of the abovementioned crystals. The basic Hamiltonian
describes the FE--CTEs mixing in the molecular stack (point group $C_i$) caused
by two transfer mechanisms, notably of the electron and the hole on the
neighbor molecules. The vibronic spectra consist of mixed excitons and one
vibrational mode of an intramolecular vibration linearly coupled with FE and
CTEs. Using the vibronic approach, we calculate the linear optical
susceptibility in the excitonic and one-phonon vibronic regions of the
molecular stack, as well as of a crystal which contains two types of
nonequivalent stacks. We put the excitonic and vibrational parameters for the
crystals of PTCDA and MePTCDI fitted in the previous studies. We analyze the
general structure and some important features of the lineshape of the linear
absorption spectra in the spectral region of 15 000--23000 cm^{-1}. We vary the
values of the excitonic linewidth and the parameters of the linear
exciton--phonon coupling and look for the values which reproduce the absorption
lineshape similar to the absorption spectra of the investigated crystals. Our
study exhibits the necessity of introducing the FE--CTEs mixing in the
interpretation of the linear absorption spectra, especially of the MePTCDI
crystal.
