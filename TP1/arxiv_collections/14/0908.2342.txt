Berry phases and quantum fidelities for interacting spins have attracted
considerable attention, in particular in relation to entanglement properties of
spin systems and quantum phase transitions. These efforts mainly focus either
on spin pairs or the thermodynamic infinite spin limit, while studies of the
multipartite case of a finite number of spins are rare. Here, we analyze Berry
phases and quantum fidelities of the energetic ground state of a
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model consisting of three spin-1/2 particles
(qubits). We find explicit expressions for the Berry phase and fidelity
susceptibility of the full system as well as the mixed state Berry phase and
partial-state fidelity susceptibility of its one- and two-qubit subsystems. We
demonstrate a realization of a nontrivial magnetic monopole structure
associated with local, coordinated rotations of the three-qubit system around
the external magnetic field.
