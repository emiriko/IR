We show for a first time ever a prototype of a fully exclusive QCD NLO parton
shower for the initial state (albeit for a limited set of diagrams). It is
based on the rigorous theorems of the collinear factorisation, however the
standard DGLAP evolution kernels are replaced by their exclusive versions.
Contrary to the standard DGLAP approach, the constructed parton shower provides
fully exclusive events, i.e. four-momenta of all emitted partons. At the
inclusive level it is identical to the MS-bar scheme of the DGLAP evolution.
