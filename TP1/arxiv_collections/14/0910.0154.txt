In the MSSM with complex parameters, loop corrections to the decay of a stop
into a bottom quark and a chargino can lead to a CP violating decay rate
asymmetry.
  We calculate this asymmetry at full one-loop level and perform a detailed
numerical study, analyzing the dependence on the parameters and complex phases
involved. In addition, we take the Yukawa couplings of the top and bottom quark
running. We account for the constraints on the parameters coming from several
experimental limits.
  Asymmetries of several percent are obtained. We also comment on the
feasibility of measuring this asymmetry at the LHC.
