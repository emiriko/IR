In this paper, we accelerate a gravitational physics numerical modelling
application using hardware accelerators -- Cell processor and Tesla CUDA GPU.
We describe these new technologies and our approach in detail, and then present
our final performance results. We obtain well over an order-of-magnitude
performance gain in our application by making use of these many-core
architectures.
