We discuss several new observations of mesons with open charm. In particular,
we consider $D_{sJ}(2317)$ and $D_{sJ}(2460)$ and compare their isospin
violating decays into $D^{(*)}_s \pi$ to the radiative decays analysed using
light-cone QCD sum rules. The results support the interpretation of these two
mesons as ordinary $c{\bar s}$ states.
  In the case of $D_{sJ}(2860)$ and $D_{sJ}(2710)$ we compute the strong decays
in the heavy quark limit. Comparison of the results with recent measurements of
the BaBar Collaboration leads to identify $D_{sJ}(2710)$ with the first radial
excitation of $D_s^*$, while the identification is still uncertain in the case
of $D_{sJ}(2860)$.
