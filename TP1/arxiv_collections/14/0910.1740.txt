The LHCb spectrometer is designed with special emphasis on the discovery
potential of b and c-physics studies. The main characteristics of the setup are
discussed shortly. Since the completion of the LHCb detector, it has
extensively been commissioned with cosmic rays, simulated data, beam and
beam-induced events. Some commissioning results and an outlook to early physics
are presented.
