We investigate the entanglement content of the ground state of a system
characterized by effective elementary degrees of freedom with fractional
statistics. To this end, we explicitly construct the ground state for a chain
of $N$ spins with inverse square interaction (the Haldane-Shastry model) in the
presence of an external uniform magnetic field. For such a system at zero
temperature, we evaluate the entanglement in the ground state both at finite
size and in the thermodynamic limit. We relate the behavior of the quantum
correlations with the spinon condensation phenomenon occurring at the
saturation field.
