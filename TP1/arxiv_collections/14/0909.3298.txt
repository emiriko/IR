Andromeda X (And X) is a newly discovered low-luminosity M31 dwarf spheroidal
galaxy (dSph) found by Zucker et al. (2007) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS - York et al. 2000). In this paper, we present the first spectroscopic
study of individual red giant branch stars in And X, as a part of the SPLASH
Survey (Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo).
Using the Keck II telescope and multiobject DEIMOS spectrograph, we target two
spectroscopic masks over the face of the galaxy and measure radial velocities
for ~100 stars with a median accuracy of sigma_v ~ 3 km/s. The velocity
histogram for this field confirms three populations of stars along the sight
line: foreground Milky Way dwarfs at small negative velocities, M31 halo red
giants over a broad range of velocities, and a very cold velocity ``spike''
consisting of 22 stars belonging to And X with v_rad = -163.8 +/- 1.2 km/s. By
carefully considering both the random and systematic velocity errors of these
stars (e.g., through duplicate star measurements), we derive an intrinsic
velocity dispersion of just sigma_v = 3.9 +/- 1.2 km/s for And X, which for its
size, implies a minimum mass-to-light ratio of M/L =37^{+26}_{-19} assuming the
mass traces the light. Based on the clean sample of member stars, we measure
the median metallicity of And X to be [Fe/H] = -1.93 +/- 0.11, with a slight
radial metallicity gradient. The dispersion in metallicity is large,
sigma([Fe/H]) = 0.48, possibly hinting that the galaxy retained much of its
chemical enrichment products. We discuss the potential for better understanding
the formation and evolution mechanisms for M31's system of dSphs through
(current) kinematic and chemical abundance studies, especially in relation to
the Milky Way sample. (abridged version)
