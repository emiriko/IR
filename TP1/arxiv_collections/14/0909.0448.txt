We present the first detailed spatio-kinematical analysis and modelling of
the Southern planetary nebula SuWt 2. This object presents a problem for
current theories of planetary nebula formation and evolution, as it is not
known to contain a central post-main sequence star.
  Deep narrowband [NII]6584 images reveal the presence of faint bipolar lobes
emanating fromthe edges of the nebular ring. Longslit observations of the
H-alpha and [NII]6584 emission lines were obtained using EMMI on the 3.6-m
ESO-NTT. The spectra reveal the nebular morphology as a bright torus encircling
the waist of an extended bipolar structure. By deprojection, the inclination of
the ring is found to be 68$\degr$ $\pm$ 2$\degr$ (c.f. ~90$\degr$ for the
double A-type binary believed to lie at the centre of the nebula), and the ring
expansion velocity is found to be 28 km/s.
  Our findings are discussed with relation to possible formation scenarios for
SuWt 2. Through comparison of the nebular heliocentric systemic velocity, found
here to be -25 $\pm$ 5 km/s, and the heliocentric systemic velocity of the
double A-type binary, we conclude that neither component of the binary could
have been the nebular progenitor. However, we are unable to rule out the
presence of a third component to the system, which would have been the nebula
progenitor.
