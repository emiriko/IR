We developed a method to make GEM foils with a spherical geometry. Tests of
this procedure and with the resulting spherical GEMs are presented. Together
with a spherical drift electrode, a spherical conversion gap for x-rays can be
formed. This would eliminate the parallax error in an x-ray diffraction setup,
which limits the spatial resolution at wide diffraction angles. The method is
inexpensive and flexible towards possible changes in the design.
  We show advanced plans to make a prototype of an entirely spherical
triple-GEM detector, including a spherical readout structure. This detector
will have a superior position resolution, also at wide diffraction angles, and
a high rate capability. A completely spherical gaseous detector has never been
made before.
