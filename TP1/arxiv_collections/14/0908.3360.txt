We present a practical method to solve the proton-deuteron scattering problem
at energies above the three-body breakup threshold, in which we treat
three-body integral equations in coordinate space accommodating long-range
proton-proton Coulomb interactions. The method is examined for phase shift
parameters, and then applied to calculations of differential cross sections in
elastic and breakup reactions, analyzing powers, etc. with a realistic
nucleon-nucleon force and three-nucleon forces. Effects of the Coulomb force
and the three-nucleon forces on these observables are discussed in comparing
with experimental data.
