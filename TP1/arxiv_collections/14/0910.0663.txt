Transmission line, or wire, is always troublesome to integrated circuits
designers, but it could be helpful to parallel computing researchers. This
paper proposes the Virtual Transmission Method (VTM), which is a new
distributed and stationary iterative algorithm to solve the linear system
extracted from circuit. It tears the circuit by virtual transmission lines to
achieve distributed computing. For the symmetric positive definite (SPD) linear
system, VTM is proved to be convergent. For the unsymmetrical linear system,
numerical experiments show that VTM is possible to achieve better convergence
property than the traditional stationary algorithms. VTM could be accelerated
by some preconditioning techniques, and the convergence speed of VTM is fast
when its preconditioner is properly chosen.
