We measure the frequency spectra of random spin fluctuations, or "spin
noise", in ensembles of (In,Ga)As/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) at low temperatures.
We employ a spin noise spectrometer based on a sensitive optical Faraday
rotation magnetometer that is coupled to a digitizer and field-programmable
gate array, to measure and average noise spectra from 0-1 GHz continuously in
real time with sub-nanoradian/root-Hz sensitivity. Both electron and hole spin
fluctuations generate distinct noise peaks, whose shift and broadening with
magnetic field directly reveal their g-factors and dephasing rates within the
ensemble. A large, energy-dependent anisotropy of the in-plane hole g-factor is
clearly exposed, reflecting systematic variations in the average QD confinement
potential.
