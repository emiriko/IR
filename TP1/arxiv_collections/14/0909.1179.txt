We make a detailed analysis on the proton decay in a supersymmetric SO(10)
model proposed by K.Babu, I.Gogoladze, P.Nath, and R. Syed. We introduce quark
mixing, and find that this model can generate fermion mass without breaking the
experimental bound on proton decay. We also predict large CKM unitarity
violations.
