The charge flow from a single C60 molecule to another one has been probed.
The conformation and electronic states of both molecules on the contacting
electrodes have been characterized using a cryogenic scanning tunneling
microscope. While the contact conductance of a single molecule between two Cu
electrodes can vary up to a factor of three depending on electrode geometry,
the conductance of the C60-C60 contact is consistently lower by two orders of
magnitude. First-principles transport calculations reproduce the experimental
results, allow a determination of the actual C60-C60 distances, and identify
the essential role of the intermolecular link in bi- and trimolecular chains.
