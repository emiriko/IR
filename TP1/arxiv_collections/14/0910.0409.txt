The upgrade of the ISOLDE machine at CERN foresees a superconducting linac
based on two gap independently phased Nb sputtered Quarter Wave Resonators
(QWRs) working at 101.28MHz and producing an accelerating field of 6MV/m on
axis. A careful study of the fields in the cavity has been carried out in order
to pin down the crucial e-m parameters of the structure such as peak fields,
quality factor and e-m power dissipated on the cavity wall. A tuning system
with about 200kHz frequency range has been developed in order to cope with
fabrication tolerances. In this paper we will report on the cavity simulations.
The tuning plate design will be described. Finally the frequency measurements
on a cavity prototype at room temperature will be presented.
