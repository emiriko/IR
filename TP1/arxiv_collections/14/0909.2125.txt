We study the configurational properties of single polymers in a theta solvent
by Monte Carlo simulation of the bond fluctuation model. The intramolecular
structure factor at the theta point is found to be distinctively different from
that of the ideal chain. The structure factor shows a hump around $q\sim 5/R_g$
and a dip around $q\sim 10/R_g$ in the Kratky plot with $R_g$ being the radius
of gyration. This feature is apparently similar to that in a melt. The
theoretical expression by the simple perturbation expansion to the first order
in terms of the Mayer function can be fitted to the obtained structure factor
quite well, but the second virial coefficient cannot be set to zero.
