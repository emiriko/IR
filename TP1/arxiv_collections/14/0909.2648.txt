We present ultraviolet through far-infrared surface brightness profiles for
the 75 galaxies in the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS). The
imagery used to measure the profiles includes GALEX UV data, optical images
from KPNO, CTIO and SDSS, near-IR data from 2MASS, and mid- and far-infrared
images from Spitzer. Along with the radial profiles, we also provide
multi-wavelength asymptotic magnitudes and several non-parametric indicators of
galaxy morphology: the concentration index (C_42), the asymmetry (A), the Gini
coefficient (G) and the normalized second-order moment of the brightest 20% of
the galaxy's flux (M_20). Our radial profiles show a wide range of morphologies
and multiple components (bulges, exponential disks, inner and outer disk
truncations, etc.) that vary not only from galaxy to galaxy but also with
wavelength for a given object. In the optical and near-IR, the SINGS galaxies
occupy the same regions in the C_42-A-G-M_20 parameter space as other normal
galaxies in previous studies. However, they appear much less centrally
concentrated, more asymmetric and with larger values of G when viewed in the UV
(due to star-forming clumps scattered across the disk) and in the mid-IR (due
to the emission of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons at 8.0 microns and very hot
dust at 24 microns).
