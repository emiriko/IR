Simulations of QCD are known to suffer from serious critical slowing down
towards the continuum limit. This is particularly prominent in the topological
charge. We investigate the severeness of the problem in the range of lattice
spacings used in contemporary simulations and propose a method to give more
reliable error estimates.
