We develop the bivector formalism in higher dimensional Lorentzian
spacetimes. We define the Weyl bivector operator in a manner consistent with
its boost-weight decomposition. We then algebraically classify the Weyl tensor,
which gives rise to a refinement in dimensions higher than four of the usual
alignment (boost-weight) classification, in terms of the irreducible
representations of the spins. We are consequently able to define a number of
new algebraically special cases. In particular, the classification in five
dimensions is discussed in some detail. In addition, utilizing the (refined)
algebraic classification, we are able to prove some interesting results when
the Weyl tensor has (additional) symmetries.
