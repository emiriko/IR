We perform an extensive study of FCNC and CP Violation within Supersymmetric
(SUSY) theories with particular emphasis put on processes governed by b->s
transitions and of their correlations with processes governed by b->d
transitions, s->d transitions, $D^0-\bar D^0$ oscillations, lepton flavour
violating decays, electric dipole moments and (g-2)_mu. We first perform a
comprehensive model-independent analysis of Delta F=2 observables and we
emphasize the usefulness of the R_b-gamma plane in exhibiting transparently
various tensions in the present UT analyses. Secondly, we consider a number of
SUSY models: the general MSSM, a flavour blind MSSM, the MSSM with Minimal
Flavour Violation as well as SUSY flavour models based on abelian and
non-abelian flavour symmetries that show representative flavour structures in
the soft SUSY breaking terms. We show how the characteristic patterns of
correlations among the considered flavour observables allow to distinguish
between these different SUSY scenarios. Of particular importance are the
correlations between the CP asymmetry S_psi phi and B_s->mu^+\mu^-, between the
anomalies in S_phi K_S and S_psi phi, between S_phi K_S and d_e, between S_psi
phi and (g-2)_mu and also those involving lepton flavour violating decays. In
our analysis, the presence of right-handed currents and of the double Higgs
penguin contributions to B_s mixing plays a very important role. We propose a
"DNA-Flavour Test" of NP models including Supersymmetry, the Littlest Higgs
model with T-parity and the Randall-Sundrum model with custodial protection,
with the aim of showing a tool to distinguish between these NP scenarios, once
additional data on flavour changing processes become available.
