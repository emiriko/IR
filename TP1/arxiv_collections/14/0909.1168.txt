We use ab initio density functional calculations to study hydrogen-induced
disintegration of single- and multi-wall carbon fullerenes and nanotubes. Our
results indicate that hydrogen atoms preferentially chemisorb along lines in
sp2 bonded carbon nanostructures, locally weakening the carbon bonds and
releasing stress. For particular structural arrangements, hydrogen helps to
relieve the accumulated stress by inducing step-wise local cleavage leading to
disintegration of the outermost wall.
