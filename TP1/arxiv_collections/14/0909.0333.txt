A simple and general prescription for evaluating unambiguously the sign of
the grand-canonical trace of quasi-particle statistical density operators (the
so-called sign ambiguity in taking the square root of determinants) is given.
Sign ambiguities of this kind appear in the evaluation of the grand-canonical
partition function projected to good quantum numbers (angular momentum, parity
and particle number) in the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation at finite
temperature, since traces are usually expressed as the square root of
determinants. A comparison is made with the numerical continuity method.
