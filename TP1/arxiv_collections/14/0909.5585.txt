We present full accounts of a method to extract nucleon-nucleon (NN)
potentials from the Bethe-Salpter amplitude in lattice QCD. The method is
applied to two nucleons on the lattice with quenched QCD simulations. By
disentangling the mixing between the S-state and the D-state, we obtain central
and tensor potentials in the leading order of the velocity expansion of the
non-local NN potential. The spatial structure and the quark mass dependence of
the potentials are analyzed in detail.
