Nullifying the servo bandwidth errors improves the strehl ratio by a
substantial quantity in adaptive optics systems. An effective method for
predicting atmospheric turbulence to reduce servo bandwidth errors in real time
closed loop correction systems is presented using data mining. Temporally
evolving phase screens are simulated using Kolmogorov statistics and used for
data analysis. A data cube is formed out of the simulated time series. Partial
data is used to predict the subsequent phase screens using the progressive
prediction method. The evolution of the phase amplitude at individual pixels is
segmented by implementing the segmentation algorithms and prediction was made
using linear as well as non linear regression. In this method, the data cube is
augmented with the incoming wave-front sensor data and the newly formed data
cube is used for further prediction. The statistics of the prediction method is
studied under different experimental parameters like segment size,
decorrelation timescales of turbulence and segmentation procedure. On an
average, 6% improvement is seen in the wave-front correction after progressive
prediction using data mining.
