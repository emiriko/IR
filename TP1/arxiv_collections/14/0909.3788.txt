Superconducting and epitaxially grown LaFeAsOF thin films were successfully
prepared on (001)-oriented LaAlO3 substrates using pulsed laser deposition. The
prepared thin films show exclusively a single in-plane orientation with
epitaxial relation (001)[100] parallel to (001)[100] and a FWHM value of 1deg.
Furthermore, resistive measurement of the superconducting transition
temperature revealed a Tc90 of 25K with a high residual resistive ratio of 6.8.
The applied preparation technique, standard thin film pulsed laser deposition
at room temperature in combination with a subsequent post annealing process, is
suitable for fabrication of high quality LaFeAsO1-xFx thin films. A high upper
critical field of 76.2 T was evaluated for magnetic fields applied
perpendicular to the c-axis and the anisotropy was calculated to be 3.3
assuming single band superconductivity.
