In this paper, we present the design of a sample sort algorithm for manycore
GPUs. Despite being one of the most efficient comparison-based sorting
algorithms for distributed memory architectures its performance on GPUs was
previously unknown. For uniformly distributed keys our sample sort is at least
25% and on average 68% faster than the best comparison-based sorting algorithm,
GPU Thrust merge sort, and on average more than 2 times faster than GPU
quicksort. Moreover, for 64-bit integer keys it is at least 63% and on average
2 times faster than the highly optimized GPU Thrust radix sort that directly
manipulates the binary representation of keys. Our implementation is robust to
different distributions and entropy levels of keys and scales almost linearly
with the input size. These results indicate that multi-way techniques in
general and sample sort in particular achieve substantially better performance
than two-way merge sort and quicksort.
