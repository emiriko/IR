We present measurements of the top quark mass based on 3.6 fb^-1 of data
collected by the D0 experiment during Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron collider.
We present results in the dilepton and lepton+jets final states. We also
present the measurement of the mass difference between t and tbar quarks
observed in lepton+jets final states of ttbar events in 1 fb^-1 of data.
