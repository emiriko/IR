Results of the chiral quark models for the soft matrix elements involving
pions and photons, relevant for high-energy processes, are reviewed. We discuss
quantities related to the generalized parton distributions of the pion: the
parton distribution functions, the parton distribution amplitudes, and the
generalized form factors. The model predictions are compared to the data or
lattice simulations, with good agreement. The QCD evolution from the low quark
model scale up to the experimental scales is a crucial ingredient of the
approach.
