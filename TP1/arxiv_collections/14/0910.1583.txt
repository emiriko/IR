We suggest electronic circuits with memristors (resistors with memory) that
operate as memcapacitors (capacitors with memory) and meminductors (inductors
with memory). Using a memristor emulator, the suggested circuits have been
built and their operation has been demonstrated, showing a useful and
interesting connection between the three memory elements.
