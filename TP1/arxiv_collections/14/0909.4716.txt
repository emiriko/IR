The 18O(p,alpha)15N reaction rate has been extracted by means of the
Trojan-Horse method. For the first time the contribution of the 20-keV peak has
been directly evaluated, giving a value about 35% larger than previously
estimated. The present approach has allowed to improve the accuracy of a factor
8.5, as it is based on the measured strength instead of educated guesses or
spectroscopic measurements. The contribution of the 90-keV resonance has been
determined as well, which turned out to be of negligible importance to
astrophysics.
