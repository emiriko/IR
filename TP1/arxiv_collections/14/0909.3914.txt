A holographic dual of hadrons at finite density is considered. We use the
zero black-hole mass limit of Reisner-Nordstrom (RN) AdS background with hard
wall to describe a confining background with finite quark density. We calculate
density-dependence of meson masses and decay constants. In our model, pion
decay constant and its velocity go down but all the meson masses go up as
density grows.
