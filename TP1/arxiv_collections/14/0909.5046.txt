We study the rapidity losses in central heavy-ion collisions from AGS to RHIC
energies with the mean rapidity determined from the projectile net-baryon
distribution after collisions. The projectile net-baryon distribution in the
full rapidity range was obtained by removing the target contribution
phenomenologically at forward rapidity region from the experimental net-baryon
measurements and taking into account the projectile contribution at backward
rapidity region. Based on the full projectile net-baryon distributions,
calculation results show that the rapidity loss stops increasing from the SPS
top energy to RHIC energies, indicating that baryon transport does not depend
strongly on energy at high energies.
