We present models of giant planet migration in evolving protoplanetary disks.
Our disks evolve subject to viscous transport of angular momentum and
photoevaporation, while planets undergo Type II migration. We use a Monte Carlo
approach, running large numbers of models with a range in initial conditions.
We find that relatively simple models can reproduce both the observed radial
distribution of extra-solar giant planets, and the lifetimes and accretion
histories of protoplanetary disks. The use of state-of-the-art photoevaporation
models results in a degree of coupling between planet formation and disk
clearing, which has not been found previously. Some accretion across planetary
orbits is necessary if planets are to survive at radii <~1.5AU, and if planets
of Jupiter mass or greater are to survive in our models they must be able to
form at late times, when the disk surface density in the formation region is
low. Our model forms two different types of "transitional" disks, embedded
planets and clearing disks, which show markedly different properties. We find
that the observable properties of these systems are broadly consistent with
current observations, and highlight useful observational diagnostics. We
predict that young transition disks are more likely to contain embedded giant
planets, while older transition disks are more likely to be undergoing disk
clearing.
