Effects of periodic curvature on the the electrical resistivity of corrugated
semiconductor films are theoretically considered. The presence of a
curvature-induced potential affects the motion of electrons confined to the
thin curved film, resulting in a significant resistivity enhancement at
specific values of two geometric parameters: the amplitude and period of the
surface corrugation. The maximal values of the two parameters in order to
observe the corrugation-induced resistivity enhancement in actual experiments
are quantified by employing existing material constants.
