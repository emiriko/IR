We investigate the parameter space of a specific class of model within the
deflected mirage mediation (DMM) scenario. We look at neutralino properties and
compute the thermal relic density as well as interaction rates with xenon
direct detection experiments. We find that there are portions of the parameter
space which are in line with the current WMAP constraints. Further we find that
none of the investigated parameter space is in conflict with current bounds
from the Xenon10 experiment and that future large-scale liquid xenon
experiments will probe a large portion of the model space.
