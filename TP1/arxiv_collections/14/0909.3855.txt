We propose a new technique for measuring the polarization of hadronically
decaying boosted top quarks. In particular, we apply a subjet-based technique
to events where the decay products of the top are clustered within a single
jet. The technique requires neither b-tagging nor W-reconstruction, and does
not rely on assumptions about either the top production mechanism or the
sources of missing energy in the event. We include results for various new
physics scenarios made with different Monte Carlo generators to demonstrate the
robustness of the technique.
