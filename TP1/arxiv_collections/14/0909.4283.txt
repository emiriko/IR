The spectral properties of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on an
anisotropic triangular lattice in a magnetic field are investigated using a
weak-interchain-coupling approach combined with exact solutions of a chain.
Dominant modes induced by interchain interactions in a magnetic field behave as
quasiparticles which show distinctive features such as anomalous incommensurate
ordering and high-energy modes. In terms of them, various unusual features
observed in the anisotropic triangular antiferromagnet Cs_2CuCl_4 in a magnetic
field are quantitatively explained in a unified manner.
