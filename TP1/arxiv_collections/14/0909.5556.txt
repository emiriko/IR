A study of the kinematics of the $\alpha$-$d$ coincidences in the $^{6}$Li +
$^{59}$Co system at a bombarding energy of $E_{lab} = 29.6$ MeV is presented.
With exclusive measurements performed over different angular intervals it is
possible to identify the respective contributions of the sequential projectile
breakup and direct projectile breakup components. A careful analysis using a
semiclassical approach of these processes provides information on both their
lifetime and their distance of occurrence with respect to the target. Breakup
to the low-lying (near-threshold) continuum is delayed, and happens at large
internuclear distances. This suggests that the influence of the projectile
breakup on the complete fusion process can be related essentially to direct
breakup to the $^6$Li high-lying continuum spectrum. %
