Since the Newtonian gravitation is largely used to model with success the
structures of the universe, such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies, for
example, a way to probe and constrain alternative theories, in the weak field
limit, is to apply them to model the structures of the universe. We then
modified the well known Gadget-2 code to probe alternative theories of
gravitation through galactic dynamics. In particular, we modified the Gadget-2
code to probe alternatives theories whose weak field limits have a Yukawa-like
gravitational potential. As a first application of this modified Gadget-2 code
we simulate the evolution of elliptical galaxies. These simulations show that
galactic dynamics can be used to constrain the parameters associated with
alternative theories of gravitation.
