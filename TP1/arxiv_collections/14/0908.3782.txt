We present the results of muon-spin relaxation (muSR) measurements on the
hexagonal manganite HoMnO3. Features in the temperature-dependent relaxation
rate, lambda, correlate with the magnetic transitions at 76 K, 38 K and 34 K.
The highest temperature transition, associated with the ordering of Mn3+
moments has the largest effect on lambda. The application of a static electric
field of E=10^4 Vm^-1 below T=50 K causes a small reduction in lambda which is
suggestive of coupling between ferroelectric and magnetic domain walls in the
ordered state of the material.
