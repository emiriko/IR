Protons and antiprotons at collider energies are a source of high energy
Weizsaecker--Williams photons. This opens up a possibility to study at the LHC
exclusive photoproduction of heavy vector mesons at energies much larger than
possible at the HERA accelerator. We present selected results of our detailed
studies of various distributions for the production of heavy quarkonia (e.g.
rapidity, transverse momenta, azimuthal angles). We give predictions for LHC
energies. Our calculations are based on modelling the photoproduction
amplitudes in a k_\perp-factorisation approach which is checked against HERA
data. We also discuss the exclusive photoproduction of Z^0 bosons.
