We consider a two-dimensional crystalline monolayer of carbon atoms with a
single non-magnetic impurity. Using the Weyl Hamiltonian to describe electronic
energy spectrum near the Dirac points, we calculate the wave function and
energy of impurity states, as well as the induced magnetic moment associated
with polarization of the electron system. We present a phase diagram of the
localized magnetic state as a function of the chemical potential $\mu $ and
coupling constant $g_c$.
