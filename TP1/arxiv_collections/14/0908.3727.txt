Signatures of soft supersymmetry breaking at the CERN LHC and in dark matter
experiments are discussed with focus drawn to light superparticles, and in
particular light gauginos and their discovery prospects. Connected to the above
is the recent PAMELA positron anomaly and its implications for signatures of
SUSY in early runs at the Large Hadron Collider. Other new possibilities for
physics beyond the Standard Model are also briefly discussed.
