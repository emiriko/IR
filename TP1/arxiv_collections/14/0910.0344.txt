In [2], a detailed argument is presented on a version of pilot-waves, given
by at Theory of Exclusively Local Beables. What the author of [2] considers to
be his crucial proposal is described in the title of section 3 as 'complicated,
ugly, and highly contrived'. The reason for such a proposal is claimed to be
the widespread perception among quantum physicists, according to which 'those
sympathetic to the pilot-wave ontology no doubt expected that, for a system of
N particles moving in three spatial dimensions, the theoretical description
would be of N wave-particle pairs - each pair consisting of a point particle
guided in some way by an associated wave propagating in 3-space. But
Schroedinger's wave function for such an N-particle system was emphatically not
a set of N (interacting) waves, each propagating in 3-space. It was, rather, a
single wave propagating in the 3N-dimensional configuration space for the
system', [2, p. 5]. In the present paper it is argued that the mentioned
widespread expectation need not be seen as being betrayed by what actually
happens. In particular, the construction in section 3 of [2] may be avoidable.
