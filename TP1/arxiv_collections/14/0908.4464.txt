The aim of this project is to design, study and build an "eel-like robot"
prototype able to swim in three dimensions. The study is based on the analysis
of eel swimming and results in the realization of a prototype with 12
vertebrae, a skin and a head with two fins. To reach these objectives, a
multidisciplinary group of teams and laboratories has been formed in the
framework of two French projects.
