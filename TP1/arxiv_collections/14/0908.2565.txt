We investigate surface-curvature induced alteration in the Tomonaga-Luttinger
liquid (TLL) states of a one-dimensional (1D) deformed hollow nanotube with a
dumbbell-shape. Periodic variation of the surface curvature along the axial
direction is found to enhance the TLL exponent significantly, which is
attributed to an effective potential field that acts low-energy electrons
moving on the curved surface. The present results accounts for the experimental
observation of the TLL properties of 1D metallic peanut-shaped fullerene
polymers whose enveloping surface is assumed to be a dumbbell-shaped hollow
tube.
