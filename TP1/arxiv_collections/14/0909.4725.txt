We show that the classical and strongly coupled QGP (cQGP) is characterized
by a multiple of structure factors that obey generalized Orstein-Zernicke
equations. We use the canonical partition function and its associated density
functional to derive analytical equations for the density and charge monopole
structure factors for arbitrary values of $\Gamma=V/K$, the ratio of the mean
potential to Coulomb energy. The results are compared with SU(2) molecular
dynamics simulations.
