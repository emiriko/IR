The Fokker Planck (FP) equation has been solved to study the interaction of
non-equilibrated heavy quarks with the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) expected to be
formed in heavy ion collisions at RHIC energies. The solutions of the FP
equation have been convoluted with the relevant fragmentation functions to
obtain the $D$ and $B$ meson spectra. The results are compared with
experimental data measured by STAR collaboration. It is found that the present
experimental data can not distinguish between the $p_T$ spectra obtained from
the equilibrium and non-equilibrium charm distributions. Data at lower $p_T$
may play a crucial role in making the distinction between the two. The nuclear
suppression factor, $R_{\mathrm AA}$ for non-photonic single electron spectra
resulting from the semileptonic decays of hadrons containing heavy flavours
have been evaluated using the present formalism. It is observed that the
experimental data on nuclear suppression factor of the non-photonic electrons
can be reproduced within this formalism by enhancing the pQCD cross sections by
a factor of 2 provided the expansion of the bulk matter is governed by the
velocity of sound, $c_s\sim 1/\sqrt{4}$. Ideal gas equation of state fails to
reproduce the data even with the enhancement of the pQCD cross sections by a
factor of 2.
