In this work we analyze a particular setup with ultracold atoms trapped in
state-dependent lattices. We show that any asymmetry in the contact interaction
translates into one of two classes of correlated hopping. After deriving the
effective lattice Hamiltonian for the atoms, we obtain analytically and
numerically the different phases and quantum phase transitions. We find for
weak correlated hopping both Mott insulators and charge density waves, while
for stronger correlated hopping the system transitions into a pair superfluid.
We demonstrate that this phase exists for a wide range of interaction
asymmetries and has interesting correlation properties that differentiate it
from an ordinary atomic Bose-Einstein condensate.
