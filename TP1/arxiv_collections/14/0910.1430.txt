We consider nonparametric estimation of the state price density encapsulated
in option prices. Unlike usual density estimation problems, we only observe
option prices and their corresponding strike prices rather than samples from
the state price density. We propose to model the state price density directly
with a nonparametric mixture and estimate it using least squares. We show that
although the minimization is taken over an infinitely dimensional function
space, the minimizer always admits a finite dimensional representation and can
be computed efficiently. We also prove that the proposed estimate of the state
price density function converges to the truth at a ``nearly parametric'' rate.
