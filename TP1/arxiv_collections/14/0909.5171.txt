In this work, based on the Petrov-Diakonov representation of the Wilson loop
average W in the SU(2) Yang-Mills theory, together with the Cho-Fadeev-Niemi
decomposition, we present a natural framework to discuss possible ideas
underlying confinement and ensembles of defects in the continuum. In this
language we show how for different ensembles the surface appearing in the
Wess-Zumino term in W can be either decoupled or turned into a variable, to be
summed together with gauge fields, defects and dual fields. This is discussed
in terms of the regularity properties imposed by the ensembles on the dual
fields, thus precluding or enabling the possibility of performing the large
dual transformations that would be necessary to decouple the initial surface.
