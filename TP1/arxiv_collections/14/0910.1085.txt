This study resolves a discrepancy in the abundance of Zr in the 47 Tucanae
asymptotic giant branch star Lee 2525. This star was observed using the echelle
spectrograph on the 2.3 m telescope at Siding Spring Observatory. The analysis
was undertaken by calibrating Lee 2525 with respect to the standard giant star
Arcturus. This work emphasises the importance of using a standard star with
stellar parameters comparable to the star under analysis rather than a
calibration with respect to the Sun (Koch & McWilliam 2008). Systematic errors
in the analysis process are then minimised due to the similarity in atmospheric
structure between the standard and programme stars. The abundances derived for
Lee 2525 were found to be in general agreement with the Brown & Wallerstein
(1992) values except for Zr. In this study Zr has a similar enhancement
([Zr/Fe] = +0.51 dex) to another light s-process element, Y ([Y/Fe] = +0.53
dex), which reflects current theory regarding the enrichment of s-process
elements by nuclear processes within AGB stars (Busso et al. 2001). This is
contrary to the results of Brown & Wallerstein (1992) where Zr was
under-abundant ([Zr/Fe] = +0.51 dex) and Y was over-abundant ([Y/Fe] = +0.50
dex) with respect to Fe.
