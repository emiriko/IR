We show that presently available precision data are in good agreement with
supersymmetry at a mass scale below 1 TeV. Using a SUSY point close to the best
fit to present data, we give a projection of the capabilities of the LHC to
constrain SUSY models and their parameters as function of the accumulated
luminosity.
