An impact parameter dependent unintegrated gluon distribution is constructed
as a solution of a nonlinear evolution equation with realistic Glauber--Gribov
input. Photon--jet correlations in the proton fragmentation region of pA
collisions are proposed as a direct probe of the nuclear unintegrated glue.
