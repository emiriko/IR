Large scale shell model calculations have been carried out for odd-odd
$^{58-62}$Mn isotopes in two different model spaces. First set of calculations
have been carried out in full $\it{fp}$ shell valence space with two recently
derived $\it{fp}$ shell interactions namely GXPF1A and KB3G treating $^{40}$Ca
as core. The second set of calculations have been performed in ${fpg_{9/2}}$
valence space with the $fpg$ interaction treating $^{48}$Ca as core and
imposing a truncation by allowing up to a total of six particle excitations
from the 0f$_{7/2}$ orbital to the upper $\it{fp}$ orbitals for protons and
from the upper $\it{fp}$ orbitals to the 0g$_{9/2}$ orbital for neutron. For
low-lying states in $^{58}$Mn, the KB3G and GXPF1A both predicts good results
and for $^{60}$Mn, KB3G is much better than GXPF1A. For negative parity and
high-spin positive parity states in both isotopes $fpg$ interaction is
required. Experimental data on $^{62}$Mn is sparse and therefore it is not
possible to make any definite conclusions. More experimental data on negative
parity states is needed to ascertain the importance of 0g$_{9/2}$ and higher
orbitals in neutron rich Mn isotopes.
