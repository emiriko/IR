The structure and elastic properties of (5,5) and (10,10) nanotubes, as well
as barriers for relative rotation of the walls and their relative sliding along
the axis in a double-walled (5,5)@(10,10) carbon nanotube, are calculated using
the density functional method. The results of these calculations are the basis
for estimating the following physical quantities: shear strengths and diffusion
coefficients for relative sliding along the axis and rotation of the walls, as
well as frequencies of relative rotational and translational oscillations of
the walls. The commensurability-incommensurability phase transition is
analyzed. The length of the incommensurability defect is estimated on the basis
of ab initio calculations. It is proposed that (5,5)@(10,10) double-walled
carbon nanotube be used as a plain bearing. The possibility of experimental
verification of the results is discussed.
