We report on the observation of the bright, long gamma-ray burst, GRB
090902B, by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Large Area Telescope (LAT)
instruments on-board the Fermi observatory. This was one of the brightest GRBs
to have been observed by the LAT, which detected several hundred photons during
the prompt phase. With a redshift of z = 1.822, this burst is among the most
luminous detected by Fermi. Time-resolved spectral analysis reveals a
significant power-law component in the LAT data that is distinct from the usual
Band model emission that is seen in the sub-MeV energy range. This power-law
component appears to extrapolate from the GeV range to the lowest energies and
is more intense than the Band component both below $\sim$ 50 keV and above 100
MeV. The Band component undergoes substantial spectral evolution over the
entire course of the burst, while the photon index of the power-law component
remains constant for most of the prompt phase, then hardens significantly
towards the end. After the prompt phase, power-law emission persists in the LAT
data as late as 1 ks post-trigger, with its flux declining as $t^{-1.5}$. The
LAT detected a photon with the highest energy so far measured from a GRB,
$33.4_{-3.5}^{+2.7}$ GeV. This event arrived 82 seconds after the GBM trigger
and $\sim$ 50 seconds after the prompt phase emission had ended in the GBM
band. We discuss the implications of these results for models of GRB emission
and for constraints on models of the Extragalactic Background Light.
