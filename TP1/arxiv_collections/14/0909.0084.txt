We investigate the contentions that Jackson Pollock's drip paintings are
fractals produced by the artist's Levy distributed motion and that fractal
analysis may be used to authenticate works of uncertain provenance[1-5]. We
find that the paintings exhibit fractal characteristics over too small a range
to be usefully considered as fractal; their limited fractal characteristics are
easily generated without Levy motion, both by freehand drawing and gaussian
random motion. Several problems must therefore be addressed before fractal
analysis can be used to authenticate paintings.
