We report a possible detection of an ~4.6-hour quasi-periodic oscillation
(QPO) in the 0.3-10 keV emission of the high-energy peaked blazar PKS 2155-304
from a 64 ks observation by the XMM-Newton EPIC/pn detector. We identify a
total modulation of ~5% in the light curve and confirm that nominal period by
periodogram, structure function and wavelet analyses. The limited light curve
duration allows the capture of only 3.8 cycles of this oscillation and thus
precludes a very strong claim for this QPO, despite a nominally high (>3 sigma)
statistical significance. We briefly discuss models capable of producing an
X-ray QPO of such a period in a blazar.
