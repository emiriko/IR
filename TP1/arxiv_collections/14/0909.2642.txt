We present a library of 139 near-IR spectra of cool asymptotic giant branch
stars that will be useful for comparison with theoretical model atmosphere
calculations and for modeling the integrated emission from intermediate-age
stellar populations. The source list was selected from the `extremely red'
region of the INT Photometric H Alpha Survey (IPHAS) colour-colour plane that
is overwhelmingly dominated by very late-type stars. The spectral library also
includes a large fraction of S-type and carbon stars. We present a number of
spectral classification sequences highlighting the various molecular features
identified and discuss a number of rare features with uncertain identifications
in the literature. With its focus on particularly cool photospheres this
catalogue serves as a companion to recent spectroscopic atlases of MK standards
in the near-IR. Finally the relationship between IPHAS (r'-i') and (r'-H Alpha)
colours and spectroscopically determined properties is discussed and a strong
correlation between (r'-H Alpha) colour and the C/O abundance index for S-type
and carbon stars is noted. This relation has the potential to separate O-rich,
S-type and carbon stars in the Galaxy based on their photometry alone.
