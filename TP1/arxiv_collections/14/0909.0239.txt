A framework is developed based on the concepts of {\it divorticity} ${\textbf
B}$($\equiv\nabla\times\bfo$, $\bfo$ being the vorticity) and
$\textit{dihelicity} g \lp \equiv\bfv\cdot\textbf{B}\rp$ for discussing the
theoretical structure underlying two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamics. This
formulation leads to the global and Lagrange invariants that could impose
significant constraints on the evolution of divorticity lines in 2D
hydrodynamics.
