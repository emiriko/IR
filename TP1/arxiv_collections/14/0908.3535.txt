We examine the influence of Ni impurity in cuprates on the distribution of
hole carriers by performing numerically exact diagonalization calculations for
a model consisting of Cu3d, Ni3d, and O2p orbitals. Using realistic parameters
for the system, we find that a hole is predominantly bound to O2p orbitals
around the Ni impurity forming the Zhang-Rice doublet. This imposes strong
restrictions on modeling Ni-substituted cuprates. We propose a resonant
inelastic x-ray scattering experiment for Ni K-edge to confirm hole binding
around the Ni impurity.
