We present high-resolution spectroscopic observations for 91 PMS stars in ONC
with masses in the range 0.10-0.25Msun carried out with the multi-fiber
spectrograph FLAMES@ESO. Our aim is to better understand the disk-locking
scenario in very low-mass stars. We have derived radial velocities, vsini, and
full width at 10% of the Halpha emission peak. Using published measurements of
infrared excess as disk tracer, and equivalent width of the NIR CaII line
lambda8542, mid-IR difference [3.6]-[8.0]micron derived by Spitzer data, and
10% Halpha width as diagnostic of the level of accretion, we have looked for
any correlation between vsini divided by the radius and presence of disk and
accretion. Four low-mass stars are SB2 systems. The distribution of rotation
periods derived from our vsini measurements is unimodal with a peak of few
days. Our <sini> is lower than the one expected for a random distribution. We
find no evidence for a population of fast rotators close to the break-up
velocity. A clear correlation between vsini/R and Delta(Ic-K) has been found.
While for stars with no circumstellar disk a spread in the rotation rates is
seen, stars with a circumstellar disk show an abrupt drop in their rotation
rates by a factor of ~5. On the other hand, only a partial correlation between
vsini and accretion is observed when other indicators are used. The X-ray
coronal activity level shows no dependence on vsini/R suggesting that all stars
are in a saturated regime limit. The critical velocity is probably below our
vsini detection limit of 9 km/s. The ONC low-mass stars in our sample at
present seem to be not locked, but the clear correlation we find between
rotation and IR color excess suggests that they were locked once. In addition,
the percentage of accretors seems to scale inversely to the stellar mass.
