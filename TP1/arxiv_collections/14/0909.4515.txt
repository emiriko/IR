We investigate the influence of artificial defects (small holes) inserted
into magnetic nanodisks on the vortex core dynamics. One and two holes
(antidots) are considered. In general, the core falls into the hole but, in
particular, we would like to remark an interesting phenomenon not yet observed,
which is the vortex core switching induced by the vortex-hole interactions. It
occurs for the case with only one hole and for very special conditions
involving the hole size and position as well as the disk size. Any small
deformation in the disk geometry such as the presence of a second antidot
changes completely the vortex dynamics and the vortex core eventually falls
into one of the defects. After trapped, the vortex center still oscillates with
a very high frequency and small amplitude around the defect center.
