We consider the dependence of ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) flux
predictions on the choice of galaxy catalogue. We demonstrate that model
predictions by Koers & Tinyakov (2009b), based on the so-called KKKST
catalogue, are in good agreement with predictions based on the XSCz catalogue,
a recently compiled catalogue that contains spectroscopic redshifts for a large
fraction of galaxies. This agreement refutes the claim by Kashti (2009) that
the KKKST catalogue is not suited for studies of UHECR anisotropy due to its
dependence on photometric redshift estimates. In order to quantify the effect
of galaxy catalogues on flux predictions, we develop a measure of anisotropies
associated with model flux maps. This measure offers a general criterion to
study the effect of model parameters and assumptions on the predicted strength
of UHECR anisotropies.
