Leptogenic Supersymmetry is a scenario characterized by copious lepton
production in cascade decays. Due to the high lepton multiplicity and the lack
of significant missing energy, leptogenic supersymmetry provides very clean
channels which can be probed already with the early LHC data. Furthermore, the
Higgs may be discovered in the h->b bbar mode because the leptons accompanying
Higgs production efficiently suppress the background.
