We report preparation, x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility chi(T) and
heat capacity Cp(T) measurements on the undoped samples as also samples with
Zn-doped (S = 0) at Cu site, Ni doped (S = 1) at Cu site, and Ca-doped (holes)
at Bi site in the coupled two-leg spin ladder system BiCu2PO6. While, Zn shows
complete solid solubility, Ni could be doped to about 20% and Ca to about 15%.
Magnetization and heat capacity data in the undoped compound point towards the
existence of frustration effects. In all the samples, the chi(T) at low
temperature increases with doping content. The Zn-induced susceptibility is
smaller than that due to effective S=1/2 moments possibly due to frustrating
next-nearest-neighbor interactions along the leg. For Zn content x > 0.01,
chi(T) deviates from the Curie-law at low temperatures. The magnetic specific
heat data Cm(T) for the Zn-doped samples show weak anomalies at low temperature
in agreement with chi(T) behavior. The anomalies are suggestive of spin
freezing at low-T. In contrast, prominent effects are observed in chi(T) and
Cm(T) on Ni-doped samples. The zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC)
chi(T) data are different from each other at low temperature unlike that for Zn
doped samples, clearly indicating a transition to a spin-glass like phase. No
anomalies were found in Ca- or Pb-doped samples.
