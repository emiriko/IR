This paper describes a new approach to solving some stochastic optimization
problems for linear dynamic system with various parametric uncertainties.
Proposed approach is based on application of tensor formalism for creation the
mathematical model of parametric uncertainties. Within proposed approach
following problems are considered: prediction, data processing and optimal
control. Outcomes of carried out simulation are used as illustration of
properties and effectiveness of proposed methods.
