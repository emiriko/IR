In this paper we study the local behavior of an algebraic curve under a
geometric construction which is a variation of the usual offsetting
construction, namely the {\it generalized} offsetting process (\cite {SS99}).
More precisely, here we discuss when and how this geometric construction may
cause local changes in the shape of an algebraic curve, and we compare our
results with those obtained for the case of classical offsets (\cite{JGS07}).
For these purposes, we use well-known notions of Differential Geometry, and
also the notion of {\it local shape} introduced in \cite{JGS07}.
