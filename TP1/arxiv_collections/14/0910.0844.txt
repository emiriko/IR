Most of the super massive black hole mass estimates based on stellar
kinematics use the assumption that galaxies are axisymmetric oblate spheroids
or spherical. Here we use fully general triaxial orbit-based models to explore
the effect of relaxing the axisymmetric assumption on the previously studied
galaxies M32 and NGC 3379. We find that M32 can only be modeled accurately
using an axisymmetric shape viewed nearly edge-on and our black hole mass
estimate is identical to previous studies. When the observed 5 degrees
kinematical twist is included in our model of NGC 3379, the best shape is
mildly triaxial and we find that our best-fitting black hole mass estimate
doubles with respect to the axisymmetric model. This particular black hole mass
estimate is still within the errors of that of the axisymmetric model and
consistent with the M-sigma relationship. However, this effect may have a
pronounced impact on black hole demography, since roughly a third of the most
massive galaxies are strongly triaxial.
