A careful examination of Red Rectangle bands which have been considered as
diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) in emission shows that a few are likely to be
artifacts in the spectrum. Some others result from atmospheric extinction.
Consequences for the Red Rectangle band/DIB associations are examined.
  I will also comment a striking resemblance between the DIB spectrum and the
spectrum of NO2 in the 6150-6250A region. This suggests that some DIBs could be
provoked by atmospheric molecules.
