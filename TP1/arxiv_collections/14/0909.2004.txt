We derive a general and simple expression for the time-dependence of the
position operator of a multi-band Hamiltonian with arbitrary matrix elements
depending only on the momentum of the quasi-particle. Our result shows that in
such systems the Zitterbewegung like term related to a trembling motion of the
quasi-particle, always appears in the position operator. Moreover, the
Zitterbewegung is, in general, a multi-frequency oscillatory motion of the
quasi-particle. We derive a few different expressions for the amplitude of the
oscillatory motion including that related to the Berry connection matrix. We
present several examples to demonstrate how general and versatile our result
is.
