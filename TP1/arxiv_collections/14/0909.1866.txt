We describe a data structure, a rectangular complex, that can be used to
represent hyperconvex metric spaces that have the same topology (although not
necessarily the same distance function) as subsets of the plane. We show how to
use this data structure to construct the tight span of a metric space given as
an n x n distance matrix, when the tight span is homeomorphic to a subset of
the plane, in time O(n^2), and to add a single point to a planar tight span in
time O(n). As an application of this construction, we show how to test whether
a given finite metric space embeds isometrically into the Manhattan plane in
time O(n^2), and add a single point to the space and re-test whether it has
such an embedding in time O(n).
