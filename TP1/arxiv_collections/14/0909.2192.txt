The three-state Potts field theory in two dimensions with thermal and
magnetic perturbations provides the simplest model of confinement allowing for
both mesons and baryons, as well as for an extended phase with deconfined
quarks. We study numerically the evolution of the mass spectrum of this model
over its whole parameter range, obtaining a pattern of confinement, particle
decay and phase transitions which confirms recent predictions.
