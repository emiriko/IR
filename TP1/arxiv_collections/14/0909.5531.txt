The nature of baryon resonances is studied in the dynamical chiral
coupled-channel approach for meson-baryon scattering. In general, origin of
resonances in two-body scattering can be classified into two categories:
dynamically generated states and genuine elementary particles. We demonstrate
that the genuine contribution in the loop function can be excluded by adopting
a natural renormalization scheme. The origin of resonances can be studied by
looking at the effective interaction in the natural renormalization scheme,
which is deduced from the phenomenological amplitude fitted to experimental
data. Applying this method to the baryon resonances, we find that the dominant
component for the Lambda(1405) resonance is dynamical, while a genuine
contribution plays a substantial role for the structure of the N(1535).
