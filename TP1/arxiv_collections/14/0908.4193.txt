Nonperiodic tunable quantum echoes have been observed in experiments with an
open microwave billiard whose geometry under certain conditions provides
Fibonacci like sequences of classical delay times. These sequences combined
with the reflection at the opening induced by the wave character of the
experiment and the size of the opening allow to shape quantum pulses. The
pulses are obtained by response of an integrable scattering system.
