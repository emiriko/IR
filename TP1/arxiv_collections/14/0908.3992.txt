The effects of dry and wet merging on the Scaling Laws (SLs) of elliptical
galaxies (Es) are discussed. It is found that the galaxy SLs, possibly
established at high redshift by the fast collapse of gas-rich and clumpy
stellar distributions in preexisting dark matter halos following the
cosmological SLs, are compatible with a (small) number of galaxy mergers at
lower redshift.
