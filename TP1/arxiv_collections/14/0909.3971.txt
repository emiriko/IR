This article reports the design, the breadboarding and the validation of an
ultra-stable Cryogenic Sapphire Oscillator operated in an autonomous
cryocooler. The objective of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of
a frequency stability of 3x10-15 between 1 s and 1,000 s for the European Space
Agency deep space stations. This represents the lowest fractional frequency
instability ever achieved with cryocoolers. The preliminary results presented
in this paper validate the design we adopted for the sapphire resonator, the
cold source and the oscillator loop.
