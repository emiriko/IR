Since language is tied to cognition, we expect the linguistic structures to
reflect patterns we encounter in nature and analyzed by physics. Within this
realm we investigate the process of protolanguage acquisition, using analytical
and tractable methods developed within physics. A protolanguage is a mapping
between sounds and objects (or concepts) of the perceived world. This mapping
is represented by a matrix and the linguistic interaction among individuals is
described by a random matrix model. There are two essential parameters in our
approach. The strength of the linguistic interaction $\beta$, which following
Chomsky's tradition, we consider as a genetically determined ability, and the
number $N$ of employed sounds (the lexicon size). Our model of linguistic
interaction is analytically studied using methods of statistical physics and
simulated by Monte Carlo techniques. The analysis reveals an intricate
relationship between the innate propensity for language acquisition $\beta$ and
the lexicon size $N$, $N \sim \exp(\beta)$. Thus a small increase of the
genetically determined $\beta$ may lead to an incredible lexical explosion. Our
approximate scheme offers an explanation for the biological affinity of
different species and their simultaneous linguistic disparity.
