The test of the crab waist collision scheme, undergoing at the e+e- Frascati
DAFNE accelerator complex since February 2008, requires a fast and accurate
measurement of the absolute luminosity, as well as a full characterization of
the background conditions. Three different monitors, a Bhabha calorimeter, a
Bhabha GEM tracker and a gamma bremsstrahlung proportional counter have been
designed, tested and installed around the interaction point end of
2007-beginning of 2008. In this paper, we describe these detectors and present
their performances in various operation conditions during the 2008 and 2009
DAFNE runs.
