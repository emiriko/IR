Monte Carlo methods are now an essential part of the statistician's toolbox,
to the point of being more familiar to graduate students than the measure
theoretic notions upon which they are based! We recall in this note some of the
advances made in the design of Monte Carlo techniques towards their use in
Statistics, referring to Robert and Casella (2004,2010) for an in-depth
coverage.
