The kinematics of newly-formed star clusters are interesting both as a probe
of the state of the gas clouds from which the stars form, and because they
influence planet formation, stellar mass segregation, cluster disruption, and
other processes controlled in part by dynamical interactions in young clusters.
However, to date there have been no attempts to use simulations of star cluster
formation to investigate how the kinematics of young stars change in response
to variations in the properties of their parent molecular clouds. In this
letter we report the results of turbulent self-gravitating simulations of
cluster formation in which we consider both clouds in virial balance and those
undergoing global collapse. We find that stars in these simulations generally
have velocity dispersions smaller than that of the gas by a factor of ~ 5,
independent of the dynamical state of the parent cloud, so that subvirial
stellar velocity dispersions arise naturally even in virialized molecular
clouds. The simulated clusters also show large-scale stellar velocity gradients
of ~0.2-2 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ and strong correlations between the centroid
velocities of stars and gas, both of which are observed in young clusters. We
conclude that star clusters should display subvirial velocity dispersions,
large-scale velocity gradients, and strong gas-star velocity correlations
regardless of whether their parent clouds are in virial balance, and,
conversely, that observations of these features cannot be used to infer the
dynamical state of the parent gas clouds.
