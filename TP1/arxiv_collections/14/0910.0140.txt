We study the decay $\eta'\to\eta\pi\pi$ in two different chiral invariant
approaches: Large-$N_c$ Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) and Large-$N_c$
Resonance Chiral Theory (RChT). We analyze the Dalitz plot and the invariant
mass spectra. We also compare the relevance of the isoscalar and isovector
channels in these approaches. While the predictions of Large-$N_c$ ChPT at
next-to-leading order slightly disagree with the measured decay width (showing
the need for final state interactions and higher order local contributions), a
reasonable agreement is obtained for the case of RChT. Forthcoming experimental
analyses at Bonn, Frascati, J\"ulich and Mainz will decide among the different
frameworks.
