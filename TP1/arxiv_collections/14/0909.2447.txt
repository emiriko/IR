The roughness of fracture surfaces has been shown to exhibit self-affne scale
invariance for a wide variety of materials and loading conditions. The range of
scales over which this regime extends remains a matter of debate, together with
the universality of the associated exponents. The topography of these surfaces
is however often investigated with a contact probe that is larger than the
micro-structure. In this case, we show that the correlation function of the
roughness and the corresponding Hurst exponent $\zeta$ can only be measured
down to a length scale $\Delta xc$ which depends on the probe size $R$, on
$\zeta$ and on the surface topothesy $l$, and exhibit spurious behavior at
smaller scales. First, we derive the dependence of $\Delta xc$ on these
parameters from a simple scaling argument. Then we study this dependence
numerically and verify our theoretical prediction. Finally, we establish the
relevance of this analysis from AFM measurements on an experimental glass
fracture surface and provide a metrological procedure for roughness
measurements.
