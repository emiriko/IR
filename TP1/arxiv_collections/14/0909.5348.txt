Starting from the striking similarity of proton-neutron multiplets in 134Sb
and 210Bi, we perform a shell-model study of nuclei with two additional protons
or neutrons to find out to what extent this analogy persists. We employ
effective interactions derived from the CD-Bonn nucleon-nucleon potential
renormalized by use of the V-low-k approach. The calculated results for 136Sb,
212Bi, 136I, and 212At are in very good agreement with the available
experimental data. The similarity between 132Sn and 208Pb regions is discussed
in connection with the effective interaction, emphasizing the role of core
polarization effects.
