Boolean networks have long been used as models of molecular networks and play
an increasingly important role in systems biology. This paper describes a
software package, Polynome, offered as a web service, that helps users
construct Boolean network models based on experimental data and biological
input. The key feature is a discrete analog of parameter estimation for
continuous models. With only experimental data as input, the software can be
used as a tool for reverse-engineering of Boolean network models from
experimental time course data.
