Malware is a type of malicious program that replicate from host machine and
propagate through network. It has been considered as one type of computer
attack and intrusion that can do a variety of malicious activity on a computer.
This paper addresses the current trend of malware detection techniques and
identifies the significant criteria in each technique to improve malware
detection in Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Several existing techniques are
analyzing from 48 various researches and the capability criteria of malware
detection technique have been reviewed. From the analysis, a new generic
taxonomy of malware detection technique have been proposed named Hybrid Malware
Detection Technique (Hybrid MDT) which consists of Hybrid Signature and Anomaly
detection technique and Hybrid Specification based and Anomaly detection
technique to complement the weaknesses of the existing malware detection
technique in detecting known and unknown attack as well as reducing false alert
before and during the intrusion occur.
