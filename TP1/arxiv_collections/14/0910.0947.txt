The vacuum structure of QCD with two degenerated flavours of Wilson fermions
is discussed by means of the p.d.f. (probability distribution function)
formalism. Under certain assumptions, either new phases related to Aoki's
appear, characterized by a non-vanishing expectation value of the condensate
$i\bar\psi_u\gamma_5\psi_u + i\bar\psi_d\gamma_5\psi_d$, enriching the standard
picture of the QCD vacuum structure with Wilson fermions; or the eigenvalues of
the Dirac-Wilson operator must comply with a non-trivial, infinite set of sum
rules, enforcing the currently accepted structure of the Aoki vacuum.
  The same scenario is analyzed using the Ginsparg-Wilson regularization. In
this case, the absence of any parity and/or flavour breaking phase is proved
for a non-zero value of the fermion mass.
