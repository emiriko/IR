The Bloom filter (BF) is a well-known space-efficient data structure that
answers set membership queries with some probability of false positives. In an
attempt to solve many of the limitations of current inter-networking
architectures, some recent proposals rely on including small BFs in packet
headers for routing, security, accountability or other purposes that move
application states into the packets themselves. In this paper, we consider the
design of such in-packet Bloom filters (iBF). Our main contributions are
exploring the design space and the evaluation of a series of extensions (1) to
increase the practicality and performance of iBFs, (2) to enable
false-negative-free element deletion, and (3) to provide security enhancements.
In addition to the theoretical estimates, extensive simulations of the multiple
design parameters and implementation alternatives validate the usefulness of
the extensions, providing for enhanced and novel iBF networking applications.
