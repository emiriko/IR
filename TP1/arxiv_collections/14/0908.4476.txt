The Barrett-Crane spin foam model for quantum gravity provides an excellent
setting for testing analytical and numerical tools used to probe spinfoam
models. Here, we complete the report on the numerical analysis of the single
4-simplex area correlations begun in Phys. Lett. B670 (2009) 403-406,
discussing the next-to-leading order corrections ("one-loop" corrections) with
particular attention to their measure dependence, and the difference between
the Gaussian and Bessel ansatze for the boundary state.
