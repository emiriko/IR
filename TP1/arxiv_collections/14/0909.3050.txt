We studied the rheological behavior of a molecular solution composed of
$\alpha$-cyclodextrin, water and 4-methylpyridine, a liquid known to undergo
inverse melting, at different temperatures and concentrations. The system shows
a marked non-Newtonian behavior, exhibiting the typical signature of shear
thickening. Specifically, a transition is observed from a Newtonian to a shear
thickening regime at a critical shear rate $\dot{\gamma}_c$. The value of this
critical shear rate as a function of T follows an Arrhenius behavior
$\dot{\gamma}_c(T)=$ B exp$(E_a/K_BT)$, with an activation energy $E_a$ close
to the value of the hydrogen bond energy of the O-H group of the $\alpha$-CD
molecules. We argue that the increase of viscosity vs shear rate (shear
thickening transition) is due to the formation of hydrogen bonded aggregates
induced by the applied shear field. Finally, we speculate on the possible
interplay between the non-Newtonian rheology and the inverse melting behavior,
proposing a single mechanism to be at the origin of both phenomena.
