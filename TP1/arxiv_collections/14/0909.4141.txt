The existence of a glueball has been a tough work for many years study.
Utilizing the well developed QCD theory for $B$ meson decays, we propose a new
way to identify whether a scalar glueball existed or not. In the presence of
mixing between glueballs and ordinary scalar mesons, we explore the possibility
to extract the mixing parameters from semileptonic B decays and nonleptonic B
decays. We also point out a clean way to identify a glueball through $B_c$
decays.
