Anomalous transport of non-Markovian, thermal Brownian particle dynamics in
spatially-periodic symmetric systems that is driven by time-periodic symmetric
driving and constant bias is investigated numerically. The Brownian dynamics is
modeled by a Generalized Langevin equation with exponentially correlated
Gaussian thermal noise, obeying the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We study
the role of non-zero correlation time of thermal fluctuations for the
occurrence of absolute negative (linear) mobility (ANM) near zero bias,
negative-valued, nonlinear mobility (NNM) and negative differential mobility
(NDM) at finite bias away from equilibrium. We detect that a non-zero thermal
correlation time can either enhance or also diminish the value of ANM.
Moreover, finite thermal noise correlation can induce NDM and NNM in regions of
parameter space for which such ANM- and NNM-behavior is distinctly absent for
limiting white thermal noise. In parts of the parameter space, we find a
complex structure of regions of linear and nonlinear negative mobility: islands
and tongues which emerge and vanish under parameters manipulation. While
certain such anomalous transport regimes fade away with increasing temperature
some specific regions interestingly remain rather robust. Outside those regimes
with anomalous mobility, the ac/dc driven transport is either normal or the
driven Brownian particles are not transported at all.
