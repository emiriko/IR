Conducting nanowires possess remarkable physical properties unattainable in
bulk materials. However our understanding of their transport properties is
limited by the difficulty of connecting them electrically. In this Letter we
investigate phototransport in both bulk silicon and silicon nanowires using a
superconducting multimode resonator operating at frequencies between 0.3 and 3
GHz. We find that whereas the bulk Si response is mainly dissipative, the
nanowires exhibit a large dielectric polarizability. This technique is
contactless and can be applied to many other semiconducting nanowires and
molecules. Our approach also allows to investigate the coupling of electron
transport to surface acoustic waves in bulk Si and to electro-mechanical
resonances in the nanowires.
