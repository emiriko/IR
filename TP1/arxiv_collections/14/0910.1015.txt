The development of viable all-optical data processing systems has immense
importance for both the computing and telecommunication industries, but device
realization remains elusive. In this Letter, we propose an innovative mechanism
deployed as a basis for all optical transistor action. In detail, it is
determined that an optically pumped system, operating just below laser
threshold, can exhibit a greatly enhanced output on application of an
off-resonant beam of sufficient intensity. The electrodynamics of the
underlying, nonlinear optical mechanism is analyzed, model calculations are
performed, and the results are illustrated graphically.
