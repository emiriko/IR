The proton-dissociative diffractive photoproduction of J/psi mesons has been
studied in ep collisions with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated
luminosity of 112 pb^-1. The cross section is presented as a function of the
photon-proton centre-of-mass energy and of the squared four-momentum transfer
at the proton vertex. The results are compared to perturbative QCD
calculations.
