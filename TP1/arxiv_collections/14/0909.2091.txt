We propose Interactive Differential Evolution (IDE) based on paired
comparisons for reducing user fatigue and evaluate its convergence speed in
comparison with Interactive Genetic Algorithms (IGA) and tournament IGA. User
interface and convergence performance are two big keys for reducing Interactive
Evolutionary Computation (IEC) user fatigue. Unlike IGA and conventional IDE,
users of the proposed IDE and tournament IGA do not need to compare whole
individuals each other but compare pairs of individuals, which largely
decreases user fatigue. In this paper, we design a pseudo-IEC user and evaluate
another factor, IEC convergence performance, using IEC simulators and show that
our proposed IDE converges significantly faster than IGA and tournament IGA,
i.e. our proposed one is superior to others from both user interface and
convergence performance points of view.
