The power loss and electromagnetic energy density of a metamaterial
consisting of arrays of wires and split-ring resonators (SRRs) are
investigated. We show that a field energy density formula can be derived
consistently from both the electrodynamic (ED) approach and the equivalent
circuit (EC) approach. The derivations are based on the knowledge of the
dynamical equations of the electric and magnetic dipoles in the medium and the
correct form of the power loss. We discuss the role of power loss in
determining the form of energy density and explain why the power loss should be
identified first in the ED derivation. When the power loss is negligible and
the field is harmonic, our energy density formula reduces to the result of
Landau's classical formula. For the general case with finite power loss, our
investigation resolves the apparent contradiction between the previous results
derived by the EC and ED approaches.
