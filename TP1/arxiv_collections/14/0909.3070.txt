A fully self-consistent microscopic framework for evaluation of nuclear
weak-interaction rates at finite temperature is introduced, based on Skyrme
functionals. The single-nucleon basis and the corresponding thermal occupation
factors of the initial nuclear state are determined in the finite-temperature
Skyrme Hartree-Fock model, and charge-exchange transitions to excited states
are computed using the finite-temperature RPA. Effective interactions are
implemented self-consistently: both the finite-temperature single-nucleon
Hartree-Fock equations and the matrix equations of RPA are based on the same
Skyrme energy density functional. Using a representative set of Skyrme
functionals, the model is applied in the calculation of stellar
electron-capture cross sections for selected nuclei in the iron mass group and
for neutron-rich Ge isotopes.
