If $F$ is a continuous function on the real line and $f=F'$ is its
distributional derivative then the continuous primitive integral of
distribution $f$ is $\int_a^bf=F(b)-F(a)$. This integral contains the Lebesgue,
Henstock--Kurzweil and wide Denjoy integrals. Under the Alexiewicz norm the
space of integrable distributions is a Banach space. We define the convolution
$f\ast g(x)=\intinf f(x-y)g(y) dy$ for $f$ an integrable distribution and $g$ a
function of bounded variation or an $L^1$ function. Usual properties of
convolutions are shown to hold: commutativity, associativity, commutation with
translation. For $g$ of bounded variation, $f\ast g$ is uniformly continuous
and we have the estimate $\|f\ast g\|_\infty\leq \|f\|\|g\|_\bv$ where
$\|f\|=\sup_I|\int_If|$ is the Alexiewicz norm. This supremum is taken over all
intervals $I\subset\R$. When $g\in L^1$ the estimate is $\|f\ast g\|\leq
\|f\|\|g\|_1$. There are results on differentiation and integration of
convolutions. A type of Fubini theorem is proved for the continuous primitive
integral.
