We study the use of final state particle pseudorapidity for measurements of
s-channel resonances at the LHC. Distinguishing the spin of an s-channel
resonance can, in principle, be accomplished using angular distributions in the
centre-of-mass frame, possibly using a centre-edge asymmetry measurement, A_CE.
In addition, forward-backward asymmetry measurements, A_FB, can be used to
distinguish between models of extra neutral gauge bosons. In this note we show
how these measurements can be improved by using simple methods based on the
pseudorapidity of the final state particles and present the expected results
for A_FB and A_CE for several representative models.
