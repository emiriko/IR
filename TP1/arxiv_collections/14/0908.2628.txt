We present an analysis of the period-$V$-amplitude plane for RR0 Lyrae stars
(fundamental mode pulsators) with "normal" light curves in the bulge using the
MACHO bulge fields. Although bulge globular clusters have RR Lyraes that divide
into two reasonable distinct groups according to the average period of the RR0
Lyraes (Oosterhoff 1939), there is no evidence of a gap between Oosterhoff I
and II stars in the bulge field star sample. The majority of the bulge RR0
Lyrae field star population have a difference in period compared to the
Oosterhoff I cluster M3 (Delta log P) that is shifted by about 0.02 days with
regard to the Milky Way Oosterhoff I population, and the sample includes stars
with Delta log P > 0.06 days, a characteristic hardly seen in Milky Way
globular clusters. The metal-rich RR0 Lyrae stars in the Galactic bulge sample
have Delta log P values on the other side of the spectrum as those in the
metal-rich globular clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. We find that the
$V$-amplitude for a given period is a function of Delta log P, and not of metal
abundance, similar to the result found by Clement & Shelton (1999) for RR Lyrae
stars in Milky Way globular clusters. A comparative study of the bulge field
stars with similar metallicities but different Oosterhoff types is carried out.
Bulge field RR0 Lyrae variables with Delta log P values similar to Oosterhoff
II clusters are about 0.2 mag brighter than RR0 Lyrae variables with Delta log
P similar to Oosterhoff I clusters. Reliance upon a single absolute
magnitude-[Fe/H] relation may be inappropriate when considering populations
with different Delta log P.
