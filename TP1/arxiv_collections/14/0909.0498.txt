We study the thermodynamics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model within the
dynamical cluster approximation. We use continuous time quantum Monte Carlo as
a cluster solver to avoid the systematic error which complicates the
calculation of the entropy and potential energy (double occupancy). We find
that at a critical filling, there is a pronounced peak in the entropy divided
by temperature, S/T, and in the normalized double occupancy as a function of
doping. At this filling, we find that specific heat divided by temperature,
C/T, increases strongly with decreasing temperature and kinetic and potential
energies vary like T^2 ln(T). These are all characteristics of quantum critical
behavior.
