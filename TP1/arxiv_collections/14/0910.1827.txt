We calculate the spectral function of a one-dimensional strongly interacting
chain of fermions, where the response can be well understood in terms of spinon
and holon excitations. Upon increasing the spin imbalance between the spin
species, we observe the single-electron response of the fully polarised system
to emanate from the holon peak while the spinon response vanishes. For
experimental setups that probe one-dimensional properties, we propose this
method as an additional generic tool to aid the identification of spectral
structures, e.g. in ARPES measurements. We show that this applies even to
trapped systems having cold atomic gas experiments in mind.
