We discuss the characterization and stability of the Haldane phase in integer
spin chains on the basis of simple, physical arguments. We find that an odd-$S$
Haldane phase is a topologically non-trivial phase which is protected by any
one of the following three global symmetries: (i) the dihedral group of
$\pi$-rotations about $x,y$ and $z$ axes; (ii) time-reversal symmetry
$S^{x,y,z} \rightarrow - S^{x,y,z}$; (iii) link inversion symmetry (reflection
about a bond center), consistently with previous results [Phys. Rev. B
\textbf{81}, 064439 (2010)]. On the other hand, an even-$S$ Haldane phase is
not topologically protected (i.e., it is indistinct from a trivial,
site-factorizable phase). We show some numerical evidence that supports these
claims, using concrete examples.
