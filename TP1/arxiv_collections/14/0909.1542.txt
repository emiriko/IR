The azimuthal angular dependence of the nuclear modification factor
R_{AA}(p_T, phi,N_{part}) recently obtained by PHENIX is related at low p_T to
the trigger phi dependence of the ridge yield as measured by STAR in a
framework in which the azimuthal anisotropy is driven by semihard scattering
near the surface. Careful consideration of the initial geometry leads to the
determination of a surface segment in which the production of semihard partons
are responsible for the phi dependence of the inclusive distribution on the one
hand, and for the angular correlation in ridge phenomenology on the other. With
v_2 also being well reproduced along with R_{AA} and ridge yield, all relevant
phi dependencies in heavy-ion collisions can now be understood in a unified
description that emphasizes the ridge production whether or not a trigger is
used.
