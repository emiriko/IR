We explore the possibility to explain the LSND result in the context of
extra-dimensional theories. If sterile neutrinos take shortcuts through extra
dimensions, this results in altered neutrino dispersion relations.
Active-sterile neutrino oscillations thus are modified and new types of
resonances occur.
