We study synchronization in delay-coupled oscillator networks, using a master
stability function approach. Within a generic model of Stuart-Landau
oscillators (normal form of super- or subcritical Hopf bifurcation) we derive
analytical stability conditions and demonstrate that by tuning the coupling
phase one can easily control the stability of synchronous periodic states. We
propose the coupling phase as a crucial control parameter to switch between
in-phase synchronization or desynchronization for general network topologies,
or between in-phase, cluster, or splay states in unidirectional rings. Our
results are robust even for slightly nonidentical elements of the network.
