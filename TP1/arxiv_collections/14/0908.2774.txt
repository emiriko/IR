Employing a medium-dependent quantum optics formalism and a Green function
solution of Maxwell's equations, we study the enhanced spontaneous emission
factors (Purcell factors) and Lamb shifts from a quantum dot or atom near the
surface of a %embedded in a slow-light metamaterial waveguide. Purcell factors
of approximately 250 and 100 are found at optical frequencies for $p-$polarized
and $s-$polarized dipoles respectively placed 28\thinspace nm (0.02\thinspace
$\lambda_{0}$) above the slab surface, including a realistic metamaterial loss
factor of $\gamma /2\pi =2 \mathrm{THz}$. For smaller loss values, we
demonstrate that the slow-light regime of odd metamaterial waveguide
propagation modes can be observed and related to distinct resonances in the
Purcell factors. Correspondingly, we predict unusually large and rich Lamb
shifts of approximately -1 GHz to -6 GHz for a dipole moment of 50 Debye. We
also make a direct calculation of the far field emission spectrum, which
contains direct measurable access to these enhanced Purcell factors and Lamb
shifts.
