Spin and charge susceptibilities and the 4f^n, 4f^{n-1}, and 4f^{n+1}
configuration weights are calculated for compressed Ce (n=1), Pr (n=2), and Nd
(n=3) metals using dynamical mean field theory combined with the local-density
approximation. At ambient and larger volumes these trivalent rare earths are
pinned at sharp 4f^n configurations, their 4f moments assume atomic-limiting
values, are unscreened, and the 4f charge fluctuations are small indicating
little f state density near the Fermi level. Under compresssion there is
dramatic screening of the moments and an associated increase in both the 4f
charge fluctuations and static charge susceptibility. These changes are
coincident with growing weights of the 4f^{n-1} configurations, which it is
argued are better measures of delocalization than the 4f^{n+1} weights which
are compromised by an increase in the number of 4f electrons caused by rising
6s, 6p bands. This process is continuous and prolonged as a function of volume,
with strikingly similarity among the three rare earths, aside from the effects
moderating and shifting to smaller volumes for the heavier members. The
observed alpha-gamma collapse in Ce occurs over the large-volume half of this
evolution, the Pr analog at smaller volumes, and Nd has no collapse.
