We suggest some possible approaches of the unified equations of boson and
fermion, which correspond to the unified statistics at high energy. A. The spin
terms of equations can be neglected. B. The mass terms of equations can be
neglected. C. The known equations of formal unification change to the same.
They can be combined each other. We derive the chaos solution of the nonlinear
equation, in which the chaos point should be a unified scale. Moreover, various
unifications in particle physics are discussed. It includes the unifications of
interactions and the unified collision cross sections, which at high energy
trend toward constant and rise as energy increases.
