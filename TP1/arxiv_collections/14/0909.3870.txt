We present the most recent searches for lepton-flavor-violating tau decays in
BaBar. We find no evidence of tau decaying to three charged leptons or to a
charged lepton and a neutral meson (KS, rho, phi, K*0, anti-K*0), and set upper
limits on the corresponding branching fractions between 1.8 and 19 times 10-8
at 90% confidence level.
