We present results from two 1536^3 direct numerical simulations of rotating
turbulence where both energy and helicity are injected into the flow by an
external forcing. The dual cascade of energy and helicity towards smaller
scales observed in isotropic and homogeneous turbulence is broken in the
presence of rotation, with the development of an inverse cascade of energy now
coexisting with direct cascades of energy and helicity. In the direct cascade
range, the flux of helicity dominates over that of energy at low Rossby number.
These cascades have several consequences for the statistics of the flow. The
evolution of global quantities and of the energy and helicity spectra is
studied, and comparisons with simulations at different Reynolds and Rossby
numbers at lower resolution are done to identify scaling laws.
