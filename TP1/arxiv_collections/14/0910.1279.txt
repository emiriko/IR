In this article, we quantize the Maxwell ("massless spin one") de Sitter
field in a conformally invariant gauge. This quantization is invariant under
the SO$_0(2,4)$ group and consequently under the de Sitter group. We obtain a
new de Sitter invariant two-points function which is very simple. Our method
relies on the one hand on a geometrical point of view which uses the
realization of Minkowski, de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spaces as intersections
of the null cone in $\setR^6$ and a moving plane, and on the other hand on a
canonical quantization scheme of the Gupta-Bleuler type.
