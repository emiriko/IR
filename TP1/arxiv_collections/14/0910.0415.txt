We developed an iterative technique to better characterize stellar
populations and the central activity of barred galaxies using evolutionary
synthesis codes and OASIS data. The case of NGC5430 is presented here. Our
results are reinforcing the role played by the bar and nuclear structures for
the evolution of galaxies.
