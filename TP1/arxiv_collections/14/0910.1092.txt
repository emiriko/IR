We present the first quantitative experimental evidence for the underscreened
Kondo effect, an uncomplete compensation of a quantized magnetic moment by
conduction electrons, as originally proposed by Nozieres and Blandin. The
device consists of an even charge spin S = 1 molecular quantum dot, obtained by
electromigration of C60 molecules into gold nanogaps and operated in a dilution
fridge. The persistence of logarithmic singularities in the low temperature
conductance is demonstrated by a comparison to the fully screened configuration
obtained in odd charge spin S = 1/2 Coulomb diamonds. We also discover an
extreme sensitivity of the underscreened Kondo resonance to magnetic field,
that we confirm on the basis of numerical renormalization group calculations.
