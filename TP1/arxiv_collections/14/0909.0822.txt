We study the weak gravitational lensing effects caused by a stochastic
distribution of dark matter halos. We develop a simple approach to calculate
the magnification probability distribution function which allows us to easily
compute the magnitude bias and dispersion for an arbitrary data sample and a
given universe model. As an application we consider the effects of single-mass
large-scale cosmic inhomogeneities to the SNe magnitude-redshift relation, and
conclude that such structures could bias the PDF enough to affect the
extraction of cosmological parameters from the limited size of present-day SNe
data samples. We also release turboGL, a simple and very fast (<= 1s)
Mathematica code based on the method here presented.
