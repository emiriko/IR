In heavy-ion collisions in the energy regime probed at the CERN SPS,
experimental hints for the deconfinement phase transition have been seen in
numerous inclusive hadronic observables. In order to further characterize this
transition, and in the pursuit of indications for the expected critical point
of strongly interacting matter, the NA49 collaboration has conducted analyses
of the event-by-event fluctuations of various hadronic observables. A selection
of these results will be presented and discussed in the light of theoretical
predictions. Among these are new results on hadron ratio fluctuations, in
particular K/p fluctuations and their potential connection to the correlation
between strangeness and baryon number, thus revealing the basic degrees of
freedom produced in heavy-ion collisions.
