The allowed patterns of a map on a one-dimensional interval are those
permutations that are realized by the relative order of the elements in its
orbits. The set of allowed patterns is completely determined by the minimal
patterns that are not allowed. These are called basic forbidden patterns. In
this paper we study basic forbidden patterns of several functions. We show that
the logistic map L_r(x)=rx(1-x) and some generalizations have infinitely many
of them for 1<r<=4, and we give a lower bound on the number of basic forbidden
patterns of L_4 of each length. Next, we give an upper bound on the length of
the shortest forbidden pattern of a piecewise monotone map. Finally, we provide
some necessary conditions for a set of permutations to be the set of basic
forbidden patterns of such a map.
