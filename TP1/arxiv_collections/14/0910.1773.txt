We study the dynamics of a two-species Bose-Einstein condensate in a double
well. Such a system is characterized by the intraspecies and interspecies
s-wave scattering as well as the Josephson tunneling between the two wells and
the population transfer between the two species. We investigate the dynamics
for some interesting regimes and present numerical results to support our
conclusions. In the case of vanishing intraspecies scattering lengths and a
weak interspecies scattering length, we find collapses and revivals in the
population dynamics. A possible experimental implementation of our proposal is
briefly discussed.
