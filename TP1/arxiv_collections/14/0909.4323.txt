We study the thermodynamic properties of a dirty ferromagnetic
S$\mid$F$\mid$S Josephson junction with s-wave superconducting leads in the
low-temperature regime. We employ a full numerical solution with a set of
realistic parameters and boundary conditions, considering both a uniform and
non-uniform exchange field in the form of a Bloch domain wall ferromagnetic
layer. The influence of spin-active interfaces is incorporated via a
microscopic approach. We mainly focus on how the electronic specific heat and
density of states (DOS) of such a system is affected by the \textit{proximity
effect}, which may be tuned via the superconducting phase difference. Our main
result is that it is possible to \textit{strongly modify the electronic
specific heat} of the system by changing the phase difference between the two
superconducting leads from 0 up to nearly $\pi$ at low temperatures. An
enhancement of the specific heat will occur for small values $h\simeq\Delta$ of
the exchange field, while for large values of $h$ the specific heat is
suppressed by increasing the phase difference between the superconducting
leads. These results are all explained in terms of the proximity-altered DOS in
the ferromagnetic region, and we discuss possible methods for experimental
detection of the predicted effect.
