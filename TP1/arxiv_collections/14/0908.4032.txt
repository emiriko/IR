We theoretically investigate into the effects of the incidence angles in
light transmission of cholesteric liquid crystal two-layer sandwich structures
with twist defects created by rotation of the one layer about the helical
axis.The conoscopic images and polarization resolved patterns are obtained for
thick layers by computing the intensity and the polarization parameters as a
function of the incidence angles.In addition to the defect angle induced
rotation of the pictures as a whole, the rings of defect mode resonances are
found to shrink to the origin and disappear as the defect twist angle varies
from zero to its limiting value and beyond.
