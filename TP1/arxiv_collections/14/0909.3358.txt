X-ray absorption spectroscopy on oxygen-annealed, self-flux-grown single
crystals of Tl-2201 suggests a microscopic doping mechanism whereby
interstitial oxygens are attracted to copper substituted on the thallium site,
contributing holes to both the planes and to these coppers, and typically
promoting only one hole to the plane rather than two. These copper substituents
would provide an intrinsic hole doping. The evidence for this is discussed,
along with an alternative interpretation.
