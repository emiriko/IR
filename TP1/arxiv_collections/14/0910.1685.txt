In some new physics models, there exists a long-lived colored particle.
Although such a particle is expected be discovered by studying the muon-like
tracks, it is not easy to discriminate hadronic events from leptonic ones at
the Large Hadron Collider. We focus on the charged track events associated with
a single hard gluon jet. They are sensitive to the colored long-lived particle
and found to be almost free from the background after applying the velocity
cut. We also study the the process to probe properties of the particle.
