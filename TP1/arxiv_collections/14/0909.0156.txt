Only some special open surfaces satisfying the shape equation of lipid
membranes can be compatible with the boundary conditions. As a result of this
compatibility, the first integral of the shape equation should vanish for
axisymmetric lipid membranes, from which two theorems of non-existence are
verified: (i) There is no axisymmetric open membrane being a part of torus
satisfying the shape equation; (ii) There is no axisymmetric open membrane
being a part of a biconcave discodal surface satisfying the shape equation.
Additionally, the shape equation is reduced to a second-order differential
equation while the boundary conditions are reduced to two equations due to this
compatibility. Numerical solutions to the reduced shape equation and boundary
conditions agree well with the experimental data [A. Saitoh \emph{et al.},
