In the context of the Randall-Sundrum braneworld, an exhaustive and detailed
description of the approach based in the minimal anisotropic consequence onto
the brane, which has been successfully used to generate exact interior
solutions to Einstein's field equations for static and non-uniform braneworld
stars with local and non-local bulk terms, is carefully presented. It is shown
that this approach allows the generation of a braneworld version for any known
general relativistic solution.
