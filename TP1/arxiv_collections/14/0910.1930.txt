Numerical simulations of the onset phase of continuous wave supercontinuum
generation from modulation instability show that the structure of the field as
it develops can be interpreted in terms of the properties of Akhmediev
Breathers. Numerical and analytical results are compared with experimental
measurements of spectral broadening in photonic crystal fiber using nanosecond
pulses
