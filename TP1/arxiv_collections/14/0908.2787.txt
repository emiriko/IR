This paper studies the inflationary dynamics of a Non-Local Theory of
gravity. This theory, based around derivatives of the Ricci Scalar in the
Einstein-Hilbert action, was previously found to be Ghost free, and to give
rise to a bouncing cosmology. Perturbation spectra are calculated and found to
be similar to those for chaotic inflation.
