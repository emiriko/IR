Starburst galaxies exhibit in their central regions a highly increased rate
of supernovae, the remnants of which are thought to accelerate energetic cosmic
rays up to energies of ~ 10^15 eV. We report the detection of gamma rays --
tracers of such cosmic rays -- from the starburst galaxy NGC 253 using the
H.E.S.S. array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The gamma-ray flux
above 220 GeV is F = (5.5 +/- 1.0stat +/- 2.8sys) x 10^-13 ph. s-1 cm-2,
implying a cosmic-ray density about three orders of magnitude larger than that
in the center of the Milky Way. The fraction of cosmic-ray energy channeled
into gamma rays in this starburst environment is 5 times larger than that in
our Galaxy.
