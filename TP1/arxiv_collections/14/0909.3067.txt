Low-energy E < 2 eV electron elastic collisions with Ge, Sn and Pb atoms
yield stable excited Ge-, Sn- and Pb- anions. The recent Regge-pole methodology
is used with Thomas-Fermi type potential incorporating the crucial
core-polarization interaction to calculate elastic total and Mulholland partial
cross sections. For excited Ge- and Sn- anions the extracted binding energies
from the unique characteristic sharp Regge resonances manifesting stable
excited states formed during the collisions agree excellently with experimental
values; for Pb- the prediction requires experimental verification. The
calculated differential cross sections also yield the binding energies.
