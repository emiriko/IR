We report on the magnetic behavior of RRhB (R = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Gd, Tb and
Tm) and RRhC (R = La, Ce, Pr and Gd) compounds crystallizing in the cubic
perovskite type structure with space group Pm3m. The heat capacity data on
Pauli-paramagnetic LaRhB and LaRhC indicate a high frequency vibrating motion
of boron and carbon atoms in the unit cell. Ce is in -like nonmagnetic state in
both the compounds. Pr compounds show a dominant crystal field effect with a
nonmagnetic singlet ground state in PrRhB and a nonmagnetic quadrupolar doublet
in PrRhC. Compounds with other rare earths order ferromagnetically at low
temperatures except TmRhB in which the zero field evolution of magnetic
interactions is relatively more complicated. The electrical resistivity of
GdRhB decreases with increasing temperature in the paramagnetic state in the
vicinity of T, which is rarely seen in ferromagnets. The behavior is discussed
to be arising due to the short range spin fluctuation and a possible
contribution from Fermi surface geometry.
