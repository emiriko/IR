We present holographic computations of the time-dependent chiral magnetic
conductivity in the framework of gauge/gravity correspondence. Chiral magnetic
effect is a phenomenon where an electromagnetic current parallel to an applied
magnetic field is induced in the presence of a finite axial chemical potential.
Motivated by a recent weak-coupling perturbative QCD calculation, our aim is to
provide a couple of complementary computations for strongly coupled regime
which might be relevant for strongly coupled RHIC plasma. We take two
prototypical holographic set-ups for computing chiral magnetic conductivity;
the first model is Einstein gravity with U(1)_L X U(1)_R Maxwell theory, and
our second set-up is based on the Sakai-Sugimoto model in a deconfined and
chiral symmetry restored phase. While the former takes into account full
back-reaction while the latter not, the common feature is an important role
played by the appropriate 5-dimensional Chern-Simons term corresponding to the
4-dimensional axial anomaly.
