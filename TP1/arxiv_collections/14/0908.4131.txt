The dependence of magnetization on magnetic field M(H) was measured for
textured BSCCO samples for H || c, H || ab at different temperatures. Inclusion
of the pinning parameter in the Valkov-Khrustalev model [V.V. Valkov, B.P.
Khrustalev, JETP 80 (1995) 680] allowed to describe successfully the asymmetric
M(H) dependencies. The temperature and magnetic field dependencies of critical
current and pinning parameter for H || c and H || ab were estimated.
