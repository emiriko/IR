Measurements on entangled quantum states can produce outcomes that are
nonlocally correlated. But according to Tsirelson's theorem, there is a
quantitative limit on quantum nonlocality. It is interesting to explore what
would happen if Tsirelson's bound were violated. To this end, we consider a
model that allows arbitrary nonlocal correlations, colloquially referred to as
"box world". We show that while box world allows more highly entangled states
than quantum theory, measurements in box world are rather limited. As a
consequence there is no entanglement swapping, teleportation or dense coding.
