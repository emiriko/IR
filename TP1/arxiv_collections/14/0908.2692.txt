We report our recent simulations on the social processes which -- in our
opinion -- lie at the bottom of hate. First simulation deals with the so-called
Heider balance where initial purely random preferences split the community into
two mutually hostile groups. Second simulation shows that once these groups are
formed, the cooperation between them is going to fail. Third simulation
provides a numerical illustration of the process of biased learning; the model
indicates that lack of objective information is a barrier to new information.
Fourth simulation shows that in the presence of a strong conflict between
communities hate is unavoidable.
