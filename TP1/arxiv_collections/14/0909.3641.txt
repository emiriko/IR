We show that strong photoluminescence (PL) can be induced in single-layer
graphene on using an oxygen plasma treatment. PL characteristics are spatially
uniform across the flakes and connected to elastic scattering spectra
distinctly different from those of gapless pristine graphene. Oxygen plasma can
be used to selectively convert the topmost layer when multi-layer samples are
treated
