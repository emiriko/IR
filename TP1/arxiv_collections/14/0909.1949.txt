We demonstrate a Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT) configuration which employs
optical forces due to light scattering between electronically excited states of
the atom. With the standard MOT laser beams propagating along the {\it x}- and
{\it y}- directions, the laser beams along the {\it z}-direction are at a
different wavelength that couples two sets of {\it excited} states. We
demonstrate efficient cooling and trapping of cesium atoms in a vapor cell and
sub-Doppler cooling on both the red and blue sides of the two-photon resonance.
The technique demonstrated in this work may have applications in
background-free detection of trapped atoms, and in assisting laser-cooling and
trapping of certain atomic species that require cooling lasers at inconvenient
wavelengths.
