We report the observation of developing fractional quantum Hall states at
Landau level filling factors $\nu = 1/2$ and 1/4 in electron systems confined
to wide GaAs quantum wells with significantly $asymmetric$ charge
distributions. The very large electric subband separation and the highly
asymmetric charge distribution at which we observe these quantum Hall states,
together with the fact that they disappear when the charge distribution is made
symmetric, suggest that these are one-component states, possibly described by
the Moore-Read Pfaffian wavefunction.
