This paper sets out to examine the skills gaps between the industrial
application of Information Technology and university academic programmes
(curriculum). It looks at some of the causes, and considers the probable
solutions for bridging the gap between them and suggests the possibilities of
exploring a new role for our universities and employers of labor. It also
highlights strategies to abolish the misalignment between university and
industry. The main concept is to blend the academic rigidity with the
industrial relevance.
