We show that a combination of linear absorption spectroscopy, hyper-Rayleigh
scattering, and a theoretical analysis using sum rules to reduce the size of
the parameter space leads to a prediction of the two-photon absorption
cross-section of the dye AF455 that agrees with two-photon absorption
spectroscopy. Our procedure, which demands self-consistency between several
measurement techniques and does not use adjustable parameters, provides a means
for determining transition moments between the dominant excited states based
strictly on experimental characterization. This is made possible by our new
approach that uses sum rules and molecular symmetry to rigorously reduce the
number of required physical quantities.
