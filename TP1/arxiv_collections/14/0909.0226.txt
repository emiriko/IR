The heavens are full of neutrinos, but so far we have observed a small subset
of those. Performing such observations and analyzing the data from them require
a thorough understanding of neutrino interactions. In this short review, the
current theoretical status of neutrino cross sections are briefly summarized
and novel aspects of neutrino interactions that arise in cosmic sites are
discussed.
