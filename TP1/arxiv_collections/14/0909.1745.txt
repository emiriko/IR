Two-dimensional Maxwell-Vlasov equilibria with finite electric fields, axial
("toroidal") plasma flow and isotropic pressure are constructed in plane
geometry by using the quasineutrality condition to express the electrostatic
potential in terms of the vector potential. Then for Harris-type distribution
functions, Ampere's equation becomes of Liouville type and can be solved
analytically. As an example, a periodic "cat-eyes" steady state consisting of a
row of magnetic islands is presented. The method can be extended to (toroidal)
axisymmetric equilibria.
