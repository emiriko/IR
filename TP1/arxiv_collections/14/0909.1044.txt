The walls of the box which contains matter represent a membrane that allows
the relativistic quantum vacuum to pass but not matter. That is why the
pressure of matter in the box may be considered as the analog of the osmotic
pressure. However, we demonstrate that the osmotic pressure of matter is
modified due to interaction of matter with vacuum. This interaction induces the
nonzero negative vacuum pressure inside the box, as a result the measured
osmotic pressure becomes smaller than the matter pressure. As distinct from the
Casimir effect, this induced vacuum pressure is the bulk effect and does not
depend on the size of the box. This effect dominates in the thermodynamic limit
of the infinite volume of the box. Analog of this effect has been observed in
the dilute solution of 3He in liquid 4He, where the superfluid 4He plays the
role of the non-relativistic quantum vacuum, and 3He atoms play the role of
matter.
