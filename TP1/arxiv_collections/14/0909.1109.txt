We study repetitions in infinite words coding exchange of three intervals
with permutation (3,2,1), called 3iet words. The language of such words is
determined by two parameters $\varepsilon,\ell$. We show that finiteness of the
index of 3iet words is equivalent to boundedness of the coefficients of the
continued fraction of $\varepsilon$. In this case we also give an upper and
lower estimate on the index of the corresponding 3iet word.
