We reconsider the emission properties of the BL Lac objects emitting in the
high-energy gamma-ray band exploiting the new information in the MeV-GeV band
obtained by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space
Telescope in its first three months of operation. To this aim we construct the
spectral energy distribution of all the BL Lacs revealed by LAT and of the
known TeV BL Lacs not detected by LAT, also including data from the Swift
satellite, and model them with a simple one-zone leptonic model. The analysis
shows that the BL Lacs detected by LAT (being or not already detected in the
TeV band) share similar physical parameters. While some of the TeV BL Lacs not
revealed by LAT have spectral energy distributions and physical parameters very
similar to the LAT BL Lacs, a group of objects displays peculiar properties
(larger electron energies and smaller magnetic fields) suggesting different
physical conditions in the emission region. Finally, we discuss possible
criteria to effectively select good new candidates for the Cherenkov telescopes
among the LAT sources, presenting a list of predicted fluxes in the very
high-energy band calculated including the effect of the absorption by the
extragalactic background light.
