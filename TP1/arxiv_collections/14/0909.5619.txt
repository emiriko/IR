I review the holographic techniques used to efficiently study models with
Gauge-Higgs Unification (GHU) in one extra dimension. The general features of
GHU models in flat extra dimensions are then reviewed, emphasizing the aspects
related to electroweak symmetry breaking. Two potentially realistic models,
based on SU(3) and SO(5) electroweak gauge groups, respectively, are
constructed.
