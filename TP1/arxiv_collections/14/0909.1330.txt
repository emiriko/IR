Self-consistent convective dynamo simulations in wedge-shaped spherical
shells are presented. Differential rotation is generated by the interaction of
convection with rotation. Equatorward acceleration and dynamo action are
obtained only for sufficiently rapid rotation. The angular velocity tends to be
constant along cylinders. Oscillatory large-scale fields are found to migrate
in the poleward direction. Comparison with earlier simulations in full
spherical shells and Cartesian domains is made.
