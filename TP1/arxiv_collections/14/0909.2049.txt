We report experiments in a large, 2.5 micron diameter Fabry-Perot quantum
Hall interferometer with two tunneling constrictions. Interference fringes are
observed as conductance oscillations as a function of applied magnetic field
(the Aharonov-Bohm flux through the electron island) or a global backgate
voltage (electronic charge in the island). Depletion is such that in the
fractional quantum Hall regime, filling 1/3 current-carrying chiral edge
channels pass through constrictions when the island filling is 2/5. The
interferometer device is calibrated with fermionic electrons in the integer
quantum Hall regime. In the fractional regime, we observe magnetic flux and
charge periods 5h/e and 2e, respectively, corresponding to creation of ten e/5
Laughlin quasiparticles in the island. These results agree with our prior
report of the superperiods in a much smaller interferometer device. The
observed experimental periods are interpreted as imposed by anyonic statistical
interaction of fractionally-charged quasiparticles.
