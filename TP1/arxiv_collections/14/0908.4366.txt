We measure the effect of uniaxial pressure on the superconducting transition
temperature Tc in CeIrIn5. We find a linear change in Tc with both a-axis and
c-axis pressure, with slopes of 56 mK/kbar and -66 mK/kbar, respectively. By
comparing results from doping studies and different types of pressure
measurements, we separate the influences of hybridization and dimensionality on
Tc. We find the true geometric influence, for constant hybridization, is
dTc/d(c/a)=44 K.
