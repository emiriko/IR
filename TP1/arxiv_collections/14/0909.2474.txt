With the availability of the large database of black-hole transients from the
Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer, the observed phenomenology has become very
complex. The original classification of the properties of these systems in a
series of static states sorted by mass accretion rate proved not to be able to
encompass the new picture. I outline here a summary of the current situation
and show that a coherent picture emerges when simple properties such as X-ray
spectral hardness and fractional variability are considered. In particular,
fast transition in the properties of the fast time variability appear to be
crucial to describe the evolution of black-hole transients. Based on this
picture, I present a state-classification which takes into account the observed
transitions. I show that, in addition to transients systems, other black-hole
binaries and Active Galactic Nuclei can be interpreted within this framework.
The association between these states and the physics of the accretion flow
around black holes will be possible only through modeling of the full time
evolution of galactic transient systems.
