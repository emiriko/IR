One Achilles heal of classical cryptographic communication systems is that
secret communication can only take place after a key is communicated in secret
over a totally secure communication channel. Here comes quantum key
distribution which takes advantage of certain phenomena that occur at the
subatomic level, so that any attempt by an enemy to obtain the bits in a key
not only fails, but gets detected as well. This paper proposes the idea of on
algorithm, intended to be a quantum network algorithm named Base Selection and
Transmission Synchronization - BSTS, which can realize a perfectly secure
communication between two computers.
