Hall effect of two-dimensional holes that are spin-polarized by a strong
parallel magnetic field was explored with a small tilt angle. The Hall
resistivity increases nonlinearly with the magnetic field and exhibits negative
corrections. The anomalous negative corrections increase with the perpendicular
magnetization of the two-dimensional hole system. We attribute this to the
anomalous Hall effect of spin-polarized carriers in a nonmagnetic system. The
anomalous corrections to the conductivity exhibit non-monotonic dependence on
the magnetic field.
