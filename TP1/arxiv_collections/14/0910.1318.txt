Millimeter-sized single crystals of LaFeAsO were grown from NaAs flux and the
in-plane optical properties were studied over a wide frequency range. A sizable
electronic correlation effect was indicated from the analysis of the
free-carrier spectral weight. With decreasing temperature from 300 K, we
observed a continuous suppression of the spectral weight near 0.6 eV. But a
spin-density-wave gap formation at lower energy scale was seen only in the
broken-symmetry state. We elaborate that both the itinerancy and local spin
interactions of Fe\emph{3d} electrons are present for the FeAs-based systems;
however, the establishment of the long-range magnetic order at low temperature
has a dominantly itinerant origin.
