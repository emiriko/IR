A solid-on-solid model is generalized to study the formation of Ge pyramid
islands bounded by (105) facets on Si(100) substrates in two dimensions. Each
atomic column is not only characterized by the local surface height but also by
two deformation state variables dictating the local surface tilt and vertical
extension. These deformations phenomenologically model surface reconstructions
in (105) facets and enable the formation of islands which better resemble
faceted pyramids. We demonstrate the model by application to a kinetic limited
growth regime. We observe significantly reduced growth rates after faceting and
a continuous nucleation of new islands until overcrowding occurs.
