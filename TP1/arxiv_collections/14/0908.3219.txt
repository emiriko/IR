The non-hermitian states that lead to separation of the four Bell states are
examined. In the absence of interactions, a new quantum state of spin magnitude
1/(root(2) is predicted. Properties of these states show that an isolated spin
is a resonance state with zero net angular momentum, consistent with a point
particle, and each resonance corresponds to a degenerate but well defined
structure. By averaging and de-coherence these structures are shown to form
ensembles which are consistent with the usual quantum description of a spin.
