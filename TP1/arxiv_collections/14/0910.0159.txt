We investigate the case of CII 158 micron observations for SPICA/SAFARI using
a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulation of the diffuse
interstellar medium (ISM) and the Meudon PDR code. The MHD simulation consists
of two converging flows of warm gas (10,000 K) within a cubic box 50 pc in
length. The interplay of thermal instability, magnetic field and self-gravity
leads to the formation of cold, dense clumps within a warm, turbulent
interclump medium. We sample several clumps along a line of sight through the
simulated cube and use them as input density profiles in the Meudon PDR code.
This allows us to derive intensity predictions for the CII 158 micron line and
provide time estimates for the mapping of a given sky area.
