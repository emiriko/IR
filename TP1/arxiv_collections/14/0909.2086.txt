Dirac equation is solved for some exponential potentials, hypergeometric-type
potential, generalized Morse potential and Poschl-Teller potential with any
spin-orbit quantum number $\kappa$ in the case of spin and pseudospin symmetry,
respectively. We have approximated for non s-waves the centrifugal term by an
exponential form. The energy eigenvalue equations, and the corresponding wave
functions are obtained by using the generalization of the Nikiforov-Uvarov
method.
