We study theoretically the coherent electron focusing in graphene
nanoribbons. Using semiclassical and numerical tight binding calculations we
show that perfect armchair edges give rise to equidistant peaks in the focusing
spectrum. In the case of zigzag edges at low magnetic fields one can also
observe focusing peaks but with increasing magnetic field a more complex
interference structure emerges in the spectrum. This difference in the spectra
can be observed even if the zigzag edge undergoes structural reconstruction.
Therefore transverse electron focusing can help in the identification and
characterisation of the edge structure of graphene samples.
