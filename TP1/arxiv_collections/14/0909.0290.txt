We consider some of the recent proposals in which weak-scale dark matter is
accompanied by a GeV scale dark sector that could produce spectacular
lepton-rich events at the LHC. Since much of the collider phenomenology is only
weakly model dependent it is possible to arrive at generic predictions for the
discovery potential of future experimental searches. We concentrate on the
production of dark states through $Z^0$ bosons and electroweak-inos at the
Tevatron or LHC, which are the cleanest channels for probing the dark sector.
We properly take into account the effects of dark radiation and dark cascades
on the formation of lepton jets. Finally, we present a concrete definition of a
lepton jet and suggest several approaches for inclusive experimental searches.
