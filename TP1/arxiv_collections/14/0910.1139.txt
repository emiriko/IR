I review a variety of model systems and their quantum critical points,
motivated by recent experimental and theoretical developments. These are used
to present a general discussion of the non-zero temperature crossovers in the
vicinity of a quantum critical point. Insights are drawn from the exact
solutions of quantum critical transport obtained from the AdS/CFT
correspondence. I conclude with a discussion of the role of quantum criticality
in the phase diagram of the cuprate superconductors
