We report constructing quantum games directly from a system of Bell's
inequalities using Arthur Fine's analysis published in early 1980s. This
analysis showed that such a system of inequalities forms a set of both
necessary and sufficient conditions required to find a joint distribution
function compatible with a given set of joint probabilities, in terms of which
the system of Bell's inequalities is usually expressed. Using the setting of a
quantum correlation experiment for playing a quantum game, and considering the
examples of Prisoners' Dilemma and Matching Pennies, we argue that this
approach towards constructing quantum games addresses some of their well known
criticisms.
