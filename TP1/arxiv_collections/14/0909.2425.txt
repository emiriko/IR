We show that a large scale mass mortality results in increased numbers of
suicides. As a case in point, we consider the influenza epidemic of October
1918 in the United States. In this month, suicides peaked at a level of over 4s
(where s denotes the desaisonalized standard deviation of the suicide rate)
which means that one would expect such a jump to occur merely by chance only
once in several centuries. The mechanism that we propose to explain this effect
relies on two steps (i) Mass mortalities break family bonds for instance
between parents and children or husbands and wives. (ii) Increased numbers of
suicides then result from the well known fact that the severance of family
bonds invariably produces more suicides.
