We model strong forward shocks in young supernova remnants with efficient
particle acceleration where a nonresonant instability driven by the cosmic ray
current amplifies magnetic turbulence in the shock precursor. Particle
injection, magnetic field amplification (MFA) and the nonlinear feedback of
particles and fields on the bulk flow are derived consistently. The shock
structure depends critically on the efficiency of turbulence cascading. If
cascading is suppressed, MFA is strong, the shock precursor is stratified, and
the turbulence spectrum contains several discrete peaks. These peaks, as well
as the amount of MFA, should influence synchrotron X-rays, allowing
observational tests of cascading and other assumptions intrinsic to the
nonlinear model of nonresonant wave growth.
