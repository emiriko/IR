We classify the invariant prime ideals of a quantum partial flag variety
under the action of the related maximal torus. As a result we construct a
bijection between them and the torus orbits of symplectic leaves of the
standard Poisson structure on the corresponding flag variety. It was previously
shown by K. Goodearl and the author that the latter are precisely the Lusztig
strata of the partial flag variety.
