This work investigates the first correction to the equilibrium phase space
distribution and its effects on spectra and elliptic flow in heavy ion
collisions. We show that the departure from equilibrium on the freezeout
surface is the largest part of the viscous corrections to $v_2(p_T)$. However,
the momentum dependence of the departure from equilibrium is not known {\it a
priori}, and it is probably not proportional to $p_T^2$ as has been assumed in
hydrodynamic simulations. At high momentum in weakly coupled plasmas it is
determined by the rate of radiative energy loss and is proportional to
$p_T^{3/2}$. The weaker $p_T$ dependence leads to straighter $v_2(p_T)$ curves
at the same value of viscosity. Further, the departure from equilibrium is
generally species dependent. A species dependent equilibration rate, with
baryons equilibrating faster than mesons, can explain ``constituent quark
scaling'' without invoking coalescence models.
