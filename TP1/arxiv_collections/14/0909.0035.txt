Methods of parabolic geometries have been recently used to construct a class
of elliptic complexes on quaternionic manifolds, the Salamon's complex being
the simplest case. The purpose of this paper is to describe an algorithm how to
compute their analytical indices in terms of characteristic classes. Using
this, we are able to derive some topological obstructions to existence of
quaternionic structures on manifolds.
