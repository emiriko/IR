The first results on next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the production
of two Z bosons, in hadronic collisions in the large extra dimension ADD model
are presented. Various kinematical distributions are obtained to order
$\alpha_s$ in QCD by taking into account all the parton level subprocesses. We
estimate the impact of the QCD corrections on various observables and find that
they are significant. We also show the reduction in factorisation scale
uncertainity when ${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$ effects are included.
