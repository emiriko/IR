The purpose of this master thesis is to simulate suitable nuclear reactions
for a commissioning experiment, to be performed with the AGATA gamma-ray
tracking spectrometer. The main aim of the work is to find a reaction, which
gives large Doppler effects of the emitted gamma rays, with as small
contribution as possible due to the energy and angular spread of the nuclei
emitting the gamma rays. Inverse kinematics heavy-ion (HI) fusion reactions of
the type (HI,gamma), (HI, n) on proton and deuteron targets have been studied.
Target effects were investigated using the program TRIM in order to determine
the impact on the Doppler effects caused by energy and angular straggling in
the target material. The cross sections of a large number of reactions of
protons and deuterons on nuclei with mass numbers in the range A=20-100 have
been evaluated using the TALYS reaction code. The fusion-evaporation reactions,
d(V-51,n)Cr-52 and d(Cl-37,n)Ar-38 were simulated in detail using the Monte
Carlo code evapOR. The interactions in AGATA of the gamma rays emitted in these
reactions were simulated using Geant4. The energy resolution of the gamma rays
after gamma-ray tracking and Doppler correction were determined as a function
of the interaction position resolution of the germanium detectors. The
conclusion of this work is that of the two reactions d(V-51,n)Cr-52 is more
suitable for an AGATA commissioning experiment.
