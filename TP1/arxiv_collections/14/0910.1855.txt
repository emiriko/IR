We derive a formalism, the separation method, for the efficient and accurate
calculation of two-body matrix elements for a Gaussian potential in the
cylindrical harmonic-oscillator basis. This formalism is of critical importance
for Hartree-Fock and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations in deformed nuclei
using realistic, finite-range effective interactions between nucleons. The
results given here are also relevant for microscopic many-body calculations in
atomic and molecular physics, as the formalism can be applied to other types of
interactions beyond the Gaussian form. The derivation is presented in great
detail to emphasize the methodology, which relies on generating functions. The
resulting analytical expressions for the Gaussian matrix elements are checked
for speed and accuracy as a function of the number of oscillator shells and
against direct numerical integration.
