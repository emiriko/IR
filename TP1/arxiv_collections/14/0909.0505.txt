We investigate fluid motions near the midplane of vertically stratified
accretion disks with highly resistive midplanes. In such disks, the
magnetorotational instability drives turbulence in thin layers surrounding a
resistive, stable dead zone. The turbulent layers in turn drive motions in the
dead zone. We examine the properties of these motions using three-dimensional,
stratified, local, shearing-box, non-ideal, magnetohydrodynamical simulations.
Although the turbulence in the active zones provides a source of vorticity to
the midplane, no evidence for coherent vortices is found in our simulations. It
appears that this is because of strong vertical oscillations in the dead zone.
By analyzing time series of azimuthally-averaged flow quantities, we identify
an axisymmetric wave mode particular to models with dead zones. This mode is
reduced in amplitude, but not suppressed entirely, by changing the equation of
state from isothermal to ideal. These waves are too low-frequency to affect
sedimentation of dust to the midplane, but may have significance for the
gravitational stability of the resulting midplane dust layers.
