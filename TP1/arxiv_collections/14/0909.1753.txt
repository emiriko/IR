A re-analysis of data from electron-pair production following 160 A GeV 207Pb
bombardment of nuclear emulsions indicates the production and decay of neutral
particles of significantly lower invariant mass and shorter lifetimes than
previously claimed (J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 34 (2007) 129-138).
