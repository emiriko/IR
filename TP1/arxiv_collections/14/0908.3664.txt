We address two-dimensional waveguide arrays where light tunneling into
neighboring waveguides may be effectively suppressed by out-of-phase harmonic
modulation of the refractive index in neighboring waveguides at suitable
frequencies. Genuine two-dimensional features, such as anisotropic diffraction
engineering, diffraction-free propagation along selected directions in the
transverse plane and tunneling inhibition for multi-channel vortices, are shown
to occur.
