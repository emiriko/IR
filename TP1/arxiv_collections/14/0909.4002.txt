$\Upsilon(1s)\to\gamma(\eta',\eta, f_2(1270))$ are studied by an approach in
which the glueball components of these mesons play dominant role. Strong
dependence on quark mass has been found in the decays $(J/\psi,
\Upsilon(1s))\to\gamma(\eta',\eta)$. Very small decay rates of
$\Upsilon(1s)\to\gamma(\eta',\eta)$ are predicted. d-wave dominance has been
found in $\Upsilon(1s)\to\gamma f_2(1270)$, which leads to larger
$B(\Upsilon(1s)\to\gamma f_2(1270)).$
