We study nuclear effect in the $F^A_3(x)$ structure function in the deep
inelastic neutrino reactions on iron by taking into account Fermi motion,
binding, target mass correction, shadowing and anti-shadowing corrections.
Calculations have been done in a local density approximation using relativistic
nuclear spectral functions which include nucleon correlations for nuclear
matter. Results for $F^A_3(x)$ have been compared with the results reported at
NuTeV and also with some of the older experiments reported in the literature.
