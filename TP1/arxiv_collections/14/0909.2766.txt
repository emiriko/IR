The manifestation of exceptional points in the scattering continuum of atomic
nucleus is studied using the real-energy continuum shell model. It is shown
that low-energy exceptional points appear for realistic values of coupling to
the continuum and, hence, could be accessible experimentally. Experimental
signatures are proposed which include the jump by $2\pi$ of the elastic
scattering phase shift and a salient energy dependence of cross-sections in the
vicinity of the exceptional point.
