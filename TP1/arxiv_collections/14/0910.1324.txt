We report a search for the decay psi(2S) -> gamma eta_c(2S) in a sample of
25.9 million psi(2S) events collected with the CLEO-c detector. No signals are
observed in any of the 11 exclusive eta_c(2S) decay modes studied, or in their
sum. Product branching fraction upper limits are determined as a function of
Gamma[eta_c(2S)] for the 11 individual modes.
