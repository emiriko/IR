Extensive Kerr microscopy studies reveal a strongly temperature dependent
domain wall dynamics in Hall-bars made from compressively strained GaMnAs.
Depending on the temperature magnetic charging of domain walls is observed and
nucleation rates depend on the Hall-geometry with respect to the crystal axes.
Above a critical temperature where a biaxial-to-uniaxial anisotropy transition
occurs a drastic increase of nucleation events is observed. Below this
temperature, the nucleation of domains tends to be rather insensitive to
temperature. This first spatially resolved study of domain wall dynamics in
patterned GaMnAs at variable temperatures has important implications for
potential single domain magneto-logic devices made from ferromagnetic
semiconductors.
