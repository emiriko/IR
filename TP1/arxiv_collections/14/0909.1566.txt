We present a preliminary survey of 58 radio sources within the isoplanatic
patches (r < 25") of bright (11<R<12) stars suitable for use as natural guide
stars with high-order adaptive optics (AO). An optical and near-infrared
imaging survey was conducted utilizing tip-tilt corrections in the optical and
AO in the near-infrared. Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) were fit to the
multi-band data for the purpose of obtaining photometric redshifts using the
Hyperz code. Several of these photometric redshifts were confirmed with
spectroscopy, a result that gives more confidence to the redshift distribution
for the whole sample. Additional long-wavelength data from Spitzer, SCUBA,
SHARC2, and VLA supplement the optical and near-infrared data. We find the
sample generally follows and extends the magnitude-redshift relation found for
more powerful local radio galaxies. The survey has identified several
reasonably bright (H=19-20) objects at significant redshifts (z>1) that are now
within the capabilities of the current generation of AO-fed integral-field
spectrographs. These objects constitute a unique sample that can be used for
detailed ground-based AO studies of galactic structure, evolution, and AGN
formation at high redshift.
