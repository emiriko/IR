We have performed a detailed investigation of the electrical properties of a
graphene monolayer which is modulated by a weak one dimensional periodic
potential in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. The periodic
modulation broadens the Landau Levels into bands which oscillate with B. The
electronic conduction in this system can take place through either diffusive
scattering or collisional scattering off impurities. Both these contributions
to electronic transport are taken into account in this work. In addition to the
appearance of commensurability oscillations in both the collisional and
diffusive contributions, we find that Hall resistance also exhibits
commensurability oscillations. Furthermore, the period and amplitude of these
commensurability oscillations in the transport parameters and how they are
affected by temperature are also discussed in this work.
