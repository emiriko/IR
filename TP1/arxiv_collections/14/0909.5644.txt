The Tevatron, with p p-bar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96TeV can produce all
flavors of B hadrons and allows for unprecedented studies in the B physics
sector. The CDF and D0 collaborations have more than 5 fb-1 of data recorded. I
present here a selection of results on the masses, lifetimes and mixings of B
hadrons using between 1.0 and 2.8fb-1 of data.
