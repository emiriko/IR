We show that renormalization group (RG) theory applied to complex networks
are useful to classify network topologies into universality classes in the
space of configurations. The RG flow readily identifies a small-world/fractal
transition by finding (i) a trivial stable fixed point of a complete graph,
(ii) a non-trivial point of a pure fractal topology that is stable or unstable
according to the amount of long-range links in the network, and (iii) another
stable point of a fractal with short-cuts that exists exactly at the
small-world/fractal transition. As a collateral, the RG technique explains the
coexistence of the seemingly contradicting fractal and small-world phases and
allows to extract information on the distribution of short-cuts in real-world
networks, a problem of importance for information flow in the system.
