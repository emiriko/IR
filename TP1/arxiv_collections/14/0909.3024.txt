The knowledge of capacitance in semiconductor micro-strip detectors is
important for a correct design, simulation and understanding of the detectors.
Analytical approaches can efficiently complement numerical methods providing
quick results in the design phase. The conformal mapping method has proved to
be the most effective analytical approach providing many realistic models. In
this paper improved analytical results are presented and compared with
experimental data.
