We present a complete and minimal catalogue of MSSM gauge invariant
monomials. That is, the catalogue of Gherghetta, Kolda and Martin is elaborated
to include generational structure for all monomials. Any gauge invariant
operator can be built as a linear combination of elements of the catalogue
lifted to nonnegative integer powers. And the removal of any one of the
monomials would deprive the catalogue of this feature. It contains 712
monomials - plus 3 generations of righthanded neutrinos if one extends the
model to the $\nu$MSSM. We note that $\nu$MSSM flat directions can all be
lifted by the 6th order superpotential - compared to the 9th order needed in
MSSM.
