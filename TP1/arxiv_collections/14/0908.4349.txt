Like all natural hazards, space weather exhibits occasional extreme events
over timescales of decades to centuries. Historical events provoked much
interest but had little economic impact. However, the widespread adoption of
advanced technological infrastructures over the past fifty years gives these
events the potential to disrupt those infrastructures - and thus create
profound economic and societal impact. However, like all extreme hazards, such
events are rare, so we have limited data on which to build our understanding of
the events. Many other natural hazards (e.g. flash floods) are highly
localised, so statistically significant datasets can be assembled by combining
data from independent instances of the hazard recorded over a few decades. But
we have a single instance of space weather so we would have to make
observations for many centuries in order to build a statistically significant
dataset. Instead we must exploit our knowledge of solar-terrestrial physics to
find other ways to assess these risks. We discuss three alternative approaches:
(a) use of proxy data, (b) studies of other solar systems, and (c) use of
physics-based modelling. The proxy data approach is well-established as a
technique for assessing the long-term risk from radiation storms, but does not
yet provide any means to assess the risk from severe geomagnetic storms. This
latter risk is more suited to the other approaches. We need to develop and
expand techniques to monitoring key space weather features in other solar
systems. To make progress in modelling severe space weather, we need to focus
on the physics that controls severe geomagnetic storms, e.g. how can dayside
and tail reconnection be modulated to expand the region of open flux to envelop
mid-latitudes?
