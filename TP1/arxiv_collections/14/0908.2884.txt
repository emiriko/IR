Electron transport properties of a biphenyl molecule are studied based on the
Green's function formalism. The molecule is sandwiched between two metallic
electrodes, where each benzene ring is threaded by a magnetic flux $\phi$. The
results are focused on the effects of the molecule to electrode coupling
strength and the magnetic flux $\phi$. Our numerical study shows that, for a
fixed molecular coupling, the current amplitude across the bridge can be {\em
regulated} significantly just by tuning the flux $\phi$. This aspect may be
utilized in designing nano-scale electronic circuits.
