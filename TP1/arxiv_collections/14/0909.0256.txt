We provide a simple example that illustrates the advantage of adaptive over
non-adaptive strategies for quantum channel discrimination. In particular, we
give a pair of entanglement-breaking channels that can be perfectly
discriminated by means of an adaptive strategy that requires just two channel
evaluations, but for which no non-adaptive strategy can give a perfect
discrimination using any finite number of channel evaluations.
