The angular dependent magnetoresistance of (Per)2[Au(mnt)2] under pressure
has revealed geometrical effects associated with the crystallographic
parameters. Pressure suppresses the charge density wave ground state of the
material, and in the metallic state both geometrical and orbital quantum
interference effects appear. Through magnetic field dependence and orientation,
the orbital and geometrical effects are independently identified. We compare
the results from (Per)2[Au(mnt)2] with previous studies of the well-known
Bechgaard salts.
