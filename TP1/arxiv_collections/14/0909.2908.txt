Quick chemical equilibration times of hadrons (specifically, $p\bar{p}$,
$K\bar{K}$, $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$, and $\Omega\bar{\Omega}$ pairs) within a
hadron gas are explained dynamically using Hagedorn states, which drive
particles into equilibrium close to the critical temperature. Within this
scheme, we use master equations and derive various analytical estimates for the
chemical equilibration times. We compare our model to recent lattice results
and find that for both $T_c=176$ MeV and $T_c=196$ MeV, the hadrons can reach
chemical equilibrium almost immediately, well before the chemical freeze-out
temperatures found in thermal fits for a hadron gas without Hagedorn states.
Furthermore the ratios $p/\pi$, $K/\pi$, $\Lambda/\pi$, and $\Omega / \pi $
match experimental values well in our dynamical scenario.
