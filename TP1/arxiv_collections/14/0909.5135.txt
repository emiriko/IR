We present an analysis of the observations of HD 51106 and HD 50747 by the
satellite CoRoT, obtained during its initial run, and of the spectroscopic
preparatory observations.
  AIMS: We complete an analysis of the light curve, extract the main
frequencies observed, and discuss some preliminary interpretations about the
stars.
  Methods: We used standard Fourier transform and pre-whitening methods to
extract information about the periodicities of the stars.
  Results: HD 51106 is an ellipsoidal binary, the light curve of which can be
completely explained by the tidal deformation of the star and smaller secondary
effects. HD 50747 is a triple system containing a variable star, which exhibits
many modes of oscillation with periods in the range of a few hours. On the
basis of this period range and the analysis of the physical parameters of the
star, we conclude that HD 50747 is a Gamma-Doradus star.
