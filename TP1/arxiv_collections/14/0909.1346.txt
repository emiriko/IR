Column-oriented indexes-such as projection or bitmap indexes-are compressed
by run-length encoding to reduce storage and increase speed. Sorting the tables
improves compression. On realistic data sets, permuting the columns in the
right order before sorting can reduce the number of runs by a factor of two or
more. Unfortunately, determining the best column order is NP-hard. For many
cases, we prove that the number of runs in table columns is minimized if we
sort columns by increasing cardinality. Experimentally, sorting based on
Hilbert space-filling curves is poor at minimizing the number of runs.
