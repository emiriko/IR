The mathematical functions log(x), exp(x), root[n]x, sin(x), cos(x), tan(x),
arcsin(x), arctan(x), x^y, sinh(x), cosh(x), tanh(x) and Gamma(x) have been
implemented for arguments x in the real domain in a native Java library on top
of the multi-precision BigDecimal representation of floating point numbers.
This supports scientific applications where more than the double precision
accuracy of the library of the Standard Edition is desired. The full source
code is made available under the LGPL v3.0.
