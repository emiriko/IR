(Abridged) We investigate massive star formation in turbulent, magnetized,
parsec-scale clumps of molecular clouds including protostellar outflow feedback
using Enzo-based MHD simulations with accreting sink particles and effective
resolution $2048^3$. We find that, in the absence of regulation by magnetic
fields and outflow feedback, massive stars form readily in a turbulent,
moderately condensed clump of $\sim 1,600$ solar masses, along with a cluster
of hundreds of lower mass stars. The massive stars are fed at high rates by (1)
transient dense filaments produced by large-scale turbulent compression at
early times, and (2) by the clump-wide global collapse resulting from
turbulence decay at late times. In both cases, the bulk of the massive star's
mass is supplied from outside a 0.1 pc-sized "core" that surrounds the star. In
our simulation, the massive star is clump-fed rather than core-fed. The need
for large-scale feeding makes the massive star formation prone to regulation by
outflow feedback, which directly opposes the feeding processes. The outflows
reduce the mass accretion rates onto the massive stars by breaking up the dense
filaments that feed the massive star formation at early times, and by
collectively slowing down the global collapse that fuel the massive star
formation at late times. The latter is aided by a moderate magnetic field of
strength in the observed range. We conclude that the massive star formation in
our simulated turbulent, magnetized, parsec-scale clump is outflow-regulated
and clump-fed (ORCF for short). An important implication is that the formation
of low-mass stars in a dense clump can affect the formation of massive stars in
the same clump, through their outflow feedback on the clump dynamics.
