The notion of symmetry is defined in the context of Linear and Integer
Programming. Symmetric integer programs are studied from a group theoretical
viewpoint. We investigate the structure of integer solutions of integer
programs and show that any integer program on n variables having an alternating
group A_n as a group of symmetries can be solved in linear time in the number
of variables.
