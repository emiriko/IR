We consider principal pivot transform (pivot) on graphs. We define a natural
variant of this operation, called dual pivot, and show that both the kernel and
the set of maximally applicable pivots of a graph are invariant under this
operation. The result is motivated by and applicable to the theory of gene
assembly in ciliates.
