We discuss the possibility that the X(3872) can be a hadronic DD* bound state
in the framework of a potential model. The potential is generated by the
exchange of pseudoscalar, scalar and vector mesons resulting from the
Lagrangian of heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory. The hadronic bound state
configuration contains charged and neutral DD* components, while orbital S- and
D-waves are included. Isospin symmetry breaking effects are fully taken into
account. We show that binding in the DD* system with J(PC)=1(++) already exists
for a reasonable value of the meson-exchange regularization parameter of Lambda
around 1.2 GeV. We also explore the possibility of hadronic BB* bound states
and show that binding can be achieved in the isoscalar limit for J(PC)=1(++) or
1(+-).
