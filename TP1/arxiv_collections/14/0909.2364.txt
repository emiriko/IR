We investigate the role of the pion in Covariant Density Functional Theory.
Starting from conventional Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) theory with a
non-linear coupling of the $\sigma$-meson and without exchange terms we add
pions with a pseudo-vector coupling to the nucleons in relativistic
Hartree-Fock approximation. In order to take into account the change of the
pion field in the nuclear medium the effective coupling constant of the pion is
treated as a free parameter. It is found that the inclusion of the pion to this
sort of density functionals does not destroy the overall description of the
bulk properties by RMF. On the other hand, the non-central contribution of the
pion (tensor coupling) does have effects on single particle energies and on
binding energies of certain nuclei.
