We studied the decay psi(2S) to gamma eta_c(2S) with 25.9 million psi(2S)
events collected with the CLEO-c detector. No psi(2S) to gamma eta_c(2S) decays
were observed in any of the eleven exclusive eta_c(2S) decay modes studied. The
product branching fraction upper limits were determined for all modes. The 90%
confidence level upper limit of branching fraction of psi(2S) to gamma eta_c
(2S) was obtained.
