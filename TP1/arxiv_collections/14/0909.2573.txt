To solve the current debate on the position of the quasi-bound K^-p state,
namely, "Lambda(1405) or Lambda*(1420)", we propose to measure the T_{21} =
T_{Sigma-pi \leftarrow Kbar-N} Sigma-pi invariant-mass spectrum in stopped-K-
absorption in deuteron, since the spectrum, reflecting the soft and hard
deuteron momentum distribution, is expected to have a narrow quasi-free
component with an upper edge of M = 1430 MeV/c^2, followed by a significant
"high-momentum" tail toward the lower mass region, where a resonant formation
of Lambda(1405) of any mass and width in a wide range is revealed. We introduce
a "deviation" spectrum as defined by DEV = OBS (observed or calculated) / QF
(non-resonant quasi-free), in which the resonant component can be seen as an
isolated peak free from the QF shape.
