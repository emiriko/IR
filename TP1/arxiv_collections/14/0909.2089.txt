Instruction sequences with direct and indirect jump instructions are as
expressive as instruction sequences with direct jump instructions only. We show
that, in the case where the number of instructions is not bounded, we are faced
with increases of the maximal internal delays of instruction sequences on
execution that are not bounded by a linear function if we strive for acceptable
increases of the lengths of instruction sequences on elimination of indirect
jump instructions.
