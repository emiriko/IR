We outline a new formalism for dipole-type parton showers which maintain
exact energy-momentum conservation at each step of the evolution. Particular
emphasis is put on the coherence properties, the level at which recoil effects
do enter and the role of transverse momentum generation from initial state
radiation. The formulated algorithm is shown to correctly incorporate coherence
for soft gluon radiation. Furthermore, it is well suited for easing matching to
next-to-leading order calculations.
