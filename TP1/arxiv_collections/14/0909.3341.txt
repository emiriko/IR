We present results obtained from a finite-element simulation of seismic
displacement fields and of gravity gradients generated by those fields. The
displacement field is constructed by a plane wave model with a 3D isotropic
stochastic field and a 2D fundamental Rayleigh field. The plane wave model
provides an accurate representation of stationary fields from distant sources.
Underground gravity gradients are calculated as acceleration of a free test
mass inside a cavity. The results are discussed in the context of
gravity-gradient noise subtraction in third generation gravitational-wave
detectors. Error analysis with respect to the density of the simulated grid
leads to a derivation of an improved seismometer placement inside a 3D array
which would be used in practice to monitor the seismic field.
