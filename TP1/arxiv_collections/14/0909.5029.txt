We consider the question of implementability of a social choice function in a
classical setting where the preferences of finitely many selfish individuals
with private information have to be aggregated towards a social choice. This is
one of the central questions in mechanism design. If the concept of weak
implementation is considered, the Revelation Principle states that one can
restrict attention to truthful implementations and direct revelation
mechanisms, which implies that implementability of a social choice function is
easy to check. For the concept of strong implementation, however, the
Revelation Principle becomes invalid, and the complexity of deciding whether a
given social choice function is strongly implementable has been open so far. In
this paper, we show by using methods from polyhedral theory that strong
implementability of a social choice function can be decided in polynomial space
and that each of the payments needed for strong implementation can always be
chosen to be of polynomial encoding length. Moreover, we show that strong
implementability of a social choice function involving only a single selfish
individual can be decided in polynomial time via linear programming.
