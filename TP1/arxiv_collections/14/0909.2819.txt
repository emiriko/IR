Due to the breaking of gauge symmetry in rotating superfluid Helium, the
inertial mass of a vortex diverges with the vortex size. The vortex inertial
mass is thus much higher than the classical inertial mass of the vortex core.
An equal increase of the vortex gravitational mass is questioned. The
possibility that the vortices in a rotating superfluid could break the weak
equivalence principle in relation with a variable speed of light in the
superfluid vacuum is debated. Experiments to test this possibility are
investigated on the bases that superfluid Helium vortices would not fall, under
the single influence of a uniform gravitational field, at the same rate as the
rest of the superfluid Helium mass.
