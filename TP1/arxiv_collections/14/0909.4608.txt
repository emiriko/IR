We show that techniques of spatial adiabatic passage can be used to realise
an electron interferometer in a geometry analogous to a conventional
Aharonov-Bohm ring, with transport of the particle through the device modulated
using coherent transport adiabatic passage. This device shows an interesting
interplay between the adiabatic and non-adiabatic behaviour of the system. The
transition between non-adiabatic and adiabatic behaviour may be tuned via
system parameters and the total time over which the protocol is enacted.
Interference effects in the final state populations analogous to the
electrostatic Aharonov-Bohm effect are observed.
