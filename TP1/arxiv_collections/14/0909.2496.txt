In this paper, we study the problems of video processing in video search
engine. Video has now become a very important kind of data in Internet; while
searching for video is still a challenging task due to the inner properties of
video: requiring enormous storage space, being independent, expressing
information hiddenly. To handle the properties of video more effectively, in
this paper, we propose a new video processing method in video search engine. In
detail, the core of the new video processing method is creating pavideoge--a
new data type, which contains the video advantages and webpage advantages. The
pavideoge has four attributes: real link, videorank, text information and
playnum. Each of them combines video's properties with webpage's. Video search
engine based on the pavideoge can retrieve video more effectively. The
experiment results show the encouraging performance of our approach. Based on
the pavideoge, our video search engine can retrieve more precise videos in
comparsion with previous related work.
