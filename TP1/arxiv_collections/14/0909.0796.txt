Chirped-pulse interferometry is a new interferometric technique encapsulating
the advantages of the quantum Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer without the
drawbacks of using entangled photons. Both interferometers can exhibit
even-order dispersion cancellation which allows high resolution optical delay
measurements even in thick optical samples. In the present work, we show that
finite frequency correlations in chirped-pulse interferometry and
Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry limit the degree of dispersion cancellation. Our
results are important considerations in designing practical devices based on
these technologies.
