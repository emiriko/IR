Using e+e- collision data taken with the CLEO-c detector at the Cornell
Electron Storage Ring, we have investigated the direct photon spectrum in the
decay psi(2S)->gamma+gluon+gluon. We determine the ratio R of that inclusive
direct photon decay rate to that of the three-gluon decay rate psi(2S)->3-gluon
to be R(z>0.4)=0.070+/-0.002+/-0.019+/-0.011, with z defined as the scaled
photon energy relative to the beam energy. The errors shown are statistical,
systematic, and that due to the uncertainty in the input branching fractions
used to extract the ratio, respectively. This R value is approximately 2/3 of
the comparable value for the J/psi(1S), both in the region z>0.4, and also when
extrapolated to the full range z>0.
