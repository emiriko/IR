We present a universal crease pattern--known in geometry as the tetrakis
tiling and in origami as box pleating--that can fold into any object made up of
unit cubes joined face-to-face (polycubes). More precisely, there is one
universal finite crease pattern for each number n of unit cubes that need to be
folded. This result contrasts previous universality results for origami, which
require a different crease pattern for each target object, and confirms
intuition in the origami community that box pleating is a powerful design
technique.
