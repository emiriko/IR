Radiative neutralino decay $\chi^0_2 -> \chi^0_1\gamma$ is studied in a Split
Supersymmetric scenario, and compared with mSUGRA and MSSM. This 1-loop process
has a transition amplitude which is often quite small, but has the advantage of
providing a very clear and distinct signature: electromagnetic radiation plus
missing energy. In Split Supersymmetry this radiative decay is in direct
competition with the tree-level three-body decay $\chi^0_2 -> \chi^0_1
f\overline f$, and we obtain large values for the branching ratio $B(\chi^0_2
-> \chi^0_1\gamma)$ which can be close to unity in the region $M_2 \sim M_1$.
Furthermore, the value for the radiative neutralino decay branching ratio has a
strong dependence on the split supersymmetric scale $\widetilde{m}$, which is
otherwise very difficult to infer from experimental observables.
