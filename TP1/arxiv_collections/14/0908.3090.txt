We propose a modeling framework for generating security protocol
specifications. The generated protocol specifications rely on the use of a
sequential and a semantical component. The first component defines protocol
properties such as preconditions, effects, message sequences and it is
developed as a WSDL-S specification. The second component defines the semantic
aspects corresponding to the messages included in the first component by the
use of ontological constructions and it is developed as an OWL-based
specification. Our approach was validated on 13 protocols from which we
mention: the ISO9798 protocol, the CCITTX.509 data transfer protocol and the
Kerberos symmetric key protocol.
