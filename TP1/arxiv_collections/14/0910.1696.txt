An external magnetic field has been applied in laterally coupled dots (QDs)
and we have studied the QD properties related to charge decoherence. The
significance of the applied magnetic field to the suppression of
electron-phonon relaxation and dephasing rates has been explored. The coupled
QDs have been studied by varing the magnetic field and the interdot distance as
other system parameters. Our numerical results show that the electron
scattering rates are strongly dependent on the applied external magnetic field
and the details of the double QD configuration.
