We generalize the topological entanglement entropy to a family of topological
Renyi entropies parametrized by a parameter alpha, in an attempt to find new
invariants for distinguishing topologically ordered phases. We show that,
surprisingly, all topological Renyi entropies are the same, independent of
alpha for all non-chiral topological phases. This independence shows that
topologically ordered ground-state wavefunctions have reduced density matrices
with a certain simple structure, and no additional universal information can be
extracted from the entanglement spectrum.
