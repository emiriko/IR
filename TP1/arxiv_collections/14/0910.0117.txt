We use Monte-Carlo Markov chain techniques to constrain acceptable parameter
regions for the Munich L-Galaxies semi-analytic galaxy formation model.
Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is required to limit star-formation
in the most massive galaxies. However, we show that the introduction of tidal
stripping of dwarf galaxies as they fall into and merge with their host systems
can lead to a reduction in the required degree of AGN feedback. In addition,
the new model correctly reproduces both the metallicity of large galaxies and
the fraction of intracluster light.
