The transmission electron microscopy observations of the charge ordering (CO)
which governs the electronic polarization in LuFe2O4-x clearly show the
presence of a remarkable phase separation at low temperatures. Two CO ground
states are found to adopt the charge modulations of Q1 = (1/3, 1/3, 0) and Q2 =
(1/3 + y, 1/3 + y, 3/2), respectively. Our structural study demonstrates that
the incommensurately Q2-modulated state is chiefly stable in samples with
relatively lower oxygen contents. Data from theoretical simulations of the
diffraction suggest that both Q1- and Q2-modulated phases have ferroelectric
ordering. The effects of oxygen concentration on the phase separation and
electric polarization in this layered system are discussed.
