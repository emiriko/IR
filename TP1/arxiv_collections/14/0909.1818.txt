Using a sums of squares formula for two variable polynomials with no zeros on
the bidisk, we are able to give a new proof of a representation for
distinguished varieties. For distinguished varieties with no singularities on
the two-torus, we are able to provide extra details about the representation
formula and use this to prove a bounded extension theorem.
