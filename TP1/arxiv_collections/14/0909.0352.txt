Disorder in spin-orbit (SO) coupling is an important feature of real
low-dimensional electron structures. We study spin relaxation due to such a
disorder as well as resulting abilities of spin manipulation. The spin
relaxation reveals quantum effects when the spatial scale of the randomness is
smaller than the electron wavelength. Due to the disorder in SO coupling, a
time-dependent external electric field generates a spatially random
spin-dependent perturbation. The resulting electric dipole spin resonance in a
two-dimensional electron gas leads to spin injection in a frequency range of
the order of the Fermi energy. These effects can be important for possible
applications in spintronics.
