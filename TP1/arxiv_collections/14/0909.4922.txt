On the basis of the Grand Combinational Model (GCM) outlined and somewhat
detailed in the text, we have attempted to capture here the several interesting
assorted characteristics of the rapidity-spectra of the major varieties of
secondaries produced in diverse nuclear reactions at various energies, though
the main thrust of our work lies on addressing the data-trends from RHIC-BNL
experiments. Obviously the core of the present approach is purely
phenomenological. Still, the method and the model address the features of the
data modestly well. And the method appears to have the rich potentiality, if
the systematic sets of data for rapidity-studies at gradually increasing
energies were available.
