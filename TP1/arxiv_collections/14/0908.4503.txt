Radiation spectrum from high energy $e^\pm$ in a bent crystal with arbitrary
curvature distribution along the longitudinal coordinate is evaluated, based on
the stationary phase approximation. For a uniformly bent crystal a closed-form
expression for the spectrum is derived. Features such as sharp end of spectrum
and volume reflection turnover at beginning of the spectrum are discussed. The
coherence length in a bent crystal appears to depend only on the crystal
geometry and not on the electron or photon energies, which is essential for
interpretation of the results. Estimates of non-dipole radiation and multiple
scattering effects are given. The value for the crystal bending angle at which
the dipole coherent bremsstrahlung theory holds best appears to be $\sim
10^{-4}\mathrm{rad}$.
