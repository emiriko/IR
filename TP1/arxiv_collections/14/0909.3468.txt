New foundations for quantum logic and quantum spaces are constructed by
merging algebraic quantum theory and topos theory. Interpreting Bohr's
"doctrine of classical concepts" mathematically, given a quantum theory
described by a noncommutative C*-algebra A, we construct a topos T(A), which
contains the "Bohrification" B of A as an internal commutative C*-algebra. Then
B has a spectrum, a locale internal to T(A), the external description S(A) of
which we interpret as the "Bohrified" phase space of the physical system. As in
classical physics, the open subsets of S(A) correspond to (atomic)
propositions, so that the "Bohrified" quantum logic of A is given by the
Heyting algebra structure of S(A). The key difference between this logic and
its classical counterpart is that the former does not satisfy the law of the
excluded middle, and hence is intuitionistic. When A contains sufficiently many
projections (e.g. when A is a von Neumann algebra, or, more generally, a
Rickart C*-algebra), the intuitionistic quantum logic S(A) of A may also be
compared with the traditional quantum logic, i.e. the orthomodular lattice of
projections in A. This time, the main difference is that the former is
distributive (even when A is noncommutative), while the latter is not.
