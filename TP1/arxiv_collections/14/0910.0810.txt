We study the Lie point symmetries of Einstein's equations for the
Friedmann-Roberstson-Walker Cosmology. They form either a two - dimensional or
a three - dimensional solvable group depending on the form of the self
interacting potential. Using the invariants of the group we reduce the second
order system of differential equations into a first order system. Writing the
action in terms of the proper time we study the point symmetries and the
variational symmetries of the resulting equations.
