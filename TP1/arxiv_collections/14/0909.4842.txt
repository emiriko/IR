In this paper we analyze a 1+3 dimensional solution of relativistic
hydrodynamics. We calculate momentum distribution and other observables from
the solution and compare them to measurements from the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC). We find that the solution we analyze is compatible with the
data. In the last several years many numerical models were tested, but it is
the first time that an exact, parametric, 1+3 dimensional relativistic solution
is compared to data.
