We provide a class of initial encodings that can be sent with a high fidelity
over an unmodulated, linear, XY spin chain. As an example, an average fidelity
of ninety-six percent can be obtained using an eleven-spin encoding to transmit
a state over a chain containing ten-thousand spins. An analysis of the magnetic
field dependence is given, and conditions for field optimization are provided.
