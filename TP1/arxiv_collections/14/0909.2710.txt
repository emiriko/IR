We studied the transverse beam dynamics including aberration effects of
sextupole and octupole perturbations in a thermal wave model. A functional
integration method was used to calculate the first-order perturbation effects.
We found that the model successfully explains a PARMILA simulation results for
proton beams without space-charge effects in a FODO lattice.
