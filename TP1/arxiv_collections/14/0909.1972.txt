We show that Quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations of the dynamic structure factor
of the isotropic spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic chain at intermediate temperatures
corroborate a picture of diffusive spin dynamics at finite frequencies in the
low-energy long wave-length limit and are in good agreement with recent
predictions for this by J. Sirker, R. G. Pereira, and I. Affleck
[arXiv:0906.1978v1].
