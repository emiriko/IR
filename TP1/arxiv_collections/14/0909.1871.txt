We study two models realized by two-component Fermi gases loaded in optical
lattices. We clarify that multi-band effects inevitably caused by the optical
lattices generate a rich structure, when the systems crossover from the region
of weakly bound molecular bosons to the region of strongly bound atomic bosons.
Here the crossover can be controlled by attractive fermion interaction. One of
the present models is a case with attractive fermion interaction, where an
insulator-superfluid transition takes place. The transition is characterized as
the transition between a band insulator and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
superfluid state. Differing from the conventional BCS superfluid transition,
this transition shows unconventional properties. In contrast to the one
particle excitation gap scaled by the superfluid order parameter in the
conventional BCS transition, because of the multi-band effects, a large gap of
one-particle density of states is retained all through the transition although
the superfluid order grows continuously from zero. A reentrant transition with
lowering temperature is another unconventionality. The other model is the case
with coexisting attractive and repulsive interactions. Within a mean field
treatment, we find a new insulating state, an orbital ordered insulator. This
insulator is one candidate for the Mott insulator of molecular bosons and is
the first example that the orbital internal degrees of freedom of molecular
bosons appears explicitly. Besides the emergence of a new phase, a coexisting
phase also appears where superfluidity and an orbital order coexist just by
doping holes or particles. The insulating and superfluid particles show
differentiation in momentum space as in the high-Tc cuprate superconductors.
