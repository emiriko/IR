An optical spectroscopic method based on the principle of
electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) is proposed as quite a generic
probing tool that provides valuable insights into the nature of Fermi paring in
ultracold Fermi gases of two hyperfine states. This technique has the
capability of allowing spectroscopic response to be determined in a nearly
non-destructive manner and the whole spectrum may be obtained by scanning the
probe laser frequency faster than the lifetime of the sample without
re-preparing the atomic sample repeatedly. A quasiparticle picture is
constructed to facilitate a simple physical explanation of the pairing
signature in the EIT spectra.
