Kazhdan-Lusztig ideals, a family of generalized determinantal ideals
investigated in [Woo-Yong '08], provide an explicit choice of coordinates and
equations encoding a neighbourhood of a torus-fixed point of a Schubert variety
on a type A flag variety. Our main result is a Grobner basis for these ideals.
This provides a single geometric setting to transparently explain the
naturality of pipe dreams on the Rothe diagram of a permutation, and their
appearance in:
  * combinatorial formulas [Fomin-Kirillov '94] for Schubert and Grothendieck
polynomials of [Lascoux-Schutzenberger '82];
  * the equivariant K-theory specialization formula of [Buch-Rimanyi '04]; and
  * a positive combinatorial formula for multiplicities of Schubert varieties
in good cases, including those for which the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig ideal
is homogeneous under the standard grading.
  Our results generalize (with alternate proofs) [Knutson-Miller '05]'s Grobner
basis theorem for Schubert determinantal ideals and their geometric
interpretation of the monomial positivity of Schubert polynomials. We also
complement recent work of [Knutson '08,'09] on degenerations of Kazhdan-Lusztig
varieties in general Lie type, as well as work of [Goldin '01] on equivariant
localization and of [Lakshmibai-Weyman '90], [Rosenthal-Zelevinsky '01], and
[Krattenthaler '01] on Grassmannian multiplicity formulas.
