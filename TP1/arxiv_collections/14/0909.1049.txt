When a person joins in an organization, he becomes authorize to take some
decisions on behalf of that organization; means he is given some authority to
exercise. After some time, on the basis of his performance in the organization,
he is given promotion and he becomes eligible to exercise to some higher
authorities. And further, he may get some higher promotion or he may leave the
organization. So, during his stay in the organization, the authority of that
person varies from the time he joins the organization until he/she leaves the
organization. This paper presents the variation in authorities of a person in
the organization. The method implements the queuing model to analyze the
various people in the queue of their promotion and looks at various parameters
like average waiting time etc.
