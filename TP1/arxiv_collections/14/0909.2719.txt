This paper presents an abstract data model for linguistic annotations and its
implementation using XML, RDF and related standards; and to outline the work of
a newly formed committee of the International Standards Organization (ISO),
ISO/TC 37/SC 4 Language Resource Management, which will use this work as its
starting point. The primary motive for presenting the latter is to solicit the
participation of members of the research community to contribute to the work of
the committee.
