Although experiments carried out by Jain et al. showed that the Cooper pairs
obey the strong equivalence principle, The measurement of the Cooper pairs
inertial mass by Tate et al. revealed an anomalous excess of mass. In the
present paper we interpret these experimental results in the framework of an
electromagnetic model of dark energy for the superconductors' vacuum. We argue
that this physical vacuum is associated with a preferred frame. Ultimately from
the conservation of energy for Cooper pairs we derive a model for a variable
vacuum speed of light in the superconductors physical vacuum in relation with a
possible breaking of the weak equivalence principle for Cooper pairs.
