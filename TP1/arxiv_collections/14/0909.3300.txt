The dwarf galaxy Segue 1 is one of the most promising targets for the
indirect detection of dark matter. Here we examine what constraints 9 months of
Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations of Segue 1 place upon the Constrained Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM), with the lightest neutralino as the dark
matter particle. We use nested sampling to explore the CMSSM parameter space,
simultaneously fitting other relevant constraints from accelerator bounds, the
relic density, electroweak precision observables, the anomalous magnetic moment
of the muon and B-physics. We include spectral and spatial fits to the Fermi
observations, a full treatment of the instrumental response and its related
uncertainty, and detailed background models. We also perform an extrapolation
to 5 years of observations, assuming no signal is observed from Segue 1 in that
time. Results marginally disfavour models with low neutralino masses and high
annihilation cross-sections. Virtually all of these models are however already
disfavoured by existing experimental or relic density constraints.
