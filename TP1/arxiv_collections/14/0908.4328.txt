Three centroiding techniques to estimate the position of the spots in a Shack
Hartmann sensor: Normalized Centre of Gravity (CoG), Iteratively Weighted
Centre of Gravity (IWCoG) and Intensity Weighted (IWC) centroiding are studied
in comparison. The spot pattern at the focal plane of a Shack Hartmann sensor
was simulated by including the effect of a background noise. We present the
results of optimization of the performance of each of the centroiding
techniques as a function of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) at different
experimental conditions.
