We investigate the relationship between persistent currents in multi-channel
rings containing an embedded scatterer and the conductance through the same
scatterer attached to leads. The case of two uncoupled channels corresponds to
a Hubbard chain, for which the one-dimensional embedding method is readily
generalized. Various tests are carried out to validate this new procedure, and
the conductance of short one-dimensional Hubbard chains attached to perfect
leads is computed for different system sizes and interaction strengths. In the
case of two coupled channels the conductance can be obtained from a statistical
analysis of the persistent current or by reducing the multi-channel scattering
problem to several single-channel setups.
