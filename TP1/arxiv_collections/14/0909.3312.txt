We search for evidence of a relation between properties of young stellar
objects (YSOs) and their parent molecular clouds to understand the initial
conditions of high-mass star formation. A sample of 135 sources was selected
from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) Point Source Catalog, on the
basis of their red color to enhance the possibility of discovering young
sources. Using the Kolner Observatorium fur SubMillimeter Astronomie (KOSMA)
3-m telescope, a single-point survey in 13CO(2-1) was carried out for the
entire sample, and 14 sources were mapped further. Archival mid-infrared (MIR)
data were compared with the 13CO emissions to identify evolutionary stages of
the sources. A 13CO observed sample was assembled to investigate the
correlation between 13CO line width of the clouds and the luminosity of the
associated YSOs. We identified 98 sources suitable for star formation analyses
for which relevant parameters were calculated. We detected 18 cores from 14
mapped sources, which were identified with eight pre-UC HII regions and one UC
HII region, two high-mass cores earlier than pre-UC HII phase, four possible
star forming clusters, and three sourceless cores. By compiling a large (360
sources) 13CO observed sample, a good correlation was found between the 13CO
line width of the clouds and the bolometric luminosity of the associated YSOs,
which can be fitted as a power law: lg(dV13/km/s)=-0.023+0.135lg(Lbol/Lsolar).
Results show that luminous (>10^3Lsolar) YSOs tend to be associated with both
more massive and more turbulent (dV13>2km/s) molecular cloud structures.
