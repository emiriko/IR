We determine the parton distribution functions (PDFs) in a
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD-analysis of the inclusive
neutral-current deep-inelastic-scattering (DIS) world data combined with the
neutri{-}no-nucleon DIS di-muon data and the fixed-target Drell-Yan data. The
PDF-evolution is performed in the $N_f = 3$ fixed-flavor scheme and
supplementary sets of PDFs in the 4- and 5-flavor schemes are derived from the
results in the 3-flavor scheme using matching conditions. The charm-quark DIS
contribution is calculated in a general-mass variable-flavor-number (GMVFN)
scheme interpolating between the zero-mass 4-flavor scheme at asymptotically
large values of momentum transfer $Q^2$ and the 3-flavor scheme prescription of
Buza-Matiounine-Smith-van Neerven (BMSN) at the value of $Q^2 = m_c^2$. The
results in the GMVFN scheme are compared with those of the fixed-flavor scheme
and other prescriptions used in global fits of PDFs. The strong coupling
constant is measured at an accuracy of $\approx 1.5%$. We obtain at NNLO
$\alpha_s(M_Z^2) = 0.1135 \pm 0.0014$ in the fixed-flavor scheme and
$\alpha_s(M_Z^2) = 0.1129 \pm 0.0applying the BMSN-prescription. The
implications for important standard candle and hard scattering processes at
hadron colliders are illustrated. Predictions for cross sections of $W^{\pm}$-
and $Z$-boson, the top-quark pair- and Higgs-boson production at the Tevatron
and the LHC based on the 5-flavor PDFs of the present analysis are
provided.014$
