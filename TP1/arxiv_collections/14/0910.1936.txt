In this talk, I present a new framework to understand the long-standing
fermion mass hierarchy puzzle. We extend the Standard Model gauge symmetry by
an extra local U(1)_S symmetry, broken spontaneously at the electroweak scale.
All the SM particles are singlet with respect to this U(1)_S. We also introduce
additional flavor symmetries, U(1)_F's, with flavon scalars F_i, as well as
vectorlike quarks and leptons at the TeV scale. The flavon scalars have VEV in
the TeV scale. Only the top quark has the usual dimension four Yukawa coupling.
EW symmetry breaking to all other quarks and leptons are propagated through the
messenger field, S through their interactions involving the heavy vector-like
fermions and S, as well as through their interactions involving the vector-like
fermions and F_i. In addition the explaining the hierarchy of the charged
fermion masses and mixings, the model has several interesting predictions for
Higgs decays, flavor changing neutral current processes in the top and the b
quark decays, decays of the new singlet scalars to the new Z' boson, as well as
productions of the new vectorlike quarks. These predictions can be tested at
the LHC.
