The scattering of electrons with inhomogeneities produces modulations in the
local density of states of a metal. We show that electron interference
contributions to these modulations are affected by the magnetic field via the
Aharonov-Bohm effect. This can be exploited in a simple STM setup that serves
as an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer at the nanometer scale.
