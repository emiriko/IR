We review the status of CPT violation in the neutrino sector. Apart from
LSND, current data favors three flavors of light stable neutrinos and
antineutrinos, with both halves of the spectrum having one smaller mass
splitting and one larger mass splitting. Oscillation data for the smaller
splitting is consistent with CPT. For the larger splitting, current data favor
an antineutrino mass-squared splitting that is an order of magnitude larger
than the corresponding neutrino splitting, with the corresponding mixing angle
less-than-maximal. This CPT-violating spectrum is driven by recent results from
MINOS, but is consistent with other experiments if we ignore LSND. We describe
an analysis technique which, together with MINOS running optimized for muon
antineutrinos, should be able to conclusively confirm the CPT-violating
spectrum proposed here, with as little as three times the current data set. If
confirmed, the CPT-violating neutrino mass-squared difference would be an order
of magnitude less than the current most-stringent upper bound on CPT violation
for quarks and charged leptons.
