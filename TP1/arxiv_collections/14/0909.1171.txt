The degree by which a function can be differentiated need not be restricted
to integer values. Usually most of the field equations of physics are taken to
be second order, curiosity asks what happens if this is only approximately the
case and the field equations are nearly second order. For Robertson-Walker
cosmology there is a simple fractional modification of the Friedman and
conservation equations. In general fractional gravitational equations similar
to Einstein's are hard to define as this requires fractional derivative
geometry. What fractional derivative geometry might entail is briefly looked at
and it turns out that even asking very simple questions in two dimensions leads
to ambiguous or intractable results. A two dimensional line element which
depends on the Gamma-function is looked at.
