A recently proposed warped top-condensation model generally predicts a light
radion \phi, with a mass of a few GeV or less, whose interactions are
suppressed by a scale of order 100 TeV. In this talk, we present existing
constraints and potential signals from the process b \to s \phi, in the context
of such a model. Astrophysical bounds, applicable to very light radions, are
also briefly discussed.
