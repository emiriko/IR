Bekenstein's Tensor-Vector-Scalar (TeVeS) theory has had considerable success
as a relativistic theory of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MoND). However, recent
work suggests that the dynamics of the theory are fundamentally flawed and
numerous authors have subsequently begun to consider a generalization of TeVeS
where the vector field is given by an Einstein-Aether action. Herein, I develop
strong-field solutions of the generalized TeVeS theory, in particular exploring
neutron stars as well as neutral and charged black holes. I find that the
solutions are identical to the neutron star and black hole solutions of the
original TeVeS theory, given a mapping between the parameters of the two
theories, and hence provide constraints on these values of the coupling
constants. I discuss the consequences of these results in detail including the
stability of such spacetimes as well as generalizations to more complicated
geometries.
