We use a mean-field (Hartree-like) approach to study the conductance of a
strongly localized electron system in two dimensions. We find a crossover
between a regime where Coulomb interactions modify the conductance
significantly to a regime where they are negligible. We show that under rather
general conditions the conduction obeys a scaling relation which we verify
using numerical simulations. The use of a Hartree self-consistent approach
gives a clear physical picture, and removes the ambiguity of the use of
single-particle tunneling density-of-states (DOS) in the calculation of the
conductance. Furthermore, the theory contains interaction-induced correlations
between the on site energy of the localized states and distances, as well as
finite temperature corrections of the DOS.
