Next-generation continuum surveys will be strongly constrained by dynamic
range and confusion. For example, the ASKAP-EMU (Evolutionary Map of the
Universe) project will map 75% of the sky at 20cm to a sensitivity of 10
microJy - some 45 times deeper than NVSS, and is likely to be challenged by
issues of confusion, cross-identification, and dynamic range. Here we describe
the survey, the issues, and the steps that can be taken to overcome them. We
also explore ways of using multiwavelength data to penetrate well beyond the
classical confusion limit, using multiwavelength data, and an innovative
outreach approach to cross-identification.
