The quest to comprehend how nuclear processes influence astrophysical
phenomena is driving experimental and theoretical research programs worldwide.
One of the main goals in nuclear astrophysics is to understand how energy is
generated in stars, how elements are synthesized in stellar events and what the
nature of neutron stars is. New experimental capabilities, the availability of
radioactive beams and increased computational power paired with new
astronomical observations have advanced the present knowledge. This review
summarizes the progress in the field of nuclear astrophysics with a focus on
the role of indirect methods and reactions involving beams of rare isotopes.
