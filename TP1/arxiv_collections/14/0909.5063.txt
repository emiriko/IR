The magnetic properties and the spin dynamics of two molecular magnets have
been investigated by magnetization and d.c. susceptibility measurements,
Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) over a wide range of temperature (1.6-300K) at applied magnetic fields,
H=0.5 and 1.5 Tesla. The two molecular magnets consist of
CuII(saldmen)(H2O)}6{FeIII(CN)6}](ClO4)38H2O in short Cu6Fe and the analog
compound with cobalt, Cu6Co. It is found that in Cu6Fe whose magnetic core is
constituted by six Cu2+ ions and one Fe3+ ion all with s=1/2, a weak
ferromagnetic interaction between Cu2+ moments through the central Fe3+ ion
with J = 0.14 K is present, while in Cu6Co the Co3+ ion is diamagnetic and the
weak interaction is antiferromagnetic with J = -1.12 K. The NMR spectra show
the presence of non equivalent groups of protons with a measurable contact
hyperfine interaction consistent with a small admixture of s-wave function with
the d-function of the magnetic ion. The NMR relaxation results are explained in
terms of a single ion (Cu2+, Fe3+, Co3+) uncorrelated spin dynamics with an
almost temperature independent correlation time due to the weak magnetic
exchange interaction. We conclude that the two molecular magnets studied here
behave as single molecule paramagnets with a very weak intramolecular
interaction, almost of the order of the dipolar intermolecular interaction.
Thus they represent a new class of molecular magnets which differ from the
single molecule magnets investigated up to now, where the intramolecular
interaction is much larger than the intermolecular one.
