Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) structures containing 74Ge nanocrystals
(NC-Ge) imbedded inside the SiO_2 layer were studied for their capacitance
characterization. Ge atoms were introduced by implantation of 74Ge+ ions with
energy of 150 keV into relatively thick (~640nm) amorphous SiO_2 films. The
experimental characterization included room temperature measurements of
capacitance-voltage (C-V) dependences at high frequencies (100 kHz and 1 MHz).
  Four groups of MOS structures have been studied: The 1st - "initial" samples,
without Ge atoms (before ion implantation). The 2nd - "implanted" samples,
after Ge+ ion implantation but before annealing, with randomly distributed Ge
atoms within the struggle layer. The 3rd - samples after formation of Ge
nanocrystals by means of annealing at 800 degree C ("NC-Ge" samples), and the
4th - "final" samples: NC-Ge samples that were subjected by an intensive
neutron irradiation in a research nuclear reactor with the integral dose up to
10^20 neutrons/cm^2 followed by the annealing of radiation damage.
  It is shown that in "initial" samples, the C-V characteristics have a
step-like form of "S-shape", which is typical for MOS structures in the case of
high frequency. However, in "implanted" and "NC-Ge" samples, C-V
characteristics have "U-shape" despite the high frequency operation, In
addition, "NC-Ge" samples exhibit a large hysteresis which may indicate charge
trapping at the NC-Ge. Combination of the "U-shape" and hysteresis
characteristics allows us to suggest a novel 4-digits memory retention unit.
"Final" samples indicate destruction of the observed peculiarities of C-V
characteristics and recurrence to the C-V curve of "initial" samples.
