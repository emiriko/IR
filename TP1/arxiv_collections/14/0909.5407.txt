We consider minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) models with an additional R-parity
violating operator at the grand unification scale. This can change the
supersymmetric spectrum leading on the one hand to a sneutrino, smuon or squark
as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). On the other hand, a wide
parameter region is reopened, where the scalar tau is the LSP. It is vital to
know the nature of the LSP, because supersymmetric particles normally cascade
decay down to the LSP at collider experiments. We investigate in detail the
conditions leading to non-neutralino LSP scenarios. We also present some
typical LHC signatures.
