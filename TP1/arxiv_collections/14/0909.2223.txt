A configuration whose density profile coincides with the Newtonian potential
for spiral galaxies is constructed from a 4D isotropic metric plus extra
dimensional components. A Miyamoto-Nagai ansatz is used to solve Einstein
equations. The stable rotation curves of such system are computed and, without
fitting techniques, we recover with accuracy the observational data for flat or
not asymptotically flat galaxy rotation curves. The density profiles are
reconstructed and compared to that obtained from the Newtonian potential.
