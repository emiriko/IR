We report on D0 searches for scalar quarks (tilde-q) and gluinos (tilde-g),
the superpartners of quark and gluons, in topologies involving jets and missing
transverse energies. Data samples obtained with D0 detector from proton
anti-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV corresponding to
an intergrated luminosities of 1-4 inverse-fb were analyzed. No evidence for
the production of such particles were observed and lower limits on squarks and
gluino masses were set.
