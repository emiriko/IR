The Poincare gauge theory of gravity has a Lorentz connection with both
torsion and curvature. For this theory two good propagating connection modes,
carrying spin-$0^+$ and spin-$0^-$, have been found. The possible effects of
the spin-$0^+$ mode in cosmology were investigated in a previous work by our
group; there it was found that the $0^+$ mode could account for the presently
accelerating universe. Here, we extend the analysis to also include the
spin-$0^-$ mode. The resulting cosmological model has three degrees of freedom.
We present both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian form of the dynamic equations
for this model, find the late-time normal modes, and present some numerical
evolution cases. In the late time asymptotic regime the two dynamic modes
decouple, and the acceleration of the Universe oscillates due to the spin-$0^+$
mode.
