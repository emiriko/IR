In this paper, we propose a new non-local population model of logistic type
equation on a bounded Lipschitz domain in the whole Euclidean space. This model
preserves the L^2 norm, which is called mass, of the solution on the domain. We
show that this model has the global existence, stability and asymptotic
behavior at time infinity.
