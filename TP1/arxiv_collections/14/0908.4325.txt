Determining if two protocols can be securely composed requires analyzing not
only their additive properties but also their destructive properties. In this
paper we propose a new composition method for constructing protocols based on
existing ones found in the literature that can be fully automatized. The
additive properties of the composed protocols are ensured by the composition of
protocol preconditions and effects, denoting, respectively, the conditions that
must hold for protocols to be executed and the conditions that hold after
executing the protocols. The non-destructive property of the final composed
protocol is verified by analyzing the independence of the involved protocols, a
method proposed by the authors in their previous work. The fully automatized
property is ensured by constructing a rich protocol model that contains
explicit description of protocol preconditions, effects, generated terms and
exchanged messages. The proposed method is validated by composing 17 protocol
pairs and by verifying the correctness of the composed protocols with an
existing tool.
