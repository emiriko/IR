The "Frankfurter Neutronenquelle am Stern-Gerlach-Zentrum" (FRANZ), which is
currently under development, will be the strongest neutron source in the
astrophysically interesting energy region in the world. It will be about three
orders of magnitude more intense than the well-established neutron source at
the Research Center Karlsruhe (FZK).
