We consider a nanodisk possessing two coupled materials with different
ferromagnetic exchange constant. The common border line of the two media passes
at the disk center dividing the system exactly in two similar half-disks. The
vortex core motion crossing the interface is investigated with a simple
description based on a two-dimensional model which mimics a very thin real
material with such a line defect. The main result of this study is that,
depending on the magnetic coupling which connects the media, the vortex core
can be dramatically and repeatedly flipped from up to down and vice versa by
the interface. This phenomenon produces burst-like emission of spin waves each
time the switching process takes place.
