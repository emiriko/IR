We discuss the reflection of light by a rheoscopic fluid (a suspension of
microscopic rod-like crystals) in a steady two-dimensional flow. This is
determined by an order parameter which is a non-oriented vector, obtained by
averaging solutions of a nonlinear equation containing the strain rate of the
fluid flow. Exact solutions of this equation are obtained from solutions of a
linear equation which are analogous to Bloch bands for a one-dimensional
Schrodinger equation with a periodic potential. On some contours of the stream
function, the order parameter approaches a limit, and on others it depends
increasingly sensitively upon position. However, in the long-time limit a local
average of the order parameter is a smooth function of position in both cases.
We analyse the topology of the order parameter and the structure of the generic
zeros of the order parameter field.
