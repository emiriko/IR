Various theoretical and observational results have been reported regarding
the presence/absence of net electric currents in the sunspots. The limited
spatial resolution of the earlier observations perhaps obscured the
conclusions. We have analyzed 12 sunspots observed from Hinode (SOT/SP) to
clarify the issue. The azimuthal and radial components of magnetic fields and
currents have been derived. The azimuthal component of the magnetic field of
sunspots is found to vary in sign with azimuth. The radial component of the
field also varies in magnitude with azimuth. While the latter pattern is a
confirmation of the interlocking combed structure of penumbral filaments, the
former pattern shows that the penumbra is made up of a "curly interlocking
combed" magnetic field. The azimuthally averaged azimuthal component is seen to
decline much faster than 1/$\varpi$ in the penumbra, after an initial increase
in the umbra, for all the spots studied. This confirms the confinement of
magnetic fields and absence of a net current for sunspots as postulated by
\cite{parker96}. The existence of a global twist for a sunspot even in the
absence of a net current is consistent with a fibril-bundle structure of the
sunspot magnetic fields.
