A recent Brief Report [Phys. Rev. A 79, 035801 (2009)] investigates two
figures of merit for heralded photon sources based on spontaneous parametric
down-conversion with a continuous pump, namely the time-averaged temporal
coherence between the signal and idler beams and the time-averaged conditioned
second-order degree of coherence for photons in the heralded arm. However,
contrary to what is claimed, no one-arm second-order effect is actually
measured.
