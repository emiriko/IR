On the basis of the Lunar Laser Ranging Data released by NASA on the Silver
Jubilee Celebration of Man Landing on Moon on 21st July 1969-1994, theoretical
formulation of Earth-Moon tidal interaction was carried out and Planetary
Satellite Dynamics was established. It was found that this mathematical
analysis could as well be applied to Star and Planets system and since every
star could potentially contain an extra-solar system, hence we have a large
ensemble of exoplanets to test our new perspective on the birth and evolution
of solar systems. Till date 403 exoplanets have been discovered in 390
extra-solar systems. I have taken 12 single planet systems, 4 Brown Dwarf -
Star systems and 2 Brown Dwarf pairs. Following architectural design rules are
corroborated through this study of exoplanets. All planets are born at inner
Clarke Orbit what we refer to as inner geo-synchronous orbit in case of
Earth-Moon System. By any perturbative force such as cosmic particles or
radiation pressure, the planet gets tipped long of aG1 or short of aG1. Here
aG1 is inner Clarke Orbit. The exoplanet can either be launched on death spiral
as CLOSE HOT JUPITERS or can be launched on an expanding spiral path as the
planets in our Solar System are. It was also found that if the exo-planet are
significant fraction of the host star then those exo-planets rapidly migrate
from aG1 to aG2 and have very short Time Constant of Evolution as Brown Dwarfs
have. This vindicates our basic premise that planets are always born at inner
Clarke Orbit. This study vindicates the design rules which had been postulated
at 35th COSPAR Scientific Assembly in 2004 at Paris, France, under the title
,New Perspective on the Birth & Evolution of Solar Systems.
