In a preceding Letter (Opt. Lett. 32, 554 (2007)) we have proposed complex
continuous wavelet transforms (CCWTs) and found Laguerre--Gaussian mother
wavelets family. In this work we present the inversion formula and Parsval
theorem for CCWT by virtue of the entangled state representation, which makes
the CCWT theory complete. A new orthogonal property of mother wavelet in
parameter space is revealed.
