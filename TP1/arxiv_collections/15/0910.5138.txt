We study the electronic and optical properties of laterally coupled
InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot molecules under lateral electric field. We find that
electrons perceive the double-dot structure as a compound single object, while
the holes discern two well separated dots. Through a combination of predictive
atomistic modeling, detailed morphology studies, and single object
micro-photoluminescence measurements, we show that this peculiar confinement
results in an unusual heterogeneous behavior of electrons and holes with
profound consequences on optical properties.
