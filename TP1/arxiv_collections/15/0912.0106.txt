We review some of the geometry of the quantum projective plane with emphasis
on the construction of a differential calculus and of the Dirac operator (of a
spin^c-structure). We also report on anti-self-dual connections on line
bundles, the spectrum of associated (gauged) Laplacian operators, and on
classical and quantum characteristic classes.
