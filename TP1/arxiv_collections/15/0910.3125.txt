A thermal-model analysis of particle production of p-p collisions at sqrt(s)
= 17 GeV using the latest available data is presented. The sensitivity of model
parameters on data selections and model assumptions is studied. The system-size
dependence of thermal parameters and recent differences in the statistical
model analysis of p-p collisions at the super proton synchrotron (SPS) are
discussed. It is shown that the temperature and strangeness undersaturation
factor depend strongly on kaon yields which at present are still not well known
experimentally. It is conclude, that within the presently available data at the
SPS it is rather unlikely that the temperature in p-p collisions exceeds
significantly that expected in central collisions of heavy ions at the same
energy.
