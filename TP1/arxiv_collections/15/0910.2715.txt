We present the first results of a program to characterize the disk and
envelope structure of typical Class 0 protostars in nearby low-mass star
forming regions. We use Spitzer IRS mid-infrared spectra, high resolution CARMA
230 GHz continuum imaging, and 2-D radiative transfer models to constrain the
envelope structure, as well as the size and mass of the circum-protostellar
disk in Serpens FIRS 1. The primary envelope parameters (centrifugal radius,
outer radius, outflow opening angle, and inclination) are well constrained by
the spectral energy distribution (SED), including Spitzer IRAC and MIPS
photometry, IRS spectra, and 1.1 mm Bolocam photometry. These together with the
excellent uv-coverage (4.5-500 klam) of multiple antenna configurations with
CARMA allow for a robust separation of the envelope and a resolved disk. The
SED of Serpens FIRS 1 is best fit by an envelope with the density profile of a
rotating, collapsing spheroid with an inner (centrifugal) radius of
approximately 600 AU, and the millimeter data by a large resolved disk with
Mdisk~1.0 Msun and Rdisk~300 AU. These results suggest that large, massive
disks can be present early in the main accretion phase. Results for the larger,
unbiased sample of Class~0 sources in the Perseus, Serpens, and Ophiuchus
molecular clouds are needed to determine if relatively massive disks are
typical in the Class 0 stage.
