Intermodulation atomic force microscopy (IMAFM) is a dynamic mode of atomic
force microscopy (AFM) with two-tone excitation. The oscillating AFM cantilever
in close proximity to a surface experiences the nonlinear tip-sample force
which mixes the drive tones and generates new frequency components in the
cantilever response known as intermodulation products (IMPs). We present a
procedure for extracting the phase at each IMP and demonstrate phase images
made by recording this phase while scanning. Amplitude and phase images at
intermodulation frequencies exhibit enhanced topographic and material contrast.
