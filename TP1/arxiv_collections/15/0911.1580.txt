A review is presented on studies of high $E_T$ jet production and production
of photon, $W$ and $Z$ associated with jets from the HERA and Tevatron
experiments. Such studies have been used to examine the Standard Model (SM) in
the area of the strong interaction, Quantum Chromodynamics, at highest energies
currently attainable in collider experiments, to extract values of the coupling
of the strong interaction, to determine the parton distribution functions in
the proton, and to provide constraints on SM processes that constitute
background to the Higgs boson and new physics searches. Some of them are also
directly sensitive to the presence of physics beyond the SM. Future prospects
for results from the LHC experiments are discussed.
