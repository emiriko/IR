We present an overview of our project of simulation of unquenched lattice QCD
with optimal domain-wall quarks, using a GPU cluster currently constituting of
16 units of Nvidia Tesla S1070 plus 64 graphic cards with Nvidia GTX285 (total
128 GPUs with 128 Teraflops peak), attaining sustained computing power of 15.36
Teraflops. The first production run in two-flavor QCD is on-going, using the
Iwasaki gauge action on a set of lattices with sizes $ 16^3 \times
(32,10,8,6,4) \times (16,32) $ at the lattice spacing $ a \sim 0.1$ fm, with
eight sea quark masses down to $ m_\pi \simeq 200 $ MeV. We outline our
simulation algorithm, and describe the present status of the production run.
Preliminary results of pseudoscalar mass and decay constant are also presented.
