A Goldstino field in the nonlinear realization of supersymmetry is
constructed from an appropriate chiral super-multiplet of the linear theory, in
general O'Raifeataigh-like models. The linear theories can thus be reformulated
into their nonlinear versions, via the standard procedure. The Goldstino field
disappears totally from the original Lagrangian in the process, but reemerges
in the Jacobian of the transformation and covariant derivatives. Vertices with
Goldstino fields carry at least one space-time derivative, as one would have
expected.
