We give a detailed exposition of the "vectorized" notation for dealing with
quantum operations. This notation is used to highlight the relationships
between representations of completely-positive dynamics. Vectorization
considerably simplifies the analysis of different methods of quantum process
tomography, and enables us to derive compact representation of the investigated
quantum operations in terms of the resulting data.
