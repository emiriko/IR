Low-temperature (T) heat-capacity measurements under hydrostatic pressure of
up to p=2.1 GPa have been performed on single-crystalline CeCu2Si2. A broad
superconducting (SC) region exists in the T-p phase diagram. In the
low-pressure region antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and in the
high-pressure region valence fluctuations had previously been proposed to
mediate Cooper pairing. We could identify these two distinct SC regions. We
found different thermodynamic properties of the SC phase in both regions,
supporting the proposal that different mechanisms might be implied in the
formation of superconductivity.
