In order to study the spin density wave transition temperature (T_SDW) in
(TMTSF)_2PF_6 as a function of magnetic field, we measured the
magnetoresistance R_zz in fields up to 19 T. Measurements were performed for
three field orientations B||a, b' and c* at ambient pressure and at P = 5 kbar,
that is nearly the critical pressure. For B||c* orientation we observed
quadratic field dependence of T_SDW in agreement with theory and with previous
experiments. For B||b' and B||a orientations we have found no shift in T_SDW
within 0.05 K, both at P=0 and P=5 kbar. This result is also consistent with
theoretical predictions.
