After the first meeting in Copenhagen in 2001 QSQCD II is the second workshop
in this series dealing with cosmic matter at very high density and its
astrophysical implications. The aim is to bring together reseachers in the
physics of compact stars, both theoretical and observational. Consequently a
broad range of topics was presented, reviewing extremely energetic cosmological
events and their relation to the high-density equation of state of
strong-interaction matter. This summary elucidates recent progress in the
field, as presented by the participants, and comments on pertinent questions
for future developments.
