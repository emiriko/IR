Incorporating the effect of mass-stripping and accretion-disk instability on
the evolution of WD binary, we carried out binary stellar evolution
calculations for more than 1600 close WD binaries. As a result, the initial
parameter spaces for SNe Ia are presented in an orbital period-secondary mass
($\log P_{\rm i}, M_{\rm 2}^{\rm i}$) plane. We confirmed that in a WD + MS
system, the initial companion leading to SNe Ia may have mass from 1
$M_{\odot}$ to 5 $M_{\odot}$. The initial WD mass for SNe Ia from WD + MS
channel is as low as 0.565 $M_{\odot}$, while the lowest WD mass from the WD +
RG channel is 1.0 $M_{\odot}$. Adopting the results above, we studied the birth
rate of SNe Ia via a binary population synthesis approach. We found that the
Galactic SNe Ia birth rate from SD model is $2.55 - 2.9\times10^{\rm -3}$ ${\rm
yr}^{\rm -1}$ (including WD + He star channel), which is slightly smaller than
that from observation. If a single starburst is assumed, the distribution of
the delay time of SNe Ia from the SD model is a weak bimodality, where WD + He
channel contribute to SNe Ia with delay time shorter than $10^{\rm 8}$ yr and
WD + RG channel to those with age longer than 6 Gyr.
