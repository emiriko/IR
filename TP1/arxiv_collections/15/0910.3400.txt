We report on application of QCD in calculations of forward jet and W, Z boson
production cross sections at the Large Hadron Collider. In particular in case
of jet production we emphasize dynamical features of the matrix elements
controlling the resummation of logarithmically enhanced corrections in
$\sqrt{s}/E_T$, where $E_T$ is the jet production transverse energy. In case of
production of W, Z bosons we focus on angular correlations between produced
boson and hardest associated jet.
