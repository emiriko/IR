We study the Higgs boson effects on third-generation squark-pair production
in proton-proton collision at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), including
$\Stop \Stop^*$, $\Stop\Sbot^*$, and $\Sbot \Sbot^*$. We found that substantial
enhancement can be obtained through s-channel exchanges of Higgs bosons at
large $\tan\beta$, at which the enhancement mainly comes from $b\bar b$, $b\bar
c$, and $c\bar b$ initial states. We compute the complete set of electroweak
(EW) contributions to all production channels. This completes previous
computations in the literature. We found that the EW contributions can be
significant and can reach up to 25% in more general scenarios and at the
resonance of the heavy Higgs boson. The size of Higgs enhancement is comparable
or even higher than the PDF uncertainties and so must be included in any
reliable analysis. A full analytical computation of all the EW contributions is
presented.
