In this talk I review the main features of the coherent/diffractive pion
production by neutrinos on nuclei. The method is based on PCAC and relates the
reaction $\textbf{boson} + \textbf{nucleus} \to \textbf{pion} +
\textbf{nucleus}$ to elastic pion-nucleus scattering. Estimates for the
expected rates and distributions in neutrino reactions are presented with the
help of hadronic data. The absolute rates are significantly smaller than the
older estimates which brings theory in agreement with the neutral current
measurements and the bounds in charged current reactions.
