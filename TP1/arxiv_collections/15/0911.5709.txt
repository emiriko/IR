We calculate intensity of radiative heat transfer and radiative conductance
in a system of two spherical particles embedded in equilibrium vacuum
background (photon gas). The temperatures of the particles and of the
background radiation are arbitrary. The calculations are based on the dipole
and additive approximations of the fluctuation electromagnetic theory. We
obtained much higher radiative conductance between 25 mu silica particles (by 4
orders of magnitude) in comparison with recent results by A.Narayanaswamy and
Gang Chen (Phys.Rev., 2008).
