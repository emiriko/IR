Based on the old but famous distinction between "in the small" and "in the
large" software development, at Nancy Universit\'e, UHP Nancy 1, we experience
for a while software engineering education thanks to actual project
engineering. This education method has the merit to enable students to discover
and to overcome actual problems when faced to a large project which may be
conducted by a large development team. The mode of education is a simulation of
an actual software engineering project as encountered in "real life\'e"
activities.
