In this paper, adhesive contact of a rigid cylinder on an elastic power-law
graded half-space is studied analytically with the theory of weakly singular
integral equation and orthogonal polynomial method. Emphasis is placed on the
coupling effect between tangential and normal directions which was often
neglected in previous works. Our analysis shows that the coupling effect tends
to minimize the contact area in the compressive regime. The effect of bending
moment on the adhesion behavior is also examined. Like a pull-off force, there
also exist a critical bending moment at which the cylinder can be bended apart
from the substrate. However, unlike pull-off force, the critical bending moment
is insensitive to the gradient exponent of the graded material.
