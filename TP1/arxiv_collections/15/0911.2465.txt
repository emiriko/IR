Direct detection of exoplanets requires high dynamic range imaging.
Coronagraphs could be the solution, but their performance in space is limited
by wavefront errors (manufacturing errors on optics, temperature variations,
etc.), which create quasi-static stellar speckles in the final image. Several
solutions have been suggested for tackling this speckle noise. Differential
imaging techniques substract a reference image to the coronagraphic residue in
a post-processing imaging. Other techniques attempt to actively correct
wavefront errors using a deformable mirror. In that case, wavefront aberrations
have to be measured in the science image to extremely high accuracy. We propose
the self-coherent camera sequentially used as a focal-plane wavefront sensor
for active correction and differential imaging. For both uses, stellar speckles
are spatially encoded in the science image so that differential aberrations are
strongly minimized. The encoding is based on the principle of light incoherence
between the hosting star and its environment. In this paper, we first discuss
one intrinsic limitation of deformable mirrors. Then, several parameters of the
self-coherent camera are studied in detail. We also propose an easy and robust
design to associate the self-coherent camera with a coronagraph that uses a
Lyot stop. Finally, we discuss the case of the association with a four-quadrant
phase mask and numerically demonstrate that such a device enables the detection
of Earth-like planets under realistic conditions. The parametric study of the
technique lets us believe it can be implemented quite easily in future
instruments dedicated to direct imaging of exoplanets.
