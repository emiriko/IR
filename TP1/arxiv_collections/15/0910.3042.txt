We present modified $\ell$-states of diatomic molecules by solving the radial
and angle-dependent parts of the Schr\"odinger equation for central potentials,
such as Morse and Kratzer, plus an exactly solvable angle-dependent potential
$V_{\theta}(\theta)/r^2$ within the framework of the Nikiforov-Uvarov (NU)
method. We emphasize that the contribution which comes from the solution of the
Schr\"odinger equation for the angle-dependent potential modifies the usual
angular momentum quantum number $\ell$. We calculate explicitly bound state
energies of a number of neutral diatomic molecules composed of a first-row
transition metal and main-group elements for both Morse and Kratzer potentials
plus an angle-dependent potential.
