We present a spectroscopic campaign to follow-up red colour-selected
candidate massive galaxies in two high redshift proto-clusters surrounding
radio galaxies. We observed a total of 57 galaxies in the field of MRC0943-242
(z=2.93) and 33 in the field of PKS1138-262 (z=2.16) with a mix of optical and
near-infrared multi-object spectroscopy.
  We confirm two red galaxies in the field of PKS1138-262 at the redshift of
the radio galaxy. Based on an analysis of their spectral energy distributions,
and their derived star formation rates from the H-alpha and 24um flux, one
object belongs to the class of dust-obscured star-forming red galaxies, while
the other is evolved with little ongoing star formation. This result represents
the first red and mainly passively evolving galaxy to be confirmed as companion
galaxies in a z>2 proto-cluster. Both red galaxies in PKS1138-262 are massive,
of the order of 4-6x10^11 M_Sol. They lie along a Colour-Magnitude relation
which implies that they formed the bulk of their stellar population around z=4.
  In the MRC0943-242 field we find no red galaxies at the redshift of the radio
galaxy but we do confirm the effectiveness of our JHK_s selection of galaxies
at 2.3<z<3.1, finding that 10 out of 18 (56%) of JHK_s-selected galaxies whose
redshifts could be measured fall within this redshift range. We also
serendipitously identify an interesting foreground structure of 6 galaxies at
z=2.6 in the field of MRC0943-242. This may be a proto-cluster itself, but
complicates any interpretation of the red sequence build-up in MRC0943-242
until more redshifts can be measured.
