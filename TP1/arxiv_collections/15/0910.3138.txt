In this talk, we review the most recent progress in the searching for the
exotic hadrons, including hybrids, multi-quark states, molecules and so on. We
only focus on the studies with a charmonium and one or more light mesons in the
final states. This covers the X(3872), the $XYZ$ states at around 3.940 GeV,
the Y(4140) and X(4350) in two-photon collisions, the $Y$ states from $ISR$
processes, and the charged $Z$ states.
