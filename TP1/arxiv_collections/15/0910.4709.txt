A longstanding question of Gromov asks whether every one-ended
word-hyperbolic group contains a subgroup isomorphic to the fundamental group
of a closed hyperbolic surface. An infinite family of word-hyperbolic groups
can be obtained by taking doubles of free groups amalgamated along words that
are not proper powers. We define a set of polygonal words in a free group of
finite rank, and prove that polygonality of the amalgamating word guarantees
that the associated square complex virtually contains a $\pi_1$-injective
closed surface. We provide many concrete examples of classes of polygonal
words. For instance, in the case when the rank is 2, we establish polygonality
of words without an isolated generator, and also of almost all simple height 1
words, including Baumslag--Solitar relator $a^p (a^q)^b$ for $pq\ne0$.
