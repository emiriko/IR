Considering all available non-redundant protein structures across different
structural classes, present study identified the probabilistic characteristics
that describe several facets of the occurrence of 3(10) and Pi-helices in
proteins. Occurrence profile of 3(10) and Pi-helices revealed that, their
presence follows Poisson flow on the primary structure; implying that, their
occurrence profile is rare, random and accidental. Structural class-specific
statistical analyses of sequence intervals between consecutive occurrences of
3(10) and Pi-helices revealed that these could be best described by gamma and
exponential distributions, across structural classes. Comparative study of
normalized percentage of non-glycine and non-proline residues in 3(10), Pi and
alpha-helices revealed a considerably higher proportion of 3(10) and Pi-helix
residues in disallowed, generous and allowed regions of Ramachandran map. Probe
into these findings in the light of evolution suggested clearly that 3(10) and
Pi-helices should appropriately be viewed as evolutionary intermediates on long
time scale, for not only the {\alpha}-helical conformation but also for the
'turns', equiprobably. Hence, accidental and random nature of occurrences of
3(10) and Pi-helices, and their evolutionary non-conservation, could be
described and explained from an invariant quantitative framework. Extent of
correctness of two previously proposed hypotheses on 3(10) and Pi-helices, have
been investigated too. Alongside these, a new algorithm to differentiate
between related sequences is proposed, which reliably studies evolutionary
distance with respect to protein secondary structures.
