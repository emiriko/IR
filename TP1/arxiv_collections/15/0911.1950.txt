We discuss the constraints on the parameters of a Yukawa interaction obtained
from the indirect measurements of the Casimir pressure between parallel plates
using the sphere-plate configuration. Recently, it was claimed in the
literature that the application of the proximity force approximation (PFA) to
the calculation of a Yukawa interaction in the sphere-plate configuration could
lead to a large error of order 100\% in the constraints obtained. Here we
re-calculate the constraints both exactly and using the PFA, and arrive at
identical results. We elucidate the reasons why an incorrect conclusion was
obtained suggesting that the PFA is inapplicable to calculate the Yukawa force.
