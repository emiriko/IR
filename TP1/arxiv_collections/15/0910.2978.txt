The second and third order coherence functions $g^{(n)}(0) (n=2 {\rm and} 3)$
of an exciton-polariton condensate is measured and compared to the theory.
Contrary to an ideal photon laser, deviation from unity in the second and third
order coherence functions is observed, thus showing a bunching effect, but not
the characteristics of a standard thermal state with $g^{(n)}(0)=n!$. The
increase of bunching with the order of the coherence function, $g^{(3)}(0) >
g^{(2)}(0)>1$, indicates that the polariton condensate is different from
coherent state, number state and thermal state. The experimental results are in
agreement with the theoretical model where polariton-polariton and
polariton-phonon interactions are responsible for the loss of temporal
coherence.
