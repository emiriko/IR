We show that any complex (respectively real) representation of finite group
naturally generates a open-closed (respectively Klein) topological field theory
over complex numbers. We relate the 1-point correlator for the projective plane
in this theory with the Frobenius-Schur indicator on the representation. We
relate any complex simple Klein TFT to a real division ring.
