We present a theory that efficiently describes the quantum dynamics of an
electronic excitation that is coupled to a continuous, highly structured phonon
environment. Based on a stochastic approach to non-Markovian open quantum
systems, we develop a dynamical framework that allows us to handle realistic
systems where a fully quantum treatment is desired yet the usual approximation
schemes fail. The capability of the method is demonstrated by calculating
spectra and energy transfer dynamics of mesoscopic molecular aggregates,
elucidating the transition from fully coherent to incoherent transfer.
