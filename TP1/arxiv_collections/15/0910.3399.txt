An instrument has been constructed to measure a large range of
magnetostriction and thermal expansion between room temperature and 4 K in a
superconductive split-coil magnet, that allows investigation in magnetic fields
up to 12 T. The very small bulk samples (up to 1 mm in size) as well as big
ones (up to 13 mm) of the irregular form can be measured. The possibility of
magnetostriction investigation in thin films is shown. A general account is
given of both electrical and the mechanical aspects of the design of
capacitance cell and their associated electronic circuitry. A simple lever
device is proposed to increase the sensitivity twice. The resulting obtained
sensitivity can be 0.5 Angstrom. The performance of the technique is
illustrated by some preliminary measurements of the magnetostriction of
superconducting MgB2, thermal expansion of (La0.8Ba0.2)0.93MnO3 single crystal
and magnetoelastic behavior of the Ni/Si(111) and
La0.7Sr0.3CoO3/SAT0.7CAT0.1LA0.2(001) cantilevers.
