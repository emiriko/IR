We report measurements of phonon dispersion in CaC$_6$ using inelastic X-ray
and neutron scattering. We find good overall agreement, particularly in the 50
meV energy region, between experimental data and first-principles
density-functional-theory calculations. However, on the longitudinal dispersion
along the $(1 1 1)$ axis of the rhombohedral representation, we find an
unexpected anti-crossing with an additional longitudinal mode, at about 11 meV.
At a comparable energy, we observe also unexpected intensity on the in-plane
direction. These results resolve the previous incorrect assignment of a
longitudinal phonon mode to a transverse mode in the same energy range. By
calculating the electron susceptibility from first principles we show that this
longitudinal excitation is unlikely to be due to a plasmon and consequently can
probably be due to defects or vacancies present in the sample.
