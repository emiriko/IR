The preliminary results of a three-site CCD photometric campaign are
reported. The $\delta$ Scuti variable V650 Tauri belonging to the Pleiades
cluster was observed photometrically for 14 days on three continents during
2008 November. An overall run of 164 hr of data was collected. At least five
significant frequencies for V650 Tauri have been detected.
