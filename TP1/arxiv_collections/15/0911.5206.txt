The International Pulsar Timing Array project combines observations of
pulsars from both Northern and Southern hemisphere observatories with the main
aim of detecting ultra-low frequency (~10^-9 to 10^-8 Hz) gravitational waves.
Here we introduce the project, review the methods used to search for
gravitational waves emitted from coalescing supermassive binary black-hole
systems in the centres of merging galaxies and discuss the status of the
project.
