We present recent results concerning the searches for light Higgs-like
particles in the decay $\Upsilon (3S) \to \gamma A^{0}, A^{0}\to
\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ as well as for the lepton flavour violation in the decays
$\Upsilon (3S) \to e^{\pm}\tau^{\mp},\mu^{\pm}\tau^{\mp}$ and $\tau \to 3l
(l=e,\mu)$ with the BaBar experiment.
