We propose a simple way to parameterize the gap function in iron pnictides.
The key idea is to use orbital representation, not band representation, and to
assume real-space short-range pairing. Our parameterization reproduces fairly
well the structure of gap function obtained in microscopic calculation. At the
same time the present parameterization is simple enough to obtain an intuitive
picture and to develop a phenomenological theory. We also discuss
simplification of the treatment of the superconducting state.
