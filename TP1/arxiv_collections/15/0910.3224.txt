An equilibrium multielectron bubble in liquid helium is a fascinating object
with a spherical two-dimensional electron gas on its surface. We describe two
ways of creating them. MEBs have been observed in the dome of a cylindrical
cell with an unexpectedly short lifetime; we show analytically why these MEBs
can discharge by tunneling. Using a novel method, MEBs have been extracted from
a vapor sheath around a hot filament in superfluid helium by applying electric
fields up to 15 kV/cm, and photographed with high-speed video. Charges as high
as 1.6x10-9 C (~1010 electrons) have been measured. The latter method provides
a means of capture in an electromagnetic trap to allow the study of the
extensive exciting properties of these elusive objects.
