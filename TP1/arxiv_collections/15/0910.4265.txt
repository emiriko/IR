The authors introduce dynamics of multiple air bubbles exposed to ultrasonic
wave while ascending in water in the present fluid dynamics video. The authors
pay attention to the shape oscillation and the transition from the volume to
the shape oscillations of the bubble. Correlation between the bubble size and
the mechanism of the excitation of the shape oscillation is introduced.
