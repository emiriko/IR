We theoretically study classical thermal activation (TA) and macroscopic
quantum tunneling (MQT) for a YBCO Josephson junction coupled with an LC
circuit. The TA and MQT escape rate are calculated by taking into account the
two-dimensional nature of the classical and quantum phase dynamics. We find
that the MQT escape rate is largely suppressed by the coupling to the LC
circuit. On the other hand, this coupling leads to the slight reduction of the
TA escape rate. These results are relevant for the interpretation of a recent
experiment on the MQT and TA phenomena in YBCO bi-epitaxial Josephson
junctions.
