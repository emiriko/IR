We investigate superconductor/insulator/ferromagnet/superconductor (SIFS)
tunnel Josephson junctions in the dirty limit, using the quasiclassical theory.
We consider the case of a strong tunnel barrier such that the left S layer and
the right FS bilayer are decoupled. We calculate quantitatively the density of
states (DOS) in the FS bilayer for arbitrary length of the ferromagnetic layer,
using a self-consistent numerical method. We compare these results with a known
analytical DOS approximation, which is valid when the ferromagnetic layer is
long enough. Finally we calculate quantitatively the current-voltage
characteristics of a SIFS junction.
