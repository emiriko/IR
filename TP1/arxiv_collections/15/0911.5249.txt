Via the Weyl correspondence approach, we construct multipartite entangled
state which is the common eigenvector of their center-of-mass coordinate and
mass-weighted relative momenta. This approach is concise and effective for
setting up the Fock representation of continuous multipartite entangled states.
The technique of integration within an ordered product (IWOP) of operators is
also essential in our derivation.
