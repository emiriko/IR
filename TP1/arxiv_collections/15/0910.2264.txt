We analyze how the recent precise hadronic tau-decay data on the V-A spectral
function and general properties of QCD such as analyticity, the operator
product expansion and chiral perturbation theory (ChPT), can be used to improve
the knowledge of some of the low-energy constants of ChPT. In particular we
find the most precise values of L_{9,10} (or equivalently l_{5,6}) at order p^4
and p^6 and the first phenomenological determination of C_87 (c_50).
