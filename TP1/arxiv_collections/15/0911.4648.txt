The semi-classical Wigner-Kirkwood $\hbar$ expansion method is used to
calculate shell corrections for spherical and deformed nuclei. The expansion is
carried out up to fourth order in $\hbar$. A systematic study of
Wigner-Kirkwood averaged energies is presented as a function of the deformation
degrees of freedom. The shell corrections, along with the pairing energies
obtained by using the Lipkin-Nogami scheme, are used in the
microscopic-macroscopic approach to calculate binding energies. The macroscopic
part is obtained from a liquid drop formula with six adjustable parameters.
Considering a set of 367 spherical nuclei, the liquid drop parameters are
adjusted to reproduce the experimental binding energies, which yields a {\it
rms} deviation of 630 keV. It is shown that the proposed approach is indeed
promising for the prediction of nuclear masses.
