We prove two congruences for the coefficients of power series expansions in t
of modular forms where t is a modular function. As a result, we settle two
recent conjectures of Chan, Cooper and Sica. Additionally, we provide a table
of congruences for numbers which appear in similar power series expansions and
in the study of integral solutions of Apery-like differential equations.
