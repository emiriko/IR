ArgoNeuT (Argon Neutrino Test), a NSF/DOE project at Fermilab, is the first
LArTPC to go in a low energy neutrino beam and just the second LArTPC to go in
a neutrino beam ever. ArgoNeuT sits just upstream of the on-axis MINOS near
detector in the NuMI beamline, about 1 km from the target station and 100 m
underground. The detector features a 47X40X90 cm (169 L) active volume TPC with
a fully contained recirculation and purification system. Among other physics,
ArgoNeuT will measure the charged-current quasi-elastic (anti-) neutrino cross
section on argon at an energy of ~3 GeV.
