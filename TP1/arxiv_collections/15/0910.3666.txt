We investigate doping of a single-layer graphene in the presence of
electrolytic top gating. The interfacial phenomena is modeled using a modified
Poisson-Boltzmann equation for an aqueous solution of simple salt. We
demonstrate both the sensitivity of graphene's doping levels to the salt
concentration and the importance of quantum capacitance that arises due to the
smallness of the Debye screening length in the electrolyte.
