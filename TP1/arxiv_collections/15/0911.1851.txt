Interaction with services provided by an execution environment forms part of
the behaviours exhibited by instruction sequences under execution. Mechanisms
related to the kind of interaction in question have been proposed in the
setting of thread algebra. Like thread, service is an abstract behavioural
concept. The concept of a functional unit is similar to the concept of a
service, but more concrete. A state space is inherent in the concept of a
functional unit, whereas it is not inherent in the concept of a service. In
this paper, we establish the existence of a universal computable functional
unit for natural numbers and related results.
