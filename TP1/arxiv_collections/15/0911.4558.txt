The energy eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the
one-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with q-parameter Poschl-Teller potential
are analytically obtained within the position-dependent mass formalism. The
parametric generalization of the Nikiforov-Uvarov method is used in the
calculations by choosing a mass distribution.
