An analytic understanding of the geodesic structure around non-Kerr
spacetimes will result in a powerful tool that could make the mapping of
spacetime around massive quiescent compact objects possible. To this end, I
present an analytic closed form expression for the components of a the fourth
order Killing tensor for Stationary Axisymmetric Vacuum (SAV) Spacetimes. It is
as yet unclear what subset of SAV spacetimes admit this solution. The solution
is written in terms of an integral expression involving the metric functions
and two specific Greens functions. A second integral expression has to vanish
in order for the solution to be exact. In the event that the second integral
does not vanish it is likely that the best fourth order approximation to the
invariant has been found. This solution can be viewed as a generalized Carter
constant providing an explicit expression for the fourth invariant, in addition
to the energy, azimuthal angular momentum and rest mass, associated with
geodesic motion in SAV spacetimes, be it exact or approximate. I further
comment on the application of this result for the founding of a general
algorithm for mapping the spacetime around compact objects using gravitational
wave observatories.
