A new kind of tripartite non-symmetric coordinate coherent-entangled state
(TNCCES) $ | \beta,\gamma,x >$ is proposed which exhibits the properties of
both coherence and entanglement and makes up a new quantum mechanical
representation.We investigate some properties of TNCCES such as completeness
and orthogonality which prove it is just a tripartite complete continuous
coordinate base. A protocol for generating TNCCES is proposed using asymmetric
beam splitter. And in application of TNCCES, we find its corresponding Wigner
operator and carry out its marginal distribution form; further a new tripartite
entangled squeezed operator is also presented. The multipartite CES and its
generation are also disussed.
