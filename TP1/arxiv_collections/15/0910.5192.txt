In this paper we present an approach to study the radiative decay modes of
the $J/\psi$ into a photon and one of the tensor mesons $f_2(1270)$,
$f'_2(1525)$, as well as the scalar ones $f_0(1370)$ and $f_0(1710)$.
Especially we compare predictions that emerge from a scheme where the states
appear dynamically in the solution of vector meson--vector meson scattering
amplitudes to those from a (admittedly naive) quark model. We provide evidence
that it might be possible to distinguish amongst the two scenarios, once
improved data are available.
