In their position paper entitled "Towards a new, complexity science of
learning and education", Jorg et al. (2007) argue that educational research is
in crisis. In their opinion, the transdisciplinary and interdiscursive approach
of complexity science with its orientation towards self-organization,
emergence, and potentiality provides new modes of inquiry, a new lexicon and
assessment practices that can be used to overcome the current crisis. In this
contribution, I elaborate on how complexity science can further be developed
for understanding the dynamics of intentions and the communication of meaning
as these are central to the social-scientific enterprise.
