This paper presents the study and the realization at IETR of a high data rate
60 GHz wireless communications system. The system uses a simple single carrier
architecture. The receiver architecture is based on a differential demodulation
which minimizes the intersymbol interference (ISI) effect and a signal
processing unit composed of a joint frame and byte synchronization block and a
conventional RS (255, 239) decoder. The byte synchronization technique provides
a high preamble detection probability and a very small value of the false
detection probability. First measurement results show a good communication link
quality in line of sight environments with directional antennas.
