Sounding mechanism is numerically analyzed to elucidate physical processes in
air-reed instruments. As an example, compressible large-eddy simulations (LES)
are performed on both two and three dimensional ocarina. Since, among various
acoustic instruments, ocarina is known as a combined system consisting of an
edge-tone and a Helmholtz resonator, our analysis is mainly devoted to the
resonant dynamics in the cavity. We focused on oscillation frequencies when we
blow the instruments with various velocities.
