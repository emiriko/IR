We construct the dilaton potential in the gravity dual theory of AdS/QCD for
the warp factor of Refs.{1,2}. Using this AdS_5-metric with properties similar
to QCD, we find that the gravity dual leads to a meaningful gauge coupling in
the region between the charmonium and bottonium mass, but differs slightly from
QCD in the extreme UV. When we fix the ultraviolet behavior in accord with the
beta-function, we can obtain good agreement with the overall heavy
quark-antiquark potential. Although the leading order proportional to
-\alpha^{4/3}/r differs from perturbative QCD, the full potential agrees quite
well with the short distance QCD potential in NNLO.
