We perform numerical studies to determine if the fractional quantum Hall
state observed at filling nu=5/2 is the Moore-Read wavefunction or its particle
hole conjugate, the so-called AntiPfaffian. Using a truncated Hilbert space
approach we find that for realistic interactions, including Landau-level
mixing, the ground state remains fully polarized and the AntiPfaffian is
strongly favored.
