We study the fluctuation properties of a one-dimensional many-body quantum
system composed of interacting bosons, and investigate the regimes where
quantum noise or, respectively, thermal excitations are dominant. For the
latter we develop a semiclassical description of the fluctuation properties
based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process. As an illustration, we
analyze the phase correlation functions and the full statistical distributions
of the interference between two one-dimensional systems, either independent or
tunnel-coupled and compare with the Luttinger-liquid theory.
