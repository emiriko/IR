R is a language and computing environment that has been developed for data
manipulation, statistical computing, and scientific graphing. In the paper, we
demonstrate its use analyzing data collected in a few experiments taken from an
introductory physics laboratory. The examples include a linear dependence, a
non-linear dependence, and a histogram. The merits of R are discussed against
three options often used for data analysis and graphing: manual graphing using
grid paper, general purpose spreadsheet software, and specialized scientific
graphing software.
