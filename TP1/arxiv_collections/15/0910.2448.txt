The cascade mass reconstruction approach was used for mass reconstruction of
the lightest stau produced at the LHC in the cascade decay $\tilde{g} \to
\tilde{b} b \to \tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0} b b \to \tilde{\tau}_{1} \tau b b \to
\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0} \tau \tau b b $. The stau mass was reconstructed assuming
that masses of gluino, bottom squark and two lightest neutralinos were
reconstructed in advance.
  SUSY data sample sets for the SU3 model point containing 160k events each
were generated which corresponded to an integrated luminosity of about $8 \rm
fb^{-1}$ at 14 TeV. These events were passed through the AcerDET detector
simulator, which parametrized the response of a generic LHC detector. The mass
of the $\tilde{\tau}_{1}$ was reconstructed with a precision of about 20% on
average.
