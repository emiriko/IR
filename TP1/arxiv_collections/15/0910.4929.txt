We study the process of multimode Spontaneous Parametric Down--Conversion
(SPDC) in the lossy, one dimensional waveguide. We propose a description using
first order Correlation Functions (CF) in the fluorescence fields, as a very
fruitful and easy approach providing us with a complete information about the
final multimode state. We formulate the equation of the evolution of the
multimode CF along the crystal using four characteristic length scales. We
solve it analytically in the one mode case and numerically in the multimode
case. We capture simultaneous effects of three wave mixing with ultrashort
pump, linear propagation and attenuation, and we are able to divide the
evolution into three stages and predict it qualitatively. We find that losses
do not destroy the quantum properties of SPDC but stabilize the final state.
