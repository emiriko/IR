We investigate a bosonic quantum gas consisting of two interacting species in
an optical lattice at zero and finite temperature. The equilibrium properties
and dynamics of this system are obtained by means of the Gutzwiller mean-field
method. In particular we model recent experiments where the ramp-up of the
optical lattice occurs on a time scale comparable to the tunneling time of the
bosons. We demonstrate the violation of adiabaticity of this process with
respect to the many-body quantum states, and reproduce and explain the
oscillations of the visibility as a function of ramp-up time, as seen in
experiments.
