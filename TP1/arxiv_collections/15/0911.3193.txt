Boron is a unique element, being the only element, all known polymorphs of
which are superhard, and all of its crystal structures are distinct from any
other element. The electron-deficient bonding in boron explains its remarkable
sensitivity to even small concentrations of impurity atoms and allows boron to
form peculiar chemical compounds with very different elements. These
complications made the study of boron a great challenge, creating also a unique
and instructive chapter in the history of science. Strange though it may sound,
the discovery of boron in 1808 was ambiguous, with pure boron polymorphs
established only starting from the 1950s-1970s, and only in 2007 was the stable
phase at ambient conditions determined. The history of boron research from its
discovery to the latest discoveries pertaining to the phase diagram of this
element, the structure and stability of beta-boron, and establishment of a new
high-pressure polymorph, gamma-boron, is reviewed.
