The aim of this talk is to present the most recent advances in establishing
plausible planetary system architectures determined by the gravitational tidal
interactions between the planets and the disc in which they are embedded during
the early epoch of planetary system formation. We concentrate on a very well
defined and intensively studied process of the disc-planet interaction leading
to the planet migration. We focus on the dynamics of the systems in which
low-mass planets are present. Particular attention is devoted to investigation
of the role of resonant configurations. Our studies, apart from being
complementary to the fast progress occurring just now in observing the whole
variety of planetary systems and uncovering their structure and origin, can
also constitute a valuable contribution in support of the missions planned to
enhance the number of detected multiple systems.
