If the history of science has taught us anything, it's that persistence and
creativity makes the once impossible possible. It has long been thought
experimental tests of quantum gravity are impossible. But during the last
decade, several different approaches have been proposed that allow us to test,
if not the fundamental theory of quantum gravity itself, so at least
characteristic features this theory can have. For the first time we can probe
experimentally domains in which quantum physics and gravity cohabit, in spite
of our failure so far to make a convincing marriage of them on a theoretical
level.
