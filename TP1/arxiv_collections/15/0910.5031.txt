Determination of V_cb in exclusive semileptonic decays is crucial consistency
check against the V_cb determined inclusively. Anticipated precision of V_cb at
the Super Flavor factory is ~1%, with most of the theoretical error due to
hadronic form factor uncertainties. However, at this level of precision
treating electromagnetic effects becomes inevitable. In addition to virtual
photon corrections there are also emissions of real photons which are soft
enough to avoid detection. The bremsstrahlung part is completely universal and
is accounted for in the experimental analyses. However, the so-called structure
dependent contribution, which probes the hadronic content of the process and is
infrared finite, has been neglected so far. To this end, we estimated fraction
of radiative events which are identified as semileptonic by experiment.
