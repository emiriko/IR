Inference problems with incomplete observations often aim at estimating
population properties of unobserved quantities. One simple way to accomplish
this estimation is to impute the unobserved quantities of interest at the
individual level and then take an empirical average of the imputed values. We
show that this simple imputation estimator can provide partial protection
against model misspecification. We illustrate imputation estimators' robustness
to model specification on three examples: mixture model-based clustering,
estimation of genotype frequencies in population genetics, and estimation of
Markovian evolutionary distances. In the final example, using a representative
model misspecification, we demonstrate that in non-degenerate cases, the
imputation estimator dominates the plug-in estimate asymptotically. We conclude
by outlining a Bayesian implementation of the imputation-based estimation.
