Several possible notions of Hardy-Sobolev spaces on a Riemannian manifold
with a doubling measure are considered. Under the assumption of a Poincar\'e
inequality, the space $\Mone$, defined by Haj{\l}asz, is identified with a
Hardy-Sobolev space defined in terms of atoms. Decomposition results are proved
for both the homogeneous and the nonhomogeneous spaces.
