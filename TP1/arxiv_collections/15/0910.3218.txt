By cross matching blue objects from SDSS with GALEX and the astrometric
catalogues USNO-B1.0, GSC2.3 and CMC14, 64 new dwarf nova candidates with one
or more observed outbursts have been identified. 14 of these systems are
confirmed as cataclysmic variables through existing and follow-up spectroscopy.
A study of the amplitude distribution and an estimate of the outburst frequency
of these new dwarf novae and those discovered by the Catalina Real-time
Transient Survey (CRTS) indicates that besides systems that are faint because
they are farther away, there also exists a population of intrinsically faint
dwarf novae with rare outbursts.
