Graphene has various potential applications in electronics and scientists are
seeking to introduce magnetic properties on graphene. Here we report our
theoretical findings that a local magnetic moment as large as 1 $\mu_B$ can be
generated from the adsorption of the diamagnetic beryllium dimer on perfect
diamagnetic graphene. Unexpectedly the adsorption system is remarkably stable
as evidenced by the binding energy of 1.04 eV, indicating that the formation of
beryllium dimer is energetically much favorable. Analyses reveal that the
magnetic moment and stability is originated from the spontaneous transfer of
one electron from the anti-bonding orbital of the dimer to graphene.
