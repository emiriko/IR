We present a multiphase mathematical model for tumor growth which
incorporates the remodeling of the extracellular matrix and describes the
formation of fibrotic tissue by tumor cells. We also detail a full qualitative
analysis of the spatially homogeneous problem, and study the equilibria of the
system in order to characterize the conditions under which fibrosis may occur.
