We present high-resolution spectroscopic measurements of the abundances of
titanium (Ti), yttrium (Y) and lanthanum (La) for M giant candidates of the
Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal (dSph) + tidal tail system pre-selected on
the basis of position and radial velocity. The majority of these stars show
peculiar abundance patterns compared to those of nominal Milky Way (MW) stars.
The overall [Ti/Fe], [Y/Fe], [La/Fe] and [La/Y] patterns with [Fe/H] of the Sgr
stream plus Sgr core do resemble those seen in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)
and other dSphs, only shifted [Fe/H] by ~+0.4 from the LMC and by ~+1 dex from
the other dSphs; these relative shifts reflect the faster and/or more efficient
chemical evolution of Sgr compared to the other satellites, and show that Sgr
has had an enrichment history more like the LMC than the other dSphs. By
tracking the evolution of the abundance patterns along the Sgr stream we can
follow the time variation of the chemical make-up of dSph stars donated to the
MW halo by Sgr. This evolution demonstrates that while the bulk of the stars
currently in the Sgr dSph are quite unlike those of the MW halo, an increasing
number of stars farther along the Sgr stream have abundances like MW halo
stars, a trend that shows clearly how the MW halo could have been contributed
by present day satellite galaxies even if the present chemistry of those
satellites is now different from typical halo field stars. Finally, we analyze
the chemical abundances of a moving group of M giants among the Sgr leading arm
stars at the North Galactic Cap, but having radial velocities unlike the
infalling Sgr leading arm debris there. Through use of "chemical
fingerprinting", we conclude that these northern hemisphere M giants also are
Sgr stars, likely trailing arm debris overlapping the leading arm in the north.
