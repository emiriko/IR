We evaluate the kinematic distributions in phase space of 4-parton
final-state subprocesses produced by double parton scattering, and we contrast
these with the final-state distributions that originate from conventional
single parton scattering. Our goal is to establish the distinct topologies of
events that arise from these two sources and to provide a methodology for
experimental determination of the relative magnitude of the double parton and
single parton contributions at Large Hadron Collider energies. We examine two
cases in detail, the $b \bar{b} \rm{jet jet}$ and the 4 jet final states. After
full parton-level simulations, we identify a few variables that separate the
two contributions remarkably well, and we suggest their use experimentally for
an empirical measurement of the relative cross section. We show that the double
parton contribution falls off significantly more rapidly with the transverse
momentum of the leading jet, but, up to issues of the relative normalization,
may be dominant at modest values of this transverse momentum.
