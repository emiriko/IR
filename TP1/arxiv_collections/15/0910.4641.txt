The Ginzburg - Landau theory is used for the superconducting structures free
energy fluctuations study. On its basis, we have defined the value of the heat
capacity jump in the macroscopic zero-dimensional sample and in the
zero-dimensional microstructures ensemble of the total volume equal to the
macroscopic sample volume. The inference is made that in the Ginzburg - Landau
methodology frameworks, it is essential to take into account the
superconducting clean sample effective dimensionality only on the last stage of
its thermodynamical characteristics calculation.
