We observed CO J=3-2 emission from the "water fountain" sources, which
exhibit high-velocity collimated stellar jets traced by water maser emission,
with the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) 10 m telescope. We
detected the CO emission from two sources, IRAS 16342-3814 and IRAS 18286-0959.
The IRAS 16342-3814 CO emission exhibits a spectrum that is well fit to a
Gaussian profile, rather than to a parabolic profile, with a velocity width
(FWHM) of 158+/-6 km/s and an intensity peak at VLSR = 50+/-2 km/s. The mass
loss rate of the star is estimated to be ~2.9x10^-5 M_sun/yr. Our
morpho-kinematic models suggest that the CO emission is optically thin and
associated with a bipolar outflow rather than with a (cold and relatively
small) torus. The IRAS 18286-0959 CO emission has a velocity width (FWHM) of
3.0+/-0.2 km/s, smaller than typically seen in AGB envelopes. The narrow
velocity width of the CO emission suggests that it originates from either an
interstellar molecular cloud or a slowly-rotating circumstellar envelope that
harbors the water maser source.
