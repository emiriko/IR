We consider scattering of a photon on a short intense laser pulse at high
energy. We argue that for ultra-short laser pulses the interaction is coherent
over the entire length of the pulse. At low pulse intensity $I$ the total cross
section for electron-positron pair production is proportional to $I$. However,
at pulse intensities higher than the characteristic value $I_s$, the total
cross section saturates -- it becomes proportional to the logarithm of
intensity. This nonlinear effect is due to multi-photon interactions. We derive
the total cross section for pair production at high energies by resuming the
multi-photon amplitudes to all orders in intensity. We calculate the saturation
intensity $I_s$ and show that it is significantly lower than the Schwinger's
critical value. We discuss possible experimental tests.
