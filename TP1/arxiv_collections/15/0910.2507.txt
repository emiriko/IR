We report the discovery of a new binary icosahedral phase in a Sc-Zn alloy
obtained through solution-growth, producing millimeter-sized, facetted, single
grain, quasicrystals that exhibit different growth morphologies, pentagonal
dodecahedra and rhombic triacontahedra, under only marginally different growth
conditions. These two morphologies manifest different degrees of
quasicrystalline order, or phason strain. The discovery of i-Sc$_12$Zn$_88$
suggests that a reexamination of binary phase diagrams at compositions close to
crystalline approximant structures may reveal other, new binary
quasicrystalline phases.
