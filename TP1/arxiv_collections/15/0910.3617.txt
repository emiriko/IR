A contour dynamics model for electrical discharges is obtained and analyzed.
The model is deduced as the asymptotic limit of the minimal streamer model for
the propagation of electric discharges, in the limit of small electron
diffusion. The dispersion relation for a non planar 2-D discharge is
calculated. The development and propagation of finger-like patterns are studied
and their main features quantified.
