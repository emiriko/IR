The S3-Tools are a set of Python-based routines and interfaces whose purpose
is to provide user-friendly access to the SKA Simulated Skies (S3) set of
simulations, an effort led by the University of Oxford in the framework of the
European Union's SKADS program (http://www.skads-eu.org). The databases built
from the S3 simulations are hosted by the Oxford e-Research Center (OeRC), and
can be accessed through a web portal at http://s-cubed.physics.ox.ac.uk. This
paper focuses on the practical steps involved to make radio images from the
S3-SEX and S3-SAX simulations using the S3-Map tool and should be taken as a
broad overview. For a more complete description, the interested reader should
look up the user's guide. The output images can then be used as input to
instrument simulators, e.g. to assess technical designs and observational
strategies for the SKA and SKA pathfinders.
