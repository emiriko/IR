We show that finite Fermi systems governed by a mean field and a few-body
interaction generically possess spectral fluctuations of the Wigner-Dyson type
and are, thus, chaotic. Our argument is based on an analogy to the
metal-insulator transition. We construct a sparse random-matrix ensemble ScE
that mimics that transition. Our claim then follows from the fact that the
generic random-matrix ensemble modeling a fermionic interacting many-body
system is much less sparse than ScE.
