A set of travelling wave solutions to a hyperbolic generalization of the
convection-reaction-diffusion is studied by the methods of local nonlinear
alnalysis and numerical simulation. Special attention is paid to displaying
appearance of the compactly supported soloutions, shock fronts, soliton-like
solutions and peakons
