We report a combined experimental and theoretical study of KCuF3, which
offers - because of this material's relatively simple lattice structure and
valence configuration (d9, i.e., one hole in the d-shell) - a particularly
clear view of the essential role of the orbital degree of freedom in governing
the dynamical coupling between the spin and lattice degrees of freedom. We
present Raman and x-ray scattering evidence that the phase behaviour of KCuF3
is dominated above the Neel temperature (T_N = 40 K) by coupled orbital/lattice
fluctuations that are likely associated with rotations of the CuF6 octahedra,
and we show that these orbital fluctuations are interrupted by a static
structural distortion that occurs just above T_N. A detailed model of the
orbital and magnetic phases of KCuF3 reveals that these orbital fluctuations -
and the related frustration of in-plane spin-order-are associated with the
presence of nearly degenerate low-energy spin-orbital states that are highly
susceptible to thermal fluctuations over a wide range of temperatures. A
striking implication of these results is that the ground state of KCuF3 at
ambient pressure lies near a quantum critical point associated with an
orbital/spin liquid phase that is obscured by emergent Neel ordering of the
spins; this exotic liquid phase might be accessible via pressure studies.
