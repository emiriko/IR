Developments in strangeness photo- and electro- production off the proton, as
investigated using the CLAS system in Hall B at Jefferson Lab, are discussed in
this paper. By measuring sufficient spin observables one can decompose the
reaction mechanism into elementary amplitudes. We discuss progress toward this
end in recent data from CLAS, including cross sections and spin observables. We
next discuss new results on the mass distribution of the $\Lambda(1405)$, which
shows signs of being a composite meson-baryon object of mixed isospin. The work
on other hyperons such as the $\Xi$ resonances will be mentioned, and future
prospects outlined.
