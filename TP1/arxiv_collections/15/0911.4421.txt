Radial density profiles for the sample of dense cores associated with
high-mass star-forming regions from southern hemisphere have been derived using
the data of observations in continuum at 250 GHz. Radial density profiles for
the inner regions of 16 cores (at distances $\la 0.2-0.8$ pc from the center)
are close on average to the $\rho\propto r^{-\alpha}$ dependence, where
$\alpha=1.6\pm 0.3$. In the outer regions density drops steeper. An analysis
with various hydrostatic models showed that the modified Bonnor-Ebert model,
which describes turbulent sphere confined by external pressure, is preferable
compared with the logotrope and polytrope models practically in all cases. With
a help of the Bonnor-Ebert model, estimates of central density in a core,
non-thermal velocity dispersion and core size are obtained. The comparison of
central densities with the densities derived earlier from the CS modeling
reveals differences in several cases. The reasons of such differences are
probably connected with the presence of density inhomogenities on the scales
smaller than the telescope beam. In most cases non-thermal velocity dispersions
are in agreement with the values obtained from molecular line observations.
