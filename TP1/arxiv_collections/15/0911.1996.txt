We propose a scenario in which the supersymmetry breaking effect mediated by
an additional U(1)' is comparable with that of anomaly mediation. We argue that
such a scenario can be naturally realized in a large class of models. Combining
anomaly with Z' mediation allows us to solve the tachyonic slepton problem of
the former and avoid significant fine tuning in the latter. We focus on an
NMSSM-like scenario where U(1)' gauge invariance is used to forbid a tree-level
mu term, and present concrete models, which admit successful dynamical
electroweak symmetry breaking. Gaugino masses are somewhat lighter than the
scalar masses, and the third generation squarks are lighter than the first two.
In the specific class of models under consideration, the gluino is light since
it only receives a contribution from 2-loop anomaly mediation, and it decays
dominantly into third generation quarks. Gluino production leads to distinct
LHC signals and prospects of early discovery. In addition, there is a
relatively light Z', with mass in the range of several TeV. Discovering and
studying its properties can reveal important clues about the underlying model.
