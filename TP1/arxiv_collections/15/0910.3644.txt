IceCube is a cubic kilometer neutrino telescope under construction at the
South Pole, a successor to the first-generation AMANDA telescope. IceCube is
now three quarters complete, with completion expected in early 2011, and data
taken with the partially built detector already provides a sensitivity
surpassing the complete AMANDA-II data set. Results from searches for
astrophysical sources of neutrinos and for evidence of dark matter with both
AMANDA and IceCube are summarized. We also discuss plans for Deep Core, an
enhancement of IceCube designed to extend its sensitivity to neutrinos below
the TeV scale.
