The Cooper-pair size (i.e., the BCS coherence length) in low-dimensional
superconductors is dramatically modified by quantum-size effects. In
particular, for nanowires made of conventional superconducting materials, we
show that the coherence length exhibits size-dependent drops by two-three
orders of magnitude and reaches values found in high-$T_c$ superconductors.
This phenomenon is surprisingly similar to the well-known BCS-BEC crossover but
with one important exception: it is driven by the transverse quantization of
the electron spectrum rather than by the strength of the fermion-fermion
interaction. Similar results can be expected for other systems with the same
structure of the single-particle spectrum, e.g, for superfluid Fermi gases
confined in a quantum-wire or quantum-well geometry.
