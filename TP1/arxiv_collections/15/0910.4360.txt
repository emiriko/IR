The strength of electronic correlation effects in the spin-dependent
electronic structure of ferromagnetic bcc Fe(110) has been investigated by
means of spin and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The experimental
results are compared to theoretical calculations within the three-body
scattering approximation and within the dynamical mean-field theory, together
with one-step model calculations of the photoemission process. This comparison
indicates that the present state of the art many-body calculations, although
improving the description of correlation effects in Fe, give too small mass
renormalizations and scattering rates thus demanding more refined many-body
theories including non-local fluctuations.
