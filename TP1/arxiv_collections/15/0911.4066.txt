We investigate driven magnetic flux lines in layered type-II superconductors
subject to various configurations of strong point or columnar pinning centers
by means of a three-dimensional elastic line model and Metropolis Monte Carlo
simulations. We characterize the resulting nonequilibrium steady states by
means of the force-velocity / current-voltage curve, static structure factor,
mean vortex radius of gyration, number of double-kink and half-loop
excitations, and velocity / voltage noise spectrum. We compare the results for
the above observables for randomly distributed point and columnar defects, and
demonstrate that the three-dimensional flux line structures and their
fluctuations lead to a remarkable variety of complex phenomena in the
steady-state transport properties of bulk superconductors.
