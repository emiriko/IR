When a finite group acts linearly on a complex vector space, the natural
semi-direct product of the group and the polynomial ring over the space forms a
skew group algebra. This algebra plays the role of the coordinate ring of the
resulting orbifold and serves as a substitute for the ring of invariant
polynomials from the viewpoint of geometry and physics. Its Hochschild
cohomology predicts various Hecke algebras and deformations of the orbifold. In
this article, we investigate the ring structure of the Hochschild cohomology of
the skew group algebra. We show that the cup product coincides with a natural
smash product, transferring the cohomology of a group action into a group
action on cohomology. We express the algebraic structure of Hochschild
cohomology in terms of a partial order on the group (modulo the kernel of the
action). This partial order arises after assigning to each group element the
codimension of its fixed point space. We describe the algebraic structure for
Coxeter groups, where this partial order is given by the reflection length
function; a similar combinatorial description holds for an infinite family of
complex reflection groups.
