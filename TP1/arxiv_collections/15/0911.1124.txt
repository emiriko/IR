Recently, it was suggested that the gamma rays observed by the Fermi Gamma
Ray Space Telescope from the direction of the galactic center could
surprisingly well be described by a dark matter annihilation scenario, both in
terms of their angular distribution and energy spectrum. Here, I point out that
such a scenario would be in considerable tension with existing antiproton data,
in particular the new PAMELA measurements. Radio data are even more
constraining, thus disfavoring the dark matter hypothesis and making an
astrophysical explanation of the observations much more plausible.
