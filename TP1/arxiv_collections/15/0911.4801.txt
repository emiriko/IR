A shadow price is a process lying within the bid/ask prices of a market with
proportional transaction costs, such that maximizing expected utility from
consumption in the frictionless market with this price process leads to the
same maximal utility as in the original market with transaction costs. For
finite probability spaces, this note provides an elementary proof for the
existence of such a shadow price.
