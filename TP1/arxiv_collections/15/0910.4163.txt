Design Theory, a branch of mathematics, was born out of the experimental
statistics research of the population geneticist R. A. Fisher and of Indian
mathematical statisticians in the 1930s. The field combines elements of
combinatorics, finite projective geometries, Latin squares, and a variety of
further mathematical structures, brought together in surprising ways. This
essay will present these structures and ideas as well as how the field came
together, in itself an interesting story.
