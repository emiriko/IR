We consider the standard model (SM) quark flavor sector. We study its
structure in a spurionic, symmetry oriented approach. The SM picture of flavor
and CP violation is now experimentally verified, hence strong bounds on beyond
the SM flavor structure follow. We show how to parametrically derive such
bounds, in a model independent manner, via minimal flavor violation power
counting. This min-review summarizes lectures given at the ISSCSMB '08
international school. It aims to give basic tools to understand how flavor and
CP violation occur in the SM and its extensions. It should be particularly
useful for non-expert students who have mastered other aspects of the SM
dynamics.
