We report on our study of the LFV processes \mu \to e\gamma, \mu\to eee and
\mu \to e conversion in the context of Little Higgs models. Specifically we
examine the Littlest Higgs with T-parity (LHT) and the Simplest Little Higgs
(SLH) as examples of a Product group and Simple group Little Higgs models
respectively. The necessary Feynman rules for both models are obtained in the
't Hooft Feynman Gauge up to order v^2/f^2 and predictions for the branching
ratios and conversion rates of the LFV processes are calculated to leading
order (one-loop level). Comparison with current experimental constraints show
that there is some tension and, in order to be within the limits, one requires
a higher breaking scale f, alignment of the heavy and light lepton sectors or
almost degenerate heavy lepton masses. These constraints are more demanding in
the SLH than in the LHT case.
