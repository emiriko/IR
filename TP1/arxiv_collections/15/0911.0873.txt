Although Galactic cosmic rays (protons and nuclei) are widely believed to be
dominantly accelerated by the winds and supernovae of massive stars, definitive
evidence of this origin remains elusive nearly a century after their discovery
[1]. The active regions of starburst galaxies have exceptionally high rates of
star formation, and their large size, more than 50 times the diameter of
similar Galactic regions, uniquely enables reliable calorimetric measurements
of their potentially high cosmic-ray density [2]. The cosmic rays produced in
the formation, life, and death of their massive stars are expected to
eventually produce diffuse gamma-ray emission via their interactions with
interstellar gas and radiation. M 82, the prototype small starburst galaxy, is
predicted to be the brightest starburst galaxy in gamma rays [3, 4]. Here we
report the detection of >700 GeV gamma rays from M 82. From these data we
determine a cosmic-ray density of 250 eV cm-3 in the starburst core of M 82, or
about 500 times the average Galactic density. This result strongly supports
that cosmic-ray acceleration is tied to star formation activity, and that
supernovae and massive-star winds are the dominant accelerators.
