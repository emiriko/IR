Starting from a generic model of a pore/bulk mixture equilibrium, we propose
a novel method for modulating the composition of the confined fluid without
having to modify the bulk state. To achieve this, two basic mechanisms -
sensitivity of the pore filling to the bulk thermodynamic state and electric
field effect - are combined. We show by Monte Carlo simulation that the
composition can be controlled both in a continuous and in a jumpwise way. Near
the bulk demixing instability, we demonstrate a field induced population
inversion in the pore. The conditions for the realization of this method should
be best met with colloids, but being based on robust and generic mechanisms, it
should also be applicable to some molecular fluids.
