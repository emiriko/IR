We study proximity-induced superconductivity on the surface of a topological
insulator (TI), focusing on unconventional pairing. We find that the excitation
spectrum becomes gapless for any spin-triplet pairing, such that both subgap
bound states and Andreev reflection is strongly suppressed. For spin-singlet
pairing, the zero-energy surface state in the $d_{xy}$-wave case becomes a
Majorana fermion, in contrast to the situation realized in the topologically
trivial high-$T_c$ cuprates. We also study the influence of a Zeeman field on
the surface states. Both the magnitude and direction of this field is shown to
strongly influence the transport properties, in contrast to the case without
TI. We predict an experimental signature of the Majorana states via conductance
spectroscopy.
