The standard model of cosmology relies on the existence of two components,
"dark matter" and "dark energy", which dominate the expansion of the Universe.
There is no direct proof of their existence, and their nature is still unknown.
Many alternative models suggest other cosmological scenarios, and in particular
the dark fluid model replace the dark matter and dark energy components by a
unique dark component able to mimic the behaviour of both components. The
current cosmological constraints on the unifying dark fluid model is discussed,
and a dark fluid model based on a complex scalar field is presented. Finally
the consequences of quantum corrections on the scalar field potential are
investigated.
