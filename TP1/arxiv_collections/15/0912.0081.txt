Streamer discharges are important both in theory and industry applications.
This paper proposed a local discontinuous Galerkin method to simulate the
convection dominated fluid model of streamer discharges. To simulate the rapid
transient streamer discharge process, a method with high resolution and high
order accuracy is highly desired. Combining the advantages of finite volume and
finite element method, local discontinuous Galerkin method is such a choice. In
this paper, a simulation of a double-headed streamer discharge in nitrogen was
performed by using 1.5-dimensional fluid model. The preliminary results
indicate the potential of extending the method to general streamer simulations
in complex geometries.
