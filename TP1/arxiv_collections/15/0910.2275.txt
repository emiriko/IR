Through comparison of pre- and post-explosion images obtained with the Wide
Field and Planetary Camera 2 onboard the Hubble Space Telescope, we have
isolated a supergiant star prior to explosion at nearly the same position as
the high-luminosity SN II-P 2008cn. We provide evidence that this supergiant
may well be the progenitor of the SN, although this identification is not
entirely unambiguous due mainly to the distance to the host galaxy (NGC 4603),
33.3 Mpc. The progenitor candidate has a more yellow color than generally would
be expected and, if a single star, would require that it exploded during a
"blue loop" evolutionary phase. Nonetheless, we estimate an initial mass of
Mini = 15 +/- 2 Msun for this star, which is within the expected mass range for
SN II-P progenitors. The yellower color could also arise from the blend of two
or more stars, such as a red supergiant hidden by a brighter, blue supergiant;
or a massive, interacting binary system. Finally, if the yellow supergiant is
not the progenitor, or is not a stellar blend or binary containing the
progenitor, then we constrain any undetected progenitor star to be a red
supergiant with Mini < 11 Msun, considering a physically more realistic
scenario of explosion at the model endpoint luminosity for a rotating star.
