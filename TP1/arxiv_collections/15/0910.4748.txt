In abstract interpretation-based static analysis, approximation is encoded by
abstract domains. They provide systematic guidelines for designing abstract
semantic functions that approximate some concrete system behaviors under
analysis. It may happen that an abstract domain contains redundant information
for the specific purpose of approximating a given concrete semantic function.
This paper introduces the notion of correctness kernel of abstract
interpretations, a methodology for simplifying abstract domains, i.e. removing
abstract values from them, in a maximal way while retaining exactly the same
approximate behavior of the system under analysis. We show that in abstract
model checking correctness kernels provide a simplification paradigm of the
abstract state space that is guided by examples, meaning that this
simplification preserves spuriousness of examples (i.e., abstract paths). In
particular, we show how correctness kernels can be integrated with the
well-known CEGAR (CounterExample-Guided Abstraction Refinement) methodology.
