In this paper, based on research on rank-one isometries by W.Ballmann and
M.Brin and recent research on rank-one isometries of Coxeter groups by
P.Caprace and K.Fujiwara, we study a topological fractal structure of
boundaries of Coxeter groups. We also show that the limit-point set is dense in
a boundary of a Coxeter group and introduce some remarks on boundaries of
CAT(0) groups with rank-one isometries.
