The paper proposes a novel approach for the geometrical model calibration of
quasi-isotropic parallel kinematic mechanisms of the Orthoglide family. It is
based on the observations of the manipulator leg parallelism during motions
between the specific test postures and employs a low-cost measuring system
composed of standard comparator indicators attached to the universal magnetic
stands. They are sequentially used for measuring the deviation of the relevant
leg location while the manipulator moves the TCP along the Cartesian axes.
Using the measured differences, the developed algorithm estimates the joint
offsets and the leg lengths that are treated as the most essential parameters.
Validity of the proposed calibration technique is confirmed by the experimental
results.
