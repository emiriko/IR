We calculate the properties of neutron matter and highlight the physics of
chiral three-nucleon forces. For neutrons, only the long-range 2 pi-exchange
interactions of the leading chiral three-nucleon forces contribute, and we
derive density-dependent two-body interactions by summing the third particle
over occupied states in the Fermi sea. Our results for the energy suggest that
neutron matter is perturbative at nuclear densities. We study in detail the
theoretical uncertainties of the neutron matter energy, provide constraints for
the symmetry energy and its density dependence, and explore the impact of
chiral three-nucleon forces on the S-wave superfluid pairing gap.
