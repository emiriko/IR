We consider cosmologies in which a dark-energy scalar field interacts with
cold dark matter. The growth of perturbations is followed beyond the linear
level by means of the time-renormalization-group method, which is extended to
describe a multi-component matter sector. Even in the absence of the extra
interaction, a scale-dependent bias is generated as a consequence of the
different initial conditions for baryons and dark matter after decoupling. The
effect is enhanced significantly by the extra coupling and can be at the 2-3
percent level in the range of scales of baryonic acoustic oscillations. We
compare our results with N-body simulations, finding very good agreement.
