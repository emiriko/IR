These notes cover (i) electroweak symmetry breaking in the Standard Model
(SM) and the Higgs boson, (ii) alternatives to the SM Higgs boson including an
introduction to composite Higgs models and Higgsless models that invoke extra
dimensions, (iii) the theory and phenomenology of supersymmetry, and (iv)
various further beyond topics, including Grand Unification, proton decay and
neutrino masses, supergravity, superstrings and extra dimensions.
