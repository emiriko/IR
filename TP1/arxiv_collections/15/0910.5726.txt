We analyze the >100MeV data for 3 GRBs detected by Fermi (GRBs 080916C,
090510, 090902B) and find that these photons were generated via synchrotron
emission in the external forward shock. We arrive at this conclusion by four
different methods as follows. (1) We check the light curve and spectral
behavior of the >100MeV data, and late time X-ray and optical data, and find
them consistent with the closure relations for the external forward shock
radiation. (2) We calculate the expected external forward shock synchrotron
flux at 100MeV, and it matches the observed flux value. (3) We determine the
external forward shock model parameters using the >100MeV data, and with these
we calculate the expected X-ray and optical fluxes at late times (hours to days
after the burst) and find these to be in good agreement with the observed data.
(4) We calculate the external forward shock model parameters using only the
late time X-ray, optical and radio data and from these estimate the expected
flux at >100 MeV at the end of the sub-MeV burst (and at subsequent times) and
find that to be entirely consistent with the high energy data obtained by
Fermi/LAT. The ability of a simple external forward shock, to fit the entire
data from the end of the burst (1-50s) to about a week, covering more than
eight-decades in photon frequency provides compelling confirmation of the
external forward shock synchrotron origin of the >100MeV radiation from these
Fermi GRBs. Moreover, the parameters determined in points (3) and (4) show that
the magnetic field required in these GRBs is consistent with shock-compressed
magnetic field in the circum-stellar medium with pre-shocked values of a few
tens of micro-Gauss.
