We study the homotopy category of unbounded complexes with bounded homologies
and its quotient category by the homotopy category of bounded complexes. We
show the existence of a recollement of the above quotient category and it has
the homotopy category of acyclic complxes as a triangulated subcategory. In the
case of the homotopy category of finitely generated projective modules over an
Iwanaga-Gorenstein ring, we show that the above quotient category are triangle
equivalent to the stable module category of Cohen-Macaulay
$\opn{T}_2(R)$-modules.
