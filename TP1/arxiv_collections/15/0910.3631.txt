We report on the fabrication and characterization of a few-electron quantum
dot controlled by a single gate electrode. Our device has a double-quantum-well
design, in which the doping controls the occupancy of the lower well while the
upper well remains empty under the free surface. A small air-bridged gate
contacts the surface, and is positively biased to draw laterally confined
electrons into the upper well. Electrons tunneling between this
accumulation-mode dot and the lower well are detected using a quantum point
contact (QPC), located slightly offset from the dot gate. The charge state of
the dot is measured by monitoring the differential transconductance of the QPC
near pinch-off. Addition spectra starting with N=0 were observed as a function
of gate voltage. DC sensitivity to single electrons was determined to be as
high as 8.6%, resulting in a signal-to-noise ratio of ~9:1 with an equivalent
noise bandwidth of 12.1 kHz. Analysis of random telegraph signals associated
with the zero to one electron transition allowed a measurement of the lifetimes
for the filled and empty states of the one-electron dot: 0.38 ms and 0.22 ms,
respectively, for a device with a 10 nm AlInAs tunnel barrier between the two
wells.
