We study the time evolution of superposition of product states of two dressed
atoms in a spherical cavity in the extreme situations of an arbitrarily large
cavity (free space) and of a small one. In the large-cavity case, the system
dissipates, whereas, for the small finite cavity, the system evolves in an
oscillating way and never completely decays. We also compute the von Neumann
entropy for such a system, a measurement of the degree of entanglement of the
two atoms, as the superposed state evolves in time. We find that this entropy
does not depend on time, nor on the size of the cavity.
