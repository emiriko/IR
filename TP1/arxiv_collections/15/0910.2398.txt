We report on new results on the development activity of broad band Laue
lenses for hard X-/gamma-ray astronomy (70/100-600 keV). After the development
of a first prototype, whose performance was presented at the SPIE conference on
Astronomical Telescopes held last year in Marseille (Frontera et al. 2008), we
have improved the lens assembling technology. We present the development status
of the new lens prototype that is on the way to be assembled.
