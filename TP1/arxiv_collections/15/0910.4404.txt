The classical trajectory model with stochastic breakup for nuclear collision
dynamics of weakly-bound nuclei is further developed. It allows a quantitative
study of the importance of incomplete fusion dynamics in the angular
distribution of direct alpha-production. Model calculations indicate that the
incomplete fusion contribution diminishes with decreasing energy towards the
Coulomb barrier, notably separating in angles from the contribution of
no-capture breakup events. This should facilitate the experimental
disentanglement of these competing reaction processes.
