Quantum physics and biology have long been regarded as unrelated disciplines,
describing nature at the inanimate microlevel on the one hand and living
species on the other hand. Over the last decades the life sciences have
succeeded in providing ever more and refined explanations of macroscopic
phenomena that were based on an improved understanding of molecular structures
and mechanisms. Simultaneously, quantum physics, originally rooted in a world
view of quantum coherences, entanglement and other non-classical effects, has
been heading towards systems of increasing complexity. The present perspective
article shall serve as a pedestrian guide to the growing interconnections
between the two fields. We recapitulate the generic and sometimes unintuitive
characteristics of quantum physics and point to a number of applications in the
life sciences. We discuss our criteria for a future quantum biology, its
current status, recent experimental progress and also the restrictions that
nature imposes on bold extrapolations of quantum theory to macroscopic
phenomena.
