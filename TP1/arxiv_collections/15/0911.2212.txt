We have used the Gemini NIFS to map the gas kinematics of the inner 200x500pc
of the Seyfert galaxy NGC4151 in the Z, J, H and K bands at a resolving power
5000 and spatial resolution of 8pc. The ionised gas emission is most extended
along the known ionisation bi-cone at position angle PA=60-240deg, but is
observed also along its equatorial plane. This indicates that the AGN ionizes
gas beyond the borders of the bi-cone, within a sphere with 1arcsec radius
around the nucleus. The ionised gas has three kinematic components: (1) one
observed at the systemic velocity and interpreted as originating in the galaxy
disk; (2) one outflowing along the bi-cone, with line-of-sight velocities
between -600 and 600 km/s and strongest emission at +/-(100-300)km/s; (3) and
another component due to the interaction of the radio jet with ambient gas. The
mass outflow rate, estimated to be 1 M_Sun/yr along each cone, exceeds the
inferred black hole accretion rate by a factor of 100. There is no evidence in
our data for the gradual acceleration followed by gradual deceleration proposed
by previous modelling of the [OIII] emitting gas. The molecular gas exhiibits
distinct kinematics relative to the ionised gas. Its emission arises in
extended regions approximately perpendicular to the axis of the bi-cone and
along the axis of the galaxy's stellar bar, avoiding the innermost ionised
regions. It does not show an outflowing component, being observed only at
velocities very close to systemic, and is thus consistent with an origin in the
galaxy plane. This hot molecular gas may only be the tracer of a larger
reservoir of colder gas which represents the AGN feeding.
