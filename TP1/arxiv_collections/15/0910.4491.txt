A self-consistent projection operator method for single-particle excitations
is developed. It describes the nonlocal correlations on the basis of a
projection technique to the retarded Green function and the off-diagonal
effective medium. The theory takes into account long-range intersite
correlations making use of an incremental cluster expansion in the medium. A
generalized self-consistent coherent potential is derived. It yields the
momentum-dependent excitation spectra with high resolution. Numerical studies
for the Hubbard model on a simple cubic lattice at half filling show that the
theory is applicable in a wide range of Coulomb interaction strength. In
particular, it is found that the long-range antiferromagnetic correlations in
the strong interaction regime cause shadow bands in the low-energy region and
sub-peaks of the Mott-Hubbard bands.
