The meson masses and mixing angles have been calculated for the scalar and
pseudoscalar sector in the framework of the generalized 2+1 flavor Polyakov
loop augmented quark meson linear sigma model. We have given the results for
two different forms of the effective Polyakov loop potential. The comparison of
results with the existing calculations in the bare 2+1 quark meson linear sigma
model, shows that the restoration of chiral symmetry becomes sharper due to the
influence of the Polyakov loop potential. We find that inclusion of the
Polyakov loop in quark meson linear sigma model together with the presence of
axial anomaly, triggers an early and significant melting of the strange
condensate. We have examined how the inclusion of the Polyakov loop
qualitatively and quantitatively affects the convergence in the masses of the
chiral partners in pseudoscalar ($\pi$, $\eta$, $\eta'$, $K$) and scalar
($\sigma$, $a_0$, $f_0$,$\kappa$) meson nonets as the temperature is varied on
the reduced temperature scale. The role of $U_A(1)$ anomaly in determining the
isoscalar masses and mixing angles for the pseudoscalar ($\eta$ and $\eta'$)
and scalar ($\sigma$ and $f_0$)meson complex, has also been investigated in the
Polyakov quark meson linear sigma model. The interplay of chiral symmetry
restoration effects and the setting up of $U_A(1)$ restoration trend has been
discussed and analyzed in the framework of the presented model calculations.
