Neutrino oscillations were discovered by atmospheric and solar neutrino
experiments, and have been confirmed by experiments using neutrinos from
accelerators and nuclear reactors. It has been found that there are large
mixing angles in the $\nu_e \to \nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$
oscillations. The third mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, which parameterizes the
mixing between the first and the third generation, is constrainted to be small
by the CHOOZ experiment result. The T2K experiment is a long baseline neutrino
oscillation experiment that uses intense neutrino beam produced at J-PARC and
Super-Kamiokande detector at 295 km as the far detector to measure
$\theta_{13}$ using $\nu_e$ appearance. In this talk, we will give an overview
of the experiment.
