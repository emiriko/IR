We revisit the topic of the existence and azimuthal modulational stability of
solitary vortices (alias vortex solitons) in the two-dimensional (2D)
cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation. We develop a semi-analytical
approach, assuming that the vortex soliton is relatively narrow, and thus
splitting the full 2D equation into radial and azimuthal 1D equations. A
variational approach is used to predict the radial shape of the vortex soliton,
using the radial equation, yielding results very close to those obtained from
numerical solutions. Previously known existence bounds for the solitary
vortices are recovered by means of this approach. The 1D azimuthal equation of
motion is used to analyze the modulational instability of the vortex solitons.
The semi-analytical predictions -- in particular, that for the critical
intrinsic frequency of the vortex soliton at the instability border -- are
compared to systematic 2D simulations. We also compare our findings to those
reported in earlier works, which featured some discrepancies. We then perform a
detailed computational study of collisions between stable vortices with
different topological charges. Borders between elastic and destructive
collisions are identified.
