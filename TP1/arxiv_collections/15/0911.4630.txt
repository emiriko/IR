Little Higgs models are often endowed with a T-parity in order to satisfy
electroweak precision tests and give at the same time a stable particle which
is a candidate for cold dark matter. This type of models predicts a set of new
T-odd fermions in addition to the heavy gauge bosons of the Little Higgs
models, which may show interesting signatures at colliders. In this paper, we
study the signatures of strong and electroweak pair production of the first two
generations of T-odd quarks at the LHC. We focus on the dileptonic signatures
(p p to l l j j MET) with (a) opposite-sign dileptons and (b) same-sign
dileptons.
