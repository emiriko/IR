We propose a seesaw scenario that possible corrections to the tribimaximal
pattern of lepton mixing are due to the small phase splitting of the
right-handed neutrino mass matrix. we show that the small deviations can be
expressed analytically in terms of two splitting parameters($\delta_1$ and
$\delta_2$) in the leading order. The solar mixing angle $\theta_{12}$ favors a
relatively smaller value compared to zero order value ($35.3^\circ$), and the
Dirac type CP phase $\delta$ chooses a nearly maximal one. The two Majorana
type CP phases $\rho$ and $\sigma$ turn out to be a nearly linear dependence.
Also a normal hierarchy neutrino mass spectrum is favored due to the stability
of perturbation calculations.
