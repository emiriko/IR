Blue stragglers have been found in all populations. These objects are
important in both stellar evolution and stellar population synthesis. Much
evidence shows that blue stragglers are relevant to primordial binaries. Here,
we summarize the links of binary evolution and blue stragglers, describe the
characteristics of blue stragglers from different binary evolutionary channels,
and show their consequences for binary population synthesis, such as for the
integrated spectral energy distribution, the colour-magnitude diagram, the
specific frequency, and the influences on colours etc..
