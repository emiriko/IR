We present and interpret simulation results showing how a fluid moves on a
hydrophilic substrate patterned by a square array of triangular posts. We
demonstrate that the shape of the posts leads to anisotropic spreading, and
discuss how this is influenced by the different ways in which the posts can pin
the advancing front.
