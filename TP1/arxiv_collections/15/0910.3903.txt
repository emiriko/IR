In this paper we construct and briefly study the 5D time-dependent solutions
of general relativity obtained via double analytic continuation of the black
hole (Myers-Perry) and of the black ring solutions with a double
(Pomeransky-Senkov) and a single rotation (Emparan-Reall). The new solutions
take the form of a generalized Einstein-Rosen cosmology representing
gravitational waves propagating in a closed universe. In this context the
rotation parameters of the rings can be interpreted as the extra wave
polarizations, while it is interesting to state that the waves obtained from
Myers-Perry Black holes exhibit an extra boost-rotational symmetry in higher
dimensions which signals their better behavior at null infinity. The analogue
to the C-energy is analyzed.
