We examine the star lattice Kitaev model whose ground state is a a chiral
spin liquid. We fermionize the model such that the fermionic vacua are toric
code states on an effective Kagome lattice. This implies that the Abelian phase
of the system is inherited from the fermionic vacua and that time reversal
symmetry is spontaneously broken at the level of the vacuum. In terms of these
fermions we derive the Bloch-matrix Hamiltonians for the vortex free sector and
its time reversed counterpart and illuminate the relationships between the
sectors. The phase diagram for the model is shown to be a sphere in the space
of coupling parameters around the triangles of the lattices. The abelian phase
lies inside the sphere and the critical boundary between topologically distinct
Abelian and non-Abelian phases lies on the surface. Outside the sphere the
system is generically gapped except in the planes where the coupling parameters
are zero. These cases correspond to bipartite lattice structures and the
dispersion relations are similar to that of the original Kitaev honeycomb
model. In a further analysis we demonstrate the three-fold non-Abelian
groundstate degeneracy on a torus by explicit calculation.
