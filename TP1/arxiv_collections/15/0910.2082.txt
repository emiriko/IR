We construct a solution to pentagon equation with anticommuting variables
living on two-dimensional faces of tetrahedra. In this solution, matrix
coordinates are ascribed to tetrahedron vertices. As matrix multiplication is
noncommutative, this provides a "more quantum" topological field theory than in
our previous works.
