We consider two Jaynes-Cummings cavities coupled periodically with a photon
hopping term. The semi-classical phase space is chaotic, with regions of
stability over some ranges of the parameters. The quantum case exhibits dynamic
localization and dynamic tunneling between classically forbidden regions. We
explore the correspondence between the classical and quantum phase space and
propose a scheme for implementing the system experimentally.
