In the framework of the Inert Doublet Model and extensions, the signature of
neutrinos from dark matter annihilation in the Earth, the Sun and at the
Galactic centre is presented. The model contains an extra Higgs doublet, a
neutral component of which is chosen as dark matter candidate. There are three
distinct mass ranges for which consistency both with WMAP abundance and direct
searches can be obtained: a low (4 - 8 GeV), a middle (60 - 70 GeV) and a high
(500 - 1500 GeV) WIMP mass range. The first case is of interest as we showed
that the model can at the same time give the correct WMAP abundance and account
for the positive DAMA results without contradicting other direct searches. We
present how capture in the Sun can further constrain this scenario using
Super-Kamiokande data. Indirect detection through neutrinos is challenging for
the middle and high mass ranges. For the former, the presence of the so-called
'iron resonance' gives rise to larger neutrino fluxes for WIMP masses around 60
- 70 GeV since capture by the Earth is enhanced. The addition of light
right-handed Majorana neutrinos to the particle content of the model further
increases the signal since it opens a direct annihilation channel into
mono-energetic neutrinos. Neutrinos from the Galactic centre might be detected
for heavy WIMPs if the dark matter density at the Galactic centre is
substantially boosted.
