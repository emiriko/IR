We investigate various competing paramagnetic ground states of the Heisenberg
antiferromagnet on the two dimensional star lattice which exhibits geometric
frustration. Using slave particle mean field theory combined with a projective
symmetry group analysis, we examine a variety of candidate spin liquid states
on this lattice, including chiral spin liquids, spin liquids with Fermi
surfaces of spinons, and nematic spin liquids which break lattice rotational
symmetry. Motivated by connection to large-N SU(N) theory as well as numerical
exact diagonalization studies, we also examine various valence bond solid (VBS)
states on this lattice. Based on a study of energetics using Gutzwiller
projected states, we find that a fully gapped spin liquid state is the lowest
energy spin liquid candidate for this model. We also find, from a study of
energetics using Gutzwiller projected wave functions and bond operator
approaches, that this spin liquid is unstable towards two different VBS states
-- a VBS state which respects all the Hamitonian symmetries and a VBS state
which exhibits $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ order -- depending on the ratio of the
Heisenberg exchange couplings on the two inequivalent bonds of the lattice. We
compute the triplon dispersion in both VBS states within the bond operator
approach and discuss possible implications of our work for future experiments
on candidate materials.
