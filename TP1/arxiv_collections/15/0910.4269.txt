We investigate theoretically the optical properties associated to plasmon
resonances of metal nanowires with cross section given by low-order Chebyshev
nanoparticles (like rounded-tip nanostars or nanoflowers). The impact of the
nanoflower shape is analyzed for varying symmetry and deformation parameter
through the spectral dependence of resonances, and their corresponding near
field distributions. Large field intensity enhancements are obtained at the
gaps between petals, apart from the tips themselves, which make these
nanostars/nanoflowers specially suitable to host molecules for SERS sensing
applications.
