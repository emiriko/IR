We evaluate tunneling rates into/from a voltage biased quantum wire
containing weak backscattering defect. Interacting electrons in such a wire
form a true nonequilibrium state of the Luttinger liquid (LL). This state is
created due to inelastic electron backscattering leading to the emission of
nonequilibrium plasmons with typical frequency $\hbar \omega \leq U$. The
tunneling rates are split into two edges. The tunneling exponent at the Fermi
edge is positive and equals that of the equilibrium LL, while the exponent at
the side edge $E_F-U$ is negative if Coulomb interaction is not too strong.
