We characterise the virtually abelian groups which are fundamental groups of
compact K\"ahler manifolds and of smooth projective varieties. We show that a
virtually abelian group is K\"ahler if and only if it is projective. In
particular, this allows to describe the K\"ahler condition for such groups in
terms of integral symplectic representations.
