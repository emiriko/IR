We investigate exact travelling wave solutions of higher order nonlinear
Schrodinger equation in the absence of third order dispersion, which exhibit
non-trivial self phase modulation. It is shown that, the corresponding
dynamical equation, governing the evolution of intensity in the femtosecond
regime, is that of non-linear Schrodinger equation with a source. The exact
localized solutions to this system can have both super and subluminal
propagation belonging to two distinct class. A number of these solitons exhibit
chirality, thereby showing preferential propagation behavior determined by
group velocity dispersion. Both localized bright and dark solitons are found in
complementary velocity and experimental parameter domains, which can exist for
anomalous and normal dispersion regimes. It is found that, dark solitons in
this system propagate with non-zero velocity, unlike their counterpart in
nanosecond regime. Interestingly, subluminal propagation is observed for
solitons having a nontrivial Pade type intensity profile.
