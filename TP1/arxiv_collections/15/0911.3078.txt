When a one-dimensional (1D) semiconductor nanostructure is immersed in a
sluggish polar solvent, fluctuations of the medium may result in the appearance
of localized electronic levels inside the band gap. An excess charge carrier
can occupy such a level and undergo self-localization into a large-radius
adiabatic polaron surrounded by a self-consistent medium polarization pattern.
Within an appropriately adapted framework of the Marcus theory, we explore the
description and qualitative picture of thermally activated electron transfer
involving solvation-induced polaronic-like states by considering transfer
between small and 1D species as well as between two 1D species. Illustrative
calculations are performed for tubular geometries with possible applications to
carbon nanotube systems.
