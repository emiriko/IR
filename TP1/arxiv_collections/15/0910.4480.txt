A search for muon neutrinos from Kaluza-Klein dark matter annihilations in
the Sun has been performed with the 22-string configuration of the IceCube
neutrino detector using data collected in 104.3 days of live-time in 2007. No
excess over the expected atmospheric background has been observed. Upper limits
have been obtained on the annihilation rate of captured lightest Kaluza-Klein
particle (LKP) WIMPs in the Sun and converted to limits on the LKP-proton
cross-sections for LKP masses in the range 250 -- 3000 GeV. These results are
the most stringent limits to date on LKP annihilation in the Sun.
