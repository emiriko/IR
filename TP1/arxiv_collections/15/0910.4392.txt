The lepton sector masses and mixing angles can be explained in models based
on $A_4$ symmetry. $A_4$ is a non-Abelian discrete group. Therefore, one issue
in constructing models based on it is explaining the origin of $A_4$. A
plausible mechanism is that $A_4$ is an unbroken subgroup of a continuous group
that is broken spontaneously. We construct a model of leptons where the $A_4$
symmetry is obtained by spontaneous symmetry breaking of SO(3).
