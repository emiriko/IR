First principles calculations, employed to address the properties of
polycrystalline graphene, indicate that the electronic structure of tilt grain
boundaries in this system displays a rather complex evolution towards graphene
bulk, as the tilt angle decreases, with the generation of a new Dirac point at
the Fermi level, and an anisotropic Dirac cone of low energy excitations.
Moreover, the usual Dirac point at the {\bf K} point falls below the Fermi
level, and rises towards it as the tilt angle decreases. Further, our
calculations indicate that the grain-boundary formation energy behaves
non-monotonically with the tilt angle, due to a change in the the spatial
distribution and relative contributions of the bond-stretching and bond-bending
deformations associated with the formation of the defect.
