We determine the ground state energy of atoms and quantum dots whose number N
of electrons is large. We show that the dominant terms of the energy are those
given by a semiclassical Hartree-Fock theory. Correlation effects appear at the
order N ln N for atoms and the order N for quantum dots. We compute them. The
semiclassical Hartree-Fock theory creates oscillations in the ground state
energy as a function of N . These oscillations reflect the dynamics of a
classical particle moving in the presence of the Thomas-Fermi potential. The
dynamics is regular for atoms and some dots, but we present the case of a dot
where this dynamics is fully chaotic and we compute the oscillating part of the
ground state energy in this case.
