We report a study of the anisotropic exchange interactions in bulk CrO_2
calculated from first principles within density functional theory. We determine
the exchange coupling energies, using both the experimental lattice parameters
and those obtained within DFT, within a modified Heisenberg model Hamiltonian
in two ways. We employ a supercell method in which certain spins within a cell
are rotated and the energy dependence is calculated and a spin-spiral method
that modifies the periodic boundary conditions of the problem to allow for an
overall rotation of the spins between unit cells. Using the results from each
of these methods, we calculate the spin-wave stiffness constant D from the
exchange energies using the magnon dispersion relation. We employ a Monte Carlo
method to determine the DFT-predicted Curie temperature from these calculated
energies and compare with accepted values. Finally, we offer an evaluation of
the accuracy of the DFT-based methods and suggest implications of the competing
ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions.
