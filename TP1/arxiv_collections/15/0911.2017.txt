It is well known from numerous experiments that nuclear multifragmentation is
a dominating mechanism for production of intermediate-mass fragments in
nucleus-nucleus collisions at energies above 100 A MeV. In this paper we
investigate the validity and performance of the Fermi break-up model and the
statistical multifragmentation model implemented as parts of the Geant4
toolkit. We study the impact of violent nuclear disintegration reactions on the
depth-dose profiles and yields of secondary fragments for beams of light and
medium-weight nuclei propagating in extended media. Implications for ion-beam
cancer therapy and shielding from cosmic radiation are discussed.
