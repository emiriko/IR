Production of tachyons in, among other things, air showers would be in
accordance with predictions of general relativity. Some such tachyons would
travel with a precisely determined speed, almost equal to 5c/3 relative to the
earth, and would be registered high above the region of creation of air
showers, e.g. on board of a satellite. A very simple experiment designed to
detect these tachyons is outlined here. Brief justification to search for
tachyons is also given.
