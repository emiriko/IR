International co-authorship relations and university-industry-government
("Triple Helix") relations have hitherto been studied separately. Using
Japanese (ISI) publication data for the period 1981-2004, we were able to study
both kinds of relations in a single design. In the Japanese file, 1,277,823
articles with at least one Japanese address were attributed to the three
sectors, and we know additionally whether these papers were co-authored
internationally. Using the mutual information in three and four dimensions,
respectively, we show that the Japanese Triple-Helix system has continuously
been eroded at the national level. However, since the middle of the 1990s,
international co-authorship relations have contributed to a reduction of the
uncertainty. In other words, the national publication system of Japan has
developed a capacity to retain surplus value generated internationally. In a
final section, we compare these results with an analysis based on similar data
for Canada. A relative uncoupling of local university-industry relations
because of international collaborations is indicated in both national systems.
