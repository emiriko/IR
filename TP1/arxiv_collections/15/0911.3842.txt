Online music databases have increased signicantly as a consequence of the
rapid growth of the Internet and digital audio, requiring the development of
faster and more efficient tools for music content analysis. Musical genres are
widely used to organize music collections. In this paper, the problem of
automatic music genre classification is addressed by exploring rhythm-based
features obtained from a respective complex network representation. A Markov
model is build in order to analyse the temporal sequence of rhythmic notation
events. Feature analysis is performed by using two multivariate statistical
approaches: principal component analysis(unsupervised) and linear discriminant
analysis (supervised). Similarly, two classifiers are applied in order to
identify the category of rhythms: parametric Bayesian classifier under gaussian
hypothesis (supervised), and agglomerative hierarchical clustering
(unsupervised). Qualitative results obtained by Kappa coefficient and the
obtained clusters corroborated the effectiveness of the proposed method.
