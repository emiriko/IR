We address the system-reservoir dynamics of classical and quantum
correlations in the decoherence phenomenon, regarding a two qubit composite
system interacting with two independent environments. The most common noise
channels (amplitude damping, phase damping, bit flip, bit-phase flip, and phase
flip) was studied. By analytical and numerical analysis we found that, contrary
to what is usually stated in the literature, decoherence may occurs without
entanglement between the system and the environment. We also found that, in
some cases, the bipartite quantum correlation initially presented in the system
is completely evaporated, it is not transferred to the environments.
