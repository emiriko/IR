In this contribution we present a discussion of some aspects of the
capabilities of a photon collider to probe physics beyond the standard model. I
will take a few examples from Higgs physics, supersymmetry, extra dimensional
theories as well as unparticles, pointing out the special r\^ole that a photon
collider can play in each case.
