We consider deterministic and {\em randomized} quantum algorithms simulating
$e^{-iHt}$ by a product of unitary operators $e^{-iA_jt_j}$, $j=1,...,N$, where
$A_j\in\{H_1,...,H_m\}$, $H=\sum_{i=1}^m H_i$ and $t_j > 0$ for every $j$.
Randomized algorithms are algorithms approximating the final state of the
system by a mixed quantum state. First, we provide a scheme to bound the trace
distance of the final quantum states of randomized algorithms. Then, we show
some randomized algorithms, which have the same efficiency as certain
deterministic algorithms, but are less complicated than their opponentes.
Moreover, we prove that both deterministic and randomized algorithms simulating
$e^{-iHt}$ with error $\e$ at least have $\Omega(t^{3/2}\e^{-1/2})$
exponentials.
