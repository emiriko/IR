Determining the worst-case uncertainty added by a quantum circuit is shown to
be computationally intractable. This is the problem of detecting when a quantum
channel implemented as a circuit is close to a linear isometry, and it is shown
to be complete for the complexity class QMA of verifiable quantum computation.
This is done by relating the problem of detecting when a channel is close to an
isometry to the problem of determining how mixed the output of the channel can
be when the input is a pure state. How mixed the output of the channel is can
be detected by a protocol making use of the swap test: this follows from the
fact that an isometry applied twice in parallel does not affect the symmetry of
the input state under the swap operation.
