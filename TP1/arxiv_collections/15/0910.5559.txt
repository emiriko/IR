It was shown recently that parallel manipulators with several inverse
kinematic solutions have the ability to avoid parallel singularities [Chablat
1998a] and self-collisions [Chablat 1998b] by choosing appropriate joint
configurations for the legs. In effect, depending on the joint configurations
of the legs, a given configuration of the end-effector may or may not be free
of singularity and collision. Characterization of the
collision/singularity-free workspace is useful but may be insufficient since
two configurations can be accessible without collisions nor singularities but
it may not exist a feasible trajectory between them. The goal of this paper is
to define the maximal regions of the workspace where it is possible to execute
trajectories. Twodifferent families of regions are defined : 1. those regions
where the end-effector can move between any set of points, and 2. the regions
where any continuous path can be tracked. These regions are characterized from
the notion of aspects and free-aspects recently defined for parallel
manipulators [Chablat 1998b]. The construction of these regions is achieved by
enrichment techniques and using an extension of the octree structures to spaces
of dimension greater than three. Illustrative examples show the interest of
this study to the optimization of trajectories and the design of parallel
manipulators.
