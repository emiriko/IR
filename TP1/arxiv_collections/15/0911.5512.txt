Cosmological observations indicate that the Einstein equation may not be
entirely correct to describe gravity.
  However, numerous modifications of these equations usually do not affect
foundations of the theory. In this paper two important issue that lead to a
substantial revision of the theory are considered : 1. The significance of
relativity of space-time geometry with respect to measuring instruments for
theory of gravitation. 2. The gauge transformations of the field variables in
correct theory of gravitation.
