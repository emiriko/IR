Using NRQCD b quarks and HISQ light, strange and charm quarks we have
calculated B meson masses and B^*-B splittings. We quote results for a range of
lattice spacings and sea quark masses, enabling controlled extrapolation to the
physical point. Since the $b$ quark masses and lattice spacing are fixed from
the \Upsilon and other meson masses, this allows accurate, parameter-free tests
of B, B_s, and B_c masses against experiment. We can also predict the mass of
the B^*_c meson.
