We report on the method developed by Zibetti, Charlot and Rix (2009) to
construct resolved stellar mass maps of galaxies from optical and NIR imaging.
Accurate pixel-by-pixel colour information (specifically g-i and i-H) is
converted into stellar mass-to-light ratios with typical accuracy of 30%, based
on median likelihoods derived from a Monte Carlo library of 50,000 stellar
population synthesis models that include dust and updated TP-AGB phase
prescriptions. Hence, surface mass densities are computed. In a pilot study, we
analyze 9 galaxies spanning a broad range of morphologies. Among the main
results, we find that: i) galaxies appear much smoother in stellar mass maps
than at any optical or NIR wavelength; ii) total stellar mass estimates based
on unresolved photometry are biased low with respect to the integral of
resolved stellar mass maps, by up to 40%, due to dust obscured regions being
under-represented in global colours; iii) within a galaxy, on local scales
colours correlate with surface stellar mass density; iv) the slope and
tightness of this correlation reflect/depend on the morphology of the galaxy.
