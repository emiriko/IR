Mesoscopic physics concerns itself with systems which are intermediate
between a single atom and a bulk solid. Besides the many intrinsically
interesting properties of mesoscopic systems, they can also provide physical
insight into the physics of bulk systems. Here we discuss three examples of
this from the field of high temperature superconductivity.
