The resistivity in magnetic materials has been theoretically shown to depend
on the spin-spin correlation function which in turn depends on the
magnetic-field, the density of conduction electron, the magnetic ordering
stability, etc. However, these theories involved a lot of approximations, so
their validity remained to be confirmed. The purpose of this work is to show by
extensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulation the resistivity of the spin current from
low-$T$ ordered phase to high-$T$ paramagnetic phase in a ferromagnetic film.
We take into account the interaction between the itinerant spins and the
localized lattice spins as well as the interaction between itinerant spins
themselves. We show that the resistivity undergoes an anomalous behavior at the
magnetic phase transition in agreement with previous theories in spite of their
numerous approximations. The origin of the resistivity peak near the phase
transition in ferromagnets is interpreted here as stemming from the existence
of magnetic domains in the critical region. This interpretation is shown to be
in consistence with previous theoretical pictures. Resistivity in a simple
cubic antiferromagnet is also shown. The absence of a peak in this case is
explained.
