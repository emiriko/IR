A spontaneous buckling transition in thin layers of monodomain nematic liquid
crystalline gel was observed by polarized light microscopy. The coupling
between the orientational ordering of liquid crystalline solvent and the
translational ordering of crosslinked polymer backbones inside the nematic gel
contributes to such buckling transition. As the nematic mesogens become more
ordered when the gel is cooled down from a higher gelation temperature, the
polymeric backbones tend to elongate along the direction parallel to the
nematic director, which is perpendicular to the rigid glass surfaces in the
experimental setup. The shape change of such confined gel sample lead to the
spontaneous buckling of polymeric network and the spatial modulation of nematic
liquid crystalline director, which is observed as the stripe patterns. The
instability analysis was used to explain such transitions, and the relationship
between the critical field, stripe's wavelength and temperature can be
explained qualitatively by the rubber elasticity theory for liquid crystalline
gels.
