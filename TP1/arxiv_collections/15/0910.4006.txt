Long, stable and free-standing linear atomic carbon wires have been carved
out from graphene recently [Meyer et al: Nature (London) 2008, 454, 319; Jin et
al: Phys: Rev: Lett: 2009, 102, 205501]. They can be considered as the
extremely narrow graphene nanoribbons or extremely thin carbon nanotubes. It
might even be possible to make use of high strength and identical (without
charity) carbon wires as a transport channel or on-chip interconnects for
field-effect transistors. Here we investigate electron transport properties of
linear atomic carbon wire-graphene junctions by nonequilibruim Green's function
combined with density functional theory. For short wires, linear ballistic
transport is observed in odd-numbered wire but destroyed by Peirerls distortion
in even-numbered wire. For wires longer than 2.1 nm as fabricated above,
however, the ballistic conductance of carbon wire-graphene junctions is
remarkably robust against the Peierls distortion, structural imperfections, and
hydrogen impurity adsorption of the linear carbon wires except oxygen
impurities. As such, the epoxy groups might be the origin of low conductance
experimentally observed in carbon wires. Moreover, double atomic carbon wires
exhibit negative differential resistance (NDR) effect.
