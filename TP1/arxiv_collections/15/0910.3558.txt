We compute the critical temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation in dilute
three-dimensional homogeneous Bose gases. Our method involves the models of
spatial permutations and it should be exact to lowest order in the scattering
length of the particle interactions. We find that the change in the critical
temperature is proportional to a rho^{1/3} with constant c = -2.33; this
contradicts the current consensus among physicists.
