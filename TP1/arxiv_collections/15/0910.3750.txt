We report results from an intensive multiwavelength campaign on the
intermediate-frequency-peaked BL Lacertae object W Com (z=0.102) during a
strong outburst of very high energy gamma-ray emission in June 2008. The very
high energy gamma-ray signal was detected by VERITAS on 2008 June 7-8 with a
flux F(>200 GeV) = (5.7+-0.6)x10^-11 cm-2s-1, about three times brighter than
during the discovery of gamma-ray emission from W Com by VERITAS in 2008 March.
The initial detection of this flare by VERITAS at energies above 200 GeV was
followed by observations in high energy gamma-rays (AGILE, E>100 MeV), and
X-rays (Swift and XMM-Newton), and at UV, and ground-based optical and radio
monitoring through the GASP-WEBT consortium and other observatories. Here we
describe the multiwavelength data and derive the spectral energy distribution
(SED) of the source from contemporaneous data taken throughout the flare.
