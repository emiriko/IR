A simple extension of the Standard Model providing Majorana magnetic moments
to right-handed neutrinos is presented. The model contains, in addition to the
Standard Model particles and right-handed neutrinos, just a singly charged
scalar and a vector-like charged fermion. The phenomenology of the model is
analysed and its implications in cosmology, astrophysics and lepton flavour
violating processes are extracted. If light enough, the charged particles
responsible for the right-handed neutrino magnetic moments could copiously be
produced at the LHC.
