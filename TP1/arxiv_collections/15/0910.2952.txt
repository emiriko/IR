It is proposed a natural and consistent division of the momentum of
electromagnetic waves in linear, non-dispersive and non-absorptive dielectric
and magnetic media into material and electromagnetic parts. The material part
is calculated using directly the Lorentz force law and the electromagnetic
momentum density has the same form than in vacuum, without an explicit
dependence on the properties of the media. The consistency of the treatment is
verified through the obtention of a correct momentum balance equation in many
examples and showing the compatibility of the division with the Einstein's
theory of relativity by the use of a gedanken experiment. An experimental
prediction for the radiation pressure on mirrors immersed in linear dielectric
and magnetic media is also made.
