Can the knowledge base of an economy be measured? In this study, we combine
the perspective of regional economics on the interrelationships among
technology, organization, and territory with the triple-helix model, and offer
the mutual information in three dimensions as an indicator of the
configuration. When this probabilistic entropy is negative, the configuration
reduces the uncertainty that prevails at the systems level. Data about more
than a million Dutch companies are used for testing the indicator. The data
contain postal codes (geography), sector codes (proxy for technology), and firm
sizes in terms of number of employees (proxy for organization). The
configurations are mapped at three levels: national (NUTS-1), provincial
(NUTS-2), and regional (NUTS-3). The levels are cross-tabled with the
knowledge-intensive sectors and services. The results suggest that medium-tech
sectors contribute to the knowledge base of an economy more than high-tech
ones. Knowledge-intensive services have an uncoupling effect, but less so at
the high-tech end of these services.
