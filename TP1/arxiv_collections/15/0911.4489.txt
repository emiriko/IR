A simple theory of supersymmetric dark matter (DM) naturally linked to
neutrino flavour physics is studied. The DM sector comprises a spectrum of
mixed lhd-rhd sneutrino states where both the sneutrino flavour structure and
mass splittings are determined by the associated neutrino masses and mixings.
Prospects for indirect detection from solar capture are good due to a large
sneutrino-nucleon cross-section afforded by the inelastic splitting (solar
capture limits exclude an explanation of DAMA/LIBRA). We find parameter regions
where all heavier states will have decayed, leaving only one flavour mixture of
sneutrino as the candidate DM. Such regions have a unique `smoking gun'
signature--sneutrino annihilation in the Sun produces a pair of neutrino mass
eigenstates free from vacuum oscillations, with the potential for detection at
neutrino telescopes through the observation of a hard spectrum of nu_mu and
nu_tau (for a normal neutrino hierarchy). Next generation direct detection
experiments can explore much of the parameter space through both elastic and
inelastic scattering. We show in detail that the observed neutrino masses and
mixings can arise as a consequence of supersymmetry breaking effects in the
sneutrino DM sector, consistent with all experimental constraints.
