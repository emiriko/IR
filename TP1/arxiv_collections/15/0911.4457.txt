Supernova remnants are believed to be a major source of cosmic-rays in the
Galaxy. As their progenitors are commonly found clustered in OB associations,
one has to consider the possibility of collective effects in the acceleration
process. In this work we investigate the shape of the spectrum of protons
accelerated inside the superbubbles blown around clusters of massive stars. To
do so we embed semi-analytical models of particle acceleration and transport
inside Monte-Carlo simulations of OB associations timelines. We consider
regular acceleration at the shock front of supernova remnants, as well as
stochastic re-acceleration and escape occurring between the shocks. We observe
that particle spectra, although strongly intermittent, get a distinctive shape
resulting from a competition between acceleration and escape: they are harder
at the lowest energies and softer at the highest energies. The momentum at
which this spectral break occurs depends on a single dimensionless parameter,
which we evaluate for a selection of objects. The behaviour of a superbubble
regarding acceleration depends on the magnetic turbulence: if B is low the
superbubble is simply the host of a collection of individual supernovae shocks,
but if B is high enough it acts as a global accelerator, producing distinctive
spectra ? which has important implications on the high-energy emission from
these objects.
