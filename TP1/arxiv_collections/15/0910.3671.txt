We discuss the production of W bosons in association with three jets at the
LHC. We investigate how next-to-leading order QCD corrections modify basic
kinematic distributions of jets and leptons. We also address the magnitude of
NLO QCD effects in W+3 jet observables, relevant for SUSY searches at the LHC.
