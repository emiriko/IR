The low energy spin excitations of the Fe pnictide parent compounds have been
determined by inelastic neutron scattering and interpreted within the local
moment J_1a,b-J_2 Heisenberg model with orthorhombic symmetry. This has led to
alternative exchange models that strongly differ in the size of anisotropy.
Although the compounds are itinerant the localised spin model can explain basic
features of the excitations. The inherent frustration of this model leads to
quantum fluctuations and possible moment reduction. We investigate this
question in detail using spin wave approximation and partly exact
diagonalisation Lanczos calculations for finite clusters. We find that the
orthorhombic anisotropy stabilizes the columnar AF phase and its moment. For
the exchange models proposed from inelastic neutron scattering we can exclude a
strong influcence of frustration on the moment size. We also investigate
dependence of magnetisation and susceptibility on field and temperature.
