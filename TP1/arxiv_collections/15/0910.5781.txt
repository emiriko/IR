An explicit construction of the proton wave function is outlined in the high
momentum limit of QCD dominated by a direct $qqq$ force, one generated by
hooking the ends of a $ggg$ vertex to 3 distinct ${\bar q}gq$ vertices, thus
making up a $Y$-shaped diagram (see fig.1). The high degree of $S_3$ symmetry
thus involved ensures that the $qqq$ wave function is a mixture of $56, 0^+$
and $20,1^+$ components, rather than the traditional $56, 0^+$ and $70, 0^+$
type. Some results of this paradigm shift are offered.
