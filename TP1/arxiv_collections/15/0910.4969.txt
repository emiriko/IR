We simulate the possible emission from a disk perturbed by a recoiling
super-massive black hole. To this end, we study radiation transfer from the
system incorporating bremsstrahlung emission from a Maxwellian plasma and
absorption given by Kramer's opacity law modified to incorporate blackbody
effects. We employ this model in the radiation transfer integration to compute
the luminosity at several frequencies, and compare with previous bremsstrahlung
luminosity estimations from a transparent limit (in which the emissivity is
integrated over the computational domain and over all frequencies) and with a
simple thermal emission model. We find close agreement between the radiation
transfer results and the estimated bremsstrahlung luminosity from previous work
for electromagnetic signals above $10^{14}$ Hz. For lower frequencies, we find
a self-eclipsing behavior in the disk, resulting in a strong intensity
variability connected to the orbital period of the disk.
