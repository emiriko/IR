Effects of the Landau diamagnetism and the Pauli paramagnetism on the
longitudinal electric wave characteristics in a quantum plasma are studied. It
is shown that a dispersion relation of the longitudinal wave propagating along
a magnetic field strongly depends on the magnetic field, in radical contrast to
the classical case. New modes of quantum plasma waves due to the magnetic field
are found.
