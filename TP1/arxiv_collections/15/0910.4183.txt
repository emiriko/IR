In this paper, conventional Global QCD analysis is generalized to produce
parton distributions optimized for use with event generators at the LHC. This
optimization is accomplished by combining the constraints due to existing
hard-scattering experimental data with those from anticipated cross sections
for key representative SM processes at LHC (by the best available theory) as
joint input to the global analyses. The PDFs obtained in these new type of
global analyses using matrix elements calculated in any given order will be
best suited to work with event generators of that order, for predictions at the
LHC. This is most useful for LO event generators at present. Results obtained
from a few candidate PDF sets (labeled as CT09MCS, CT09MC1 and CT09MC2) for LO
event generators produced in this way are compared with those from other
approaches.
