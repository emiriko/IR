We present strong arguments that the deep structure of the quantum vacuum
contains a web of microscopic wormholes or short-cuts. We develop the concept
of wormhole spaces and show that this web of wormholes generate a peculiar
array of long-range correlations in the patterns of vacuum fluctuations on the
Planck scale. We conclude that this translocal structure represents the common
cause for both the BH-entropy-area law, the more general holographic principle
and the entanglement phenomena in quantum theory. In so far our approach
exhibits a common structure which underlies both gravity and quantum theory on
a microscopic scale. A central place in our analysis is occupied by a
quantitative derivation of the distribution laws of microscopic wormholes in
the quantum vacuum. This makes it possible to address a number of open
questions and controversial topics in the field of quantum gravity.
