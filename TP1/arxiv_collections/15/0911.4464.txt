We report on the first experimental demonstration of the broadband "trapped
rainbow" in the visible frequency range using an adiabatically tapered
waveguide. Being a distinct case of the slow light phenomenon, the trapped
rainbow effect could be applied to optical computing and signal processing, and
to providing enhanced light-matter interactions.
