We emphasize that a muon based neutrino factory could show the existence of
light right-handed neutrinos, if a deficit in the number of detected events is
observed at a near detector. This could be as large as ~10% if the size of the
new interactions saturates the present limits from electroweak precision data,
what is not excluded by the oscillation experiments performed up to now. A
simple model realizing such a scenario can be obtained adding right-handed
neutrinos to the minimal Standard Model, together with an extra scalar doublet
and a triplet of hypercharge 1. In this case, however, the possible deficit is
reduced by a factor of ~3, and the Yukawa couplings must be adequately chosen.
This is also generically required if lepton flavour violation must be below
present bounds.
