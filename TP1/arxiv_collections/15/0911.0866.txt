The most accepted model for jet production is based on the
magneto-centrifugal acceleration out off an accretion disk that surrounds the
central source (Blandford & Payne, 1982). This scenario, however, does not
explain, e.g., the quasi-periodic ejection phenomena often observed in
different astrophysical jet classes. de Gouveia Dal Pino & Lazarian (2005)
(hereafter GDPL) have proposed that the large scale superluminal ejections
observed in microquasars during radio flare events could be produced by violent
magnetic reconnection (MR) episodes. Here, we extend this model to other
accretion disk systems, namely: active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and young stellar
objects (YSOs), and also discuss its role on jet heating and particle
acceleration.
