Distances between quantum states are reviewed within the framework of the
tomographic-probability representation. Tomographic approach is based on
observed probabilities and is straightforward for data processing. Different
states are distinguished by comparing corresponding probability-distribution
functions. Fidelity as well as other distance measures are expressed in terms
of tomograms.
