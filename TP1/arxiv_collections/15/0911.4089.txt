It is demonstrated that high critical temperature of superconducting
transition in cuprates and new iron-based superconductors is reached because of
the Little-Ginzburg exciton mechanism of HTSC when Cooper pairing of mobile
charge carriers is mediated by excitons which characteristic energy is
essentially higher than Debye one for phonons. The effectiveness of such
mechanism in these doped compounds is provided due to a series of planar
Ginzburg HTSC-'sandwiches': 'insulator'-'metal'- 'insulator' (stripe structure)
naturally forming in conducting planes below the onset pseudogap temperature in
the normal state. The parameters of mobile, planar charge-transfer (CT)
excitons in outer 'insulating' plates of such in-plane HTSC-'sandwich' are
exactly within the optimal range predicted by Ginzburg about forty years ago.
