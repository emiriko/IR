We review the development of ultrafast electron nanocrystallography as a
method for investigating structural dynamics for nanoscale materials and
interfaces. Its sensitivity and resolution are demonstrated in the studies of
surface melting of gold nanocrystals, nonequilibrium transformation of graphite
into reversible diamond-like intermediates, and molecular scale charge
dynamics, showing a versatility for not only determining the structures, but
also the charge and energy redistribution at interfaces. A quantitative scheme
for three-dimensional retrieval of atomic structures is demonstrated with
few-particle (< 1000) sensitivity, establishing this nanocrystallographic
method as a tool for directly visualizing dynamics within isolated
nanomaterials with atomic scale spatio-temporal resolution.
