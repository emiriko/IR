As far as music is concerned, instruments have always been part of a cultural
?landscape? (on technical, expressive and symbolic levels). The present
contribution explores the changes brought about by the shift that occurred
during the 20th century, from mechanical to digital instruments (also named
?virtual instruments?). First and foremost, a short recall of some historical
steps of the technological developments that have renewed our relationship to
sound, music, and instruments will be presented. Second, an analysis of
different discourses and terminologies presently used in the domains of
musicology and computer music will account for the evolution of the notion of
instrumentality.
