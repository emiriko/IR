Consider a one-dimensional shift-invariant attractive spin-flip system in
equilibrium, constituting a dynamic random environment, together with a
nearest-neighbor random walk that on occupied sites has a local drift to the
right but on vacant sites has a local drift to the left. In previous work we
proved a law of large numbers for dynamic random environments satisfying a
space-time mixing property called cone-mixing. If an attractive spin-flip
system has a finite average coupling time at the origin for two copies starting
from the all-occupied and the all-vacant configuration, respectively, then it
is cone-mixing.
  In the present paper we prove a large deviation principle for the empirical
speed of the random walk, both quenched and annealed, and exhibit some
properties of the associated rate functions. Under an exponential space-time
mixing condition for the spin-flip system, which is stronger than cone-mixing,
the two rate functions have a unique zero, i.e., the slow-down phenomenon known
to be possible in a static random environment does not survive in a fast mixing
dynamic random environment. In contrast, we show that for the simple symmetric
exclusion dynamics, which is not cone-mixing (and which is not a spin-flip
system either), slow-down does occur.
