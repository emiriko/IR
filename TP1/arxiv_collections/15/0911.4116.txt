Recently, metamaterials have been introduced to improve the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) of magnetic resonance images with very promising results. However,
the use polymers in the generation of high quality images in magnetic resonance
imaging has not been fully been investigated. These investigations explored the
use of a dielectric periodical array as a lens to improve the image SNR
generated with single surface coils. Commercial polycarbonate glazing sheets
were used together with a circular coil to generate phantom images at 3 Tesla
on a clinical MR imager.
