A pulse shape analysis algorithm and a method for suppressing the noise
component of signals from a large copper proportional counter in the experiment
aimed at searching for 2K capture of Kr-78 are described. These signals
correspond to a compound event with different numbers of charge clusters due to
from primary ionization is formed by these signals. A technique for separating
single- and multipoint events and determining the charge in individual clusters
is presented. Using the Daubechies wavelets in multiresolutional signal
analysis, it is possible to increase the sensitivity and the resolution in
extraction of multipoint events in the detector by a factor of 3-4.
