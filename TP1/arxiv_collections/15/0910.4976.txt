Electroweak interactions need three Nambu-Goldstone bosons to provide a mass
to the W and the Z gauge bosons but they also need an ultra-violet moderator or
new physics to unitarize the gauge boson scattering amplitudes. In this talk, I
will present various recent models of physics at the Fermi scale: several
deformations of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, Little Higgs models,
holographic composite Higgs models, 5D Higgsless models.
