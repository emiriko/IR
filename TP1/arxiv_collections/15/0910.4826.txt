We propose in this paper a Galois theory of $q$-difference equations where q
is a root of unity. This theory is the q difference analogue of the Galois
theory of iterative differential equations, that is differential equations over
fields of positive characteristic. This theory contains and generalizes the
Galois theory of q difference equations developed by Singer and van der Put.
