We present an automated generation of the subtraction terms for
next-to-leading order QCD calculations in the Catani-Seymour dipole formalism.
For a given scattering process with n external particles our Mathematica
package generates all dipole terms, allowing for both massless and massive
dipoles. The numerical evaluation of the subtraction terms proceeds with
MadGraph, which provides Fortran code for the necessary scattering amplitudes.
Checks of the numerical stability are discussed.
