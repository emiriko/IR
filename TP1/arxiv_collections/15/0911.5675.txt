The evolution of a quantum system subjected to infinitely many measurements
in a finite time interval is confined in a proper subspace of the Hilbert
space. This phenomenon is called "quantum Zeno effect": a particle under
intensive observation does not evolve. This effect is at variance with the
classical evolution, which obviously is not affected by any observations. By a
semiclassical analysis we will show that the quantum Zeno effect vanishes at
all orders, when the Planck constant tends to zero, and thus it is a purely
quantum phenomenon without classical analog, at the same level of tunneling.
