We study the thermodynamic singularities of QCD in the complex chemical
potential plane by a numerical simulation of lattice QCD, and discuss a method
to understand the nature of the QCD phase transition at finite density from the
information of the singularities. The existence of singular points at which the
partition function (Z) vanishes is expected in the complex plane. These are
called Lee-Yang zeros or Fisher zeros. We investigate the distribution of these
singular points using the data obtained by a simulation of two-flavor QCD with
p4-improved staggered quarks. The convergence radius of a Taylor expansion of
ln Z in terms of the chemical potential is also discussed.
