The program FIESTA has been completely rewritten. Now it can be used not only
as a tool to evaluate Feynman integrals numerically, but also to expand Feynman
integrals automatically in limits of momenta and masses with the use of sector
decompositions and Mellin-Barnes representations. Other important improvements
to the code are complete parallelization (even to multiple computers),
high-precision arithmetics (allowing to calculate integrals which were undoable
before), new integrators and Speer sectors as a strategy, the possibility to
evaluate more general parametric integrals.
