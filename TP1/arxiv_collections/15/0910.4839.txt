A $p$-adic variation of the Ran(dom) Sa(mple) C(onsensus) method for solving
the relative pose problem in stereo vision is developped. From two 2-adically
encoded images a random sample of five pairs of corresponding points is taken,
and the equations for the essential matrix are solved by lifting solutions
modulo 2 to the 2-adic integers. A recently devised $p$-adic hierarchical
classification algorithm imitating the known LBG quantisation method classifies
the solutions for all the samples after having determined the number of
clusters using the known intra-inter validity of clusterings. In the successful
case, a cluster ranking will determine the cluster containing a 2-adic
approximation to the "true" solution of the problem.
