The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope was launched in June 2008 and the onboard
Large Area Telescope (LAT) has been collecting data since August of that same
year. The LAT is currently being used to study a wide range of science topics
in high-energy astrophysics, one of which is the study of high-energy cosmic
rays. The LAT has recently demonstrated its ability to measure cosmic-ray
electrons, and the Fermi LAT Collaboration has published a measurement of the
high-energy cosmic-ray electron spectrum in the 20 GeV to 1 TeV energy range.
This talk will discuss the prospects for using the LAT to perform a similar
analysis to measure cosmic-ray proton events. The instrument response for
cosmic-ray protons will be characterized and an assessment of the potential to
measure the cosmic-ray proton energy spectrum will be presented.
