Large datasets with interactions between objects are common to numerous
scientific fields (i.e. social science, internet, biology...). The interactions
naturally define a graph and a common way to explore or summarize such dataset
is graph clustering. Most techniques for clustering graph vertices just use the
topology of connections ignoring informations in the vertices features. In this
paper, we provide a clustering algorithm exploiting both types of data based on
a statistical model with latent structure characterizing each vertex both by a
vector of features as well as by its connectivity. We perform simulations to
compare our algorithm with existing approaches, and also evaluate our method
with real datasets based on hyper-textual documents. We find that our algorithm
successfully exploits whatever information is found both in the connectivity
pattern and in the features.
