The energy dependence of the neutrino-iron and antineutrino-iron inclusive
charged-current cross sections and their ratio have been measured using a
high-statistics sample with the MINOS Near Detector exposed to the NuMI beam
from the Main Injector at Fermilab. Neutrino and antineutrino fluxes were
determined using a low hadronic energy subsample of charged-current events. We
report measurements of neutrino-Fe (antineutrinoFe) cross section in the energy
range 3-50 GeV (5-50 GeV) with precision of 2-8% (3-9%) and their ratio which
is measured with precision 2-8%. The data set spans the region from low energy,
where accurate measurements are sparse, up to the high-energy scaling region
where the cross section is well understood.
