An analytic Bethe ansatz is carried out related to tensor-like
representations of the type II Lie superalgebras B(r|s)=osp(2r+1|2s) (r > -1, s
>0) and D(r|s)=osp(2r|2s) (r >1, s >0). We present eigenvalue formulae of
transfer matrices in dressed vacuum forms labeled by Young (super) diagrams. A
class of transfer matrix functional relations (T-system) is discussed. In
particular for B(0|s)=osp(1|2s)(s >0) case, a complete set of functional
relations is proposed by using duality among dressed vacuum forms.
