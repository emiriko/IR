We review slightly a work by Horowitz and Maldecena solving the information
loss problem for black holes by having inside the blackhole - near to the
singularity - a boundary condition, as e.g the no boundary proposal by Hartle
and Hawking. Here we propose to make this boundary condition come out of our
imaginary action model (together with Masao Ninomiya). This model naturally
begins effectively to set up boundaries - whether it be in future or past! -
especially strongly whenever we reach to high energy physics regimes, such as
near the black hole singularity, or in Higgs producing machines as LHC or SSC.
In such cases one can say our model predicts miracles. The point is that you
may say that the information loss problem, unless you solve it in other ways,
call for such a violation of time causality as in our imaginary action model!
