For two families of four-dimensional off-shell N = 2 supersymmetric nonlinear
sigma-models constructed originally in projective superspace, we develop their
formulation in terms of N = 1 chiral superfields. Specifically, these theories
are: (i) sigma-models on cotangent bundles T*M of arbitrary real analytic
Kaehler manifolds M; (ii) general superconformal sigma-models described by
weight-one polar supermultiplets. Using superspace techniques, we obtain a
universal expression for the holomorphic symplectic two-form \omega^{(2,0)}
which determines the second supersymmetry transformation and is associated with
the two complex structures of the hyperkaehler space T*M that are complimentary
to the one induced from M. This two-form is shown to coincide with the
canonical holomorphic symplectic structure. In the case (ii), we demonstrate
that \omega^{(2,0)} and the homothetic conformal Killing vector determine the
explicit form of the superconformal transformations. At the heart of our
construction is the duality (generalized Legendre transform) between off-shell
N = 2 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma-models and their on-shell N = 1 chiral
realizations. We finally present the most general N = 2 superconformal
nonlinear sigma-model formulated in terms of N = 1 chiral superfields. The
approach developed can naturally be generalized in order to describe 5D and 6D
superconformal nonlinear sigma-models in 4D N = 1 superspace.
