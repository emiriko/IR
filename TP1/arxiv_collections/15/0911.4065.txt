We squeeze unconditionally the collective spin of a dilute ensemble of
laser-cooled rubidium-87 atoms using their interaction with a driven optical
resonator. The shape and size of the resulting spin uncertainty region are well
described by a simple analytical model [M.H.S., I.D.L., V.V., arXiv:0911.3936]
through two orders of magnitude in the effective interaction strength, without
free parameters. We deterministically generate states with up to 5.6(6) dB of
metrologically relevant spin squeezing on the canonical rubidium-87 hyperfine
clock transition.
