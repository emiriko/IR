The cosmic distance scale largely depends on distance determinations to Local
Group galaxies. In this sense, the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is a key rung to
better constrain the cosmic distance ladder. A project was started in 1999 to
firmly establish a direct and accurate distance to M31 using eclipsing binaries
(EBs). After the determination of the first direct distance to M31 from EBs,
the second direct distance to an EB system is presented:
M31V_J00443610+4129194. Light and radial velocity curves were obtained and
fitted to derive the masses and radii of the components. The acquired spectra
were combined and disentangled to determine the temperature of the components.
The analysis of the studied EB resulted in a distance determination to M31 of
(m-M)o = 24.30 +/- 0.11 mag. This result, when combined with the previous
distance determination to M31, results in a distance modulus of (m-M)o = 24.36
+/- 0.08 mag (744 +/- 33 kpc), fully compatible with other distance
determinations to M31. With an error of only 4%, the obtained value firmly
establishes the distance to this important galaxy and represents the
fulfillment of the main goal of our project.
