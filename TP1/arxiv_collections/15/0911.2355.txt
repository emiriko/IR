A two-component Bose-Einstein condensate confined in an axially-symmetric
potential with two local minima, resembling two concentric annular traps, is
investigated. The system shows a number of quantum phase transitions that
result from the competition between phase coexistence, and radial/azimuthal
phase separation. The ground-state phase diagram, as well as the rotational
properties, including the (meta)stability of currents in this system, are
analysed.
