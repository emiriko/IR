With the advent of generalized unitarity and parametric integration
techniques, the construction of a generic Next-to-Leading Order Monte Carlo
becomes feasible. Such a generator will entail the treatment of QCD color in
the amplitudes. We extend the concept of color dressing to one-loop amplitudes,
resulting in the formulation of an explicit algorithmic solution for the
calculation of arbitrary scattering processes at Next-to-Leading order. The
resulting algorithm is of exponential complexity, that is the numerical
evaluation time of the virtual corrections grows by a constant multiplicative
factor as the number of external partons is increased. To study the properties
of the method, we calculate the virtual corrections to $n$-gluon scattering.
