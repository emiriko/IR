This paper presents the design and the realization of a hybrid wireless
Gigabit Ethernet indoor communications system operating at 60 GHz. As the 60
GHz radio link operates only in a single-room configuration, an additional
Radio over Fiber (RoF) link is used to ensure the communications within all the
rooms of a residential environment. The system uses low complexity baseband
processing modules. A byte synchronization technique is designed to provide a
high value of the preamble detection probability and a very small value of the
false detection probability. Conventional RS (255, 239) encoder and decoder are
used for channel forward error correction (FEC). The FEC parameters are
determined by the tradeoff between higher coding gain and hardware complexity.
The results of bit error rate measurements at 875 Mbps are presented for
various antennas configurations.
