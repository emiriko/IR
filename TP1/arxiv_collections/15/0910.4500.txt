Until is a notoriously difficult temporal operator as it is both existential
and universal at the same time: A until B holds at the current time instant w
iff either B holds at w or there exists a time instant w' in the future at
which B holds and such that A holds in all the time instants between the
current one and w'. This "ambivalent" nature poses a significant challenge when
attempting to give deduction rules for until. In this paper, in contrast, we
make explicit this duality of until to provide well-behaved natural deduction
rules for linear-time logics by introducing a new temporal operator that allows
us to formalize the "history" of until, i.e., the "internal" universal
quantification over the time instants between the current one and w'. This
approach provides the basis for formalizing deduction systems for temporal
logics endowed with the until operator. For concreteness, we give here a
labeled natural deduction system for a linear-time logic endowed with the new
operator and show that, via a proper translation, such a system is also sound
and complete with respect to the linear temporal logic LTL with until.
