The possibility of dissipative contributions to the mass flux is considered
in detail. A general, thermodynamically consistent framework is developed to
obtain such terms, the compatibility of which with general principles is then
checked--including Galilean invariance, the possibility of steady rigid
rotation and uniform center-of-mass motion, the existence of a locally
conserved angular momentum, and material objectivity. All previously discussed
scenarios of dissipative mass fluxes are found to be ruled out by some
combinations of these principles, but not a new one that includes a smoothed
velocity field v-bar. However, this field v-bar is nonlocal and leads to
unacceptable consequences in specific situations. Hence we can state with
confidence that a dissipative contribution to the mass flux is not possible.
