The nearby ($z=0.03015$) cluster of galaxies Abell~2199 was observed by
Suzaku in X-rays, with five pointings for $\sim 20$ ks each. From the XIS data,
the temperature and metal abundance profiles were derived out to $\sim 700$ kpc
(0.4 times virial radius). Both these quantities decrease gradually from the
center to peripheries by a factor of $\sim 2$, while the oxygen abundance tends
to be flat. The temperature within 12' ($\sim 430$ kpc) is $\sim 4$ keV, and
the 0.5--10 keV X-ray luminosity integrated up to 30' is $(2.9 \pm 0.1) \times
10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, in agreement with previous XMM-Newton measurements.
Above this thermal emission, no significant excess was found either in the XIS
range below $\sim 1$ keV, or in the HXD-PIN range above $\sim 15$ keV. The
90%-confidence upper limit on the emission measure of an assumed 0.2 keV warm
gas is (3.7--7.5) $\times 10^{62}$ cm$^{-3}$ arcmin$^{-2}$, which is 3.7--7.6
times tighter than the detection reported with XMM-Newton. The 90%-confidence
upper limit on the 20--80 keV luminosity of any power law component is $1.8
\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, assuming a photon index of 2.0. Although this
upper limit does not reject the possible 2.1$\sigma$ detection by the BeppoSAX
PDS, it is a factor of 2.1 tighter than that of the PDS if both are considered
upper limits. The non-detection of the hard excess can be reconciled with the
upper limit on diffuse radio emission, without invoking the very low magnetic
fields ($< 0.073 \mu$G) which were suggested previously.
