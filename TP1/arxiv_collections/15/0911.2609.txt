We compute the radial distributions of the scalar, vector and axial charge
density in the heavy-light mesons. We present the results obtained for both the
lowest lying static heavy-light mesons as well as for their nearest
excitations, with $N_f=2$ dynamical quarks of Wilson (Clover) type. We used
various improvements of the static heavy-quark actions. From these
distributions we were able to compute the corresponding charges and their radii
$< r^2>$, the results of which are also presented.
