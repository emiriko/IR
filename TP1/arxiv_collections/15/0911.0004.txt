One of the most fundamental problems in the study of Kuiper belt objects
(KBOs) is to know their true physical size. Without knowledge of their albedos
we are not able to distinguish large and dark from small and bright KBOs.
Spitzer produced rough estimates of the sizes and albedos of about 20 KBOs, and
the Herschel space telescope will improve on those initial measurements by
extending the sample to the ~150 brightest KBOs. SPICA's higher sensitivity
instruments should allow us not only to broaden the sample to smaller KBOs but
also to achieve a statistically significant sample of KBO thermal light curves
(Herschel will measure only six objects). A large sample covering a broad range
of sizes will be key to identify meaningful correlations between size and other
physical and surface properties that constrain the processes of formation and
evolution of the solar system.
