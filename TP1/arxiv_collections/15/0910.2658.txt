A full, high-statistic I=0 and I=2 $\pi-\pi$ scattering calculation including
the disconnected diagram is performed on 2+1 flavor, domain wall fermion gauge
configurations generated using the Iwasaki gauge action with $\beta=2.13$, a
$16^3\times32$ volume with $L_s=16$ and $a^{-1}=1.73GeV$. Using the same light
quark propagators and additional strange quark propagators, we study the $\eta$
and $\eta^\prime$ mesons, where disconnected diagrams also make an important
contribution. Our $\pi-\pi$ calculation shows a good exponentially decaying
signal from the disconnected graph, which makes a small contribution to the I=0
scattering amplitude at least for the short times where it can be accurately
computed. We are able to resolve the $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ states and see
the pattern of SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking found in Nature.
