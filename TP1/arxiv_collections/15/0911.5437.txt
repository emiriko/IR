FRIDA (inFRared Imager and Dissector for the Adaptative optics system of the
GTC) will be a NIR (1-2.5microns) imager and Integral Field Unit spectrograph
to operate with the Adaptative Optics system of the 10.4m GTC telescope. FRIDA
will offer broad and narrow band diffraction-limited imaging and integral field
spectroscopy at low, intermediate and high spectral resolution. The
Extragalactic Astrophysics and Astronomical Instrumentation group of the
Universidad Complutense de Madrid (GUAIX) is developing the Data Reduction
Pipeline for FRIDA. Specific tools for converting output, reduced datacubes to
the standard Euro3D FITS format will be developed, in order to allow users to
exploit existing VO applications for analysis. FRIDA is to be commissioned on
the telescope in 2011.
