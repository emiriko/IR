We apply an elementary measurement scheme to calculate the electronic
triplet-singlet transition mediated by hyperfine interaction in a double
quantum dot. We show how the local character of the hyperfine interaction and
the nuclear back-action process (flip-flop) are crucial to cancel destructive
interferences of the triplet-singlet transition probability. It is precisely
this cancellation which differentiates the hyperfine interaction from an
anisotropic magnetic field which mixes the triplet and the singlet eigenstates.
