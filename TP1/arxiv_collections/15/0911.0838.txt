Collaborative edition is achieved by distinct sites that work independently
on (a copy of) a shared document. Conflicts may arise during this process and
must be solved by the collaborative editor. In pure Peer to Peer collaborative
editing, no centralization nor locks nor time-stamps are used which make
conflict resolution difficult. We propose an algorithm which relies on the
notion or semantics dependence and avoids the need of any integration
transformation to solve conflicts. Furthermore, it doesn't use any history file
recording operations performed since starting the edition process. We show how
to define editing operations for semi-structured documents i.e. XML-like trees,
that are enriched with informations derived for free from the editing process.
Then we define the semantics dependence relation required by the algorithm and
we present preliminary results obtained by a prototype implementation.
