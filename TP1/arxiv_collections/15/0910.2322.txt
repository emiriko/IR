We propose a thought experiment to detect low-energy Quantum Gravity
phenomena using Quantum Optical Information Technologies. Gravitational field
perturbations, such as gravitational waves and quantum gravity fluctuations,
decohere the entangled photon pairs, revealing the presence of gravitational
field fluctuations including those more speculative sources such as compact
extra dimensions and the sub-millimetric hypothetical low-energy quantum
gravity phenomena and then set a limit for the decoherence of photon bunches
and entangled pairs in space detectable with the current astronomical space
technology.
