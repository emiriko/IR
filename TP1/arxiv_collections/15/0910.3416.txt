From an experimental point of view, clear signatures of multifragmentation
have been detected by different experiments. On the other hand, from a
theoretical point of view, many different models, built on the basis of totally
different and often even contrasting assumptions, have been provided to explain
them. In this contribution we show the capabilities and the shortcomings of one
of this models, a QMD code developed by us and coupled to the nuclear
de-excitation module taken from the multipurpose transport and interaction code
FLUKA, in reproducing the multifragmentation observations recently reported by
the INDRA collaboration for the reaction Nb + Mg at a 30 MeV/A projectile
bombarding energy. As far as fragment production is concerned, we also briefly
discuss the isoscaling technique by considering reactions characterized by a
different isospin asymmetry, and we explain how the QMD + FLUKA model can be
applied to obtain information on the slope of isotopic yield ratios, which is
crucially related to the symmetry energy of asymmetric nuclear matter.
