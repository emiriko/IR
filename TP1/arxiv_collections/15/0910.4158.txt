Two dimensional hard core bosons suffer strong scattering in the high
temperature resistive state at half filling. The dynamical conductivity is
calculated using non perturbative tools such as continued fractions, series
expansions and exact diagonalization. We find a large temperature range with
linearly increasing resistivity and broad dynamical conductivity, signaling a
breakdown of Boltzmann-Drude quasiparticle transport theory. At zero
temperature, a high frequency peak in the dynamical conductivity appears above
a "Higgs mass" gap, and corresponds to order parameter magnitude fluctuations.
We discuss the apparent similarity between conductivity of hard core bosons and
phenomenological characteristics of cuprates, including the universal scaling
of Homes et. al. (Nature 430, 539 (2004)).
