An overview of the Conquest linear scaling density functional theory (DFT)
code is given, focussing particularly on the scaling behaviour on modern high-
performance computing (HPC) platforms. We demonstrate that essentially perfect
linear scaling and weak parallel scaling (with fixed atoms per processor core)
can be achieved, and that DFT calculations on millions of atoms are now
possible.
