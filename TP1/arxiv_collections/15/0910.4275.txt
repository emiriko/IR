A global analysis of the world data on differential cross sections and
polarization asymmetries of backward pion-nucleon scattering for invariant
collision energies above 3 GeV is performed in a Regge model. Including the
$N_\alpha$, $N_\gamma$, $\Delta_\delta$ and $\Delta_\beta$ trajectories, we
reproduce both angular distributions and polarization data for small values of
the Mandelstam variable $u$, in contrast to previous analyses. The model
amplitude is used to obtain evidence for baryon resonances with mass below 3
GeV. Our analysis suggests a $G_{39}$ resonance with a mass of 2.83 GeV as
member of the $\Delta_{\beta}$ trajectory from the corresponding Chew-Frautschi
plot.
