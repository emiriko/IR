We present predictions for the $Z$-boson $p_t$-spectrum at Tevatron within
the framework of unintegrated distributions evolved according to evolution
equations recently proposed by us. We discuss the dependence of the results on
the choice of non-perturbative parameters, the coupling constant and the impact
of soft gluon resummation.
