Shor's quantum factoring algorithm finds the prime factors of a large number
exponentially faster than any other known method a task that lies at the heart
of modern information security, particularly on the internet. This algorithm
requires a quantum computer a device which harnesses the `massive parallelism'
afforded by quantum superposition and entanglement of quantum bits (or qubits).
We report the demonstration of a compiled version of Shor's algorithm on an
integrated waveguide silica-on-silicon chip that guides four single-photon
qubits through the computation to factor 15.
