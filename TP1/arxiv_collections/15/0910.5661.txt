We have studied the correlation effects in Cs and Fr arising from the
interplay of the residual Coulomb interaction to all orders and the neutral
weak interaction which gives rise to the parity violating electric dipole
transition to first order, within the framework of the relativistic
coupled-cluster theory which circumvents the constrain of explicitly summing
over the intermediate states. We observe that, the contributions arising from
the perturbed doubly excited states are quite significant and hence, any
calculation should not be considered accurate unless it includes the perturbed
double excitations comprehensively. In this article, we have reported a
comparative study of various results related to the parity violation in Cs and
Fr.
