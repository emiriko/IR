We investigate baryon-baryon (BB) interactions in the flavor SU(3) symmetric
world, by using the 3-flavor full QCD simulations. In the SU(3) limit, six
independent two-baryon states exist for a given orbital angular momentum. We
forcus on S-wave states and extract BB potentials using the method recently
developed. We discuss the flavor dependence of the potentials, in particular,
the strength of the repulsion at short distance. We find that the SU(3) flavor
structure of the repulsive core is compatible with that expected from the Pauli
principle for the quarks.
