We update our previous work of a Langevin-with-interaction model for
charmonium in heavy-ion collisions, by considering the effect due to
recombination. We determine the contribution to J/psi yields from
charm-anticharm pairs whose constituent quarks originate from two different
hard processes. Like the surviving J/psi states, the recombinant J/psi also
undergo both a stochastic interaction, determined by a hydrodynamical
simulation of the heavy-ion collision, and an interaction determined by the
heavy quark-antiquark potentials measured on the lattice for appropriate
temperatures. From the results of these simulations, we determine both the
direct and the recombinant contribution to the J/psi yields for RHIC
conditions, and find that for central collisions, between 30% and 50% of the
J/psi yield is due to recombinant production. We compare our results with other
models and look for how the recombinant contribution differs from the surviving
contribution in the differential p_t yields. Including the recombinant
contribution improves the agreement with the latest analysis of charmonium at
RHIC, which shows an absence of anomalous suppression except in the most
central collisions.
