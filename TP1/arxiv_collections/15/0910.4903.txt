The Dendritic Cell algorithm (DCA) is inspired by recent work in innate
immunity. In this paper a formal description of the DCA is given. The DCA is
described in detail, and its use as an anomaly detector is illustrated within
the context of computer security. A port scan detection task is performed to
substantiate the influence of signal selection on the behaviour of the
algorithm. Experimental results provide a comparison of differing input signal
mappings.
