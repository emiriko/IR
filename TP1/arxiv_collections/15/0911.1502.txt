In this paper, we analyze a round-based pricing scheme that encourages
favorable behavior from users of real-time P2P applications like P2PTV. In the
design of pricing schemes, we consider price to be a function of usage and
capacity of download/upload streams, and quality of content served. Users are
consumers and servers at the same time in such networks, and often exhibit
behavior that is unfavorable towards maximization of social benefits.
Traditionally, network designers have overcome this difficulty by building-in
traffic latencies. However, using simulations, we show that appropriate pricing
schemes and usage terms can enable designers to limit required traffic
latencies, and be able to earn nearly 30% extra revenue from providing P2PTV
services. The service provider adjusts the prices of individual programs
incrementally within rounds, while making relatively large-scale adjustments at
the end of each round. Through simulations, we show that it is most beneficial
for the service provider to carry out 5 such rounds of price adjustments for
maximizing his average profit and minimizing the associated standard deviation
at the same time.
