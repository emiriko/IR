We discuss the implications of our prior results obtained in our companion
paper [arXiv:0910.2229]. Inescapably, they lead to three laws governing the
size of hadrons, including in particular protons and neutrons that make up the
bulk of ordinary matter: a) there are no radial excitations in low-energy QCD;
b) the size of a hadron is largest in its ground state; c) the hadron's size
shrinks when its orbital excitation increases. The second and third laws follow
from the first law. It follows that the path from confinement to asymptotic
freedom is a Regge trajectory. It also follows that the top quark is a free,
albeit short-lived, quark.
