I describe a method that places the fermion fields and the gauge fields on
different lattice spacings during the Hybrid Monte Carlo generation of
Ginsparg-Wilson dynamical ensembles. The idea is motivated by Wilson's
formulation of the renormalisation group. After outlining the underlying
theory, I describe a method to perform most of the work of the HMC on a coarse
lattice, only requiring to convert to and from the fine lattice once for each
independent configuration. Because the bulk of the work takes place on the
coarse lattice, including the calculation of most observables, this method
saves over an order of magnitude in computer time over previous methods.
