In this paper we consider the effect of self-localization of a quantum
impurity in Bose-Einstein condensate. Space correlation function of the
impurity is evaluated with the help of the imaginary-time path integral
approach. Employing the Feynman's variational method we calculate the impurity
correlation function as well as the energy of the system associated with the
impurity. The effect of self-localization predicted before within
Gross-Pitaevskii approach is recovered by our treatment. The strong coupling
regime with negative ground state energy is reached by variational method, and
corresponding correlation function is calculated.
