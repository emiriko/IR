3D Magnetohydrodynamic simulations show that when matter accretes onto
neutron stars, in particular if the misalignment angle is small, it does not
constantly fall at a fixed spot. Instead, the location at which matter reaches
the star moves. These moving hot spots can be produced both during stable
accretion, where matter falls near the magnetic poles of the star, and unstable
accretion, characterized by the presence of several tongues of matter which
fall on the star near the equator, due to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities.
Precise modeling with Monte Carlo simulations shows that those movements could
be observed as high frequency Quasi Periodic Oscillations. We performed a
number of new simulation runs with a much wider set of parameters, focusing on
neutron stars with a small misalignment angle. In most cases we observe
oscillations whose frequency is correlated with the mass accretion rate
$\dot{M}$. Moreover, in some cases double QPOs appear, each of them showing the
same correlation with $\dot{M}$.
