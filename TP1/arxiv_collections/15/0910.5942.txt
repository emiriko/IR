We study the sensitivity and resolution of phase measurement in a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer with two-mode squeezed vacuum (<n> photons on
average). We show that super-resolution and sub-Heisenberg sensitivity is
obtained with parity detection. In particular, in our setup, dependence of the
signal on the phase evolves <n> times faster than in traditional schemes, and
uncertainty in the phase estimation is better than 1/<n>.
