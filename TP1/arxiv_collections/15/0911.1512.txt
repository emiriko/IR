A special scenario of the topology in the hybrid Cognitive Ad-hoc networks is
studied and a novel cross layer scheme is proposed in this paper. The proposed
scheme integrated the attributes both of the new performance evaluation machine
check time metric and the topology space in special scenario. The topology and
power consumption of each node can all be optimized due to the minimum link
occupation with the help of this scheme. Simulation results show that the novel
scheme can give schedule guarantee to the multi-channel networks in the
variable node loads and transmission powers, and make the node stable to
support multi-hops at the same time.
