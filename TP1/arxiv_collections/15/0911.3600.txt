This paper presents a novel approach for the integration of a set of XML
Schemas. The proposed approach is specialized for XML, is almost automatic,
semantic and "light". As a further, original, peculiarity, it is parametric
w.r.t. a "severity" level against which the integration task is performed. The
paper describes the approach in all details, illustrates various theoretical
results, presents the experiments we have performed for testing it and,
finally, compares it with various related approaches already proposed in the
literature.
