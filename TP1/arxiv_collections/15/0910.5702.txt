Let G^\vee be a complex simple algebraic group. We describe certain morphisms
of G^\vee(\calO)-equivariant complexes of sheaves on the affine Grassmannian
\Gr of G^\vee in terms of certain morphisms of G-equivariant coherent sheaves
on \frakg, where G is the Langlands dual group of G^\vee and \frakg is its Lie
algebra. This can be regarded as an example of the derived Satake
correspondence.
