A proposed set of instrumentation, collectively referred to as the Super
Bigbite project, is presented. Used in three different configurations it will
allow measurements of three nucleon electromagnetic form factors GEn, GEp, and
GMn with unprecedented precision to Q2-values up to three times higher than
existing data.
