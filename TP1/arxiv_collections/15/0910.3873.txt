In superconducting ferromagnets for which the Curie temperature $T_{m}$
exceeds the superconducting transition temperature $T_{c}$, it was suggested
that ferromagnetic spin fluctuations could lead to superconductivity with
p-wave spin triplet Cooper pairing. Using the Stoner model of itinerant
ferromagnetism, we study the feedback effect of the p-wave superconductivity on
the ferromagnetism. Below $T_{c}$, the ferromagnetism is enhanced by the p-wave
superconductivity. At zero temperature, the critical Stoner value for itinerant
ferromagnetism is reduced by the strength of the p-wave pairing potential, and
the magnetization increases correspondingly. More important, our results
suggest that once Stoner ferromagnetism is established, $T_m$ is unlikely to
ever be below $T_c$. For strong and weak ferromagnetism, three and two peaks in
the temperature dependence of the specific heat are respectively predicted, the
upper peak in the latter case corresponding to a first-order transition.
