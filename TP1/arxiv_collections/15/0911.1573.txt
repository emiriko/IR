The Darboux transformations for the two dimensional elliptic affine Toda
equations corresponding to all seven infinite series of affine Kac-Moody
algebras, including $A_l^{(1)}$, $A_{2l}^{(2)}$, $A_{2l-1}^{(2)}$, $B_l^{(1)}$,
$C_l^{(1)}$, $D_l^{(1)}$ and $D_{l+1}^{(2)}$, are presented. The Darboux
transformation is constructed uniformly for the latter six series of equations
with suitable choice of spectral parameters and the solutions of the Lax pairs
so that all the reality symmetry, cyclic symmetry and complex orthogonal
symmetry of the corresponding Lax pairs are kept invariant. The exact solutions
of all these two dimensional elliptic affine Toda equations are obtained by
using Darboux transformations.
