In correlated electron systems such as cuprate superconductors and colossal
magnetoresistive (CMR) oxides there is often a tendency for a nanoscale
self-organization of electrons that can give rise to exotic properties and to
extreme non-linear responses. The driving mechanisms for this self-organization
are highly debated, especially in the CMR oxides in which two types of
self-organized stripes of charge and orbital order coexist with each other. By
utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements over a wide
doping range, we show that one type of stripe is exclusively linked to long
flat portions of nested Fermi surface, while the other type prefers to be
commensurate with the real space lattice but also may be driven away from this
by the Fermi surface. Complementarily, the Fermi surface also appears to be
driven away from its non-interacting value at certain doping levels, giving
rise to a host of unusual electronic properties.
