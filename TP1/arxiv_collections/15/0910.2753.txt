Masses determined from classical Cepheids in binary systems are a primary
test of both pulsation and evolutionary calculations. The first step is to
determine the orbit from ground-based radial velocities. Complementary
satellite data from Hubble, FUSE, IUE, and Chandra provide full information
about the system. A summary of recent results on masses is given. Cepheids have
also provided copious information about the multiplicity of massive stars, as
well as the distribution of mass ratios and separations. This provides some
important constraints for star formation scenarios including differences
between high and low mass results and differences between close and wide
binaries.
