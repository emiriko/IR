We introduce a method to experimentally measure the monochromatic
transmission matrix of a complex medium in optics. This method is based on a
spatial phase modulator together with a full-field interferometric measurement
on a camera. We determine the transmission matrix of a thick random scattering
sample. We show that this matrix exhibits statistical properties in good
agreement with random matrix theory and allows light focusing and imaging
through the random medium. This method might give important insights into the
mesoscopic properties of complex medium.
