The causal dynamical triangulations (CDT) program has for the first time
allowed for path-integral computation of correlation functions in full general
relativity without symmetry reductions and taking into account Lorentzian
signature. One of the most exciting recent results in CDT is the strong
agreement of these computations with (minisuperspace) path integral
calculations in quantum cosmology. Herein I will describe my current project to
compute minisuperspace (Friedman-Robertson-Walker) path integrals with a range
of different measures corresponding to various factor orderings of the
Friedman-Robertson-Walker Hamiltonian. The aim is to compare with CDT results
and ask whether CDT can shed light on factor-ordering ambiguities in quantum
cosmology models.
