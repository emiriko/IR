We propose a new paradigm for emergence of macroscopic flows. The latter are
considered as a collective phenomenon created by many agents that exchange
abstract information. The information exchange causes agents to change their
relative positions which results in a flow. This paradigm, aimed at the study
of the nature of turbulence, appeals to the original meaning of the word:
"turbulence" siginifies "disordered motions of crowds". We give a preliminary
discussion on a model of multi-agent dynamics that realizes the paradigm. This
dynamics is reminiscent of spin glasses and neural networks. The model is
relational, i. e. it assumes no spatio-temporal background and may serve as a
basis for an approach to quantum gravity via spin models.
