Observed physical phenomena can be described well by quantum mechanics or
general relativity. People may try to find an unified fundamental theory which
mainly aims to merge gravity with quantum theory. However, difficulty in
merging those theories self-consistently still exists, and no such theory is
generally accepted. Here we try to propose a quantum theory with space and time
in symmetrical positions in the framework of general relativity. In this
theory, Dirac matter fields, gauge fields and gravity field are formulated in
an unified way which satisf Dirac equation, Yang-Mills equation and Einstein
equation in operator form. This combines the quantum mechanics and general
relativity .
