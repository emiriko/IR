The Imaginary Time Step (ITS) method is applied to solve the Dirac equation
with the nonlocal potential in coordinate space by the ITS evolution for the
corresponding Schr\"odinger-like equation for the upper component. It is
demonstrated that the ITS evolution can be equivalently performed for the
Schr\"odinger-like equation with or without localization. The latter algorithm
is recommended in the application for the reason of simplicity and efficiency.
The feasibility and reliability of this algorithm are also illustrated by
taking the nucleus $^{16}$O as an example, where the same results as the
shooting method for the Dirac equation with localized effective potentials are
obtained.
