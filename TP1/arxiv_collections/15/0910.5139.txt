The 2-spin Ising model in statistical mechanics and the 2x2 normal form game
in game theory are compared. All configurations allowed by the second are
recovered by the first when the only concern is about Nash equilibria. But it
holds no longer when Pareto optimum condiderations are introduced like in the
prisoner's dilemma. This gap can nevertheless be filled by adding a new
coupling term to the Ising model, even if that term has up to now no physical
meaning. An individual complete bilinear objective function is thus found to be
sufficient to reproduce all possible configurations of a 2x2 game. Using this
one-to-one mapping, new perspectives for future research in both fields can be
envisioned.
