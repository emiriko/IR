The rotation rate in pre-supernova cores is an important ingredient which can
profoundly affect the post-collapse evolution and associated energy release in
supernovae and long gamma ray bursts (LGRBs). Previous work has focused on
whether the specific angular momentum is above or below the critical value
required for the creation of a centrifugally supported disk around a black
hole. Here, we explore the effect of the distribution of angular momentum with
radius in the star, and show that qualitative transitions between high and low
angular momentum flow, corresponding to high and low luminosity accretion
states, can effectively be reflected in the energy output, leading to
variability and the possibility of quiescent times in LGRBs.
