We propose factorized difference operators L(u) associated with the twisted
quantum affine algebras U_{q}(A^{(2)}_{2n}),U_{q}(A^{(2)}_{2n-1}),
U_{q}(D^{(2)}_{n+1}),U_{q}(D^{(3)}_{4}). These operators are shown to be
annihilated by a screening operator. Based on a basis of the solutions of the
difference equation L(u)w(u)=0, we also construct a Casorati determinant
solution to the T-system for U_{q}(A^{(2)}_{2n}),U_{q}(A^{(2)}_{2n-1}).
