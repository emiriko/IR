Some features of the global entanglement of a composed quantum system can be
quantified in terms of the purity of a balanced bipartition, made up of half of
its subsystems. For the given bipartition, purity can always be minimized by
taking a suitable (pure) state. When many bipartitions are considered, the
requirement that purity be minimal for all bipartitions can engender conflicts
and frustration arises. This unearths an interesting link between frustration
and multipartite entanglement, defined as the average purity over all
(balanced) bipartitions.
