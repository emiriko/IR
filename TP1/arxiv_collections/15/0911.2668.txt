There is currently vast evidence for Dark Matter (DM) from astronomical
observations. However, in spite of tremendous efforts by large experimental
groups, there is no confirmed direct detection of the dark matter in our
galaxy. Recent experimental results and theoretical developments suggest the
possibility of a DM particle with mass below 10 GeV, such a particle would
escape most of the direct searches due to the large thresholds for the
detection of nuclear recoils typically used. In this work we study the
possibility of a new Dark Matter search with an unprecedented low threshold for
the detection of nuclear recoils using high-resistivity CCD detectors (hr-CCD).
Due to their extremely low readout noise and the relatively large active mass,
these detectors present a unique opportunity in this field.
