We formulate a sufficient condition for the existence of a consistent price
system (CPS), which is weaker than the conditional full support condition (CFS)
introduced by Guasoni, Rasonyi, and Schachermayer [Ann. Appl. Probab.,
18(2008), pp. 491-520] . We use the new condition to show the existence of CPSs
for certain processes that fail to have the CFS property. In particular this
condition gives sufficient conditions, under which a continuous function of a
process with CFS admits a CPS, while the CFS property might be lost.
