Proper characterization of the host star to a planet is a key element to the
understanding of its overall properties. The star has a direct impact through
the modification of the structure and evolution of the planet atmosphere by
being the overwhelmingly larger source of energy. The star plays a central role
in shaping the structure, evolution, and even determining the mere existence of
planetary atmospheres. The vast majority of the stellar flux is well understood
thanks to the impressive progress made in the modeling of stellar atmospheres.
At short wavelengths (X-rays to UV), however, the information is scarcer since
the stellar emission does not originate in the photosphere but in the
chromospheric and coronal regions, which are much less understood. The same can
be said about particle emissions, with a strong impact on planetary
atmospheres, because a detailed description of the time-evolution of stellar
wind is still lacking. Here we review our current understanding of the flux and
particle emissions of the Sun and low-mass stars and briefly address their
impact in the context of planetary atmospheres.
