We explore the features of gravity in its quantum regime in a mathematically
rigorous way by carrying out the classical and quantum formulations of some
two-Killing symmetry reductions of general relativity which admit an exact
Fock/Schr\"{o}dinger quantization. Concretely, we analyze in depth the linearly
polarized 3-handle (S1xS2) and 3-sphere (S3) Gowdy cosmological models coupled
to massless scalar fields. Within the classical formulation, this study
requires a careful application of modern differential geometry techniques and
the Dirac-Bergmann theory of constrained systems. Regarding the quantization
process, we analyze the construction of both Fock and Schr\"{o}dinger
representations, the unitarity of the time evolution, and the existence of
semiclassical states for these systems by making use of the algebraic formalism
of quantum theory and the theory of unitary implementation of symplectic
transformations. Several appendices give additional information on the results
attained in the main body of the thesis, going deeply into the relevant
mathematical aspects of the text.
