The optimization of large portfolios displays an inherent instability to
estimation error. This poses a fundamental problem, because solutions that are
not stable under sample fluctuations may look optimal for a given sample, but
are, in effect, very far from optimal with respect to the average risk. In this
paper, we approach the problem from the point of view of statistical learning
theory. The occurrence of the instability is intimately related to over-fitting
which can be avoided using known regularization methods. We show how
regularized portfolio optimization with the expected shortfall as a risk
measure is related to support vector regression. The budget constraint dictates
a modification. We present the resulting optimization problem and discuss the
solution. The L2 norm of the weight vector is used as a regularizer, which
corresponds to a diversification "pressure". This means that diversification,
besides counteracting downward fluctuations in some assets by upward
fluctuations in others, is also crucial because it improves the stability of
the solution. The approach we provide here allows for the simultaneous
treatment of optimization and diversification in one framework that enables the
investor to trade-off between the two, depending on the size of the available
data set.
