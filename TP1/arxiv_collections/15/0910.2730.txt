We develop a geometro-dynamical approach to the cosmological constant problem
(CCP) by invoking a geometry induced by the energy-momentum tensor of vacuum,
matter and radiation. The construction, which utilizes the dual role of the
metric tensor that it structures both the spacetime manifold and
energy-momentum tensor of the vacuum, gives rise to a framework in which the
vacuum energy induced by matter and radiation, instead of gravitating,
facilitates the generation of the gravitational constant. The non-vacuum
sources comprising matter and radiation gravitate normally. At the level of
classical gravitation, the mechanism deadens the CCP yet quantum gravitational
effects, if can be strong in de Sitter space, can keep it existent.
