The vacuum fluctuation (VF) effects on asymmetric nuclear matter are
investigated. Masses of nucleons and mesons are modified in the nuclear medium
by calculating the loop-diagram corrections and the density dependence of
hadron masses is obtained. The relativistic Lagrangian density with the
isovector scalar $\delta$ meson is used to calculate the nuclear equation of
state (EOS) in the framework of the relativistic mean-field (RMF) approach, the
effects of the in-medium hadron masses on the properties of neutron stars are
finally studied. With the inclusion of the VF corrections, the nuclear EOS
becomes softer and the neutron star masses are reduced.
