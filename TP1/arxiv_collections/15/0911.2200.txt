The transport properties of quantum dots with up to N=7 electrons ranging
from the weak to the strong interacting regime are investigated via the
projected Hartree-Fock technique. As interactions increase radial order
develops in the dot, with the formation of ring and centered-ring structures.
Subsequently, angular correlations appear, signalling the formation of a Wigner
molecule state. We show striking signatures of the emergence of Wigner
molecules, detected in transport. In the linear regime, conductance is
exponentially suppressed as the interaction strength grows. A further
suppression is observed when centered-ring structures develop, or peculiar spin
textures appear. In the nonlinear regime, the formation of molecular states may
even lead to a conductance enhancement.
