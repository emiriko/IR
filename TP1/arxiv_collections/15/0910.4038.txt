Our objective was to design a quantum repeater capable of achieving one
million entangled pairs per second over a distance of 1000km. We failed, but
not by much. In this letter we will describe the series of developments that
permitted us to approach our goal. We will describe a mechanism that permits
the creation of entanglement between two qubits, connected by fibre, with
probability arbitrarily close to one and in constant time. This mechanism may
be extended to ensure that the entanglement has high fidelity without
compromising these properties. Finally, we describe how this may be used to
construct a quantum repeater that is capable of creating a linear quantum
network connecting two distant qubits with high fidelity. The creation rate is
shown to be a function of the maximum distance between two adjacent quantum
repeaters.
