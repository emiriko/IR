Cyclostationary processes are those signals whose have vary almost
periodically in statistics. It can give rise to random data whose statistical
characteristics vary periodically with time although these processes not
periodic functions of time. Intermittent pulsar is a special type in pulsar
astronomy which have period but not a continuum. The Rotating RAdio TransientS
(RRATs) represent a previously unknown population of bursting neutron stars.
Cyclical period changes of variables star also can be thought as
cyclostationary which are several classes of close binary systems.
Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) refer to the way the X-ray light from an
astronomical object flickers about certain frequencies in high-energy (X-ray)
astronomy. I think that all above phenomenon is cyclostationary process. I
describe the signal processing of cyclostationary, then discussed that the
relation between it and intermittent pulsar, RRATs, cyclical period changes of
variables star and QPOs, and give the perspective of finding the
cyclostationary source in the transient universe.
