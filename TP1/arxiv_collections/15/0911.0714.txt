Let $Q$ be an acyclic quiver and let $\mathcal A(Q)$ be the corresponding
cluster algebra. Let $H$ be the path algebra of $Q$ over an algebraically
closed field and let $M$ be an indecomposable regular $H$-module. We prove the
positivity of the cluster characters associated to $M$ expressed in the initial
seed of $\mathcal A(Q)$ when either $H$ is tame and $M$ is any regular
$H$-module, or $H$ is wild and $M$ is a regular Schur module which is not
quasi-simple.
