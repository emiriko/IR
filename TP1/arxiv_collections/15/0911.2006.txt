We present new photometric and spectroscopic observations for 2M 1533+3759 (=
NSVS 07826147). It has an orbital period of 0.16177042 day, significantly
longer than the 2.3--3.0 hour periods of the other known eclipsing sdB+dM
systems. Spectroscopic analysis of the hot primary yields Teff = 29230 +/- 125
K, log g = 5.58 +/- 0.03 and log N(He)/N(H) = -2.37 +/- 0.05. The sdB velocity
amplitude is K1 = 71.1 +/- 1.0 km/s. The only detectable light contribution
from the secondary is due to the surprisingly strong reflection effect. Light
curve modeling produced several solutions corresponding to different values of
the system mass ratio, q(M2/M1), but only one is consistent with a core helium
burning star, q=0.301. The orbital inclination is 86.6 degree. The sdB primary
mass is M1 = 0.376 +/- 0.055 Msun and its radius is R1 = 0.166 +/- 0.007 Rsun.
2M1533+3759 joins PG0911+456 (and possibly also HS2333+3927) in having an
unusually low mass for an sdB star. SdB stars with masses significantly lower
than the canonical value of 0.48 Msun, down to as low as 0.30 Msun, were
theoretically predicted by Han et al. (2002, 2003), but observational evidence
has only recently begun to confirm the existence of such stars. The existence
of core helium burning stars with masses lower than 0.40--0.43 Msun implies
that at least some sdB progenitors have initial main sequence masses of
1.8--2.0 Msun or more, i.e. they are at least main sequence A stars. The
secondary is a main sequence M5 star.
