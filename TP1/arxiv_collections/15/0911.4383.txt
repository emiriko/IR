We apply the functional renormalization group (FRG) method to calculate the
conductance of a quantum dot in the Kondo regime. Starting from the exact FRG
equations in Keldysh formulation for the Kondo exchange Hamiltonian in
pseudo-fermion (pf) representation, we solve the coupled equations for the pf
self energy and the coupling function, neglecting three-particle and higher
correlation functions. The conductance $G$ as a function of temperature $T$ and
bias voltage $V$ is calculated using a renormalized Golden Rule expression. The
limiting behavior at $T$ and/or $V$ $\gg T_{K}$ ($T_{K}$ : Kondo temperature)
agrees with known results. The difficulties when approaching strong coupling
are analyzed and improvements are suggested.
