We investigate quasiparticles in bilayer quantum Hall systems around total
filling factor nu =1 by current-pumped and resistively detected NMR. The
measured Knight shift reveals that the spin component in the quasiparticle
increases continuously with $\Delta_{SAS}$. Combined with results for the
pseudospin component obtained by activation gap measurements, this demonstrates
that both spin and pseudospin are contained in a quasiparticle at intermediate
$\Delta_{SAS}$, providing evidence for the existence of the spin-pseudospin
intermixed SU(4) skyrmion. Nuclear spin relaxation measurements show that the
collective behavior of the SU(4) skyrmion system qualitatively changes with
$\Delta_{SAS}$.
