Ferromagnetism in carbon-based materials is appealing for both applications
and fundamental science purposes because carbon is a light and bio-compatible
material that contains only s and p electrons in contrast to traditional
ferromagnets based on 3d or 4f electrons. Here we demonstrate direct evidence
for ferromagnetic order locally at defect structures in highly oriented
pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) with magnetic force microscopy and in bulk
magnetization measurements at room temperature. Magnetic impurities have been
excluded as the origin of the magnetic signal after careful analysis supporting
an intrinsic magnetic behavior of carbon. The observed ferromagnetism has been
attributed to originate from unpaired electron spins localized at grain
boundaries of HOPG. Grain boundaries form two-dimensional arrays of point
defects, where their spacing depends on the mutual orientation of two grains.
Depending on the distance between these point defects, scanning tunneling
spectroscopy of grain boundaries showed two intense split localized states for
small distances between defects (< 4 nm) and one localized state at the Fermi
level for large distances between defects (> 4 nm).
