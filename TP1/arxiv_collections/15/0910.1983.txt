We study electron transport in polycyclic hydrocarbon molecules attached to
two semi-infinite one-dimensional metallic electrodes by the use of Green's
function formalism. Parametric calculations based on the tight-binding
framework are given to investigate the transport properties through such
molecular bridges. In this context we also discuss noise power of current
fluctuations and focus our attention on the shot noise contribution to the
power spectrum. The electron transport properties are significantly influenced
by (a) length of the molecule, (b) molecule-electrode interface geometry and
(c) molecular coupling strength to the electrodes.
