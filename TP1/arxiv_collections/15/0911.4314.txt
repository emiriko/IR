One of the major open issues in neutrino physics is the possible existence of
CP violation in the neutrino sector. Such an observation would have an
important impact in various domains of physics, from high energy physics to
cosmology. Its search requires future accelerator neutrino facilities producing
intense and pure neutrino beams such as "beta-beams". Here we review the
different beta-beam scenarios proposed so far and discuss the present status,
with a particular emphasis on the original baseline scenario and its
feasibility. Alternative strategies for the CP violation search are to be
pursued as well. A possibility is to search for CP violation effects in
astrophysical environments. Here we present recent analytical and numerical
results obtained in the context of core-collapse supernovae. In particular, we
point out the conditions under which there can be CP violating effects in dense
media and show numerical results on the supernova (anti-)neutrino fluxes and on
the electron fraction, relevant for the r-process nucleosynthesis.
