We design a polarization-sensitive resonator for use in midinfrared
photodetectors, utilizing a photonic crystal cavity and a single or
double-metal plasmonic waveguide to achieve enhanced detector efficiency due to
superior optical confinement within the active region. As the cavity is highly
frequency and polarization-sensitive, this resonator structure could be used in
chip-based infrared spectrometers and cameras that can distinguish among
different materials and temperatures to a high degree of precision.
