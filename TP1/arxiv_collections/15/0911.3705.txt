Effective low-energy Hamiltonians for several different families of
iron-based superconductors are compared after deriving them from the
downfolding scheme based on first-principles calculations. Systematic
dependences of the derived model parameters on the families are elucidated,
many of which are understood from the systematic variation of the covalency
between Fe-3d and pnictogen-/chalcogen-p orbitals.
