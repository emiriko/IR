The magnetic version of the effects commonly attributed to Aharonov and Bohm
had been published ten years earlier by Ehrenberg and Siday. We compare the two
articles, and conclude that their essential contents are identical. We
therefore advocate that the magnetic effect be referred to as the
Ehrenberg-Siday Effect, and that the term Aharonov-Bohm Effect be reserved for
the electrical case.
