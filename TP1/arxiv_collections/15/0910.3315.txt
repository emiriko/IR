We discuss the techniques to extract the electromagnetic Delta form factors
in Lattice QCD. We evaluate these form factors using dynamical fermions with
smallest pion mass of about 350 MeV. We pay particular attention to the
extraction of the electric quadrupole form factor that signals a deformation of
the Delta. The magnetic moment of the $\Delta$ is extrapolated using a chiral
effective field theory. Using the form factors we evaluate the transverse
density distributions in the infinite momentum frame showing deformation in the
Delta.
