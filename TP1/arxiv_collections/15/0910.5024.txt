We present results of a study of four-wave mixing in Rb vapour with highly
nonlinear susceptibility, using both homodyne and heterodyne detection. We
demonstrate that the spectra have different appearances for media possessing
electromagnetically induced transparency and electromagnetically induced
absorption, and for different relative polarizations of the drive and probe
fields. We show that these differences allow the contributions of different
processes responsible for the enhanced Kerr nonlinearity of the media to be
distinguished.
