A method for studying the qualitative dynamical properties of abstract
computing machines based on the approximation of their program-size complexity
using a general lossless compression algorithm is presented. It is shown that
the compression-based approach classifies cellular automata (CA) into clusters
according to their heuristic behavior, with these clusters showing a
correspondence with Wolfram's main classes of CA behavior. A compression based
method to estimate a characteristic exponent to detect phase transitions and
measure the resiliency or sensitivity of a system to its initial conditions is
also proposed. A conjecture regarding the capability of a system to reach
computational universality related to the values of this phase transition
coefficient is formulated. These ideas constitute a compression-based framework
for investigating the dynamical properties of cellular automata and other
systems.
