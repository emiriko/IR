We present a study of quantum phase analysis of inhomogeneous and homogeneous
arrays of superconducting quantum dots (SQD). We observe the existance of
Josephson decouple (JD) phase only at the half filling for inhomogeneous array
of SQD due to the fluctuation of Josephson couplings over the sites at half
filling. In JD phase superconductivity disappears even in the absence of
Coulomb blockade phase. We also observe that fluctuation of on-site Coulomb
charging energy produces the relevant coupling term that yields Coulomb
blockade gapped phase. The presence of nearest-neighbor and
next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction yields the same physics for
inhomogeneous and homogeneous SQD.
