We present a comprehensive multiband spectral and polarimetric study of the
jet of 3C 264 (NGC 3862). Included in this study are three HST optical and
ultraviolet polarimetry data sets, along with new and archival VLA radio
imaging and polarimetry, a re-analysis of numerous HST broadband data sets from
the near infrared to the far ultraviolet, and a Chandra ACIS-S observation. We
investigate similarities and differences between optical and radio polarimetry,
in both degree of polarization and projected magnetic field direction. We also
examine the broadband spectral energy distribution of both the nucleus and jet
of 3C 264, from the radio through the X-rays. From this we place constraints on
the physics of the 3C 264 system, the jet and its dynamics. We find significant
curvature of the spectrum from the near-IR to ultraviolet, and synchrotron
breaks steeper than 0.5, a situation also encountered in the jet of M87. This
likely indicates velocity and/or magnetic field gradients and more efficient
particle acceleration localized in the faster/higher magnetic field parts of
the flow. The magnetic field structure of the 3C 264 jet is remarkably smooth;
however, we do find complex magnetic field structure that is correlated with
changes in the optical spectrum. We find that the X-ray emission is due to the
synchrotron process; we model the jet spectrum and discuss mechanisms for
accelerating particles to the needed energies, together with implications for
the orientation of the jet under a possible spine-sheath model.
