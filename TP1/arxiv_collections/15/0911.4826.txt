I briefly summarize neutrino oscillation results and discuss their
robustness. I mention recent attempts to understand the pattern of neutrino
mixing within various seesaw mechanisms, with or without supersymmetry and/or
flavor symmetries. I also mention the possibility of intrinsic supersymmetric
neutrino masses in the context of broken R parity models, showing how this
leads to clear tests at the LHC.
