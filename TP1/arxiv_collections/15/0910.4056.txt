Hunt and Sands (ESOP'08) studied a notion of information erasure for systems
which receive secrets intended for limited-time use. Erasure demands that once
a secret has fulfilled its purpose the subsequent behaviour of the system
should reveal no information about the erased data. In this paper we address a
shortcoming in that work: for erasure to be possible the user who provides data
must also play his part, but previously that role was only specified
informally. Here we provide a formal model of the user and a collection of
requirements called erasure friendliness. We prove that an erasure-friendly
user can be composed with an erasing system (in the sense of Hunt and Sands) to
obtain a combined system which is jointly erasing in an appropriate sense. In
doing so we identify stronger requirements on the user than those informally
described in the previous work.
