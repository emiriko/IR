Experimental studies of one nucleon knockout from magic nuclei suggest that
their nucleon orbits are not fully occupied. This conflicts a commonly accepted
view of the shell closure associated with such nuclei. The conflict can be
reconciled if the overlap between initial and final nuclear states in a
knockout reaction are calculated by a non-standard method. The method employs
an inhomogeneous equation based on correlation-dependent effective
nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions and allows the simplest wave functions, in
which all nucleons occupy only the lowest nuclear orbits, to be used. The
method also reproduces the recently established relation between reduction of
spectroscopic strength, observed in knockout reactions on other nuclei, and
nucleon binding energies. The implication of the inhomogeneous equation method
for the physical meaning of spectroscopic factors is discussed.
