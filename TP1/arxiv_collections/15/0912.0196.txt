Trapped, laser-cooled atoms and ions are quantum systems which can be
experimentally controlled with an as yet unmatched degree of precision. Due to
the control of the motion and the internal degrees of freedom, these quantum
systems can be adequately described by a well known Hamiltonian. In this
colloquium, we present powerful numerical tools for the optimization of the
external control of the motional and internal states of trapped neutral atoms,
explicitly applied to the case of trapped laser-cooled ions in a segmented
ion-trap. We then delve into solving inverse problems, when optimizing trapping
potentials for ions. Our presentation is complemented by a quantum mechanical
treatment of the wavepacket dynamics of a trapped ion. Efficient numerical
solvers for both time-independent and time-dependent problems are provided.
Shaping the motional wavefunctions and optimizing a quantum gate is realized by
the application of quantum optimal control techniques. The numerical methods
presented can also be used to gain an intuitive understanding of quantum
experiments with trapped ions by performing virtual simulated experiments on a
personal computer. Code and executables are supplied as supplementary online
