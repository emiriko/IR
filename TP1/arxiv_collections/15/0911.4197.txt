Methodology is presented for analysis of three-particle correlation functions
obtained in heavy ion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. We show that
harmonic correlations can be removed and jet driven correlations reliably
extracted. Results from detailed Monte Carlo simulations are used to
demonstrate the efficacy of this technique for the study of modifications to
away-side jet topologies. Such modifications are an essential probe of the
properties of the quark gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions.
