The first order antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) transition in
the functional material Fe49(Rh0.93Pd0.07)51 has been studied at low
temperatures and high magnetic fields. We have addressed the non-monotonic
variation of lower critical field required for FM to AFM transition. It is
shown that critically slow dynamics of the transition dominates below 50 K. At
low temperature and high magnetic field, state of the system depends on the
measurement history resulting in tunable coexistence of AFM and FM phases. By
following cooling and heating in unequal magnetic field (CHUF) protocol it is
shown that equilibrium state at 6 Tesla magnetic field is AFM state. Glass like
FM state at 6 T (obtained after cooling in 8 T) shows reentrant transition with
increasing temperature; viz. devitrification to AFM state followed by melting
to FM state.
