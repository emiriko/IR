The Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) silicon
tracking detectors (Tracker) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is a
software based system designed to monitor the detector and reconstruction
performance, to identify problems and to certify the collected data for physics
analysis. It uses the framework provided by the central CMS DQM as well as
tools developed especially for the CMS Tracker DQM. This paper describes aim,
framework conditions, tools and work flows of the CMS Tracker DQM and shows
examples of its successful use during the recent commissioning phase of the CMS
experiment.
