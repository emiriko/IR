We investigate the binding surface along the Bain path and phonon dispersion
relations for the cubic phase of the ferromagnetic binary alloys Fe3X (X = Ni,
Pd, Pt) for L12 and DO22 ordered phases from first principles by means of
density functional theory. The phonon dispersion relations exhibit a softening
of the transverse acoustic mode at the M-point in the L12-phase in accordance
with experiments for ordered Fe3Pt. This instability can be associated with a
rotational movement of the Fe-atoms around the Ni-group element in the
neighboring layers and is accompanied by an extensive reconstruction of the
Fermi surface. In addition, we find an incomplete softening in [111] direction
which is strongest for Fe3 Ni. We conclude that besides the valence electron
density also the specific Fe-content and the masses of the alloying partners
should be considered as parameters for the design of Fe-based functional
magnetic materials.
