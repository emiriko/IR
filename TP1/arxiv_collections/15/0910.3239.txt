We discuss two-dimensional mapping of the near-infrared emission-line
intensity distributions and kinematics of the narrow-line region (NLR) of NGC
4151, obtained with the Gemini Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrograph, with
a projected spatial resolution of ~8pc. The ionized gas intensity distribution
follows the projected bi-cone morphology observed in previous optical
narrow-band images, and its kinematics reveal outflows along the bi-cone. We
propose a kinematic model in which the gas in the NLR moves at a velocity of
~600 km s^-1 up to ~100 pc from the nucleus. A completely distinct morphology
and kinematic structure is observed for the molecular gas, which avoids the
region of the bi-cone and has velocities close to systemic, and is consistent
with an origin in the galaxy plane. The molecular gas thus traces the AGN
feeding, while the ionized gas traces its feedback.
