We consider the semiclassical Schr\"odinger operator $-h^2\partial_x^2+V(x)$
on a half-line, where $V$ is a compactly supported potential which is positive
near the endpoint of its support. We prove that the eigenvalues and the purely
imaginary resonances are symmetric up to an error $Ce^{-\delta/h}$.
