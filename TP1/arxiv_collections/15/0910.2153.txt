This report presents new four-round integral properties against the Rijndael
cipher with block sizes larger than 128 bits. Using higher-order multiset
distinguishers and other well-known extensions of those properties, the deduced
attacks reach up to 7 and 8 rounds of Rijndael variants with 160 up to 256-bit
blocks. For example, a 7-rounds attack against Rijndael-224 has a time
complexity equal to $2^{80}$.
