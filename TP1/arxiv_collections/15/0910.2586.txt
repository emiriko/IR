A full accounting of biological robustness remains elusive; both in terms of
the mechanisms by which robustness is achieved and the forces that have caused
robustness to grow over evolutionary time. Although its importance to topics
such as ecosystem services and resilience is well recognized, the broader
relationship between robustness and evolution is only starting to be fully
appreciated. A renewed interest in this relationship has been prompted by
evidence that mutational robustness can play a positive role in the discovery
of future adaptive innovations (evolvability) and evidence of an intimate
relationship between robustness and complexity in biology.
  This paper offers a new perspective on the mechanics of evolution and the
origins of complexity, robustness, and evolvability. Here we explore the
hypothesis that degeneracy, a partial overlap in the functioning of
multi-functional components, plays a central role in the evolution and
robustness of complex forms. In support of this hypothesis, we present evidence
that degeneracy is a fundamental source of robustness, it is intimately tied to
multi-scaled complexity, and it establishes conditions that are necessary for
system evolvability.
