The KArlsruhe TRitium Neutrino mass experiment, KATRIN, aims to search for
the mass of the electron neutrino with a sensitivity of 0.2 eV/c^2 (90% C.L.)
and a detection limit of 0.35 eV/c^2 (5 sigma). Both a positive or a negative
result will have far reaching implications for cosmology and the standard model
of particle physics and will give new input for astroparticle physics and
cosmology. The major components of KATRIN are being set up at the Karlsruhe
Institut of Technology in Karlsruhe, Germany, and test measurements of the
individual components have started. Data taking with tritium is scheduled to
start in 2012.
