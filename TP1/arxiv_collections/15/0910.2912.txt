The Universal Composability model (UC) by Canetti (FOCS 2001) allows for
secure composition of arbitrary protocols. We present a quantum version of the
UC model which enjoys the same compositionality guarantees. We prove that in
this model statistically secure oblivious transfer protocols can be constructed
from commitments. Furthermore, we show that every statistically classically UC
secure protocol is also statistically quantum UC secure. Such implications are
not known for other quantum security definitions. As a corollary, we get that
quantum UC secure protocols for general multi-party computation can be
constructed from commitments.
