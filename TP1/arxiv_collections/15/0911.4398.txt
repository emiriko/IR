Our recent neutron scattering measurements of phonons and magnons in solid
\alpha-oxygen have led us to a new understanding of the production mechanismen
of ultra-cold-neutrons (UCN) in this super-thermal converter. The UCN
production in solid \alpha-oxygen is dominated by the excitation of phonons.
The contribution of magnons to UCN production becomes only slightly important
above E >10 meV and at E >4 meV. Solid \alpha-oxygen is in comparison to solid
deuterium less effcient in the down-scattering of thermal or cold neutrons into
the UCN energy regime.
