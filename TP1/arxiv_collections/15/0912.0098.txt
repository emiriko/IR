A discussion of the time scales in the s process appears to be an approriate
aspect to discuss at the occasion of 70th anniversary of Roberto Gallino, the
more as this subject has been repeatedly addressed during the 20 years of
collaboration between Torino and Karlsruhe. The two chronometers presented in
this text were selected to illustrate the intense mutual stimulation of both
groups. Based on a reliable set of accurate stellar (n, gamma) cross sections
determined mostly at FZK, the Torino group succeeded to develop a comprehensive
picture of the various s-process scenarios, which are most valuable for
understanding the composition of the solar system as well as for the
interpretation of an increasing number of astronomical observations.
