We report on performance studies of the ATLAS detector obtained with first
single LHC (Large Hadron Collider) beam data in September 2008, and large
samples of cosmic ray events collected in the fall of 2008. In particular, the
performance of the calorimeter, crucial for jet and missing transverse energy
measurements, is studied. It is shown that the ATLAS experiment is ready to
record the first LHC collisions.
