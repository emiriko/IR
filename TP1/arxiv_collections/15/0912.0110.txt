In this paper we describe the detector components, triggers and analysis
techniques for flavor physics at the Tevatron experiments CDF and DO. As
Tevatron performs very well and runs at higher luminosities regularly we also
touch issues related to it and efforts to improve detectors and triggers for
such running.
