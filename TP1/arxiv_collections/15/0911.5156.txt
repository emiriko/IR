We provide a microphysical model that connects neutrino oscillations to dark
energy, which has predictions of Lorentz and CPT violating neutrino
oscillations. We argue that the DE is a BCS condensate of flavored neutrinos.
As neutrinos propigate in their own condensate they naturally have oscillations
proportional to the DE energy density. All that is assumed in this model is a
covariant coupling of neutrinos to gravity and a finite number density of
neutrinos in the cosmic rest frame; this situation yields an attractive channel
for the formation of a spin zero neutrino condensate leading to late time
acceleration self consistently. Moreover, the vacuum oscillation has two
predictions: (1) CPT violating oscillations proportional to the DE density (2)
A connection between the evolution of the equation of state of the DE
condensate and the neutrino oscillations. These predictions can be probed
independently with future Supernovae and Neutrino Telescopes.
