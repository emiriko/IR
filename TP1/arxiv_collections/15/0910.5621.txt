We present projected rotational velocity measurements of the red giant in the
symbiotic star MWC 560 (V694 Mon), using the high-resolution spectroscopic
observations with the FEROS spectrograph. We find that the projected rotational
velocity of the red giant is vsini = 8.2 +/- 1.5 km/s, and estimate its
rotational period to be P_rot = 144-306 days. Using the theoretical predictions
of tidal interaction and pseudosynchronization, we estimate the orbital
eccentricity e=0.68-0.82. We briefly discuss the connection of our results with
the photometric variability of the object.
