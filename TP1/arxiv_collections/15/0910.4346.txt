After more than six and half years in orbit, the ESA space observatory
INTEGRAL has provided new, exciting results in the soft gamma-ray energy range
(from a few keV to a few MeV). With the discovery of about 700 hard X-Ray
sources, it has changed our previous view of a sky composed of peculiar and
``monster'' sources. The new high energy sky is in fact full of a large variety
of normal, very energetic emitters, characterized by new accretion and
acceleration processes (see also IBIS cat4, Bird et al. 2009). If compared to
previous IBIS/ISGRI surveys it is clear that there is a continual increase in
the rate of discoveries of HMXB and AGN, including a variety of distant QSOs.
This is basically due to increased exposure away from the Galactic Plane, while
the percentage of sources without an identification has remained constant. At
the same time, about one GRB/month is detected and imaged by the two main
gamma-ray instruments on board: IBIS and SPI. INTEGRAL, after six and half
years of observations, has completed the Core Programme phase and is now fully
open to the scientific community for Open Time and Key Programme observations,
with AO7 recently announced by ESA. In this paper we review the major
achievements of the INTEGRAL Observatory in the field of Gamma Ray Bursts.
