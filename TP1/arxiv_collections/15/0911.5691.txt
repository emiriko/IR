Visible light photon counters (VLPCs) offer many attractive features as
photon detectors, such as high quantum efficiency and photon number resolution.
We report measurements of the single-photon timing jitter in a VLPC, a critical
performance factor in a time-correlated single-photon counting measurement, in
a fiber-coupled closed-cycle cryocooler. The measured timing jitter is 240 ps
full-width-at-half-maximum at a wavelength of 550 nm, with a dark count rate of
25 000 counts per second. The timing jitter increases modestly at longer
wavelengths to 300 ps at 1000 nm, and increases substantially at lower bias
voltages as the quantum efficiency is reduced.
