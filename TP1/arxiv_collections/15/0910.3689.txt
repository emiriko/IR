At present none of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models provides a
self-consistent description of observed trends for all iron-peak elements with
metallicity simultaneously. The question is whether the discrepancy is due to
deficiencies of GCE models, such as stellar yields, or due to erroneous
spectroscopically-determined abundances of these elements in metal-poor stars.
The present work aims at a critical reevaluation of the abundance trends for
several odd and even-Z Fe-peak elements, which are important for understanding
explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae.
