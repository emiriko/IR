A summary of recent calculations of Casimir forces between a collection of
$N$-dielectric spheres is presented. This is done by evaluating directly the
force on a sphere constructed from a stress tensor, rather than an interaction
energy. A loop integral formulation is also discussed where we rewrite the
expressions for the force in terms of loop integrals for the effective
classical propagation of the electric and magnetic fields.
