We describe the current status and the prospect for the development of
monolithic Ge:Ga array detector for SAFARI. Our goal is to develop a 64x64
array for the 45 -- 110 um band, on the basis of existing technologies to make
3x20 monolithic arrays for the AKARI satellite. For the AKARI detector we have
achieved a responsivity of 10 A/W and a read-out noise limited NEP (noise
equivalent power) of 10^-17 W/rHz. We plan to develop the detector for SAFARI
with technical improvements; significantly reduced read-out noise with newly
developed cold read-out electronics, mitigated spectral fringes as well as
optical cross-talks with a multi-layer antireflection coat. Since most of the
elemental technologies to fabricate the detector are flight-proven, high
technical readiness levels (TRLs) should be achieved for fabricating the
detector with the above mentioned technical demonstrations. We demonstrate some
of these elemental technologies showing results of measurements for test
coatings and prototype arrays.
