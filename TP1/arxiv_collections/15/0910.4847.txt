In Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 2245 (1998) an explicit expression for entanglement
of formation for any two qubit state was given. Based on this result we present
an expression for the Bures measure of entanglement for two qubit states. This
measure was proposed in Phys. Rev. A 57, 1619 (1998), where the authors showed
that it satisfies all properties every entanglement measure must have.
