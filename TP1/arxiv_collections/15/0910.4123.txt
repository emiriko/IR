We show that the periodic modulation of the Hamiltonian parameters for 1D
correlated fermionic systems can be used to parametrically amplify their
bosonic collective modes. Treating the problem within the Luttinger liquid
picture, we show how charge and spin density waves with different momenta are
simultaneously amplified. We discuss the implementation of our predictions for
cold atoms in 1D modulated optical lattices, showing that the fermionic
momentum distribution directly provides a clear signature of spin-charge
separation.
