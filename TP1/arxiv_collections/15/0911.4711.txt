We extend our previous work arXiv:1007.0053 on coherent-constructible
correspondence for toric varieties to include toric Deligne-Mumford (DM)
stacks. Following Borisov-Chen-Smith, a toric DM stack $\cX_\bSi$ is described
by a "stacky fan" $\bSi=(N,\Si,\beta)$, where $N$ is a finitely generated
abelian group and $\Si$ is a simplicial fan in $N_\bR=N\otimes_{\bZ}\bR$. From
$\bSi$ we define a conical Lagrangian $\Lambda_\bSi$ inside the cotangent
$T^*M_\bR$ of the dual vector space $M_\bR$ of $N_\bR$, such that
torus-equivariant, coherent sheaves on $\cX_\bSi$ are equivalent to
constructible sheaves on $M_\bR$ with singular support in $\LbS$.
