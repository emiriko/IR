We develop a new approach to build the eigenfunctions of a translationally
shape-invariant potential. For this we show that their logarithmic derivatives
can be expressed as terminating continued fractions in an appropriate variable.
We give explicit formulas for all the eigenstates, their specific form
depending on the Barclay-Maxwell class to which the considered potential
belongs.
