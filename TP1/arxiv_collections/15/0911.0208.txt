We consider some duality relations for models of non-interacting particles
hopping on disordered one-dimensional chains. In particular, we discuss
symmetries of bulk-driven barrier and trap models, and relations between
boundary-driven and equilibrium models with related energy landscapes. We
discuss the relationships between these duality relations and similar results
for interacting many-body systems.
