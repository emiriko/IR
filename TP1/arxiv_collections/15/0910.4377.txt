We investigated the temperature-dependent evolution of the electronic
structure of the Jeff,1/2 Mott insulator Sr2IrO4 using optical spectroscopy.
The optical conductivity spectra $\sigma(\omega)$ of this compound has recently
been found to exhibit two d-d transitions associated with the transition
between the Jeff,1/2 and Jeff,3/2 bands due to the cooperation of the electron
correlation and spin-orbit coupling. As the temperature increases, the two
peaks show significant changes resulting in a decrease in the Mott gap. The
experimental observations are compared with the results of first-principles
calculation in consideration of increasing bandwidth. We discuss the effect of
the temperature change on the electronic structure of Sr2IrO4 in terms of local
lattice distortion, excitonic effect, electron-phonon coupling, and magnetic
ordering.
