We investigate theoretically the effects of the Coulomb interaction and
spin-orbit interactions (SOIs) on the anisotropic transport property of
semiconductor quantum wires embedded in (110) plane. The anisotropy of the dc
conductivity can be enhanced significantly by the Coulomb interaction for
infinite-long quantum wires. But it is smeared out in quantum wires with finite
length, while the ac conductivity still shows anisotropic behavior, from which
one can detect and distinguish the strengths of the Rashba SOI and Dresselhaus
SOI.
