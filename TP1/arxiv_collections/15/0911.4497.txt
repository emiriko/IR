The fragmentation of alumina and glass plates due to lateral impact is
studied. A few hundred plates have been fragmented at different impact
velocities and the produced fragments are analyzed. The method employed in this
work allows one to investigate some geometrical properties of the fragments,
besides the traditional size distribution usually studied in former
experiments. We found that, although both materials exhibit qualitative similar
fragment size distribution function, their geometrical properties appear to be
quite different. A schematic model for two-dimensional fragmentation is also
presented and its predictions are compared to our experimental results. The
comparison suggests that the analysis of the fragments' geometrical properties
constitutes a more stringent test of the theoretical models' assumptions than
the size distribution.
