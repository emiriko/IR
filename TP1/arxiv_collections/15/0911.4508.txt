A long range Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) violating force between Dark
Matter (DM) particles, mediated by an ultralight scalar, is tightly constrained
by galactic dynamics and large scale structure formation. We examine the
implications of such a "dark force" for several terrestrial experiments,
including E\"otv\"os tests of the WEP and direct-detection DM searches. The
presence of a dark force implies a non-vanishing effect in E\"otv\"os tests
that could be probed by current and future experiments depending on the DM
model. For scalar singlet DM scenarios, a dark force of astrophysically
relevant magnitude is ruled out in large regions of parameter space by the DM
relic density and WEP constraints. WEP tests also imply constraints on the
Higgs-exchange contributions to the spin-independent (SI) DM-nucleus direct
detection cross-section. For WIMP scenarios, these considerations constrain
Higgs-exchange contributions to the SI cross-section to be subleading compared
to gauge-boson mediated contributions. The combination of observations from
galactic dynamics, large scale structure formation, E\"otv\"os experiments,
DM-direct-detection experiments, and colliders can further constrain the size
of new long range forces in the dark sector.
