The vector potential for the Ohmic heating coil system of a tokamak is
obtained in semi-analytical form. Comparison is made to the potential of a
simple, finite solenoid. In the quasi-static limit, the time rate of change of
the potential determines the induced electromotive force through the
Maxwell-Lodge effect. Discussion of the gauge constraint is included.
