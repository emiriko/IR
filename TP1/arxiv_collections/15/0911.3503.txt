In this paper, we give new explicit representations of the Hilbert scheme of
$\mu$ points in $\PP^{r}$ as a projective subvariety of a Grassmanniann
variety. This new explicit description of the Hilbert scheme is simpler than
the previous ones and global. It involves equations of degree $2$. We show how
these equations are deduced from the commutation relations characterizing
border bases. Next, we consider infinitesimal perturbations of an input system
of equations on this Hilbert scheme and describe its tangent space. We propose
an effective criterion to test if it is a flat deformation, that is if the
perturbed system remains on the Hilbert scheme of the initial equations. This
criterion involves in particular formal reduction with respect to border bases.
