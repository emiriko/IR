We measure the spatial clustering of galaxies as a function of their
morphological type at z~0.8, for the first time in a deep redshift survey with
full morphological information. This is obtained by combining high-resolution
HST imaging and VLT spectroscopy for about 8,500 galaxies to I_AB=22.5 with
accurate spectroscopic redshifts from the zCOSMOS-Bright redshift survey. At
this epoch, early-type galaxies already show a significantly stronger
clustering than late-type galaxies on all probed scales. A comparison to the
SDSS at z~0.1, shows that the relative clustering strength between early and
late morphological classes tends to increase with cosmic time at small
separations, while on large scales it shows no significant evolution since
z~0.8. This suggests that most early-type galaxies had already formed in
intermediate and dense environments at this epoch. Our results are consistent
with a picture in which the relative clustering of different morphological
types between z~1 and z~0, reflects the evolving role of environment in the
morphological transformation of galaxies, on top of the global mass-driven
evolution.
