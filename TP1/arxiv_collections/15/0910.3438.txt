In this fluid dynamics video, we demonstrate the experimental generation of
various internal wave fields using a novel wave generator. Specifically,
uni-directional internal wave beams and vertical modes 1 and 2 are generated
and visualized using Particle Image Velocimetry. Further details and analysis
of these experiments can be found in [1].
