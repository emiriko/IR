Thermodynamics is a well developed tool to study systems in equilibrium but
no such general framework is available for non-equilibrium processes. Only hope
for a quantitative description is to fall back upon the equilibrium language as
often done in biology. This gap is bridged by the work theorem. By using this
theorem we show that the Barkhausen-type non-equilibrium noise in a process,
repeated many times, can be combined to construct a special matrix ${\cal S}$
whose principal eigenvector provides the equilibrium distribution. For an
interacting system ${\cal S}$, and hence the equilibrium distribution, can be
obtained from the free case without any requirement of equilibrium.
