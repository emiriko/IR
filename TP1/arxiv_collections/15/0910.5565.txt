Within the Improved Quantum Molecular Dynamics (ImQMD) Model incorporating
the statistical decay Model, the reactions of U238+U238 at the energy of 7.0
AMeV have been studied. The charge, mass and excitation energy distributions of
primary fragments are investigated within the ImQMD model and de-excitation
processes of those primary fragments are described by the statistical decay
model. The mass distribution of the final products in U238+U238 collisions is
obtained and compared with the recent experimental data.
