We present an orthogonal basis of gauge invariant operators constructed from
some complex matrices for the free matrix field, where operators are expressed
with the help of Brauer algebra. This is a generalisation of our previous work
for a signle complex matrix. We also discuss the matrix quantum mechanics
relevant to N=4 SYM on S^{3} times R. A commuting set of conserved operators
whose eigenstates are given by the orthogonal basis is shown by using enhanced
symmetries at zero coupling.
