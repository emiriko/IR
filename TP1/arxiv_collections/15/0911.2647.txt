We study the transport properties of the quantum Hall bilayers systems
looking closely at the effect that disorder and electron-phonon interaction
have on the interlayer tunnelling current in the presence of an in-plane
magnetic field $B_\parallel$. We find that it is important to take into account
the effect of disorder and electron-phonon interactions in order to predict a
finite current at a finite voltage when an in-plane magnetic field is present.
We find a broadened resonant feature in the tunnelling current as a function of
bias voltage, in qualitative agreement with experiments. We also find the
broadening of this resonant feature due to electron-phonon coupling has a
non-monotonic dependence on $B_\parallel$, related to the geometry of the
double quantum well. We also compare this with the broadening effect due to
spatial fluctuations of the tunnelling amplitude. We conclude that such static
disorder provides only very weak broadening of the resonant feature in the
experimental range.
