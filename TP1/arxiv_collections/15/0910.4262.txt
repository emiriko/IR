We use photometric and spectroscopic observations of the eclipsing binary
V69-47 Tuc to derive the masses, radii, and luminosities of the component
stars. Based on measured systemic velocity, distance, and proper motion, the
system is a member of the globular cluster 47 Tuc. The system has an orbital
period of 29.5 d and the orbit is slightly eccentric with e=0.056. We obtain
Mp=0.8762 +- 0.0048 M(Sun), Rp=1.3148 +-0.0051 R(Sun), Lp=1.94 +- 0.21 L(Sun)
for the primary and Ms=0.8588 +- 0.0060 M(Sun), Rs=1.1616 +- 0.0062 R(Sun),
Ls=1.53 +- 0.17 L(Sun) for the secondary. These components of V69 are the first
Population II stars with masses and radii derived directly and with an accuracy
of better than 1%. We measure an apparent distance modulus of (m-M)v=13.35 +-
0.08 to V69. We compare the absolute parameters of V69 with five sets of
stellar evolution models and estimate the age of V69 using mass-luminosity-age,
mass-radius-age, and turnoff mass - age relations. The masses, radii, and
luminosities of the component stars are determined well enough that the
measurement of ages is dominated by systematic differences between the
evolutionary models, in particular, the adopted helium abundance. By comparing
the observations to Dartmouth model isochrones we estimate the age of V69 to be
11.25 +- 0.21(random) +- 0.85(systematic) Gyr assuming [Fe/H]=-0.70,
[alpha/Fe]=0.4, and Y=0.255. The determination of the distance to V69, and
hence to 47Tuc, can be further improved when infrared eclipse photometry is
obtained for the variable.
