The non-modal approach for a linearized system differs from a normal mode
analysis by following the temporal evolution of some perturbed equilibria, and
therefore includes transient effects. We employ a non-modal approach for
studying the stability of a bi-Maxwellian magnetized plasma using the Landau
fluid model, which we briefly describe. We show that bi-Maxwellian stable
equilibria can support transient growth of some physical quantities, and we
study how these transients behave when an equilibrium approaches its marginally
stable condition. This is relevant to anisotropic plasma, that are often
observed in the solar wind with a temperature anisotropy close to values that
can trigger a kinetic instability. The results obtained with a non-modal
approach are relevant to a re-examination of the concept of linear marginal
stability. Moreover, we discuss the topic of the dissipation of turbulent
fluctuations, suggesting that the non-modal approach should be included in
future studies.
