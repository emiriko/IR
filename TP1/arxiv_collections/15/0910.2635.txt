We investigate the suitability of natural orbitals as a basis for describing
many-body excitations. We analyze to which extend the natural orbitals describe
both bound as well as ionized excited states and show that depending on the
specifics of the excited state the ground-state natural orbitals yield a good
approximation or not. We show that the success of reduced density-matrix
functional theory in describing molecular dissociation lies in the flexibility
provided by fractional occupation numbers while the role of the natural
orbitals is minor.
