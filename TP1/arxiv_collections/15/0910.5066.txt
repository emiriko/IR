The form of the nuclear symmetry energy $E_s$ around saturation point density
leads to a different crust-core transition point in the neutron star and affect
the crust properties. We show that the knowledge about $E_s$ close to the
saturation point is not sufficient, because the very low density behaviour is
relevant. We also claim that crust properties are strongly influenced by the
very high density behavior of $E_s$, so in order to conclude about the form of
low density part of the symmetry energy one must isolate properly the high
density part.
