A set of necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the equivalence
of an arbitrary pure state and a graph state on n qubits under stochastic local
operations and classical communication (SLOCC), using the stabilizer formalism.
Because all stabilizer states are equivalent to a graph state by local unitary
transformations, these conditions constitute a classical algorithm for the
determination of SLOCC-equivalence of pure states and stabilizer states. This
algorithm provides a distinct advantage over the direct solution of the
SLOCC-equivalence condition for an unknown invertible local operator S, as it
usually allows for easy detection of states that are not SLOCC-equivalent to
graph states.
