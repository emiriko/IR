We study the asymptotic behavior of a self-interacting one-dimensional
Brownian polymer first introduced by Durrett and Rogers [Probab. Theory Related
Fields 92 (1992) 337--349]. The polymer describes a stochastic process with a
drift which is a certain average of its local time. We show that a smeared out
version of the local time function as viewed from the actual position of the
process is a Markov process in a suitably chosen function space, and that this
process has a Gaussian stationary measure. As a first consequence, this enables
us to partially prove a conjecture about the law of large numbers for the
end-to-end displacement of the polymer formulated in Durrett and Rogers
[Probab. Theory Related Fields 92 (1992) 337--349]. Next we give upper and
lower bounds for the variance of the process under the stationary measure, in
terms of the qualitative infrared behavior of the interaction function. In
particular, we show that in the locally self-repelling case (when the process
is essentially pushed by the negative gradient of its own local time) the
process is super-diffusive.
