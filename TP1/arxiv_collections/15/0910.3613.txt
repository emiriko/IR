Manipulating expressions in many-body perturbation theory becomes unwieldily
with increasing order of the perturbation theory. Here I derive a set of
theorems for efficient simplification of such expressions. The derived rules
are specifically designed for implementing with symbolic algebra tools. As an
illustration, we count the numbers of Brueckner-Goldstone diagrams in the first
several orders of many-body perturbation theory for matrix elements between two
states of a mono-valent system.
