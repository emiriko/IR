It is well-known that chiral symmetry breaking ($\chi$SB) in QCD with
$N_{f}=2$ light quark flavours can be described by orthogonal groups as $O(4)
\to O(3)$, due to local isomorphisms. Here we discuss the question how specific
this property is. We consider generalised forms of $\chi$SB involving an
arbitrary number of light flavours of continuum or lattice fermions, in various
representations. We search systematically for isomorphic descriptions by
non-unitary, compact Lie groups. It turns out that there are a few alternative
options in terms of orthogonal groups, while we did not find any description
entirely based on symplectic or exceptional Lie groups. If we adapt such an
alternative as the symmetry breaking pattern for a generalised Higgs mechanism,
we may consider a Higgs particle composed of bound fermions and trace back the
mass generation to $\chi$SB. In fact, some of the patterns that we encounter
appear in technicolour models. In particular if one observes a Higgs mechanism
that can be expressed in terms of orthogonal groups, we specify in which cases
it could also represent some kind of $\chi$SB of techniquarks.
