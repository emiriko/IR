On the basis of the physico-chemical principles underlying silver-staining of
proteins, which are recalled in this paper, several methods of silver-staining
of proteins after SDS electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels or isoelectric
focusing were tested. The most valuable protocols are presented in this report,
including standard methods for unsupported gels and new methods devised for
thin (0.5 mm) supported gels for SDS electrophoresis or isoelectric focusing
and for staining of small peptides. Generally speaking, the most rapid methods
were found to be less sensitive and less reproducible than more time-consuming
ones. Among the long methods, those using silver-diammine complex gave the most
uniform sensitivity. They require however special home-made gels and cannot be
applied to several electrophoretic systems (e.g. systems using tricine or
bicine as the trailing ion, or isoelectric focusing in immobilized pH
gradients). For these reasons, protocols based on silver nitrate are of a more
general use and might be favored. Future trends for silver-staining will also
be discussed.
