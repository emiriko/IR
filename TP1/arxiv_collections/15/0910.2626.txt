Designing and implementing comprehensive IT-based support environments for KM
in organizations is fraught with many problems. Solving them requires intimate
knowledge about the information usage in knowledge works and the scopes of
technology intervention. In this paper, the Task-oriented Organizational
Knowledge Management or TOKM, a design theory for building integrated IT
platforms for supporting organizational KM, is proposed. TOKM brings together
two apparently mutually exclusive practices of building KM systems, the
task-based approach and the generic or universalistic approach. In developing
the design, the information requirements of knowledge workers in light of an
information usage model of knowledge works is studied. Then the model is
extended to study possibilities of more advanced IT support and formulate them
in form of a set of meta-requirements. Following the IS design theory paradigm,
a set of artifacts are hypothesized to meet the requirements. Finally, a design
method, as a possible approach of building an IT-based integrated platform, the
Knowledge Work Support Platform (KWSP) to realize the artifacts in order to
meet the requirements, is outlined. The KWSP is a powerful platform for
building and maintaining a number of task-type specific Knowledge Work Support
Systems (KWSS) on a common sharable platform. Each KWSS, for the task-type
supported by it, can be easily designed to provide extensive and sophisticated
support to individual as well as group of knowledge workers in performing their
respective knowledge work instances
