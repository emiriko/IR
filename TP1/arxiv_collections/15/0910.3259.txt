The impact of a jet of droplets upon surfaces of varying hydrophobicity is
studied via high-speed imaging. Microstructures on silicone surfaces consisting
of cylindrical pillars of varying sizes and spacings are utilized to enhance
hydrophobicity. Comparison of droplet motion after impact with these
microstructured surfaces is contrasted with that noted for plain glass
(hydrophilic) and flat silicone surfaces. Fluid dynamics videos are captured at
6000 fps and played back at 30 fps over a field of view of 1.35 cm (height) X
2.7 cm (width) that is back-illuminated with an LED array for 800-micron
diameter droplets impinging the surfaces at 2.5 m/s with an angle of incidence
of 38 degrees (relative to the surface). Bouncing of droplets after impact is
not apparent for the glass and unstructured silicone cases, though many
droplets were observed to roll along the surface in the latter case which is
consistent with its slightly hydrophobic nature. In contrast, droplets were
found to both skip and bounce upon impacting the microstructured surfaces which
indicates a significant enhancement in hydrophobicity due to these surface
features.
