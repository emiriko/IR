A recently proposed test for chaos [Gottwald G A and Melbourne I 2004
\textit{Proc. R. Soc. London A} {\bf 460} 603-611] is employed to probe the
Hamiltonian dynamics of a one-dimensional anharmonic oscillator lattice. For a
homogeneous (uniform mass) lattice in the weakly chaotic regime and for a heavy
impurity embedded in the lattice, the results stemming from the time record of
the position and momentum of a single oscillator in the former case, and for
that same variables corresponding to the impurity in the latter, are
inconclusive to determine the dynamical regime of the system. This seemingly
odd behavior has its origin in the insufficient time series length employed.
Nevertheless, for both cases the necessary time record length needed to obtain
the correct result renders the test impractical. In particular, for the second
case, specially in the large system size limit (which is the physically
relevant one due to its connection with Brownian motion), the estimated length
of the position time series required by the test to correctly classify the
signal is beyond the reach of present-day computer capability. Thus our results
indicate that the proposed test, for the aforementioned cases of Hamiltonian
chaos, affords no clear advantage over conventional phase space reconstruction
methods.
