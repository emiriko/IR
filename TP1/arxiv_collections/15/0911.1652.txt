We consider bilinear oscillatory integrals, i.e. pseudo-product operators
whose symbol involves an oscillating factor. Lebesgue space inequalities are
established, which give decay as the oscillation becomes stronger ; this
extends the well-known linear theory of oscillatory integral in some
directions. The proof relies on a combination of time-frequency analysis of
Coifman-Meyer type with stationary and non-stationary phase estimates. As a
consequence of this analysis, we obtain Lebesgue estimates for new bilinear
multipliers defined by non-smooth symbols.
