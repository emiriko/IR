Identifying the Hamiltonian of a quantum system from experimental data is
considered. General limits on the identifiability of model parameters with
limited experimental resources are investigated, and a specific Bayesian
estimation procedure is proposed and evaluated for a model system where
a-priori information about the Hamiltonian's structure is available.
