About one-fourth of the universe is thought to consist of dark matter. Yet
there is no clear understanding about the nature of these particles. Commonly
discussed dark matter candidates includes the so called WIMPs or weakly
interacting massive particles with masses from about 10GeV to 1TeV. These
particles can gravitate to form a new class of objects in dark matter halos or
around the galactic centre. We study in some detail many properties of these
objects; which are dark matter dominated and bound by their self gravity; their
formation and possibilities of their detection. Implications of the presence of
such objects for star formation are also discussed. These objects could provide
the possibility of forming primordial black holes distinct from the usual
Hawking black holes and they could also provide a scenario for short duration
gamma ray bursts, avoiding the baryon load problem.
