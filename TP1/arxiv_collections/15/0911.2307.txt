The study of Entanglement of Formation of a mixed state of a bipartite system
in high-dimensional Hilbert space is not easy in general. So, we focus on
determining the amount of entanglement for a bipartite mixed state based on the
concept of decomposable optimal entanglement witness (DOEW), that can be
calculated as a minimum distance of an entangled state from the edge of
positive partial transpose (PPT) states which has the most negative (positive)
expectation value for non-PPT (bound) entangled states. We have constructed
DOEWs based on the convex optimization method, then by using of it we quantify
the degree of entanglement for two spin half particles under the Lorentz
transformations. For convenience, we restrict ourselves to 2D momentum subspace
and under this constraint when the momentum and the Lorentz boost are parallel,
we have shown that the entanglement is not relativistic invariant. Keywords :
