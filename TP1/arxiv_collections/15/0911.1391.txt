We discuss an approximation for the dynamic charge response of nonlinear
spin-1/2 Luttinger liquids in the limit of small momentum. Besides accounting
for the broadening of the charge peak due to two-holon excitations, the
nonlinearity of the dispersion gives rise to a two-spinon peak, which at zero
temperature has an asymmetric line shape. At finite temperature the spin peak
is broadened by diffusion. As an application, we discuss the density and
temperature dependence of the Coulomb drag resistivity due to long-wavelength
scattering between quantum wires.
