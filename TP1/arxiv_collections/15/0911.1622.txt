We discuss intensity effects in collisions between beams of optical photons
from a high-power laser and relativistic electrons. Our main focus are the
modifications of the emission spectra due to realistic finite-beam geometries.
By carefully analyzing the classical limit we precisely quantify the
distinction between strong-field QED Compton scattering and classical Thomson
scattering. A purely classical, but fully covariant, calculation of the
bremsstrahlung emitted by an electron in a plane wave laser field yields
radiation into harmonics, as expected. This result is generalized to pulses of
finite duration and explains the appearance of line broadening and harmonic
substructure as an interference phenomenon. The ensuing numerical treatment
confirms that strong focussing of the laser leads to a broad continuum while
higher harmonics become visible only at moderate focussing, hence lower
intensity. We present a scaling law for the backscattered photon spectral
density which facilitates averaging over electron beam phase space. Finally, we
propose a set of realistic parameters such that the observation of intensity
induced spectral red-shift, higher harmonics, and their substructure, becomes
feasible.
