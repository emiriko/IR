Aims. We study the geometry of the circumstellar environment of the B[e]
supergiant star GG Car. Methods. We present observations acquired using the
IAGPOL imaging polarimeter in combination with the Eucalyptus-IFU spectrograph
to obtain spectropolarimetric measurements of GG Car across Halpha at two
epochs. Polarization effects along the emission line are analysed using the Q-U
diagram. In particular, the polarization position angle (PA) obtained using the
line effect is able to constrain the symmetry axis of the disk/envelope.
Results. By analysing the fluxes, GG Car shows an increase in its double-peaked
Halpha line emission relative to the continuum within the interval of our
measurements (~43 days). The depolarization line effect around Halpha is
evident in the Q-U diagram for both epochs, confirming that light from the
system is intrinsically polarized. A rotation of the PA along Halpha is also
observed, indicating a counter-clockwise rotating disk. The intrinsic PA
calculated using the line effect (~85deg) is consistent between our two epochs,
suggesting a clearly defined symmetry axis of the disk.
