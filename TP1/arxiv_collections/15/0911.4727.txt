Sets of desirable gambles constitute a quite general type of uncertainty
model with an interesting geometrical interpretation. We give a general
discussion of such models and their rationality criteria. We study
exchangeability assessments for them, and prove counterparts of de Finetti's
finite and infinite representation theorems. We show that the finite
representation in terms of count vectors has a very nice geometrical
interpretation, and that the representation in terms of frequency vectors is
tied up with multivariate Bernstein (basis) polynomials. We also lay bare the
relationships between the representations of updated exchangeable models, and
discuss conservative inference (natural extension) under exchangeability and
the extension of exchangeable sequences.
