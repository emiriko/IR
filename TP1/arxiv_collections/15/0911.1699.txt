The available data on the forward charge exchange of nucleons on the deuteron
up to 2GeV per nucleon are reviewed. The value of the inclusive nd->pnn/np->pn
cross section ratio is sensitive to the fraction of spin-independent
neutron-proton backward scattering. The measurements of the polarisation
transfer in d(\vec{n},\vec{p})nn or the deuteron analysing power in
p(\vec{d},pp)n in high resolution experiments, where the final nn or pp pair
emerge at low excitation energy, depend upon the longitudinal and transverse
spin-spin np amplitudes. The relation between these types of experiments is
discussed and the results compared with predictions of the impulse
approximation model in order to see what new constraints they can bring to the
neutron-proton database.
