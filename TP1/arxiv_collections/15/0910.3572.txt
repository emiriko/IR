Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with DNA microarrays (ChIP-chip) is an
assay for DNA-protein-binding or post-translational chromatin/histone
modifications. As with all high-throughput technologies, it requires a thorough
bioinformatic processing of the data for which there is no standard yet. The
primary goal is the reliable identification and localization of genomic regions
that bind a specific protein. The second step comprises comparison of binding
profiles of functionally related proteins, or of binding profiles of the same
protein in different genetic backgrounds or environmental conditions.
Ultimately, one would like to gain a mechanistic understanding of the effects
of DNA binding events on gene expression. We present a free, open-source R
package Starr that, in combination with the package Ringo, facilitates the
comparative analysis of ChIP-chip data across experiments and across different
microarray platforms. Core features are data import, quality assessment,
normalization and visualization of the data, and the detection of ChIP-enriched
genomic regions. The use of common Bioconductor classes ensures the
compatibility with other R packages. Most importantly, Starr provides methods
for integration of complementary genomics data, e.g., it enables systematic
investigation of the relation between gene expression and dna binding.
