This note describes five subjects of some interest for the density functional
theory in nuclear physics. These are, respectively, i) the need for concave
functionals, ii) the nature of the Kohn-Sham potential for the radial density
theory, iii) a proper implementation of a density functional for an "intrinsic"
rotational density, iv) the possible existence of a potential driving the
square root of the density, and v) the existence of many models where a density
functional can be explicitly constructed.
