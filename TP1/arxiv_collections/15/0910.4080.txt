In this contribution, we summarize the results from an NLO computation of the
production of ttbb in hadronic collisions. The results are obtained by
combining two programs: Helac-1Loop, based on the OPP method and the reduction
code CutTools, for the virtual one-loop matrix elements and Helac-Dipoles for
the real-emission contributions. Selected numerical results are presented for
the LHC.
