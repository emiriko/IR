The general extreme limit of the double-Reissner-Nordstrom solution is worked
out in explicit analytical form involving prolate spheroidal coordinates. We
name it the combined Majumdar-Papapetrou-Bonnor field to underline the fact
that it contains as particular cases the two-body specialization of the
well-known Majumdar-Papapetrou solution and Bonnor's three-parameter
electrostatic field. To the latter we give a precise physical interpretation as
describing a pair of non-rotating extremal black holes with unequal masses and
unequal opposite charges kept apart by a strut, the absolute values of charges
exceeding the respective (positive) values of masses.
