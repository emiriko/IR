Here we present HST/ACS imaging, in the B and I bands, of the edge-on Sb/Sc
galaxy NGC 5170. Excluding the central disk region region, we detect a 142
objects with colours and sizes typical of globular clusters (GCs). Our main
result is the discovery of a `blue tilt' (a mass-metallicity relation), at the
3sigma level, in the metal-poor GC subpopulation of this Milky Way like galaxy.
The tilt is consistent with that seen in massive elliptical galaxies and with
the self enrichment model of Bailin & Harris. For a linear mass-metallicity
relation, the tilt has the form Z ~ L^{0.42 +/- 0.13}. We derive a total GC
system population of 600 +/- 100, making it much richer than the Milky Way.
However when this number is normalised by the host galaxy luminosity or stellar
mass it is similar to that of M31. Finally, we report the presence of a
potential Ultra Compact Dwarf of size ~ 6 pc and luminosity M_I ~ -12.5,
assuming it is physically associated with NGC 5170.
