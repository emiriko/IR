The eclipsing low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1822-371 is the prototypical accretion
disk corona (ADC) system. We have obtained new time-resolved UV spectroscopy of
4U 1822-371 with the Advanced Camera for Surveys/Solar Blind Channel (ACS/SBC)
on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and new V- and J-band photometry with the
1.3-m SMARTS telescope at CTIO. We use the new data to construct its UV/optical
spectral energy distribution and its orbital light curve in the UV, V, and J
bands. We derive an improved ephemeris for the optical eclipses and confirm
that the orbital period is changing rapidly, indicating extremely high rates of
mass flow in the system; and we show that the accretion disk in the system has
a strong wind with projected velocities up to 4000 km/s.
  We show that the disk has a vertically-extended, optically-thick component at
optical wavelengths.This component extends almost to the edge of the disk and
has a height equal to ~0.5 of the disk radius. As it has a low brightness
temperature, we identify it as the optically-thick base of a disk wind, not as
the optical counterpart of the ADC. Like previous models of 4U 1822-371, ours
needs a tall obscuring wall near the edge of the accretion disk, but we
interpret the wall as a layer of cooler material at the base of the disk wind,
not as a tall, luminous disk rim.
