We forward here the case that the anomalous electron states found in cuprate
superconductors and related systems are rooted in a deeply non-classical
fermion sign structure. The collapse of Mottness as advocated by Phillips and
supported by recent DCA results on the Hubbard model is setting the necessary
microscopic conditions. The crucial insight is due to Weng who demonstrated
that in the presence of Mottness the fundamental workings of quantum statistics
changes and we will elaborate on the effects of this Weng statistics with an
emphasis on characterizing these further using numerical methods. The pseudogap
physics of the underdoped regime appears as a consequence of the altered
statistics and the profound question is how to connect this by a continuous
quantum phase transition to the overdoped regime ruled by normal Fermi-Dirac
statistics. Proof of principle follows from
  Ceperley's constrained path integral formalism where states can be explicitly
constructed showing a merger of
  Fermi-Dirac sign structure and scale invariance of the quantum dynamics.
