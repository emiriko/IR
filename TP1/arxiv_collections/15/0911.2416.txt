By proposing a paradox between the impossibility of superluminal signal
transfer and the normalization condition of wavefunctions, we predict that when
a change happens to the conditions that determining the status of a quantum
system, the system will show no response to this change at all, until after a
certain time interval. Otherwise either special relativity or quantum mechanics
will be violated. As a consequence, no physical process can actually happen
within Planck time. Therefore time is discrete, with Planck time being the
smallest unit. More intriguingly, systems with a larger size and a slower speed
will have a larger unit of time. Unlike many other interpretations of the
discreteness of time, our proof can be tested, at less partly, by experiments.
Our result also sets a limit on the speed of computers, and gives instruction
to the search of quantum gravity theories.
