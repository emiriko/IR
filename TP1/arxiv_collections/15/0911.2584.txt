We discuss the calculation of Casimir forces between a collection of
$N$-dielectric spheres. This is done by evaluating directly the force on a
sphere constructed from a stress tensor, rather than an interaction energy. Two
and three body forces between the spheres are evaluated for setups of two and
three sphere systems respectively. An approximate large-$N$ limit is also
obtained for the functional dependence on the number of spheres.
