We give a pedagogical introduction (suitable to upper level physics
undergraduates) to the field of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. We pay
particular attention to our understanding of the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic
properties of the matter created in heavy ion collisions at RHIC energies.
