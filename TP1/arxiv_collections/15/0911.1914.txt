Two techniques of measurements of thin film magnetostriction are compared:
direct, when changes of the substrate curvature caused by the film
magnetization are controlled, and inverse ("indirect"), when the modification
of the magnetic anisotropy induced by the substrate deformation (usually
bending) is measured. We demonstrate how both the elastic strength of the
substrate and the effective magneto-mechanical coupling between the substrate
deformation and magnetic anisotropy of the film depend on different conditions
of bending. Equations to be used for magnetostriction value determination in
typical cases are given and critical parameters for the corresponding
approximations are identified.
