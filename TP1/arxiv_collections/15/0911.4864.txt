We report on the electrical and functional characterization of 3D
Double-side, Double-Type-Column (3D- DDTC) detectors fabricated on p-type
substrates. Results relevant to detectors in the diode, strip and pixel
configurations are presented, and demonstrate a clear improvement in the charge
collection performance compared to the first prototypes of these detectors.
