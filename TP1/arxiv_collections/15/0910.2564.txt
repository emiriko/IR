The random-dimer model is probably the most popular model for a
one-dimensional disordered system where correlations are responsible for
delocalization of the wave functions. This is the primary model used to justify
the insulator-metal transition in conducting polymers and in DNA. However, for
such systems, the localization-delocalization regimes have only been observed
by deeply modifying the system itself, including the correlation function of
the disordered potential. In this article, we propose to use an ultracold
atomic mixture to cross the transition simply by externally tuning the
interspecies interactions, and without modifying the impurity correlations.
