In Ref. [1] one of the authors proposed postulates for axiomatizing Quantum
Mechanics as a "fair operational framework", namely regarding the theory as a
set of rules that allow the experimenter to predict future events on the basis
of suitable tests, having local control and low experimental complexity. In
addition to causality, the following postulates have been considered: PFAITH
(existence of a pure preparationally faithful state), and FAITHE (existence of
a faithful effect). These postulates have exhibited an unexpected theoretical
power, excluding all known nonquantum probabilistic theories. Later in Ref. [2]
in addition to causality and PFAITH, postulate LDISCR (local discriminability)
and PURIFY (purifiability of all states) have been considered, narrowing the
probabilistic theory to something very close to Quantum Mechanics. In the
present paper we test the above postulates on some nonquantum probabilistic
models. The first model, "the two-box world" is an extension of the
Popescu-Rohrlich model, which achieves the greatest violation of the CHSH
inequality compatible with the no-signaling principle. The second model "the
two-clock world" is actually a full class of models, all having a disk as
convex set of states for the local system. One of them corresponds to the "the
two-rebit world", namely qubits with real Hilbert space. The third model--"the
spin-factor"--is a sort of n-dimensional generalization of the clock. Finally
the last model is "the classical probabilistic theory". We see how each model
violates some of the proposed postulates, when and how teleportation can be
achieved, and we analyze other interesting connections between these postulate
violations, along with deep relations between the local and the non-local
structures of the probabilistic theory.
