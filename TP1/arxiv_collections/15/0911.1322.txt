Publication statistics are ubiquitous in the ratings of scientific
achievement, with citation counts and paper tallies factoring into an
individual's consideration for postdoctoral positions, junior faculty, tenure,
and even visa status for international scientists. Citation statistics are
designed to quantify individual career achievement, both at the level of a
single publication, and over an individual's entire career. While some academic
careers are defined by a few significant papers (possibly out of many), other
academic careers are defined by the cumulative contribution made by the
author's publications to the body of science. Several metrics have been
formulated to quantify an individual's publication career, yet none of these
metrics account for the dependence of citation counts and journal size on time.
In this paper, we normalize publication metrics across both time and discipline
in order to achieve a universal framework for analyzing and comparing
scientific achievement. We study the publication careers of individual authors
over the 50-year period 1958-2008 within six high-impact journals: CELL, the
New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Nature, the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Science (PNAS), Physical Review Letters (PRL), and Science. In
comparing the achievement of authors within each journal, we uncover
quantifiable statistical regularity in the probability density function (pdf)
of scientific achievement across both time and discipline. The universal
distribution of career success within these arenas for publication raises the
possibility that a fundamental driving force underlying scientific achievement
is the competitive nature of scientific advancement.
