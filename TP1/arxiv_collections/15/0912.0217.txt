In the presence of the T-parity violating Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) anomaly
term, the otherwise stable heavy photon A_H in the Littlest Higgs model with
T-parity (LHT) decays to either Standard Model (SM) gauge boson pairs, or to SM
fermions via loop diagrams. We make a detailed study of the collider signatures
where the A_H can be reconstructed from invariant mass peaks in the opposite
sign same flavor dilepton or the four-lepton channels. This enables us to
obtain information about the fundamental symmetry breaking scale f in the LHT
and thereby the low-lying mass spectrum of the theory. In addition, indication
of the presence of the WZW term gives us hints of the possible UV completion of
the LHT via strong dynamics. The crucial observation is that the sum of all
production processes of heavy T-odd quark pairs has a sizeable cross-section at
the LHC and these T-odd particles eventually all cascade decay down to the
heavy photon A_H. We show that for certain regions of the parameter space with
either a small f of around 500 GeV or relatively light T-odd quarks with a mass
of around 400 GeV, one can reconstruct the A_H even at the early LHC run with
\sqrt{s}=10 TeV and a modest integrated luminosity of 200 pb^{-1}. At \sqrt{s}
= 14 TeV and with an integrated luminosity of 30 fb^{-1}, it is possible to
cover a large part of the typical parameter space of the LHT, with the scale f
up to 1.5 TeV and with T-odd quark masses almost up to 1 TeV. In this region of
the parameter space, the mass of the reconstructed A_H ranges from 66 GeV to
230 GeV.
