We discuss the factorization breaking observed in diffractive dijet
photoproduction by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations at HERA. By considering the
effects of rapidity gap survival, hadronisation, migration and NLO
contributions, we find that the observed data are compatible with theoretical
expectations.
