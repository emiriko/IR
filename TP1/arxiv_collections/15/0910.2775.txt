We propose methods to create fractional vortices in the cyclic state of an F
= 2 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate by manipulating its internal spin structure
using pulsed microwave and laser fields. The stability of such vortices is
studied as a function of the rotation frequency of the confining harmonic trap
both in pancake and cigar shaped condensates. We find a range of parameters for
which the so-called 1/3-vortex state is energetically favorable. Such
fractional vortices could be created in condensates of 87Rb atoms using current
experimental techniques facilitating probing of topological defects with
non-Abelian statistics.
