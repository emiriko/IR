The new YBaCuO superconductors are synthesized by using the standard solid
state reaction method as Y5-6-11, Y7-9-16, Y5-8-13, Y7-11-18, Y156, Y3-8-11,
and Y13-20-23. We find that all material obtained are shown the Meissner effect
at 77 K. The resistivity measurements are used by the four-probe method .The
  Y 7-11-18 has the highest onset as 109 K . The XRD spectra are shown that
they have the same crystal structure as Y123 with some impurities peaks .
