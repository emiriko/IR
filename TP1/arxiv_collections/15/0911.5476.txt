We present new brightness and magnetic images of the weak-line T Tauri star
V410 Tau, made using data from the NARVAL spectropolarimeter at Telescope
Bernard Lyot (TBL). The brightness image shows a large polar spot and
significant spot coverage at lower latitudes. The magnetic maps show a field
that is predominantly dipolar and non-axisymmetric with a strong azimuthal
component. The field is 50% poloidal and 50% toroidal, and there is very little
differential rotation apparent from the magnetic images.
  A photometric monitoring campaign on this star has previously revealed V-band
variability of up to 0.6 magnitudes but in 2009 the lightcurve is much flatter.
The Doppler image presented here is consistent with this low variability.
Calculating the flux predicted by the mapped spot distribution gives an
peak-to-peak variability of 0.04 magnitudes. The reduction in the amplitude of
the lightcurve, compared with previous observations, appears to be related to a
change in the distribution of the spots, rather than the number or area.
  This paper is the first from a Zeeman-Doppler imaging campaign being carried
out on V410 Tau between 2009-2012 at TBL. During this time it is expected that
the lightcurve will return to a high amplitude state, allowing us to ascertain
whether the photometric changes are accompanied by a change in the magnetic
field topology.
