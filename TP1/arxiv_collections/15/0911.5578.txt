We estimate the detection efficiency of binary gravitational lensing events
through the channel of high-magnification events. From this estimation, we find
that binaries in the separations ranges of 0.1 < s < 10, 0.2 < s < 5, and 0.3 <
s < 3 can be detected with ~ 100% efficiency for events with magnifications
higher than A=100, 50, and 10, respectively, where s represents the projected
separation between the lens components normalized by the Einstein radius. We
also find that the range of high efficiency covers nearly the whole mass-ratio
range of stellar companions. Due to the high efficiency in wide ranges of
parameter space, we point out that majority of binary-lens events will be
detected through the high-magnification channel in lensing surveys that focus
on high-magnification events for efficient detections of microlensing planets.
In addition to the high efficiency, the simplicity of the efficiency estimation
makes the sample of these binaries useful in the statistical studies of the
distributions of binary companions as functions of mass ratio and separation.
We also discuss other importance of these events.
