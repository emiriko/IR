We present a detailed analysis of the fluctuation dissipation theorem (FDT)
close to the glass transition in colloidal suspensions under steady shear using
mode coupling approximations. Starting point is the many-particle Smoluchowski
equation. Under shear, detailed balance is broken and the response functions in
the stationary state are smaller at long times than estimated from the
equilibrium FDT. An asymptotically constant relation connects response and
fluctuations during the shear driven decay, restoring the form of the FDT with,
however, a ratio different from the equilibrium one. At short times, the
equilibrium FDT holds. We follow two independent approaches whose results are
in qualitative agreement. To discuss the derived fluctuation dissipation
ratios, we show an exact reformulation of the susceptibility which contains not
the full Smoluchowski operator as in equilibrium, but only its well defined
Hermitian part. This Hermitian part can be interpreted as governing the
dynamics in the frame comoving with the probability current. We present a
simple toy model which illustrates the FDT violation in the sheared colloidal
system.
