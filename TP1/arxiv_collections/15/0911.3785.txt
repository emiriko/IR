X-ray data analysis have found that fairly complex structures at cluster
centres are more common than expected. Many of these structures have similar
morphologies, which exhibit spiral-like substructure. It is not yet well known
how these structures formed or are maintained. Understanding the origin of
these spiral-like features at the centre of some clusters is the major
motivation behind this work. We analyse deep \textit{Chandra} observations of
15 nearby galaxy clusters (0.01 $ < z < $ 0.06), and use X-ray temperature and
substructure maps to detect small features at the cores of the clusters. We
detect spiral-like features at the centre of 7 clusters: A85, A426, A496, Hydra
A cluster, Centaurus, Ophiuchus, and A4059. These patterns are similar to those
found in numerical hydrodynamic simulations of cluster mergers with non-zero
impact parameter. In some clusters of our sample, a strong radio source also
occupies the inner region of the cluster, which indicates a possible connection
between the two. Our investigation implies that these spiral-like structures
may be caused by off-axis minor mergers. Since these features occur in regions
of high density, they may confine radio emission from the central galaxy
producing, in some cases, unusual radio morphology.
