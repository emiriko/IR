A wide range of experiments have established that certain chemical reactions
at metal surfaces can be driven by multiple hot electron mediated excitations
of adsorbates. A high transient density of hot electrons is obtained by means
of femtosecond laser pulses and a characteristic feature of such experiments is
the emergence of a power law dependence of the reaction yield on the laser
fluence $Y\sim F^n$. We propose a model of multiple inelastic scattering by hot
electrons, which reproduces this power law and the experimentally found
exponents of several experiments. All parameters are calculated within Density
Functional Theory and the Delta Self-Consistent Field method. With a simplified
assumption, the power law becomes exact and we obtain a simple and very useful
physical interpretation of the exponent $n$, which represents the number of
adsorbate vibrational states participating in the reaction.
