The spin symmetry of anti-Lambda spectrum in nucleus $^{16}$O has been
studied in the relativistic mean field theory. The spin-orbit splittings of
spin doublets are found to be around 0.03-0.07 MeV and the dominant components
of the Dirac spinor for the anti-Lambda spin doublets are found to be near
identical. It indicates that there is an even better spin symmetry in the
anti-Lambda spectrum than that in the anti-nucleon spectrum.
