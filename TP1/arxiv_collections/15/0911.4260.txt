We study the exact solutions of a class of integrable Henon-Heiles-type
systems (according to the analysis of Bountis et al. (1982)). These solutions
are expressed in terms of two-dimensional Kleinian functions. Special periodic
solutions are expressed in terms of the well-known Weierstrass function. We
extend some of our results to a generalized Henon-Heiles-type system with n+1
degrees of freedom.
