We study the single-particle Green function for a two-dimensional
superconductor in a regime of strong classical phase fluctuations. Although the
developed approach is valid for any symmetry, we concentrate on d-wave
superconductors. We obtain analytical expressions for the Green function below
the transition temperature and have worked out a way to extrapolate it for a
finite temperatures above $T_c$. Along with analytical expressions for a
certain limits of parameters we outline the qualitative features of the
spectral function.
