Tetragonal ferroelectric/ferroelectric BaTiO3/PbTiO3 superlattice under
uniaxial tensile stress along the c axis is investigated from first principles.
We show that the calculated ideal tensile strength is 6.85 GPa and that the
superlattice under the loading of uniaxial tensile stress becomes soft along
the nonpolar axes. We also find that the appropriately applied uniaxial tensile
stress can significantly enhance the piezoelectricity for the superlattice,
with piezoelectric coefficient d33 increasing from the ground state value by a
factor of about 8, reaching 678.42 pC/N. The underlying mechanism for the
enhancement of piezoelectricity is discussed.
