We provide physically intuitive mechanisms for the effect of noise on
excitation energy transfer (EET) in networks. Using these mechanisms of
dephasing-assisted transport (DAT) in a hybrid basis of both excitons and
sites, we develop a detailed picture of how noise enables energy transfer with
efficiencies well above $90%$ across the Fenna-Matthew-Olson (FMO) complex, a
type of light harvesting molecule. We demonstrate explicitly how noise alters
the pathways of energy transfer across the complex, suppressing ineffective
pathways and facilitating direct ones to the reaction centre. We explain that
the fundamental mechanisms underpinning DAT are expected to be robust with
respect to the considered noise model but show that the specific details of the
exciton-phonon coupling, which remain largely unknown in these type of
complexes, and in particular the impact of non-Markovian effects, results in
variations of dynamical features that should be amenable to experimental
verification within current or planned technology. A detailed understanding of
DAT in natural compounds should open up a new paradigm of `noise-engineering'
by which EET can be optimized in artificial light-harvesting structures.
