Quantum systems that have never interacted can become nonlocally correlated
through a process called entanglement swapping. To characterize nonlocality in
this context, we introduce local models where quantum systems that are
initially uncorrelated are described by uncorrelated local variables. While a
pair of maximally entangled qubits prepared in the usual way (i.e., emitted
from a common source) requires a visibility close to 70% to violate a Bell
inequality, we show that an entangled pair generated through entanglement
swapping will already violate a Bell inequality for visibilities as low as 50%
under our assumption.
