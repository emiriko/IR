Let k denote a perfect field of characteristic 5. We show that the versal
deformation ring of an element of order 5 and Hasse conductor 2 as automorphism
of a ring of formal power series k[[t]] computed by Bertin and Mezard, is in
fact universal. This provides the first example of a non trivial universal
deformation ring in higher conductor.
