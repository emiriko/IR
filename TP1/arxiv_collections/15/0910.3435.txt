We provide an analytical description of the dynamics of an atom in an optical
lattice using the method of perturbative adiabatic expansion. A precise
understanding of the lattice-atom interaction is essential to taking full
advantage of the promising applications that optical lattices offer in the
field of atom interferometry. One such application is the implementation of
Large Momentum Transfer (LMT) beam splitters that can potentially provide
multiple order of magnitude increases in momentum space separations over
current technology. We also propose interferometer geometries where optical
lattices are used as waveguides for the atoms throughout the duration of the
interferometer sequence. Such a technique could simultaneously provide a
multiple order of magnitude increase in sensitivity and a multiple order of
magnitude decrease in interferometer size for many applications as compared to
current state-of-the-art atom interferometers.
