We perform a fully relativistic calculation of the $^2 H(e,e'\vec p)n$
reaction in the impulse approximation employing the Gross equation to describe
the deuteron ground state, and we use the SAID parametrization of the full NN
scattering amplitude to describe the final state interactions (FSIs). The
formalism for treating the ejectile polarization with a spin projection on an
arbitrary axes is discussed. We show results for the six relevant asymmetries
and discuss the role of spin-dependent FSI contributions.
