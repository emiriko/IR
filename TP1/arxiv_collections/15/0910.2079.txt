We apply the covariant anomaly cancellation method to compute the Hawking
fluxes from the event and cosmic horizons of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black
hole. The derivation is new from the existing ones as we split the space in
three different regions (near to and away from the event and cosmic horizons)
and write down the covariant energy-momentum tensor using three step functions
which covers the whole region leading elegantly to the conditions required to
compute the Hawking fluxes from the event and cosmic horizons.
