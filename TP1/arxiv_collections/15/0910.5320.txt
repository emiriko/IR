We discuss O(alpha_s) spin effects in e+ e- -> q qbar (g) for the
polarization of single quarks and for spin-spin correlations of the final state
quarks. Particular attention is paid to residual mass effects in the limit m_q
-> 0 which are described in terms of universal helicity flip and helicity
non-flip contributions.
