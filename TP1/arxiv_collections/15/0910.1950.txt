We study the non-equilibrium dynamics in a mesoscopic graphene ring excited
by picoseconds shaped electromagnetic pulses. We predict an ultrafast buildup
of charge polarization, currents and orbital magnetization. Applying the light
pulses identified here, non-equilibrium valley currents are generated in a
graphene ring threaded by a stationary magnetic flux. We predict a finite
graphene ring magnetization even for a vanishing charge current; the
magnetization emerges due to the light-induced difference of the valley
populations.
