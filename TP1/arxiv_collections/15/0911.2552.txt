We review our recent studies of the globular cluster system of NGC 5128.
First, we have obtained low-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopy of 72
globular clusters using Gemini-S/GMOS to obtain the ages, metallicities, and
the level of alpha enrichment of the metal-poor and metal-rich globular cluster
subpopulations. Second, we have explored the rotational signature and velocity
dispersion of the galaxy's halo using over 560 globular clusters with radial
velocity measurements. We have also compared the dependence of these properties
on galactocentric distance and globular cluster age and metallicity. Using
globular clusters as tracer objects, we have analyzed the mass, and M/L ratio
of NGC 5128. Last, we have measured the structural parameters, such as
half-light radii, of over 570 globular clusters from a superb 1.2 square degree
Magellan/IMACS image. We will present the findings of these studies and discuss
the connection to the formation and evolution of NGC 5128.
