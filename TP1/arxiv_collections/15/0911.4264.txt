The exact structure of edge modes in `hole conjugate' fractional quantum Hall
states remains an unsolved issue despite significant experimental and
theoretical efforts devoted to their understanding. Recently, there has been a
surge of interest in such studies led by the search for neutral modes, which in
some cases may lead to exotic statistical properties of the excitations. In
this letter we report on detailed measurements of shot noise, produced by
partitioning of the more familiar 2/3 state. We find a fractional charge of
(2/3)e at the lowest temperature, decreasing to e/3 at an elevated temperature.
Surprisingly, strong shot noise had been measured on a clear 1/3 plateau upon
partitioning the 2/3 state. This behavior suggests an uncommon picture of the
composite edge channels quite different from the accepted one.
