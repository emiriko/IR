We review the current status of D0-antiD0 mixing, with special emphasis in
the most recent results. We begin with a discussion of charm mixing and CP
violation phenomenology, the evolution with the decay proper time, and physics
processes contributing to these. Then we follow with the summary of the main
experimental techniques and the results in the various final states. We make
use of the analysis reporting the first evidence of D0-antiD0 mixing by BaBar
in D0 -> K+ pi- decays as a textbook example, and then we discuss the results
from other two-body and three-body final states. We conclude with the
combination of all experimental results. Time-integrated CP violation
measurements are not discussed here.
