The ability to represent scientific data and concepts visually is becoming
increasingly important due to the unprecedented exponential growth of
computational power during the present digital age. The data sets and
simulations scientists in all fields can now create are literally thousands of
times as large as those created just 20 years ago. Historically successful
methods for data visualization can, and should, be applied to today's huge data
sets, but new approaches, also enabled by technology, are needed as well.
Increasingly, "modular craftsmanship" will be applied, as relevant
functionality from the graphically and technically best tools for a job are
combined as-needed, without low-level programming.
