We discuss possible inhomogeneous phases in two regions of the QCD phase
diagram: We begin with color superconducting quark matter at moderately high
densities, which is an imbalanced Fermi system due to the finite strange quark
mass and neutrality constraints. Within an NJL-type toy model we find that this
situation could lead to the formation of a soliton lattice. Similar solutions
also exist in the context of the chiral phase transition. As an interesting
result, the first-order transition line in the phase diagram of homogeneous
phases gets replaced by an inhomogeneous phase which is bordered by two
second-order transition lines.
