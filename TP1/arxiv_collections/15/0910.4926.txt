The universal quantum work relation connects a functional of an arbitrary
observable averaged over the forward process to the free energy difference and
another functional averaged over the time-reversed process. Here, we ask the
question if the system is driven out of equilibrium by a different Hamiltonian
rather than the original one during the forward process and similarly during
the reversed process then how accurate is the quantum work relation. We present
an inequality that must be satisfied when the system is driven out by such a
trial Hamiltonian. This also answers the issue of accuracy of the Jarzynski
relation with a trial Hamiltonian. We have shown that the correction term can
be expressed as the averages of the difference operator between the accurate
and trial Hamiltonians. This leads to a generalized version of the Bogoliubov
inequality for the free energy differences.
