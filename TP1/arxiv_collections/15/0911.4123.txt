If general relativity is an emergent phenomenon, there may be small
violations of diffeomorphism invariance. We propose a phenomenology of
perturbatively small violations of general relativity by the inclusion of terms
which break general covariance. These can be tested by matching to the
Parametrized Post Newtonian (PPN) formalism. The most sensitive tests involve
pulsar timing and provide an extremely strong bound, with a dimensionless
constraint of order 10^{-20} relative to gravitational strength.
