Partial Split Supersymmetry with violation of R-parity as a model for
neutrino masses is explored. It is shown that at the one-loop level the model
can give predictions that are in agreement with all present experimental values
for the neutrino sector. An analytical result is that the small solar neutrino
mass difference can be naturally explained in the decoupling limit for the
heavy Higgs mass eigenstates.
