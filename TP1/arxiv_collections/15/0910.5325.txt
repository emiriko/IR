During the period July 2007 - January 2009, the AGILE satellite, together
with several other space- and ground-based observatories monitored the activity
of the flat-spectrum radio quasar 3C 454.3, yielding the longest
multiwavelength coverage of this gamma-ray quasar so far. The source underwent
an unprecedented period of very high activity above 100 MeV, a few times
reaching gamma-ray flux levels on a day time scale higher than F=400 x 10^-8 ph
cm^-2 s^-1, in conjunction with an extremely variable behavior in the optical
R-band, even of the order of several tenth of magnitude in few hours, as shown
by the GASP-WEBT light curves. We present the results of this long term
multiwavelength monitoring campaign, with particular emphasis on the study of
possible lags between the different wavebands, and the results of the modeling
of simultaneous spectral energy distributions at different levels of activity.
