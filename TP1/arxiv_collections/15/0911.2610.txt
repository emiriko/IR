The first paper: We describe principles of new cybernetics and use these
principles for resolution of basic physical paradoxes. It demonstrates
universality of the principles of new cybernetics.
  The second paper: recent letter by Maccone presents a solution based on the
existing laws of quantum mechanics to the arrow-of-time dilemma. He argues that
all phenomena in which the entropy decreases must not leave any information (in
the observer's memory) of their having occurred because the observer is a part
of the whole system. Maccone concludes that quantum mechanics is necessary to
his argument, which he believes does not otherwise work in classical mechanics.
This Comment consists of four parts. We discuss the basic problems in the first
part. This Comment and the previously published Comment by Jennings and Rudolph
describes flaws in Maccone's arguments. However, the main argument (erasure of
the observer's memory), which was previously formulated in our work and was
repeated by Maccone, is correct under the conditions described in this Comment.
Moreover, this argument can be used to resolve a reduction paradox (the
Schrodinger's Cat paradox) in quantum mechanics. This use is demonstrated in
the second part. In the third part, the synchronisation (decoherence) of time
arrows is discussed. In the fourth part, the synchronisation (decoherence) of
time arrows in quantum gravity is considered.
