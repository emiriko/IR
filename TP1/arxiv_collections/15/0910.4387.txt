We present results from high precision, large volume simulations of the
lattice gauge theory corresponding to minimal walking technicolor. We find
evidence that the pion decay constant vanishes in the infinite volume limit and
that the dependence of the chiral condensate on quark mass m_q is inconsistent
with spontaneous symmetry breaking. These findings are consistent with the
all-orders beta function prediction as well as the Schroedinger functional
studies that indicate the existence of a nontrivial infrared fixed point.
