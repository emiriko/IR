A canonical quantization scheme is represented for a quantum system
interacting with a nonlinear absorbing environment. The environment is taken
anisotropic and the main system is coupled to its environment through some
coupling tensors of various ranks. The nonlinear response equation of the
environment against the motion of the main system is obtained. The nonlinear
Langevin-schr\"{o}dinger equation is concluded as the macroscopic equation of
motion of the dissipative system. The effect of nonlinearity of the environment
is investigated on the spontaneous emission of an initially excited two
level-atom imbedded in such an environmrnt.
