We give a brief review of the physics of gluon saturation and non-linear QCD
evolution at small values of the Bjorken-$x$ variable. We discuss the ALICE
capability for low-$x$ studies at the LHC. In particular, we concentrate on the
heavy quark production in the CGC framework and its observation with the ALICE
Muon Spectrometer.
