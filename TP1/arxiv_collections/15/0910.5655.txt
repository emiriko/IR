We propose a new Quantization algorithm for the approximation of
inhomogeneous random walks, which are the key terms for the valuation of
CDO-tranches in latent factor models. This approach is based on a dual
quantization operator which posses an intrinsic stationarity and therefore
automatically leads to a second order error bound for the weak approximation.
We illustrate the numerical performance of our methods in case of the
approximation of the conditional tranche function of synthetic CDO products and
draw comparisons to the approximations achieved by the saddlepoint method and
Stein's method.
