We present a lattice QCD calculation of the heavy-light decay constants f_B
and f_Bs performed with Nf=2 maximally twisted Wilson fermions, at four values
of the lattice spacing. The decay constants have been also computed in the
static limit and the results are used to interpolate the observables between
the charm and the infinite-mass sectors, thus obtaining the value of the decay
constants at the physical b quark mass. Our preliminary results are f_B=191(14)
MeV, f_Bs=243(14) MeV, f_Bs/f_B=1.27(5). They are in good agreement with those
obtained with a novel approach, recently proposed by our Collaboration (ETMC),
based on the use of suitable ratios having an exactly known static limit.
