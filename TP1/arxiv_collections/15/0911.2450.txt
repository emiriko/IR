We study linear gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild spacetime by
solving numerically Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations in time domain using
hyperboloidal surfaces and a compactifying radial coordinate. We stress the
importance of including the asymptotic region in the computational domain in
studies of gravitational radiation. The hyperboloidal approach should be
helpful in a wide range of applications employing black hole perturbation
theory.
