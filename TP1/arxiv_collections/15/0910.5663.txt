Sizeable b and c components of the 4f moments and pronounced circular
dichroism are observed in the ferroelectric phase of DyMnO_3 by soft X-ray
diffraction at the Dy-M_5 resonance. This points to cycloidal order of the 4f
moments and indicates that inversion-symmetry breaking in this material is not
characteristic of the Mn spins alone. The circular dichroism allows to image
chiral domains that are imprinted on the surface of a DyMnO$_3$ single crystal,
exploiting the local charging by the X-ray beam via the photoelectric effect.
These findings suggest a novel approach to control and image domains and domain
walls in multiferroic materials.
