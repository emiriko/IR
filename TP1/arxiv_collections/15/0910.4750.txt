This study presents theoretical investigation of the effects of particle and
molecular extinction in horizontal remote sensing near the ground for several
visibilities at UV wavelengths by neglecting the spatial inhomogeneity of
aerosol in the atmosphere and taking into account the dependence of refracting
on air temperature and pressure. Due to weak attenuation of oxygen and other
gaseous atmospheric constituents in this region, we have only considered the
effect of ozone in calculation. The results are important to estimate
systematic errors in measuring gas concentration introduced by large wavelength
separation in UV-DIAL. The total attenuation (km-1) at wavelengths is listed in
the form of a table from 200 to 400 nm for several values of visibilities. It
is found the aerosol attenuation in UV region varies quite smoothly with
wavelength and therefore systematic error caused by aerosol scattering is
negligible in remote sensing by UV-DIAL even with large wavelength separation.
Moreover, it has been found that only aerosol extinction is dominant in lidar
remote sensing in the lower atmosphere in UV region. In large altitude that
aerosol concentration is lower; the molecular scattering is important
especially for wavelengths larger than 310 nm.
