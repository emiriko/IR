Understanding the behaviour of biological systems requires a complex setting
of in vitro and in vivo experiments, which attracts high costs in terms of time
and resources. The use of mathematical models allows researchers to perform
computerised simulations of biological systems, which are called in silico
experiments, to attain important insights and predictions about the system
behaviour with a considerably lower cost. Computer visualisation is an
important part of this approach, since it provides a realistic representation
of the system behaviour. We define a formal methodology to model biological
systems using different levels of representation: a purely formal
representation, which we call molecular level, models the biochemical dynamics
of the system; visualisation-oriented representations, which we call visual
levels, provide views of the biological system at a higher level of
organisation and are equipped with the necessary spatial information to
generate the appropriate visualisation. We choose Spatial CLS, a formal
language belonging to the class of Calculi of Looping Sequences, as the
formalism for modelling all representation levels. We illustrate our approach
using the budding yeast cell cycle as a case study.
