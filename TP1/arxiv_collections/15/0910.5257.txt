We consider two-component solitons in a medium with a periodic modulation of
the nonlinear coefficient. The modulation enables the existence of complex
multihump vector states. In particular, vector solitons composed of dipole and
fundamental, or dipole and even double-hump components exist and may be stable.
Families of unstable scalar solitons can be stabilized in the vectorial form,
due to the coupling to a stable second component.
