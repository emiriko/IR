This paper studies the impact of interference asynchrony among different
links in a wireless network. Without deliberate coordination and cooperation
among the active links, there is a naturally occurring misalignment between the
symbols of the targeted signal of a receiver and the symbols of the interfering
signals. Interestingly, we show that the interference asynchrony can actually
improve the BER performance, compared with the situation in which symbols of al
signals ay aligned. In particular, we show that symbol misalignment can
decrease the "effective interference power" and change the distribution of the
interfering signals, in a way that results in lower BER. To ensure that symbol
misalignment can be consistently attained, we propose two simple schemes that
introduce time-varying symbol offsets to obtain an "average" performance of
random symbol misalignment. Notably, our schemes do not change the simple
receiver design structure; only the transmitters are modified in a minor way.
