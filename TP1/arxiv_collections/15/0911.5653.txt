The Monte Carlo method in the canonical ensemble is used to investigate
magnetization reversal in amorphous transition metal - rare earth multilayers.
Our study is based on a model containing diluted clusters which exhibit an
effective uniaxial anisotropy in competition with random magnetic anisotropy in
the matrix. We simulate hysteresis loops for an abrupt profile and a diffuse
one obtained from atom probe tomography analyses. Our results evidence that the
atom probe tomography profile favors perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in
agreement with magnetic measurements. Moreover, the hysteresis loops calculated
at several temperatures qualitatively agree with the experimental ones.
