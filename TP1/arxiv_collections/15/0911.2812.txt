A recent update of data on the decays of $D^0$, $D^+$, and $D_s^+$ to pairs
of light pseudoscalars calls for a renewed analysis of key decay amplitudes and
tests of flavor symmetry. The present data change our previous understanding of
relative phases between amplitudes that describe Cabibbo-favored decays of the
charmed mesons. The new data also seem to favor a smaller octet-singlet mixing
angle for the $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons when singly-Cabibbo-suppressed
processes are taken into account. We also discuss the effects of the new data
on interference between Cabibbo-favored and doubly-Cabibbo-suppressed decays.
