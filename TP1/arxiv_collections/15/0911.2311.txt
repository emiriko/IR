In this note we analyse the issue of moduli stabilisation in 4d models
obtained from heterotic string compactifications on manifolds with SU(3)
structure with standard embedding. In order to deal with tractable models we
first integrate out the massive fields. We argue that one can not only
integrate out the moduli fields, but along the way one has to truncate also the
corresponding matter fields. We show that the effective models obtained in this
way do not have satisfactory solutions. We also look for stabilised vacua which
take into account the presence of the matter fields. We argue that this also
fails due to a no-go theorem for Minkowski vacua in the moduli sector which we
prove in the end. The main ingredient for this no-go theorem is the constraint
on the fluxes which comes from the Bianchi identity.
