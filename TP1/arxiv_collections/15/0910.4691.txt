Passing from arithmetic schemes to algebraic schemes, in a similar manner we
will have the computation of the \'etale fundamental group of an algebraic
scheme and then will define and discuss the qc fundamental group of an
algebraic scheme in this paper. The qc fundamental group will also give a prior
estimate of the \'etale fundamental group.
