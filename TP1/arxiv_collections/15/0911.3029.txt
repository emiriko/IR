We generalize the Matrix Product States method using the chiral vertex
operators of Conformal Field Theory and apply it to study the ground states of
the XXZ spin chain, the J1-J2 model and random Heisenberg models. We compute
the overlap with the exact wave functions, spin-spin correlators and the Renyi
entropy, showing that critical systems can be described by this method. For
rotational invariant ansatzs we construct an inhomogenous extension of the
Haldane-Shastry model with long range exchange interactions.
