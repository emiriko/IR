The SciBooNE Collaboration reports inclusive neutral current neutral pion
production by a muon neutrino beam on a polystyrene target (C8H8). We obtain
(7.7 \pm 0.5(stat.) \pm 0.5 (sys.)) x 10^(-2) as the ratio of the neutral
current neutral pion production to total charged current cross section; the
mean energy of neutrinos producing detected neutral pions is 1.1 GeV. The
result agrees with the Rein-Sehgal model implemented in our neutrino
interaction simulation program with nuclear effects. The spectrum shape of the
neutral pion momentum and angle agree with the model. We also measure the ratio
of the neutral current coherent pion production to total charged current cross
section to be (0.7 \pm 0.4) x 10^(-2).
