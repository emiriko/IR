Langevin forces are investigated in the framework of the phenomenological
Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. These stochastic forces introducted in the
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation describing the superconductor
transport properties above the critical temperature model the fluctuations
action. We assume that there exists a profound connection between the
fluctuation Cooper pair energy spectrum and the Langevin forces possible values
spectrum. In investigation carried out on the basis of that hypothesis we
obtain the analytical expression for Langevin forces defining them by means of
order parameter, i.e., by means of the fluctuation Cooper pair wave function.
Langevin forces properties are analyzed. The conlusion about their complex
nature is done. Asymptotic analysis of Langevin forces is performed.
