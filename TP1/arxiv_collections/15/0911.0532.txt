We present spectroscopic observations of a sample of 15 embedded young
stellar objects (YSOs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). These observations
were obtained with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) as part of the
SAGE-Spec Legacy program. We analyze the two prominent ice bands in the IRS
spectral range: the bending mode of CO_2 ice at 15.2 micron and the ice band
between 5 and 7 micron that includes contributions from the bending mode of
water ice at 6 micron amongst other ice species. The 5-7 micron band is
difficult to identify in our LMC sample due to the conspicuous presence of PAH
emission superimposed onto the ice spectra. We identify water ice in the
spectra of two sources; the spectrum of one of those sources also exhibits the
6.8 micron ice feature attributed to ammonium and methanol. We model the CO_2
band in detail, using the combination of laboratory ice profiles available in
the literature. We find that a significant fraction (> 50%) of CO_2 ice is
locked in a water-rich component, consistent with what is observed for Galactic
sources. The majority of the sources in the LMC also require a pure-CO_2
contribution to the ice profile, evidence of thermal processing. There is a
suggestion that CO_2 production might be enhanced in the LMC, but the size of
the available sample precludes firmer conclusions. We place our results in the
context of the star formation environment in the LMC.
