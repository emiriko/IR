A Thurston map is a branched covering map $f\colon S^2\to S^2$ that is
postcritically finite. Mating of polynomials, introduced by Douady and Hubbard,
is a method to geometrically combine the Julia sets of two polynomials (and
their dynamics) to form a rational map. We show that for every expanding
Thurston map $f$ every sufficiently high iterate $F=f^n$ is obtained as the
mating of two polynomials. One obtains a concise description of $F$ via
critical portraits. The proof is based on the construction of the invariant
Peano curve from Meyer. As another consequence we obtain a large number of
fractal tilings of the plane and the hyperbolic plane.
