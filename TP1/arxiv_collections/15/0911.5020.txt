We study formation of rotating three-dimensional high-order solitons
(azimuthons) in Bose Einstein condensate with attractive nonlocal nonlinear
interaction. In particular, we demonstrate formation of toroidal rotating
solitons and investigate their stability. We show that variational methods
allow a very good approximation of such solutions and predict accurately the
soliton rotation frequency. We also find that these rotating localized
structures are very robust and persist even if the initial condensate
conditions are rather far from the exact soliton solutions. Furthermore, the
presence of repulsive contact interaction does not prevent the existence of
those solutions, but allows to control their rotation. We conjecture that
self-trapped azimuthons are generic for condensates with attractive nonlocal
interaction.
