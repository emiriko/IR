Raman spectrums of nanoparticles of a p-dibromobenzene with size of 300
nanometers and 50 nanometers are measured. It is found that frequencies of
lines of stretching vibrations of C-Br at reduction of the sizes of
nanoparticles below 300 nanometers are incremented. It is related to
magnification of parameters of the lattice and interaction reduction between
molecules.
