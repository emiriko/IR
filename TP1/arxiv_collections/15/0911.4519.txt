We report an experimental and theoretical study of the optical properties of
two-dimensional arrays of aluminum nanoparticle in-tandem pairs. Plasmon
resonances and effective optical constants of these structures are investigated
and strong magnetic response as well as negative permeability are observed down
to 400 nm wavelength. Theoretical calculations based on the finite-difference
time-domain method are performed for various particle dimensions and lattice
parameters, and are found to be in good agreement with the experimental
results. The results show that metamaterials operating across the whole visible
wavelength range are feasible.
