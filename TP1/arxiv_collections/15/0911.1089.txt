Recent measurements of ultra-high energy cosmic rays and neutrinos are
briefly reviewed. With several new large scale observatories nearing completion
or becoming fully operational only very recently, a large body of high quality
and high statistics data is growing up now. Already these first data have
started to open up a new window to the high energy Universe giving us first
direct clues about the origin of the most energetic particles with energies of
about 10^{20} eV as well as about their interactions from extragalactic sources
to Earth. Also, for the first time full sky views of high energy neutrinos have
become available with neutrino telescopes operating on either Hemisphere. While
a "smoking gun" is still missing on galactic sources of cosmic rays,
constraining upper limits to neutrino fluxes from various source candidates are
reported. Thus, future neutrino telescopes, such as KM3NeT in the Mediterranean
should aim at volumes significantly larger than one cubic kilometer. Besides
seeking the sources of galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays, the new
generation of cosmic ray and neutrino observatories touches a wide range of
scientific issues and they have already provided important results on tests of
fundamental physics.
