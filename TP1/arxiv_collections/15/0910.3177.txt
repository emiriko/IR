We consider, in a model-independent framework, the potential for observing
dark matter in neutrino detectors through the interaction $\bar{f} p \to e^+
n$, where $f$ is a dark fermion. Operators of dimension six or less are
considered, and constraints are placed on their coefficients using the dark
matter lifetime and its decays to states which include $\gamma$ rays or
$e^+e^-$ pairs. After these constraints are applied, there remains one operator
which can possibly contribute to $\bar{f} p \to e^+ n$ in neutrino detectors at
an observable level. We then consider the results from the Super-Kamiokande
relic supernova neutrino search and find that Super-K can probe the new physics
scale of this interaction up to $O(100\mbox{ TeV})$.
