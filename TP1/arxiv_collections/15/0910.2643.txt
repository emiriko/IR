The formation and evolution of galaxies is imprinted on their stellar
population radial gradients. Two recent articles present conflicting results
concerning the mass dependence of the metallicity gradients for early-type
dwarf galaxies. On one side, Spolaor et al. show a tight positive correlation
between the total metallicity, Z/H and the mass. On the other side, in a
distinct sample, we do not find any trend involving Fe/H (Koleva et al.). In
order to investigate the origin of the discrepancy, we examine various factors
that may affect the determination of the gradients: namely the sky subtraction
and the signal-to-noise ratio. We conclude that our detection of gradients are
well above the possible analysis biases. Then, we measured the Mg/Fe relative
abundance profile and found moderate gradients. The derived Z/H gradients
scatter around -0.4 dex/r_e. The two samples contain the same types of objects
and the reason of the disagreement is still not understood.
