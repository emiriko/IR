We present infrared, optical, and X-ray data of 48 X-ray bright, optically
dull AGNs in the COSMOS field. These objects exhibit the X-ray luminosity of an
active galactic nucleus (AGN) but lack broad and narrow emission lines in their
optical spectrum. We show that despite the lack of optical emission lines, most
of these optically dull AGNs are not well-described by a typical passive red
galaxy spectrum: instead they exhibit weak but significant blue emission like
an unobscured AGN. Photometric observations over several years additionally
show significant variability in the blue emission of four optically dull AGNs.
The nature of the blue and infrared emission suggest that the optically
inactive appearance of these AGNs cannot be caused by obscuration intrinsic to
the AGNs. Instead, up to ~70% of optically dull AGNs are diluted by their
hosts, with bright or simply edge-on hosts lying preferentially within the
spectroscopic aperture. The remaining ~30% of optically dull AGNs have
anomalously high f_x/f_o ratios and are intrinsically weak, not obscured, in
the optical. These optically dull AGNs are best described as a weakly accreting
AGN with a truncated accretion disk from a radiatively inefficient accretion
flow.
