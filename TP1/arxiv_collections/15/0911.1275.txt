This article addresses the issue of the proof of the entropy power inequality
(EPI), an important tool in the analysis of Gaussian channels of information
transmission, proposed by Shannon.
  We analyse continuity properties of the mutual entropy of the input and
output signals in an additive memoryless channel and discuss assumptions under
which the entropy-power inequality holds true.
