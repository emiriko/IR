We report on the status of our study towards the equation of state in 2+1
flavor QCD with improved Wilson quarks. To reduce the computational cost which
is quite demanding for Wilson-type quarks, we adopt the fixed scale approach,
i.e. the temperature T is varied by N_t at fixed lattice spacing. Since the
conventional integral method to obtain the pressure is inapplicable at a fixed
scale, we adopt the "T-integral method", to calculate the pressure
non-perturbatively. Reduction of the computational cost of T=0 simulations thus
achieved is indispensable to study EOS in QCD with dynamical quarks.
