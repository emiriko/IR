We combine near-infrared (2MASS) and mid-infrared (Spitzer-IRAC) photometry
to characterize the IR extinction law (1.2-8 microns) over nearly 150 degrees
of contiguous Milky Way midplane longitude. The relative extinctions in 5
passbands across these wavelength and longitude ranges are derived by
calculating color excess ratios for G and K giant red clump stars in contiguous
midplane regions and deriving the wavelength dependence of extinction in each
one. Strong, monotonic variations in the extinction law shape are found as a
function of angle from the Galactic center, symmetric on either side of it.
These longitudinal variations persist even when dense interstellar regions,
known a priori to have a shallower extinction curve, are removed. The
increasingly steep extinction curves towards the outer Galaxy indicate a steady
decrease in the absolute-to-selective extinction ratio (R_V) and in the mean
dust grain size at greater Galactocentric angles. We note an increasing
strength of the 8 micron extinction inflection at high Galactocentric angles
and, using theoretical dust models, show that this behavior is consistent with
the trend in R_V. Along several lines of sight where the solution is most
feasible, A_lambda/A_Ks as a function of Galactic radius is estimated and shown
to have a Galactic radial dependence. Our analyses suggest that the observed
relationship between extinction curve shape and Galactic longitude is due to an
intrinsic dependence of the extinction law on Galactocentric radius.
