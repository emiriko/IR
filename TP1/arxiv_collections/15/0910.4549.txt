We propose an entanglement beam splitter (EBS) using a quantum-dot spin in a
double-sided optical microcavity. In contrast to the conventional optical beam
splitter, the EBS can directly split a photon-spin product state into two
constituent entangled states via transmission and reflection with high fidelity
and high efficiency (up to 100 percent). This device is based on giant optical
circular birefringence induced by a single spin as a result of cavity quantum
electrodynamics and the spin selection rule of trion transition (Pauli
blocking). The EBS is robust and it is immune to the fine structure splitting
in a realistic quantum dot. This quantum device can be used for
deterministically creating photon-spin, photon-photon and spin-spin
entanglement as well as a single-shot quantum non-demolition measurement of a
single spin. Therefore, the EBS can find wide applications in quantum
information science and technology.
