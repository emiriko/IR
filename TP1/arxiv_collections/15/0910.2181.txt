Rare-earth L$_{3}$-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES)
spectroscopy has been used to study REOFeAs (RE=La, Pr, Nd, Sm) oxypnictides.
The Nd L$_{3}$ XANES due to 2p$_{3/2}\to5\epsilon$d transition shows a
substantial change in both white line (WL) spectral weight and the higher
energy multiple scattering resonances with the partial substitution of O by F.
A systematic change in the XANES features is seen due to varying lattice
parameters with ionic radius of the rare earth. On the other hand, we hardly
see any change across the structural phase transition. The results provide
timely information on the local atomic correlations showing importance of local
structural chemistry of the REO spacer layer and interlayer coupling in the
competing superconductivity and itinerant striped magnetic phase of the
oxypnictides.
