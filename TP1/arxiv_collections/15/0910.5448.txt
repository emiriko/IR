This paper is concerned with the interpretation of velocity eigenstates for
unstable quantons, their relationship to space like momentum eigenstates for
such quantons and the explanation of Shirokovs contracting lifetimes for such
velocity eigenstates. It is an elaboration of a portion of the authors earlier
study.
