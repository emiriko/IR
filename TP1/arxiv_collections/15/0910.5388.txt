Regular superconducting solution for interior of the Kerr-Newman (KN)
spinning particle is obtained. For parameters of electron it represents a
highly oblated rotating bubble formed by Higgs field which expels the
electromagnetic (em) field and currents from interior to domain wall boundary
of the bubble.
  The external em and gravitational fields correspond exactly to Kerr-Newman
solution, while interior of the bubble is flat and forms a `false' vacuum with
zero energy density. Vortex of the KN em field forms a quantum Wilson loop on
the edge of the rotating disk-like bubble.
