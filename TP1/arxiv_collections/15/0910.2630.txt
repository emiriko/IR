We study the finite-size scaling of heavy-light mesons in the static limit.
The most relevant effects are due to the pseudo-Goldstone boson cloud. In the
HMChPT framework we compute two-point functions of left current densitities as
well as pseudoscalar densitites for the cases in which some or all of them lay
in the epsilon-regime. As expected, finite volume dependence turns out to be
significant in this regime and can be predicted in the effective theory in
terms of the infinite-volume low-energy couplings. These results might be
relevant for extraction of heavy-light meson properties from lattice
simulations.
