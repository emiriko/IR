We suggest a new approach for describing quantum dissipation in a small
systems for which the system-plus-reservoir approach is not relevant. We first
analyze the fact that equilibrium thermodynamics may reveal the existence of an
underlying dynamics. This is true in the algebraic approach of quantum
mechanics via the Tomita-Takesaki theorem. A similar result is obtained if we
start from the path integral expression of the partition function, an equation
of motion is introduced. In both cases a parameter has to be identified with
the physical time. Several arguments are presented showing that it is so. By
investigating the dynamics for short times we introduce an equilibrium
condition from which a natural unit of time appears. The equation of motion is
extended to non equilibrium situations for which a H-theorem can be derived.
The equation of motion can be transformed into a quantum Smoluchovski equation,
its solution is a probability having a clear physical meaning. The relaxation
of this probability towards its equilibrium value requires a time during which
a thermodynamic description is possible or not. A standard bistable model is
investigated and the chemical rate $k(t)$ is calculated as a function of time,
it appears to be a non monotonic function of time. In some conditions the
stationary value of $k(t)$ can be identified with the Kramers result. Finally
we compare our approach which is naturally irreversible with an analysis based
on the Schr\"{o}dinger equation which is reversible. From all these results it
appears that our equation of motion or its Smoluchovski version appear as a
realistic starting point for describing quantum dissipation in small systems.
