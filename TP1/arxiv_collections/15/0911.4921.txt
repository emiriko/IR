We calculate Landau gauge ghost and gluon propagators in pure SU(2) lattice
gauge theory in two, three and four dimensions. The gauge fixing method we use,
sc. stochastic quantisation, serves as a viable alternative approach to
standard gauge fixing algorithms. We also investigate the spectrum of the
Faddeev-Popov operator. At insufficiently accurate gauge fixing, we find
evidence that stochastic quantisation samples configurations close to the
Gribov horizon. Standard gauge fixing does so only at specific parameters;
otherwise, there is a clear difference. However, this difference disappears if
the gauge is fixed to sufficient accuracy. In this case, we confirm previous
lattice results for the gluon and ghost propagator in two, three and four
dimensions.
