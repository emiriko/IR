Molecular calculations in quantum Monte Carlo frequently employ a mixed basis
consisting of contracted and primitive Gaussian functions. While standard basis
sets of varying size and accuracy are available in the literature, we
demonstrate that reoptimizing the primitive function exponents within quantum
Monte Carlo yields more compact basis sets for a given accuracy. Particularly
large gains are achieved for highly excited states. For calculations requiring
non-diverging pseudopotentials, we introduce Gauss-Slater basis functions that
behave as Gaussians at short distances and Slaters at long distances. These
basis functions further improve the energy and fluctuations of the local energy
for a given basis size. Gains achieved by exponent optimization and
Gauss-Slater basis use are exemplified by calculations for the ground state of
carbon, the lowest lying excited states of carbon with $^5S^o$, $^3P^o$,
$^1D^o$, $^3F^o$ symmetries, carbon dimer, and naphthalene. Basis size
reduction enables quantum Monte Carlo treatment of larger molecules at high
accuracy.
