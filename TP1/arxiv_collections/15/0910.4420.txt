This volume contains the proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Security Issues
in Concurrency (SecCo'09). The workshop was held in Bologna, Italy on September
5th 2009, as a satellite workshop of CONCUR'09. The aim of the SecCo workshop
series is to cover the gap between the security and the concurrency
communities. More precisely, the workshop promotes the exchange of ideas,
trying to focus on common interests and stimulating discussions on central
research questions. In particular, we called for papers dealing with security
issues (such as authentication, integrity, privacy, confidentiality, access
control, denial of service, service availability, safety aspects, fault
tolerance, trust, language-based security, probabilistic and information
theoretic models) in emerging fields like web services, mobile ad-hoc networks,
agent-based infrastructures, peer-to-peer systems, context-aware computing,
global/ubiquitous/pervasive computing.
