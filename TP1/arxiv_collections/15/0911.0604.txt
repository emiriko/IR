We show that a certain action which gives rise to the pure spin connection
formulation of gravity by CDJ can be consistently derived from the action for
the instanton representation of Plebanski gravity. This is an illustrative
example of when certain symmetries of the basic fields commute with the
symmetries of the equations of motion.
