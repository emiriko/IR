In the present work we apply the atomic approach to the single impurity
Anderson model (SIAM). A general formulation of this approach, that can be
applied both to the impurity and to the lattice Anderson Hamiltonian, was
developed in a previous work (arXiv:0903.0139v1 [cond-mat.str-el]). The method
starts from the cumulant expansion of the periodic Anderson model (PAM),
employing the hybridization as perturbation. The atomic Anderson limit is
analytically solved and its sixteen eigenenergies and eigenstates are obtained.
This atomic Anderson solution, which we call the (AAS), has all the fundamental
excitations that generate the Kondo effect, and in the atomic approach is
employed as a seed to generate the approximate solutions for finite U. The
width of the conduction band is reduced to zero in the AAS, and we choose its
position so that the Friedel sum rule (FSR) be satisfied, close to the chemical
potential.
  We perform a complete study of the density of states of the SIAM in all the
relevant range of parameters: the empty dot, the intermediate valence
(IV-regime),the Kondo and the magnetic regime. In the Kondo regime we obtain a
density of states that characterizes well the structure of the Kondo peak. To
shown the usefulness of the method we have calculated the conductance of a
quantum dot, side coupled to a conduction band.
