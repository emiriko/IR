We describe an exact, flexible, and computationally efficient algorithm for a
joint estimation of the large-scale structure and its power-spectrum, building
on a Gibbs sampling framework and present its implementation ARES (Algorithm
for REconstruction and Sampling). ARES is designed to reconstruct the 3D
power-spectrum together with the underlying dark matter density field in a
Bayesian framework, under the reasonable assumption that the long wavelength
Fourier components are Gaussian distributed. As a result ARES does not only
provide a single estimate but samples from the joint posterior of the
power-spectrum and density field conditional on a set of observations. This
enables us to calculate any desired statistical summary, in particular we are
able to provide joint uncertainty estimates. We apply our method to mock
catalogs, with highly structured observational masks and selection functions,
in order to demonstrate its ability to reconstruct the power-spectrum from real
data sets, while fully accounting for any mask induced mode coupling.
