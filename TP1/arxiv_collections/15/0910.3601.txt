Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) of homoepitaxial SrTiO3 <001> was studied with
in-situ x-ray specular reflectivity and surface diffuse x-ray scattering.
Unlike prior reflectivity-based studies, these measurements access both the
time- and the length-scales of the evolution of the surface morphology during
growth. In particular, we show that this technique allows direct measurements
of the diffusivity for both inter- and intra-layer transport. Our results
explicitly limit the possible role of island break-up, demonstrate the key
roles played by nucleation and coarsening in PLD, and place an upper bound on
the Ehrlich-Schwoebel (ES) barrier for downhill diffusion.
