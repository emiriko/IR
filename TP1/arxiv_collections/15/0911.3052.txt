On May 2008 the ANTARES collaboration completed the installation of a
neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea. This detector consists of a
tridimensional array of almost 900 photomultipliers (PMTs) distributed in 12
lines. These PMTs can collect the Cherenkov light emitted by the muons produced
in the interaction of high energy cosmic neutrinos with the matter surrounding
the detector. A good timing resolution is crucial in order to infer the
neutrino track direction and to make astronomy. In this presentation I describe
the time calibration systems of the ANTARES detector including some
measurements (made both at the laboratory and in-situ) which validate the
expected performance.
