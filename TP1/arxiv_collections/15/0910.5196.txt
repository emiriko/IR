Toward the formulation of the operational approach to quantum thermodynamics,
the heat-up operator is explicitly constructed. This quantum operation
generates for a generic system an irreversible transformation from a pure
ground state at zero temperature to a state at finite temperature. The fixed
point analysis shows that repeated applications of the operation map from an
arbitrary state to the completely random state realized in the high-temperature
limit. The change of the von Neumann entropy is evaluated for a simple
bipartite spin-1/2 system. It is shown that remarkably, the second law of
thermodynamics may be violated along processes generated by the present quantum
operation.
