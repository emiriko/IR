With the development of quantum thermodynamics it has been shown that
relaxation to thermal equilibrium and with it the concept of heat flux may
emerge directly from quantum mechanics. This happens for a large class of
quantum systems if embedded into another quantum environment. In this paper, we
discuss the complementary question of the emergence of work flux from quantum
mechanics. We introduce and discuss two different methods to assess the work
source quality of a system, one based on the generalized factorization
approximation, the other based on generalized definitions of work and heat. By
means of those methods, we show that small quantum systems can, indeed, act as
work reservoirs. We illustrate this behavior for a simple system consisting of
a spin coupled to an oscillator and investigate the effects of two different
interactions on the work source quality. One case will be shown to allow for a
work source functionality of arbitrarily high quality.
