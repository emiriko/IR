For a restricted Lie superalgebra g over an algebraically closed field of
characteristic p > 2, we generalize the deformation method of Premet and
Skryabin to obtain results on the p-power and 2-power divisibility of
dimensions of g-modules. In particular, we give a new proof of the Super
Kac-Weisfeiler conjecture for basic classical Lie superalgebras. The new proof
allows us to improve optimally the assumption on p. We also establish a
semisimplicity criterion for the reduced enveloping superalgebras associated
with semisimple p-characters for all basic classical Lie superalgebras using
the technique of odd reflections.
