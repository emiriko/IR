We study a magnetic molecule that exhibits spin tunneling and is free to
rotate about its anisotropy axis. Exact low-energy eigenstates of the molecule
that are superpositions of spin and rotational states are obtained. We show
that parameter $\alpha = 2(\hbar S)^2/(I\Delta)$ determines the ground state of
the molecule. Here $\hbar S$ is the spin, $I$ is the moment of inertia, and
$\Delta$ is the tunnel splitting. The magnetic moment of the molecule is zero
at $\alpha < \alpha_c = [1-1/(2S)^{2}]^{-1}$ and non-zero at $\alpha >
\alpha_c$. At $\alpha \to \infty$ the spin of the molecule localizes in one of
the directions along the anisotropy axis.
