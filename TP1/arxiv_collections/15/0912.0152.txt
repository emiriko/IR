Recent work on nearby AGNs has shown that X-ray variability is correlated
with the mass and accretion rate onto the central SMBH. Here we present the
application of the variability-luminosity relation to high redshift AGNs in the
CDFS, making use of XMM-Newton observations. We use Monte Carlo simulations in
order to properly account for bias and uncertainties introduced by the sparse
sampling and the very low statistics. Our preliminary results indicate that BH
masses span over the range from 10^5 to 10^9 solar mass while accretion rates
range from 10^-3 up to values greater than 1, in unit of Eddington accretion
rate.
