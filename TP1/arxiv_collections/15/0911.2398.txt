Quantum information processing requires overcoming decoherence---the loss of
"quantumness" due to the inevitable interaction between the quantum system and
its environment. One approach towards a solution is quantum dynamical
decoupling---a method employing strong and frequent pulses applied to the
qubits. Here we report on the first experimental test of the concatenated
dynamical decoupling (CDD) scheme, which invokes recursively constructed pulse
sequences. Using nuclear magnetic resonance, we demonstrate a near order of
magnitude improvement in the decay time of stored quantum states. In
conjunction with recent results on high fidelity quantum gates using CDD, our
results suggest that quantum dynamical decoupling should be used as a first
layer of defense against decoherence in quantum information processing
implementations, and can be a stand-alone solution in the right parameter
regime.
