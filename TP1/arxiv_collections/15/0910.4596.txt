The morphological evolution of hillocks at the unpassivated sidewalls of the
single crystal metallic thin films is investigated via computer simulations by
using the free-moving boundary value problem. The effects of the
drift-diffusion anisotropy on the development of surface topographical
scenarios is fully explored under the action of electromigration and capillary
forces, utilizing numerous combination of the surface texture, the
drift-diffusion anisotropy and the direction of the applied electric field. The
present simulation studies yield very rich and technologically imported
information, in regards to the critical texture of the single crystal thin film
surfaces, and the intensity and the orientation of the applied electric field,
as far as the device reliability is concerned.
