We study the collider signatures of the left-right twin Higgs model in the
case that the right-handed neutrino mass is less than the mass of the
right-handed gauge boson. In this scenario, new leptonic decay chains open up,
allowing the particles which cancel the one-loop quadratic divergences of the
Higgs, the right-handed gauge bosons and top-partners, to be discovered. Half
of these events contain same-sign leptons without missing energy, which have no
genuine standard model background and for which the backgrounds are purely
instrumental. These signals may be used to complement other collider searches,
and in certain regions of parameter space, may be the only way to observe the
particles responsible for natural electroweak symmetry breaking in the
left-right twin Higgs model.
