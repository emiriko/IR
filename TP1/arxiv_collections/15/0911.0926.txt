Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thought to result from thermonuclear
explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarf stars. Existing models generally
explain the observed properties, with the exception of the sub-luminous
1991-bg-like supernovae. It has long been suspected that the merger of two
white dwarfs could give rise to a type Ia event, but hitherto simulations have
failed to produce an explosion. Here we report a simulation of the merger of
two equal-mass white dwarfs that leads to an underluminous explosion, though at
the expense of requiring a single common-envelope phase, and component masses
of ~0.9 M_sun. The light curve is too broad, but the synthesized spectra, red
colour and low expansion velocities are all close to what is observed for
sub-luminous 1991bg-like events. While mass ratios can be slightly less than
one and still produce an underluminous event, the masses have to be in the
range 0.83-0.9 M_sun.
