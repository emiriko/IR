We have measured the electron spin relaxation rate and the integrated spin
noise power in n-doped GaAs for temperatures between 4 K and 80 K and for
doping concentrations ranging from 2.7 x 10^{-15} cm^{-3} to 8.8 x 10^{-16}
cm^{-3} using spin noise spectroscopy. The temperature dependent measurements
show a clear transition from localized to free electrons for the lower doped
samples and confirm mainly free electrons at all temperatures for the highest
doped sample. While the sample at the metal-insulator-transition shows the
longest spin relaxation time at low temperatures, a clear crossing of the spin
relaxation rates is observed at 70 K and the highest doped sample reveals the
longest spin relaxation time above 70 K.
