The analyses of elastic collisions of charged nucleons have been based
standardly on West and Yennie formula. However, this approach has been shown
recently to be inadequate from experimental as well as theoretical points of
view. The eikonal model seems to be more pertinent as it enables to determine
physical characteristics in impact parameter space. The contemporary
phenomenological models cannot give, of course, any definite answer as the
elastic collisions may be interpreted differently, as central or peripheral
processes. Nevertheless, the predictions for the planned LHC energy have been
given on their basis and the possibility of exact determination of luminosity
has been considered.
