The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is shown to result in a canting of
spins in a single molecule transistor. We predict non-linear transport
signatures of this effect induced by spin-orbit coupling for the generic case
of a molecular dimer. The conductance is calculated using a master equation and
is found to exhibit a non-trivial dependence on the magnitude and direction of
an external magnetic field. We show how three-terminal transport measurements
allow for a determination of the coupling-vector characterizing the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In particular, we show how its orientation,
defining the intramolecular spin chirality, can be probed with ferromagnetic
electrodes.
