We perform a forecast of the MSSM with universal soft terms (CMSSM) for the
LHC, based on an improved Bayesian analysis. We do not incorporate ad hoc
measures of the fine-tuning to penalize unnatural possibilities: such
penalization arises from the Bayesian analysis itself when the experimental
value of $M_Z$ is considered. This allows to scan the whole parameter space,
allowing arbitrarily large soft terms. Still the low-energy region is
statistically favoured (even before including dark matter or g-2 constraints).
Contrary to other studies, the results are almost unaffected by changing the
upper limits taken for the soft terms. The results are also remarkable stable
when using flat or logarithmic priors, a fact that arises from the larger
statistical weight of the low-energy region in both cases. Then we incorporate
all the important experimental constrains to the analysis, obtaining a map of
the probability density of the MSSM parameter space, i.e. the forecast of the
MSSM. Since not all the experimental information is equally robust, we perform
separate analyses depending on the group of observables used. When only the
most robust ones are used, the favoured region of the parameter space contains
a significant portion outside the LHC reach. This effect gets reinforced if the
Higgs mass is not close to its present experimental limit and persits when dark
matter constraints are included. Only when the g-2 constraint (based on
$e^+e^-$ data) is considered, the preferred region (for $\mu>0$) is well inside
the LHC scope. We also perform a Bayesian comparison of the positive- and
negative-$\mu$ possibilities.
