We investigate the single flavor color superconductivity in a magnetic field.
Because of the absence of the electromagnetic Meissner effect, forming a
nonspherical CSC phase, polar, A or planar, does not cost energy of excluding
magnetic flux. We found that these nonspherical phases do occupy a significant
portion of the phase diagram with respect to magnetic field and temperature and
may be implemented under the typical quark density and the magnetic field
inside a compact star.
