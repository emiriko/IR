We revisit four generations within the context of supersymmetry. We compute
the perturbativity limits for the fourth generation Yukawa couplings and show
that if the masses of the fourth generation lie within reasonable limits of
their present experimental lower bounds, it is possible to have perturbativity
only up to scales around 1000 TeV. Such low scales are ideally suited to
incorporate gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking, where the mediation scale
can be as low as 10-20 TeV. The minimal messenger model, however, is highly
constrained. While lack of electroweak symmetry breaking rules out a large part
of the parameter space, a small region exists, where the fourth generation stau
is tachyonic. General gauge mediation with its broader set of boundary
conditions is better suited to accommodate the fourth generation.
