We investigate the dynamics of two-component Bose-Josephson junction composed
of atom-molecule BECs. Within the semiclassical approximation, the multi-degree
of freedom of this system permits chaotic dynamics, which does not occur in
single-component Bose-Josephson junctions. By investigating the level
statistics of the energy spectra using the exact diagonalization method, we
evaluate whether the dynamics of the system is periodic or non-periodic within
the semiclassical approximation. Additionally, we compare the semiclassical and
full-quantum dynamics.
