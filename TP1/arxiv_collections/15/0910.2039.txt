This work presents a novel learning method in the context of embodied
artificial intelligence and self-organization, which has as few assumptions and
restrictions as possible about the world and the underlying model. The learning
rule is derived from the principle of maximizing the predictive information in
the sensorimotor loop. It is evaluated on robot chains of varying length with
individually controlled, non-communicating segments. The comparison of the
results shows that maximizing the predictive information per wheel leads to a
higher coordinated behavior of the physically connected robots compared to a
maximization per robot. Another focus of this paper is the analysis of the
effect of the robot chain length on the overall behavior of the robots. It will
be shown that longer chains with less capable controllers outperform those of
shorter length and more complex controllers. The reason is found and discussed
in the information-geometric interpretation of the learning process.
