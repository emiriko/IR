Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of defect levels in
semiconductors based on approximate functionals are subject to considerable
uncertainties, in particular due to inaccurate band gap energies. Testing
previous correction methods by many-body GW calculations for the O vacancy in
ZnO, we find that: (i) The GW quasi-particle shifts of the VO defect states
increase the spitting between occupied and unoccupied states due to
self-interaction correction, and do not reflect the conduction versus valence
band character. (ii) The GW quasi-particle energies of charged defect states
require important corrections for supercell finite size effects. (iii) The GW
results are robust with respect to the choice of the underlying DFT or
hybrid-DFT functional, and the (2+/0) donor transition lies below mid-gap,
close to our previous prediction employing rigid band edge shifts.
