We consider construction of Lagrangians which are candidates for p-adic
sector of an adelic open scalar string. Such Lagrangians have their origin in
Lagrangian for a single p-adic string and contain the Riemann zeta function
with the d'Alembertian in its argument. In particular, we present a new
Lagrangian obtained by an additive approach which takes into account all p-adic
Lagrangians. The very attractive feature of this new Lagrangian is that it is
an analytic function of the d'Alembertian. Investigation of the field theory
with Riemann zeta function is interesting in itself as well.
