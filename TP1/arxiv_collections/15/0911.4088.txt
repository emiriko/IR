A personal account of work on the Manhattan Project in Chicago by one of the
few remaining survivors of the war-time project is given, illustrating, among
other things, how absurd things can happen at a time of great stress and
concern.. As is well known, Los Alamos was the site specializing in the physics
of the bomb while Chicago emphasized metallurgical and chemical research.
Nevertheless, physics played a significant role in Chicago, as well. That is
where Fermi constructed the worlds first uranium pile under the stands of Stagg
field, a site at which this author got seriously irradiated. Some curious
events occurring after the bomb was dropped are also related. In addition, at
this time of public protest by sincere people who question the ethics of
America for dropping the bomb on innocent civilians, certain facts, obviously
unknown to the protesters, are presented which place the bombing in a rather
different light.
