The aim of this paper is to devise a turbulence model for the particle method
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) which makes few assumptions, conserves
linear and angular momentum, satisfies a discrete version of Kelvin's
circulation theorem, and is computationally efficient. These aims are achieved.
Furthermore, the results from the model are in good agreement with the
experimental and computational results of Clercx and Heijst for two dimensional
turbulence inside a box with no-slip walls. The model is based on a Lagrangian
similar to that used for the Lagrangian averaged Navier Stokes (LANS)
turbulence model, but with a different smoothed velocity. The smoothed velocity
preserves the shape of the spectrum of the unsmoothed velocity, but reduces the
magnitude for short length scales by an amount which depends on a parameter
$\epsilon$. We call this the SPH-$\epsilon$ model. The effectiveness of the
model is indicated by the fact that the second order velocity correlation
function calculated using the smoothed velocity and a coarse resolution, is in
good agreement with a calculation using a resolution which is finer by a factor
2, and therefore requires 8 times as much work to integrate to the same time.
