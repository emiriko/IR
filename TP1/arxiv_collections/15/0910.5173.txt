Following the arguments presented by Mansuripur [Opt. Express 16, 14821-14835
(2008)], we suggest a form for the macroscopic electromagnetic stress tensor
appropriate for ionized media. The generalized Lorentz force includes the
effects of polarization forces as well as those on the free charge and current
densities. The resulting tensor is written in terms of the fields D, B, E, and
H. Its expression for a fully ionized medium subject to an external
electromagnetic field is discussed, as are the plasma conservation equations.
An apparatus is suggested for its experimental discrimination.
