We report on two different manipulation procedures of a tunable rf SQUID.
First, we operate this system as a flux qubit, where the coherent evolution
between the two flux states is induced by a rapid change of the energy
potential, turning it from a double well into a single well. The measured
coherent Larmor-like oscillation of the retrapping probability in one of the
wells has a frequency ranging from 6 to 20 GHz, with a theoretically expected
upper limit of 40 GHz. Furthermore, here we also report a manipulation of the
same device as a phase qubit. In the phase regime, the manipulation of the
energy states is realized by applying a resonant microwave drive. In spite of
the conceptual difference between these two manipulation procedures, the
measured decay times of Larmor oscillation and microwave-driven Rabi
oscillation are rather similar. Due to the higher frequency of the Larmor
oscillations, the microwave-free qubit manipulation allows for much faster
coherent operations.
