Towards employing low complexity transceivers for signal reception in
Ultra-Wideband (UWB) systems, Transmitted Reference (TR) and Differential TR
(DTR) schemes have attracted researchers attention. In this letter, we
introduce an alternative, less complex scheme, called Self Reference (SR) UWB
transceiver, which uses a modified replica of the received signal itself as
reference pulse, resulting in double data rates compared to TR schemes.
Moreover, SR eliminates the need for delay lines at the receiver side, which
constitute a major drawback of the conventional TR and DTR schemes, while it
also requires no channel estimations, resulting in lower complexity
implementations and power savings. The performance of the SR scheme is
investigated in high-frequency (HF) channels, showing that it offers a better
or comparable performance to that of DTR, depending on the channel conditions.
