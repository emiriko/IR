Measurements by the STAR collaboration of the cross section and transverse
single spin asymmetry (SSA) of neutral pion production at large Feynman x (x_F)
in pp-collisions at \sqrt{s}=200 GeV were reported previously. The x_F
dependence of the asymmetry can be described by phenomenological models that
include the Sivers effect, Collins effect or higher twist contributions in the
initial and final states. Discriminating between the Sivers and Collins effects
requires one to go beyond inclusive \pi^0 measurements. For the 2008 run,
forward calorimetry at STAR was significantly extended. The large acceptance of
the Forward Meson Spectrometer (FMS) allows us to look at heavier meson states
and \pi^0-\pi^0 correlations. Recent results, the status of current analyses
and near-term plans will be discussed.
