A theory is presented of the longitudinal dispersion of DNA under equilibrium
confined in a nanochannel. Orientational fluctuations of the DNA chain build up
to give rise to substantial fluctuations of the coil in the longitudinal
direction of the channel. The translational and orientational degrees of
freedom of the polymer are described by the Green function satisfying the usual
Fokker-Planck equation. It is argued that this is analogous to the transport
equation occurring in the theory of convective diffusion of particles in pipe
flow. Moreover, Taylor's method may be used to reduce the Fokker-Planck
equation to a diffusion equation for long DNA although subtleties arise
connected with the orientational distribution of segments within the channel.
The longitudinal "step length" turns out to be proportional to the typical
angle of a DNA segment to the sixth power. The dispersion is underestimated
compared to experiment, probably because the harmonic approximation is used to
describe the polymer confinement.
