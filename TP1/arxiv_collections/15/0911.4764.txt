Theories beyond the Standard Model must respect its gauge symmetry. This
implies strict constraints on the possible models of Non-Standard Neutrino
Interactions (NSIs). We review here the present status of NSIs from the point
of view of effective field theory. Our recent work on the restrictions implied
by Standard Model gauge invariance is provided along with some examples of
possible gauge invariant models featuring non-standard interactions.
