(Abridged) The main purpose of this paper is to consider the contribution of
all three non-thermal components to total mass measurements of galaxy clusters:
cosmic rays, turbulence and magnetic pressures. To estimate the thermal
pressure we used public XMM-\textit{Newton} archival data of 5 Abell clusters.
To describe the magnetic pressure, we assume a radial distribution for the
magnetic field, $B(r) \propto \rho_{g}^{\alpha}$, to seek generality we assume
$\alpha$ within the range of 0.5 to 0.9, as indicated by observations and
numerical simulations. For the turbulent component, we assumed an isotropic
pressure, $P_{\rm turb} = {1/3}\rho_{\rm g}(\sigma_{r}^{2}+\sigma_{t}^{2})$. We
also consider the contribution of cosmic ray pressure, $P_{cr}\propto
r^{-0.5}$. It follows that a consistent description for the non-thermal
component could yield variation in mass estimates that vary from 10% up to
$\sim$30%. We verified that in the inner parts of cool-core clusters the cosmic
ray component is comparable to the magnetic pressure, while in non cool-core
cluster the cosmic ray component is dominant. For cool-core clusters the
magnetic pressure is the dominant component, contributing with more than 50% of
total mass variation due to non-thermal pressure components. However, for non
cool-core clusters, the major influence comes from the cosmic ray pressure that
accounts with more than 80% of total mass variation due to non-thermal pressure
effects. For our sample, the maximum influence of the turbulent component to
total mass variation can be almost 20%. We show that this analysis can be
regarded as a starting point for a more detailed and refined exploration of the
influence of non-thermal pressure in the intra-cluster medium (ICM).
