We study the phenomenology of mixed-sneutrino dark matter in the Minimal
R-Symmetric Supersymmetric Standard Model (MRSSM). Mixed sneutrinos fit
naturally within the MRSSM, as the smallness (or absence) of neutrino Yukawa
couplings singles out sneutrino A-terms as the only ones not automatically
forbidden by R-symmetry. We perform a study of randomly generated sneutrino
mass matrices and find that (i) the measured value of $\Omega_{DM}$ is well
within the range of typical values obtained for the relic abundance of the
lightest sneutrino, (ii) with small lepton-number-violating mass terms
$m_{nn}^{2} {\tilde n} {\tilde n}$ for the right-handed sneutrinos, random
matrices satisfying the $\Omega_{DM}$ constraint have a decent probability of
satisfying direct detection constraints, and much of the remaining parameter
space will be probed by upcoming experiments, (iii) the $m_{nn}^{2} {\tilde n}
{\tilde n}$ terms radiatively generate appropriately small Majorana neutrino
masses, with neutrino oscillation data favoring a mostly sterile lightest
sneutrino with a dominantly mu/tau-flavored active component, and (iv) a
sneutrino LSP with a significant mu component can lead to striking signals of
e-mu flavor violation in dilepton invariant-mass distributions at the LHC.
