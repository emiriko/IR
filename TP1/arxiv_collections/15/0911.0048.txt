Validation of models for powder flow requires that the models be stochastic
and that they be fit by statistical inference. Methods from spatial and
multivariate statistics can be used for model fitting and assessment. If the
quality of the fitted model is not assessed, there is a significant risk the
model will fail to represent the physics of powder flow.
