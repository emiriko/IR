In particular, without the greenhouse effect, essential features of the
atmospheric temperature profile as a function of height cannot be described,
i.e., the existence of the tropopause above which we see an almost isothermal
temperature curve, whereas beneath it the temperature curve is nearly
adiabatic. The relationship between the greenhouse effect and observed
temperature curve is explained and the paper by Gerlich and Tscheuschner
[arXiv:0707.1161] critically analyzed. Gerlich and Tscheuschner called for this
discussion in their paper.
