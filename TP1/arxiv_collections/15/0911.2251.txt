Multiplicative processes and multifractals have earned increased popularity
in applications ranging from hydrodynamic turbulence to computer network
traffic, from image processing to economics. We analyse the multifractality of
the recently proposed point process models generating the signals exhibiting
1/f^b noise. The models may be used for modeling and analysis of stochastic
processes in different systems. We show that the multiplicative point process
models generate multifractal signals, in contrast to the formally constructed
signals with 1/f^b noise and signals consisting of sum of the uncorrelated
components with a wide-range distribution of the relaxation times.
