Local magnetization hysteresis is among the most extensively studied features
of high-temperature superconductors (HTSC). The usual source of hysteresis in
superconductors is bulk vortex pinning due to material defects. Two additional
known mechanisms of magnetic irreversibility are the Bean-Livingston surface
barrier and the geometrical barrier (GB). GB arises due to a competition
between the line energy of a vortex penetrating into the sample and the Lorentz
force of Meissner currents which focuses vortices in the sample's center to
form a dome-shaped vortex distribution. This work demonstrates that dc in-plane
field overcomes hysteresis mainly through the GB suppression in a region of
phase diagram under consideration (high temperatures and low fields).
