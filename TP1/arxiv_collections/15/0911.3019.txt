Seals are extremely useful devices to prevent fluid leakage. We present an
effective medium theory of the leak-rate of rubber seals, which is based on a
recently developed contact mechanics theory. We compare the theory with
experimental results for seals consisting of silicon rubber in contact with
sandpaper and sand-blasted PMMA surfaces.
