A natural optimization model that formulates many online resource allocation
and revenue management problems is the online linear program (LP) in which the
constraint matrix is revealed column by column along with the corresponding
objective coefficient. In such a model, a decision variable has to be set each
time a column is revealed without observing the future inputs and the goal is
to maximize the overall objective function. In this paper, we provide a
near-optimal algorithm for this general class of online problems under the
assumption of random order of arrival and some mild conditions on the size of
the LP right-hand-side input. Specifically, our learning-based algorithm works
by dynamically updating a threshold price vector at geometric time intervals,
where the dual prices learned from the revealed columns in the previous period
are used to determine the sequential decisions in the current period. Due to
the feature of dynamic learning, the competitiveness of our algorithm improves
over the past study of the same problem. We also present a worst-case example
showing that the performance of our algorithm is near-optimal.
