Using the CLAS detector system in Hall B at Jefferson Lab, we have done a
high statistics measurement of the photoproduction of K+ Lambda(1405) using a
proton target. The reconstructed invariant mass seen in the various Sigma pi
decay modes has been measured, as well as the differential cross section
dsigma/dt. The nature of the Lambda(1405) with its peculiar mass distribution
is not well understood, and studies have shown that it may posess strong
dynamical components, which could be extracted from our data. Various aspects
of our analysis are discussed, as well as future prospects to further enhance
the precision of the results.
