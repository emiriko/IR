We study the dynamics of a general scalar field, a tachyon or an ordinary
scalar, in the presence of world-volume massless fields in the DBI effective
theory by exploring their exact solutions. The obtained solutions indicate that
the effective mass of the general scalar on a uniformly moving D-brane
decreases, even to zero. For the tachyon case, the result implies that unstable
D-branes decay slower when moving faster. The effective mass is also reduced on
D-strings or in the space-independent case on arbitrarily dimensional D-branes
with constant electromagnetic fields. The result for a tachyon indicates that
the electric fields tend to slow down while the magnetic fields tend to
expedite the decay process of unstable D-branes. In the spacetime-dependent
case, D$p$-branes with $p\geq2$ in the presence of constant electromagnetic
fields can fluctuate only in some restricted modes so that they propagate no
faster than light. We also find solutions showing that D$p$-branes ($p\geq2$)
carrying a beam of electromagnetic waves are propagating together with the
electromagnetic waves. On such D$p$-branes, the tachyon gets stable while the
massive scalar gets unstable if we demand their spacetime-dependent solutions
to be real.
