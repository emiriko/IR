Within the framework of the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization
approach, we compute the polarization of prompt J/psi produced at the
Brookhaven's Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider from proton-proton collisions at
the center-of-momentum energy sqrt{s}=200 GeV. The perturbative contributions
are computed at leading order in the strong coupling constant. The prediction
reveals that the color-singlet contribution severely underestimates the PHENIX
preliminary data for the differential cross section integrated over the
rapidity range |y|<0.35 and its contribution is strongly transversely
polarized, which disagrees with the PHENIX preliminary data. After including
the color-octet contributions, we find that the NRQCD predictions for both the
cross section and polarization over the transverse-momentum range 1.5 GeV < p_T
< 5 GeV (1.5 GeV < p_T < 2 GeV) integrated over the rapidity range |y|<0.35
(1.2 < |y| < 2.2) agree with the data within errors.
