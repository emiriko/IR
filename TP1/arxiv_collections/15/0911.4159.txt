Twenty cases of different brain pathology have been studied via MRI using an
open resistive magnet with magnetic field strength of 0.2 Tesla. The relative
signal intensity with respect to the repetition time (TR) at fixed echo time
(TE) 0.117 sec. has been studied. It was found that the signal intensity
saturates for most lesions beyond a certain TR~6 sec in the T2 - weighted
image. The signal intensity differs with respect to the inversion time (TI) for
fat and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It was found that the intensity is nulled
for CSF at TI ~1.5 sec. and for Fat at TI~0.10 sec in the FLAIR imaging
sequence. Thus the intensity of the lesions is qualitatively different for the
two sequences. From the radiological diagnostic point of view, it was concluded
that the FLAIR sequence is more useful for the detection of lesions compared to
T2 sequences.
