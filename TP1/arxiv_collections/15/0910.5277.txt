We study the effect of tensor correlations on single-particle and collective
states within Skyrme Hartree-Fock and RPA model. Firstly, We study the role of
tensor interactions in Skyrme effective interaction on the spin-orbit
splittings of N=82 isotones and Z=50 isotope.
  The isospin dependence of the shell structure is well described as the
results of the tensor interactions without destroying good properties of the
binding energy and the rms charge radii of the heavy nuclei. Secondly, We
performed self-consistent HF+RPA calculations for charge exchange 1$^+$ states
in $^{90}$Zr and $^{208}$Pb to elucidate the role of tensor interactions on
spin dependent excitations. It is pointed out that Gamow-Teller(GT) states can
couple strongly with the spin-quadrupole (SQ) 1$^+$ states in the high energy
region above E$_x$=30 MeV due to the tensor interactions. As the result of this
coupling, more than 10% of the GT strength is shifted to the energy region
above 30 MeV, and the main GT peak is moved 2 MeV downward.
