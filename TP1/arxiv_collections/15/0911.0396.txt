We study the dependence of the intrinsic spin Hall effect on the crystal
symmetry and geometry of experiment. The spin current is obtained and the Hall
voltage caused by the polarization of the electron spins is computed. The
unique dependence of the effect on the crystal symmetry permits the choice of
geometry in which the spin Hall effect can be unambiguously distinguished from
the effects due to the orbital motion of charge carriers and due to the
magnetic field generated by the transport current.
