We introduce the problem of communication with partial information, where
there is an asymmetry between the transmitter and the receiver codebooks.
Practical applications of the proposed setup include the robust signal hashing
problem within the context of multimedia security and asymmetric communications
with resource-lacking receivers. We study this setup in a binary detection
theoretic context for the additive colored Gaussian noise channel. In our
proposed setup, the partial information available at the detector consists of
dimensionality-reduced versions of the transmitter codewords, where the
dimensionality reduction is achieved via a linear transform. We first derive
the corresponding MAP-optimal detection rule and the corresponding conditional
probability of error (conditioned on the partial information the detector
possesses). Then, we constructively quantify an optimal class of linear
transforms, where the cost function is the expected Chernoff bound on the
conditional probability of error of the MAP-optimal detector.
