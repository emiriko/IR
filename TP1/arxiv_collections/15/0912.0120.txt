The covariant generalizations of the background dark sector coupling
suggested in G. Mangano, G. Miele and V. Pettorino, Mod. Phys. Lett. A 18, 831
(2003) are considered. The evolution of perturbations is studied with detailed
attention to interaction rate that is proportional to the product of dark
matter and dark energy densities. It is shown that some classes of models with
coupling of this type do not suffer from early time instabilities in strong
coupling regime.
