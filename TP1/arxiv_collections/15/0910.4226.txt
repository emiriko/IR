The goal of this paper is to understand from a mathematical point of view the
magnetic confinement of plasmas for fusion. Following Fr\'enod and
Sonnendr\"ucker \cite{FS2}, we first use two-scale convergence tools to derive
a gyrokinetic system for a plasma submitted to a large magnetic field with a
slowly spatially varying intensity. We formally derive from this system a
simplified bi-temperature fluid system. We then investigate the behaviour of
the plasma in such a regime and we prove nonlinear stability or instability
depending on which side of the tokamak we are looking at. In our analysis, we
will also point out that there exists a temperature gradient threshold beyond
which one can expect stability, even in the "bad" side : this corresponds to
the so-called H-mode.
