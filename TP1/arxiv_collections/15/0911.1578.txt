Domain wall structure which may form in theories with spontaneously broken
parity is generically in conflict with standard cosmology. It has been argued
that Planck scale suppressed effects can be sufficient for removing such domain
walls. We study this possibility for three specific evolution scenarios for the
domain walls, with evolution during radiation dominated era, during matter
dominated era, and that accompanied by weak inflation. We determine the
operators permitted by the supergravity formalism and find that the field
content introduced to achieve desired spontaneous parity breaking makes
possible Planck scale suppressed terms which can potentially remove the domain
walls safely. However, the parity breaking scale, equivalently the majorana
mass scale $M_R$ of the right handed neutrino, does get constrained in some of
the cases, notably for the matter dominated evolution case which would be
generic to string theory inspired models giving rise to moduli fields. One
left-right symmetric model with only triplets and bidoublets is found to be
more constrainted than another admitting a gauge singlet.
