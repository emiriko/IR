Let $d\nu$ be a measure in $\mathbb{R}^d$ obtained from adding a set of mass
points to another measure $d\mu$. Orthogonal polynomials in several variables
associated with $d\nu$ can be explicitly expressed in terms of orthogonal
polynomials associated with $d\mu$, so are the reproducing kernels associated
with these polynomials. The explicit formulas that are obtained are further
specialized in the case of Jacobi measure on the simplex, with mass points
added on the vertices, which are then used to study the asymptotics kernel
functions for $d\nu$.
