Servo lag errors in adaptive optics lead to inaccurate compensation of
wavefront distortions. An attempt has been made to predict future wavefronts
using data mining on wavefronts of the immediate past to reduce these errors.
Monte Carlo simulations were performed on experimentally obtained data that
closely follows Kolmogorov phase characteristics. An improvement of 6% in
wavefront correction is reported after data mining is performed. Data mining is
performed in three steps (a) Data cube Segmentation (b) Polynomial
Interpolation and (c) Wavefront Estimation. It is important to optimize the
segment size that gives best prediction results. Optimization of the best
predictable future helps in selecting a suitable exposure time.
