Many approaches are developed for the forecasting of the Earth rotation
pa-rameters. In this work, we consider long-term vector prediction scheme
realized on the artificial neural network. Learning set is formed on basis of
the Taken' algorithm. Our approach allows us to obtain the vector of the
parameter values and escape the expo-nential growth of the prediction errors.
The versions of the prediction enhancement based on the using for nonlinear
corrector are discussed.
