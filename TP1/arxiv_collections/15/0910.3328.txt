The proton-to-pion ratios measured in the BRAHMS experiment for Au+Au and p+p
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4 and 200 GeV are presented as a function of
transverse momentum and collision centrality at selected pseudorapidities in
the range of 0 to 3.8. A strong pseudorapidity dependence of these ratios is
observed. We also compare the magnitude and p_T-dependence of the p/pi ratios
measured in Au+Au collisions at \rootsnn{200} and $\eta \approx 2.2$ with the
same ratio measured at \rootsnn{62.4} and $\eta = 0$. The great similarity
found between these ratios throughout the whole p_T range (up to 2.2 GeV/$c$)
is consistent with particle ratios in A+A collisions being described with
grand-canonical distributions characterized by the baryo-chemical potential
\mibn. At the collision energy of 62.4 GeV, we have observed a unique point in
pseudorapidity, $\eta = 3.2$, where the p/pi+ ratio is independent of the
collision system size in a wide p_T-range of $0.3 \le p_{T} \le 1.8$ GeV/$c$.
