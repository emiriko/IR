We report a quantum optical storage time-extended near perfect photon echo
protocol using a phase locking method via an auxiliary spin state, where the
phase locking acts as a conditional stopper of the rephasing process resulting
in extension of storage time determined by the spin dephasing process. The near
perfect retrieval efficiency is owing to phase conjugate scheme, which gives
the important benefit of aberration corrections when dealing with quantum
images.
