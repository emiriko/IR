We present an analysis of the luminosity distances of Type Ia Supernovae from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) Supernova Survey in conjunction with
other intermediate redshift (z<0.4) cosmological measurements including
redshift-space distortions from the Two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey
(2dFGRS), the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect seen by the SDSS, and the
latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) distance scale from both the SDSS and
2dFGRS. We have analysed the SDSS-II SN data alone using a variety of
"model-independent" methods and find evidence for an accelerating universe at
>97% level from this single dataset. We find good agreement between the
supernova and BAO distance measurements, both consistent with a
Lambda-dominated CDM cosmology, as demonstrated through an analysis of the
distance duality relationship between the luminosity (d_L) and angular diameter
(d_A) distance measures. We then use these data to estimate w within this
restricted redshift range (z<0.4). Our most stringent result comes from the
combination of all our intermediate-redshift data (SDSS-II SNe, BAO, ISW and
redshift-space distortions), giving w = -0.81 +0.16 -0.18(stat) +/- 0.15(sys)
and Omega_M=0.22 +0.09 -0.08 assuming a flat universe. This value of w, and
associated errors, only change slightly if curvature is allowed to vary,
consistent with constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background. We also
consider more limited combinations of the geometrical (SN, BAO) and dynamical
(ISW, redshift-space distortions) probes.
