Soliton dynamics in spin-textured metals generate electrical currents, which
produce backaction through spin torques. We modify the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation and the corresponding solitonic equations of motion to include such
higher-order texture effects. We also find a quasistatic equation for the
induced electrochemical potential, which needs to be solved for
self-consistently, in the incompressible limit. As an example, we consider the
orbital motion of a vortex in a point-contact spin valve, and discuss
modifications of orbit radius, frequency, and dissipation power.
