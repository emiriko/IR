Extrasolar planets are not named and are referred to only by their assigned
scientific designation. The reason given by the IAU to not name the planets is
that it is considered impractical as planets are expected to be common. I
advance some reasons as to why this logic is flawed, and suggest names for the
403 extrasolar planet candidates known as of Oct 2009. The names follow a
scheme of association with the constellation that the host star pertains to,
and therefore are mostly drawn from Roman-Greek mythology. Other mythologies
may also be used given that a suitable association is established.
