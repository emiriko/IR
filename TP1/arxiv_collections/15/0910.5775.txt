Ten years ago our team completed the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project on
the extragalactic distance scale. Cepheids were detected in some 25 galaxies
and used to calibrate four secondary distance indicators that reach out into
the expansion field beyond the noise of galaxy peculiar velocities. The result
was H_0 = 72 +/- 8 km/sec/Mpc and put an end to galaxy distances uncertain by a
factor of two. This work has been awarded the Gruber Prize in Cosmology for
2009.
