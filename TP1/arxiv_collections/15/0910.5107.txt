We consider the computational complexity of the question whether a certain
strategy can be removed from a game by means of iterated elimination of
dominated strategies. In particular, we study the influence of different
definitions of domination and of the number of different payoff values. In
addition, the consequence of restriction to constant-sum games is shown.
