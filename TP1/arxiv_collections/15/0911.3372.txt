The electronic structure of the neutral and singly charged Mg vacancy in MgO
is investigated using density functional theory. For both defects, semilocal
exchange correlation functionals such as the local spin density approximation
incorrectly predict a delocalized degenerate ground state. In contrast
functionals that take strong correlation effects into account predict a
localized solution, in agreement with spin resonance experiments. Our results,
obtained with the HSE hybrid, atomic self-interaction corrected and LDA+U
functionals, provide a number of constraints to the possibility of
ferromagnetism in hole doped MgO.
