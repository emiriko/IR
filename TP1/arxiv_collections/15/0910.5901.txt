We have used archival HST H$\alpha$ images to study the immediate
environments of massive and intermediate-mass young stellar object (YSO)
candidates in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The sample of YSO candidates,
taken from Gruendl & Chu (2009), was selected based on Spitzer IRAC and MIPS
observations of the entire LMC and complementary ground-based optical and
near-infrared observations. We found HST H$\alpha$ images for 99 YSO candidates
in the LMC, of which 82 appear to be genuine YSOs. More than 95% of the YSOs
are found to be associated with molecular clouds. YSOs are seen in three
different kinds of environments in the H$\alpha$ images: in dark clouds, inside
or on the tip of bright-rimmed dust pillars, and in small H II regions.
Comparisons of spectral energy distributions for YSOs in these three different
kinds of environments suggest that YSOs in dark clouds are the youngest, YSOs
with small H II regions are the most evolved, and YSOs in bright-rimmed dust
pillars span a range of intermediate evolutionary stages. This rough
evolutionary sequence is substantiated by the presence of silicate absorption
features in the Spitzer IRS spectra of some YSOs in dark clouds and in
bright-rimmed dust pillars, but not those of YSOs in small H II regions. We
present a discussion on triggered star formation for YSOs in bright-rimmed dust
pillars or in dark clouds adjacent to H II regions. As many as 50% of the YSOs
are resolved into multiple sources in high-resolution HST images. This
illustrates the importance of using high-resolution images to probe the true
nature and physical properties of YSOs in the LMC.
