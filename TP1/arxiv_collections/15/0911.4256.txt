The approximate radial wave functions for the Cornell potential describing
quark-antiquark interaction are constructed in the framework of a variational
method. The optimal values of the variational parameters are fixed by the
fulfillment of the requirements of the virial theorem and the minimality
condition for integral discrepancy. The results of calculation with the simple
trial function are in a good agreement with exact numerical results.
