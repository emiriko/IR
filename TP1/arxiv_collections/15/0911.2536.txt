We study the possibility to describe pure quantum states and evens with
classical probability distributions and conditional probabilities and show that
the distributions and/or conditional probabilities have to assume negative
values, except for a simple model whose realistic space dimension is not
smaller than the Hilbert space dimension of the quantum system. This gives a
negative answer to a question proposed by Montina [Phys.Rev.Lett.{\bf 97},
180401 (2006)] whether or not does there exist a classical theory whose
phase-space dimension is much smaller than the Hilbert space dimension for any
quantum system. Thus, any realistic theory of quantum mechanics with
nonnegative probability distributions and conditional probabilities requires a
number of variables grows exponentially with the physical size.
