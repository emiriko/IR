A 2D contact dynamics model is proposed as a microscopic description of a
collapsing suspension/soil to capture the essential physical processes
underlying the dynamics of generation and collapse of the system. Our physical
model is compared with real data obtained from in situ measurements performed
with a natural collapsing/suspension soil. We show that the shear strength
behavior of our collapsing suspension/soil model is very similar to the
behavior of this collapsing suspension soil, for both the unperturbed and the
perturbed phases of the material.
