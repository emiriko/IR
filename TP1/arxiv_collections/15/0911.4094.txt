We point out and explicitly demonstrate a close connection that exists
between featureless Mott insulators and fractional quantum Hall liquids. Using
magnetic Wannier states as the single-particle basis in the lowest Landau level
(LLL), we demonstrate that the Hamiltonian of interacting bosons in the LLL
maps onto a Hamiltonian of a featureless Mott insulator on triangular lattice,
formed by the magnetic Wannier states. The Hamiltonian is remarkably simple and
consists only of short-range repulsion and ring-exchange terms.
