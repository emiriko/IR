A linear deformation of a Meyer set $M$ in $\RR^d$ is the image of $M$ under
a group homomorphism of the group $[M]$ generated by $M$ into $\RR^d$. We
provide a necessary and sufficient condition for such a deformation to be a
Meyer set. In the case that the deformation is a Meyer set and the deformation
is injective, the deformation is pure point diffractive if the orginal set $M$
is pure point diffractive.
