We present an experimental study of thin-sample directional solidification
(T-DS) in impure biphenyl. The plate-like growth shape of the monoclinic
biphenyl crystals includes two low-mobility (001) facets and four high-mobility
{110} facets. Upon T-DS, biphenyl plates oriented with (001) facets parallel to
the sample plane can exhibit either a strong growth-induced plastic deformation
(GID), or deformation-free weakly faceted (WF) growth patterns. We determine
the respective conditions of appearance of these phenomena. GID is shown to be
a long-range thermal-stress effect, which disappears when the growth front has
a cellular structure. An early triggering of the cellular instability allowed
us to avoid GID and study the dynamics of WF patterns as a function of the
orientation of the crystal.
