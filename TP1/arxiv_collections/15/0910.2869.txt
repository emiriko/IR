We study the disorder effect of resonant spin Hall effect in a two-dimension
electron system with Rashba coupling in the presence of a tilted magnetic
field. The competition between the Rashba coupling and the Zeeman coupling
leads to the energy crossing of the Landau levels, which gives rise to the
resonant spin Hall effect. Utilizing the Streda's formula within the
self-consistent Born approximation, we find that the impurity scattering
broadens the energy levels, and the resonant spin Hall conductance exhibits a
double peak around the resonant point, which is recovered in an applied titled
magnetic field.
