A model is presented for generation of fast solar wind in coronal holes,
relying on heating that is dominated by turbulent dissipation of MHD
fluctuations transported upwards in the solar atmosphere. Scale-separated
transport equations include large-scale fields, transverse Alfvenic
fluctuations, and a small compressive dissipation due to parallel shears near
the transition region. The model accounts for proton temperature, density, wind
speed, and fluctuation amplitude as observed in remote sensing and in situ
satellite data.
