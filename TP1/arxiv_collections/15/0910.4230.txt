Point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy (PCARS) is applied to
investigate the gap structure in iron pnictide single crystal superconductors
of the AFe_2As_2 (A=Ba, Sr) family ("Fe-122"). The observed point-contact
junction conductance curves, G(V), can be divided into two categories: one
where Andreev reflection is present for both (Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4})Fe_2As_2 and
Ba(Fe_{0.9}Co_{0.1})_2As_2, and the other with a V^{2/3} background conductance
universally observed extending even up to 100 meV for Sr_{0.6}Na_{0.4}Fe_2As_2
and Sr(Fe_{0.9}Co_{0.1})_2As_2. The latter is also observed in point-contact
junctions on the nonsuperconducting parent compound BaFe_2As_2. Mesoscopic
phase-separated coexistence of magnetic and superconducting orders is
considered to explain distinct behaviors in the superconducting samples. For
Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_2As_2, double peaks due to Andreev reflection with
strongly-sloping background are frequently observed for point-contacts on
freshly-cleaved c-axis surfaces. If normalized by a background baseline and
analyzed by the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model, the data show a gap size
~3.0-4.0 meV with 2\Delta_0/k_BT_c ~ 2.0-2.6, consistent with the smaller gap
size reported in the LnFeAsO family ("Fe-1111"). For the
Ba(Fe_{0.9}Co_{0.1})_2As_2, G(V) curves typically display a zero-bias
conductance peak.
