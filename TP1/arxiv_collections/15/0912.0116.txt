The purpose of this paper is to investigate ternary multiplications
constructed from a binary multiplication, linear twisting maps and a trace
function. We provide a construction of ternary Hom-Nambu and Hom-Nambu-Lie
algebras starting from a binary multiplication of a Hom-Lie algebra and a trace
function satisfying certain compatibility conditions involving twisting maps.
We show that mutual position of kernels of twisting maps and the trace play
important role in this context, and provide examples of Hom-Nambu-Lie algebras
obtained using this construction.
