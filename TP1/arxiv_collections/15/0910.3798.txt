Perfect state transfer (PST) is discussed in the context of passive quantum
networks with logical bus topology, where many logical nodes communicate using
the same shared media, without any external control. The conditions under
which, a number of point-to-point PST links may serve as building blocks for
the design of such multi-node networks are investigated. The implications of
our results are discussed in the context of various Hamiltonians that act on
the entire network, and are capable of providing PST between the logical nodes
of a prescribed set in a deterministic manner.
