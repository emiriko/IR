We present results of the investigation of the nature of double periodic
variables (DPVs). We have selected a sample of Galactic eclipsing DPVs for a
multiwavelength photometric study aimed to reveal their nature. The short
orbital periodicity and the cyclic variability are decoupled and separately
investigated. Shapes of orbital light curves are consistent with semi-detached
binaries. The amplitude of the long cycle is always larger in redder
bandpasses.
