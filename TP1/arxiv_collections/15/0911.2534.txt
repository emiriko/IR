I study two-flavor staggered chiral perturbation theory in the light
pseudoscalar sector. The pion mass and decay constant are calculated through
NLO in the partially-quenched case. In the limit where the strange quark mass
is large compared to the light quark masses and the taste splittings, I show
that the SU(2) staggered chiral theory emerges from the SU(3) staggered chiral
theory, as expected. Explicit relations between SU(2) and SU(3) low energy
constants and taste-violating parameters are given. The results are useful for
SU(2) chiral fits to asqtad data and allow one to incorporate effects from
varying strange quark masses.
