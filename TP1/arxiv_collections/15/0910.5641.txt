Realistic stellar models are essential to the forward modelling approach in
asteroseismology. For practicality however, certain model assumptions are also
required. For example, in the case of subdwarf B stars, one usually starts with
zero-age horizontal branch structures without following the progenitor
evolution. We analyse the effects of common assumptions in subdwarf B models on
the g-mode pulsational properties. We investigate if and how the pulsation
periods are affected by the H-profile in the core-envelope transition zone.
Furthermore, the effects of C-production and convective mixing during the core
helium flash are evaluated. Finally, we reanalyse the effects of stellar
opacities on the mode excitation in subdwarf B stars. We find that helium
settling causes a shift in the theoretical blue edge of the g-mode instability
domain to higher effective temperatures. This results in a closer match to the
observed instability strip of long-period sdB pulsators, particularly for l<=3
modes. We show further that the g-mode spectrum is extremely sensitive to the
H-profile in the core-envelope transition zone. If atomic diffusion is
efficient, details of the initial shape of the profile become less important in
the course of evolution. Diffusion broadens the chemical gradients, and results
in less effective mode trapping and different pulsation periods. Furthermore,
we report on the possible consequences of the He-flash for the g-modes. The
outer edge of a flash-induced convective region introduces an additional
chemical transition in the stellar models, and the corresponding spike in the
Brunt-Vaisala frequency produces a complicated mode trapping signature in the
period spacings.
