We propose a new mass matrix ansatz: At the grand unified (GU) scale, the
standard model (SM) Yukawa coupling matrix elements are integer powers of the
square root of the GU gauge coupling constant \varepsilon \equiv
\sqrt{\alpha_{\text{GU}}}, multiplied by order unity random complex numbers. It
relates the hierarchy of the SM ermion masses and quark mixings to the gauge
coupling constants, greatly reducing the SM parameters, and can give good
fitting results of the SM fermion mass, quark mixing and CP violation
parameters. This is a neat but very effective ansatz.
