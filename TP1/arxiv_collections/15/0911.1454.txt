With the program HistCite(TM) it is possible to generate and visualize the
most relevant papers in a set of documents retrieved from the Science Citation
Index. Historical reconstructions of scientific developments can be represented
chronologically as developments in networks of citation relations extracted
from scientific literature. This study aims to go beyond the historical
reconstruction of scientific knowledge, enriching the output of HistCite(TM)
with algorithms from social network analysis and information theory.
