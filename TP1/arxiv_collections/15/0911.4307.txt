Quantum Darwinism provides an information-theoretic framework for the
emergence of the objective, classical world from the quantum substrate. The key
to this emergence is the proliferation of redundant information throughout the
environment where observers can then intercept it. We study this process for a
purely decohering interaction when the environment, E, is in a non-ideal (e.g.,
mixed) initial state. In the case of good decoherence, that is, after the
pointer states have been unambiguously selected, the mutual information between
the system, S, and an environment fragment, F, is given solely by F's entropy
increase. This demonstrates that the environment's capacity for recording the
state of S is directly related to its ability to increase its entropy.
Environments that remain nearly invariant under the interaction with S, either
because they have a large initial entropy or a misaligned initial state,
therefore have a diminished ability to acquire information. To elucidate the
concept of good decoherence, we show that - when decoherence is not complete -
the deviation of the mutual information from F's entropy change is quantified
by the quantum discord, i.e., the excess mutual information between S and F is
information regarding the initial coherence between pointer states of S. In
addition to illustrating these results with a single qubit system interacting
with a multi-qubit environment, we find scaling relations for the redundancy of
information acquired by the environment that display a universal behavior
independent of the initial state of S. Our results demonstrate that Quantum
Darwinism is robust with respect to non-ideal initial states of the
environment: the environment almost always acquires redundant information about
the system but its rate of acquisition can be reduced.
