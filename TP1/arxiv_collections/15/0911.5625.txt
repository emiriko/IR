Comet 17P/Holmes was observed for linear polarisation using the optical
polarimeter mounted on the 1.2m telescope atop Gurushikhar peak near Mt. Abu
during the period November-December 2007. Observations were conducted through
the IHW narrow band (continuum) filters. During the observing run the phase
angle was near $13^{\circ}$ at which the comet showed negative polarisation. On
the basis of the observed polarisation data we find comet 17P/Holmes to be a
typical comet with usual dust characteristics. We note that radial rate of
change of brightness in coma in red band is higher than that in blue band; it
has decreased by a factor of 3.6 and 2.5 respectively in red and blue bands
during the November - December run, indicating relative increase in the
abundance of smaller dust particles out ward. Radial brightness variation seen
near the nucleus on November 6 is indicative of the presence of a blob or
shocked region beyond 10" from the nucleus which has gradually smoothened by
December 13. The brightness distribution is found steeper during November 5-7
as compared to on December 13.
