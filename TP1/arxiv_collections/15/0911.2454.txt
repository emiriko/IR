Cosmic shear is a powerful method to constrain cosmology, provided that any
systematic effects are under control. The intrinsic alignment of galaxies is
expected to severely bias parameter estimates if not taken into account. We
explore the potential of a joint analysis of tomographic galaxy ellipticity,
galaxy number density, and ellipticity-number density cross-correlations to
simultaneously constrain cosmology and self-calibrate unknown intrinsic
alignment and galaxy bias contributions. We treat intrinsic alignments and
galaxy biasing as free functions of scale and redshift and marginalise over the
resulting parameter sets. Constraints on cosmology are calculated by combining
the likelihoods from all two-point correlations between galaxy ellipticity and
galaxy number density. The information required for these calculations is
already available in a standard cosmic shear dataset. We include contributions
to these functions from cosmic shear, intrinsic alignments, galaxy clustering
and magnification effects. In a Fisher matrix analysis we compare our
constraints with those from cosmic shear alone in the absence of intrinsic
alignments. For a potential future large area survey, such as Euclid, the extra
information from the additional correlation functions can make up for the
additional free parameters in the intrinsic alignment and galaxy bias terms,
depending on the flexibility in the models. For example, the Dark Energy Task
Force figure of merit is recovered even when more than 100 free parameters are
marginalised over. We find that the redshift quality requirements are similar
to those calculated in the absence of intrinsic alignments.
