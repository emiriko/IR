Properties of the Olami-Feder-Christensen (OFC) model of earthquakes are
studied by numerical simulations. The previous study indicated that the model
exhibits ``asperity''-like phenomena, {\it i.e.}, the same region ruptures many
times near periodically [T.Kotani {\it et al}, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 77}, 010102
(2008)]. Such periodic or characteristic features apparently coexist with
power-law-like critical features, {\it e.g.}, the Gutenberg-Richter law
observed in the size distribution. In order to clarify the origin and the
nature of the asperity-like phenomena, we investigate here the properties of
the OFC model with emphasis on its stress distribution. It is found that the
asperity formation is accompanied by self-organization of the highly
concentrated stress state. Such stress organization naturally provides the
mechanism underlying our observation that a series of asperity events repeat
with a common epicenter site and with a common period solely determined by the
transmission parameter of the model. Asperity events tend to cluster both in
time and in space.
