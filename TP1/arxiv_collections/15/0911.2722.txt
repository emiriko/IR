In this paper we develop a probabilistic micro-scale compartmental model and
use it to study macro-scale properties of axonal transport, the process by
which intracellular cargo is moved in the axons of neurons. By directly
modeling the smallest scale interactions, we can use recent microscopic
experimental observations to infer all the parameters of the model. Then, using
techniques from probability theory, we compute asymptotic limits of the
stochastic behavior of individual motor-cargo complexes, while also
characterizing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium ensemble behavior. We use
these results in order to investigate three important biological questions: (1)
How homogeneous are axons at stochastic equilibrium? (2) How quickly can axons
return to stochastic equilibrium after large local perturbations? (3) How is
our understanding of delivery time to a depleted target region changed by
taking the whole cell point-of-view?
