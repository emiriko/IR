One possible channel for the formation of dwarf galaxies involves birth in
the tidal tails of interacting galaxies. We report the detection of a bright UV
tidal tail and several young tidal dwarf galaxy candidates in the post-merger
galaxy NGC 4922 in the Coma cluster. Based on a two-component population model
(combining young and old stellar populations), we find that the light of tidal
tail predominantly comes from young stars (a few Myr old). The Galaxy Evolution
Explorer (GALEX) ultraviolet data played a critical role in the parameter (age
and mass) estimation. Our stellar mass estimates of the tidal dwarf galaxy
candidates are ~ 10^{6-7} M_sun, typical for dwarf galaxies.
