Combination of Fresnel Zone Plates (FZP) can make an excellent telescope for
imaging in X-rays. We present here the results of our experiments with several
pairs of tungsten made Fresnel Zone plates in presence of an X-ray source kept
at a distance of about 45 feet. The quasi-parallel beam allowed us to study
sources placed on the axis as well as off the axis of the telescope. We present
theoretical study of the fringe patterns produced by the zone plates in
presence of a quasi-parallel source. We compare the patterns obtained from
experiments with those obtained by our Monte-Carlo simulations. The images are
also reconstructed by deconvolution from both the patterns. We compare the
performance of such a telescope with other X-ray imaging devices used in
space-astronomy.
