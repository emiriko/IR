We propose here a robust scheme to infer the physical parameters of compact
stars from their f-mode gravitational wave signals. We first show that the
frequency and the damping rate of f-mode oscillation of compact stars can be
expressed in terms of universal functions of stellar mass and moment of
inertia. By employing the universality in the f-mode one can then infer
accurate values of the mass, the moment of inertia and the radius of a compact
star. In addition, we demonstrate that our new scheme works well for both
realistic neutron stars and quark stars, and hence provides a unifying way to
infer the physical parameters of compact stars.
