We consider non-local properties of quanternionic quantum mechanics, in which
the complex numbers are replaced by the quaternions as the underlying algebra.
Specifically, we show that it is possible to construct a non-local box. This
allows one to rule out quaternionic quantum mechanics using assumptions about
communication complexity or information causality.
