Recent results on pion physics from lattice QCD are reviewed. We discuss
quark mass dependences of pion mass and decay constant and compare them with
the predictions from chiral perturbation theory. In particular we focus on the
convergence of chiral perturbation theory around strange quark mass region. We
also consider quark mass as well as momentum dependences of pion form factors
in recent full QCD simulations.
