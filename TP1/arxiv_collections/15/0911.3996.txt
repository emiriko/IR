We consider a globally invariant chiral Lagrangian that contains vector and
axial-vector mesons. We compute the f0(600) decay width into two pions and
pion-pion scattering lengths and compare with the corresponding results in
which the (axial-)vector degrees of freedom decouple. We show that the role of
vector mesons has a great impact on these quantities.
