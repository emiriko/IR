In this note we will discuss the energy dependence of particle ratio
fluctuations in heavy ion collisions. We study how the inherent multiplicity
dependence of ratio fluctuations is reflected in the excitation function of the
dynamical fluctuations. Specifically, we will show that the observed excitation
function of dynamical $K/\pi$ fluctuations is consistent with the expected
dependence on the number of accepted pions and kaons in both the STAR and NA49
experiments.
