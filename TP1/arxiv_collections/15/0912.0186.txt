A front end ASIC (BiCMOS-SiGe 0.35 \mum) has been developed within the
framework of the MIMAC detector project, which aims at directional detection of
non-baryonic Dark Matter. This search strategy requires 3D reconstruction of
low energy (a few keV) tracks with a gaseous \muTPC. The development of this
front end ASIC is a key point of the project, allowing the 3D track
reconstruction. Each ASIC monitors 16 strips of pixels with charge
preamplifiers and their time over threshold is provided in real time by current
discriminators via two serializing LVDS links working at 320 MHz. The charge is
summed over the 16 strips and provided via a shaper. These specifications have
been chosen in order to build an auto triggered electronics. An acquisition
board and the related software were developed in order to validate this
methodology on a prototype chamber. The prototype detector presents an anode
where 2 x 96 strips of pixels are monitored.
