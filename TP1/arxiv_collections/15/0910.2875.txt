The aim of this work is to establish the celebrated Denjoy-Wolff Theorem in
the context of generalized Loewner chains. In contrast with the classical
situation where essentially convergence to a certain point in the closed unit
disk is the unique possibility, several new dynamical phenomena appear in this
framework. Indeed, $\omega$-limits formed by suitable closed arcs of
circumferences appear now as natural possibilities of asymptotic dynamical
behavior.
