We reconsidered the quantum gravity description of the near horizon extremal
Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m black hole in the viewpoint of the AdS$_2$/CFT$_1$
correspondence. We found that, for pure electric case, the right moving central
charge of dual 1D CFT is $6 Q^2$ which is different from the previous result $6
Q^3$ of left moving sector obtained by warped AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ description. We
discussed the discrepancy in these two approaches and examined novel properties
of our result.
