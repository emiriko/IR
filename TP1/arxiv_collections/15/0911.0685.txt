We re-examine claims of redshift evolution in black hole-bulge scaling
relations based on lensed quasars. In particular, we refine the black hole mass
estimates using measurements of Balmer lines from near-infrared spectroscopy
obtained with Triplespec at Apache Point Observatory. In support of previous
work, we find a large scatter between Balmer and UV line widths, both MgII
2796, 2803 and CIV 1548, 1550. There is tentative evidence that CIII] 1909,
despite being a blend of multiple transitions, may correlate well with MgII,
although a larger sample is needed for a real calibration. Most importantly, we
find no systematic changes in the estimated BH masses for the lensed sample
based on Balmer lines, providing additional support to the interpretation that
black holes were overly massive compared to their host galaxies at high
redshift.
