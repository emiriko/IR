Kosaraju in ``Computation of squares in a string'' briefly described a
linear-time algorithm for computing the minimal squares starting at each
position in a word. Using the same construction of suffix trees, we generalize
his result and describe in detail how to compute in O(k|w|)-time the minimal
k-th power, with period of length larger than s, starting at each position in a
word w for arbitrary exponent $k\geq2$ and integer $s\geq0$. We provide the
complete proof of correctness of the algorithm, which is somehow not completely
clear in Kosaraju's original paper. The algorithm can be used as a sub-routine
to detect certain types of pseudo-patterns in words, which is our original
intention to study the generalization.
