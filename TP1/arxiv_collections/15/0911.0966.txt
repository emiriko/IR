The localization length has been derived for one-dimensional bi-layered
structures with random perturbations in the refractive indices for each type of
layers. Main attention is paid to the comparison between conventional materials
and those consisting of mixed right-hand and left-hand materials. It is shown
that the localization length is described by the universal expression for both
cases. The analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations.
