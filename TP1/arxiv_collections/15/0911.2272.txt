Relativistic self-focusing and channeling of intense laser pulses have been
studied in underdense plasma using 2D PIC simulations, for different laser
powers and plasma densities. Analytical solutions for the stationary evacuated
channels have been recovered in PIC simulations. It is shown that otherwise
stable channels can accelerate electrons due to surface waves on the walls of
the channels. Relativistic filaments with finite electron density are unstable
to transverse modulations which lead in the nonlinear stage to the break-up of
laser pulses into independent filaments. Different regimes of relativistic
self-focusing and channeling, including electron heating, transverse
instability and break-up of the filaments have been discussed and characterized
using plasma density and laser power.
