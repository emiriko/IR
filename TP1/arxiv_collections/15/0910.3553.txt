Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) detectors are ideally suited
for studying neutrino interactions and probing the parameters that characterize
neutrino oscillations. The ability to drift ionization particles over long
distances in purified argon and to trigger on abundant scintillation light
allows for excellent particle identification and triggering capability. Recent
U.S. based work in the development of LAr TPC technology for massive kiloton
size detectors will be discussed in this talk, including details of the
ArgoNeuT (Argon Neutrino Test) test-beam project, which is a 175 liter LAr TPC
exposed to Fermilab's NuMI neutrino beamline.
