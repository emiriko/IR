This game is meant to be extension of the overly-beaten pacman-style game
(code-named "Yet Another Pacman 3D Adventures", or YAP3DAD) from the proposed
ideas and other projects with advance visual and computer graphics features,
including a-game-in-a-game approach. The project is an open-source project
published on SourceForge.net for possible future development and extension.
