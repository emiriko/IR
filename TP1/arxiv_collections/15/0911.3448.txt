Weak gravitational lensing provides a sensitive probe of cosmology by
measuring the mass distribution and the geometry of the low redshift universe.
We show how an all-sky weak lensing tomographic survey can jointly constrain
different sets of cosmological parameters describing dark energy, massive
neutrinos (hot dark matter), and the primordial power spectrum. In order to put
all sectors on an equal footing, we introduce a new parameter $\beta$, the
second order running spectral index. Using the Fisher matrix formalism with and
without CMB priors, we examine how the constraints vary as the parameter set is
enlarged. We find that weak lensing with CMB priors provides robust constraints
on dark energy parameters and can simultaneously provide strong constraints on
all three sectors. We find that the dark energy sector is largely insensitive
to the inclusion of the other cosmological sectors. Implications for the
planning of future surveys are discussed.
