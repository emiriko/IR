We study in the framework of the Schrodinger equation the effect of
intermolecular interactions on the tunneling racemization of the active
molecule. The active molecule is assumed as a two-level system and the
left-right isomerism is viewed in terms of a double-bottomed harmonic potential
well. The active molecule is assumed to be embedded in a gas, liquid or solid,
submitted to a perturbing potential U created by the molecules of the sample.
In our model we take into account the difference of energy E due to the weak
interactions between the left (L) and right (R) configurations. We have shown
that when E is equal to zero the system cannot be optically stable: the optical
activity tends asymptotically to zero in the case of dilute gases or compressed
gases and liquids or oscillates periodically around zero when the molecules are
isolated or submitted to a static potential. Only when E is different of zero
the system can be optically stable depending on the strength parameters of the
potential U and on the magnitude of the spontaneous tunneling.
