The "precision" frontier, which is closely related to the "intensity"
frontier, provides a complementary path to the discovery of physics beyond the
Standard Model. Several examples of discoveries that would change our view of
the physical world are: Charged lepton flavor violation, e.g. muon electron
conversion; the discovery of a permanent electric dipole moment of the
electron, neutron, muon or a nucleus. In this paper I focus mostly on phenomena
mediated by a dipole interaction, including the anomalous magnetic moment of
the muon.
