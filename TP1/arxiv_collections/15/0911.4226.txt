We introduce a coarse-grained model of DNA with bases modeled as rigid-body
ellipsoids to capture their anisotropic stereochemistry. Interaction potentials
are all physicochemical and generated from all-atom simulation/parameterization
with minimal phenomenology. Persistence length, degree of stacking, and twist
are studied by molecular dynamics simulation as functions of temperature, salt
concentration, sequence, interaction potential strength, and local position
along the chain, for both single- and double-stranded DNA where appropriate.
The model of DNA shows several phase transitions and crossover regimes in
addition to dehybridization, including unstacking, untwisting, and collapse
which affect mechanical properties such as rigidity and persistence length. The
model also exhibits chirality with a stable right-handed and metastable
left-handed helix.
