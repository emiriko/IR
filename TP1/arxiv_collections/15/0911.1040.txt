The transverse momentum spectra of secondary $\eta$ particles produced in
$P+P$, $D+Au$ and $Au+Au$ interactions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV at different
centralities have been studied in the light of a non-extensive thermodynamical
approach. The results and the possible thermodynamical insights, thus obtained,
about the hadronizing process have also been discussed in detail.
