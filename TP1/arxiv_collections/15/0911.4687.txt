On the occasion of the International Year of Astronomy (IYA2009), we present
a new interactive dictionary of astronomy and astrophysics, which contains
about 7000 entries. This interdisciplinary and multicultural work is intended
for professional and amateur astronomers, university students in astrophysics,
as well as terminologists and linguists. A new approach is pursued in the
formation of a scientific dictionary, which aims to display additional
dimensions of astronomical concepts. Although Virtual Observatories recognize
the necessity of efforts to define basic astronomical concepts and establish
their reciprocal relations, so far they have mainly been confined to archiving
observational data. The present dictionary could be an incipient contribution
to cover and inter-relate the whole astronomical lexicon beyond subfields.
