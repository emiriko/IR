We construct the quadratic analogue of the boson Fock functor. While in the
first order case all contractions on the 1--particle space can be second
quantized, the semigroup of contractions that admit a quadratic second
quantization is much smaller due to the nonlinearity. Within this semigroup we
characterize the unitary and the isometric elements.
