The time dependence of device performance has been measured for photocells
using blends containing the conjugated polymer,
poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) with two
different functionalized C60 electron acceptor molecules: commercially
available [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) or [6,6]-phenyl C61
butyric acid octadecyl ester (PCBOD) produced in this laboratory. Performance
was characterized by the short-circuit current output of the devices, with the
time dependence of PCBM samples typically degrading exponentially. Variations
in the characteristic lifetime of the devices were observed to depend on the
molar fraction of the electron acceptor molecules (calculated with respect to
the MEH-PPV monomer fraction). In comparison to the PCBM samples, the stability
of the PCBOD blends was significantly enhanced, with a one or two order of
magnitude improvement. Corresponding spectroscopic data with similar time
evolution as the transport measurements suggests an independent means for
determining and understanding degradation mechanisms.
