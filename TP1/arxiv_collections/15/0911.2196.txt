We continue former work on the modeling of potential effects of Gamma Ray
Bursts on Phanerozoic Earth. We focus on global biospheric effects of ozone
depletion and show a first modeling of the spectral reduction of light by NO2
formed in the stratosphere. We also illustrate the current complexities
involved in the prediction of how terrestrial ecosystems would respond to this
kind of burst. We conclude that more biological field and laboratory data are
needed to reach even moderate accuracy in this modeling
