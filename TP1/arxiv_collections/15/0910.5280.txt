This is my contribution to Proceedings of the International Workshop on
Cosmic Structure and Evolution, September 23-25, 2009, Bielefeld, Germany. In
my talk I presented some non-Gaussian features of the foreground reduced WMAP
five year full sky temperature maps, which were recently reported in
arXiv:0906.4954 paper by V.Vanchurin. And in these notes I first discuss the
statistics behind this analysis in some detail. Then I describe invaluable
insights which I got from discussions after my talk on the Workshop. And
finally I explain why, in my current opinion, the signal detected in
arXiv:0906.4954 can hardly have something to do with cosmological
perturbations, but rather it presents a fancy measurement of the Milky Way
angular width in the microwave frequency range.
