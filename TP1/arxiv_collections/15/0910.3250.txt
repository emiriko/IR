An accurate geometric distortion solution for the Hubble Space Telescope
UVIS-channel of Wide Field Camera 3 is the first step towards its use for high
precision astrometry. In this work we present an average correction that
enables a relative astrometric accuracy of ~1 mas (in each axis for well
exposed stars) in three broad-band ultraviolet filters (F225W, F275W, and
F336W). More data and a better understanding of the instrument are required to
constrain the solution to a higher level of accuracy.
