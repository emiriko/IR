By introducing the polytropic gas model of interacting dark energy, we obtain
the equation of state for the polytropic gas energy density in a non-flat
universe. We show that for even polytropic index by choosing
$K>Ba^{\frac{3}{n}}$, one can obtain $\omega^{\rm eff}_{\Lambda}<-1$, which
corresponds to a universe dominated by phantom dark energy.
