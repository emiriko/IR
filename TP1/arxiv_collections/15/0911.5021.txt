There is strong theoretical motivation for the study of events with 2
same-sign leptons, jets, and missing transverse energy (MET) at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). There are many compelling models, for instance,
supersymmetry and extra dimensions, which predict such signatures. On the other
hand, same-sign lepton production is very suppressed in the Standard Model.
Preparations are underway for this search using the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)
experiment, which will take data at the LHC, scheduled to start running in
2009. The CMS detector has very good measurement capabilities for muons,
electrons, jets and MET, and methods are being developed to perform sensitive
searches using the first collected data. Using results from a previous Monte
Carlo study based on this signature at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV, we
make discovery potential projections for the early 10 TeV LHC runs. While the
results of these extrapolations are encouraging, they are based purely on Monte
Carlo and, as such, should be considered only as a rough guide. Data-driven
background estimations will be critical for the success of this analysis and
are under development.
