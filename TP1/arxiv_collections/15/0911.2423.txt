While not yet in commercial existence, quantum computers have the ability to
solve certain classes of problems that are not efficiently solvable on existing
Turing Machine based (classical) computers. For quantum computers to be of use,
methods of programming them must exist. Proposals exist for programming quantum
computers, but all of the existing ones suffer from flaws that make them
impractical in commercial software development environments. Cove is a
framework for programming quantum computers that extends existing classical
languages to allow for quantum computation, thus providing a quantum computing
toolkit for commercial software developers. Since the target users of Cove are
commercial developers, it is an object oriented framework that can be used by
multiple languages and also places emphasis on complete documentation. The
focus of Cove is not so much on the software product, but on the fundamental
concepts that make quantum computing practical for common developers.
