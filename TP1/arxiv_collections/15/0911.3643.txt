Internet search engines function in a present which changes continuously. The
search engines update their indices regularly, overwriting Web pages with newer
ones, adding new pages to the index, and losing older ones. Some search engines
can be used to search for information at the internet for specific periods of
time. However, these 'date stamps' are not determined by the first occurrence
of the pages in the Web, but by the last date at which a page was updated or a
new page was added, and the search engine's crawler updated this change in the
database. This has major implications for the use of search engines in
scholarly research as well as theoretical implications for the conceptions of
time and temporality. We examine the interplay between the different updating
frequencies by using AltaVista and Google for searches at different moments of
time. Both the retrieval of the results and the structure of the retrieved
information erodes over time.
