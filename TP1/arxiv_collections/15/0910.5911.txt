The control of nonlinear processes and possible transitions to chaos in
systems of interacting particles is a fundamental physical problem. We propose
a new nonuniform solid-state plasma system, produced by the optical injection
of current in two-dimensional semiconductor structures, where this control can
be achieved. Due to an injected current, the system symmetry is initially
broken. The subsequent nonequilibrium dynamics is governed by the spatially
varying long-range Coulomb forces and electron-hole collisions. As a result,
inhomogeneities in the charge and velocity distributions should develop
rapidly, and lead to previously unexpected experimental consequences. We
suggest that the system eventually evolves into a behavior similar to chaos.
