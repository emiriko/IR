Motivated by a series of experiments that revealed a temperature dependence
of the dynamic scaling regime of growing surfaces, we investigate theoretically
how a nonequilibrium growth process reacts to a sudden change of system
parameters. We discuss quenches between correlated regimes through exact
expressions derived from the stochastic Edwards-Wilkinson equation with a
variable diffusion constant. Our study reveals that a sudden change of the
diffusion constant leads to remarkable changes in the surface roughness.
Different dynamic regimes, characterized by a power-law or by an exponential
relaxation, are identified, and a dynamic phase diagram is constructed. We
conclude that growth processes provide one of the rare instances where quenches
between correlated regimes yield a power-law relaxation.
