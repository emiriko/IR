Pressure broadening and pressure shift coefficients for 127I2 (diatomic
iodine) in the presence of various buffer gases were determined respectively
from the line-widths and line-center shifts observed in Doppler-limited,
steady-state, linear absorption spectra near 675 nm as a function of buffer gas
pressure through a nonlinear regression analysis of observed line shapes
against a Gaussian-Lorentzian convolution line shape model.
  A line shape model, obtained from a first-order perturbation solution of the
time-dependent Schrodinger equation for randomly occurring interactions between
a two-level system and a buffer gas treated as step-function potentials,
reveals a relationship between the ratio of pressure broadening to pressure
shift coefficients and a change in the wave function phase-factor, interpreted
as reflecting the "cause and effect" of state-changing events in the
microscopic domain. Collision cross-sections determined from this model are
interpreted as reflecting the inelastic nature of collision-induced
state-changing events.
  A steady-state kinetic model for the two-level system compatible with the
Beer-Lambert law reveals thermodynamic constraints on the ensemble-average
state-changing rates and collision cross-sections, and leads to the proposal of
a relationship between observed asymmetric line shapes and irreversibility in
the microscopic domain, and suggests that such features may be more fully
consistent with the use of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians for describing the
state-changing process; in the context of the [non-degenerate] two-level model,
the Hamiltonian that describes photon absorption is not the Hermitian conjugate
of the Hamiltonian that describes photon emission.
