Carbon nanotubes have attracted considerable interest for their unique
electronic properties. They are fascinating candidates for fundamental studies
of one dimensional materials as well as for future molecular electronics
applications. The molecular orbitals of nanotubes are of particular importance
as they govern the transport properties and the chemical reactivity of the
system. Here we show for the first time a complete experimental investigation
of molecular orbitals of single wall carbon nanotubes using atomically resolved
scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Local conductance measurements show
spectacular carbon-carbon bond asymmetry at the Van Hove singularities for both
semiconducting and metallic tubes, demonstrating the symmetry breaking of
molecular orbitals in nanotubes. Whatever the tube, only two types of
complementary orbitals are alternatively observed. An analytical tight-binding
model describing the interference patterns of ? orbitals confirmed by ab initio
calculations, perfectly reproduces the experimental results.
