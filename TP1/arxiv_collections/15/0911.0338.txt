We report a combined study of the Nernst coefficient (v), Hall effect and
thermoelectric power of CaFe2As2 and CaFe1.92Co0.08As2 single crystals. The
absolute value of v in both samples is enhanced, probably due to ambipolar flow
of electron- and hole-like quasiparticles. The onset of spin-density-wave order
in CaFe2As2 causes further rapid rise of the Nernst coefficient. On the
contrary, in the CaFe1.92Co0.08As2 crystal we do not see any feature of v(T),
which could be clearly associated with SDW fluctuations. In this Co-doped
sample there is also no noticeable increase in of v in the vicinity of
superconducting transition, despite the expectation of such due to vortex
movement.
