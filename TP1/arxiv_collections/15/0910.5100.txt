We calculate the optical and DC conductivity for half-filled disordered
Hubbard model near the Mott metal-insulator transition. As in the clean case,
large metallic resistivity is driven by a strong inelastic scattering, and
Drude-like peak in the optical conductivity persists even at temperatures when
the resistivity is well beyond the semiclassical Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit. Local
random potential does not introduce new charge carriers, but it induces
effective local carrier doping and broadens the bandwidth. This makes the
system more metallic, in agreement with the recent experiments on X-ray
irradiated charge-transfer salts.
