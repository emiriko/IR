In this work, the structural and magnetic properties of the gold-coated FePt
nanoparticles synthesized from high-temperature solution phase are presented.
The amount of gold was optimized to obtain most of the FePt particles coated.
The particle diameter increases from 4 to 10 nm as observed by TEM. The
magnetic properties are largely affected by the coating. At low temperature,
the coercive field Hc of the coated nanoparticles decreases about three times
respect to the uncoated and the blocking temperature reduces to the half. The
changes of the magnetic behavior are discussed in terms of the effect of the
gold atoms at the FePt core surface.
