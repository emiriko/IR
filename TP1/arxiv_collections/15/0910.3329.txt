We present two analyses dedicated to measure the ratio of branching ratios of
the top quark, R=B(t->Wb)/(t->Wq) (where q=d,s,b), using ttbar events with
either one or two prompt isolated leptons (e or mu) in the final state.
Furthermore the framework of the dileptonic analysis was used also for a
feasibility study of the measurement of b-tagging efficiency, by assuming the R
value to be the Standard Model one. Data-driven techniques to control the
background in the selected events are discussed and the expected simulation
results are presented.
