The thermal Casimir force between two metallic plates is known to depend on
the description of material properties. For large separations the dissipative
Drude model leads to a force a factor of 2 smaller than the lossless plasma
model. Here we show that the plane-sphere geometry, in which current experiment
are performed, decreases this ratio to a factor of 3/2, as revealed by exact
numerical and large distance analytical calculations. For perfect reflectors,
we find a repulsive contribution of thermal photons to the force and negative
entropy values at intermediate distances.
