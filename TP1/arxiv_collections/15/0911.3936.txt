We propose and analyze a simple method to squeeze dynamically and
unconditionally the collective spin of a dilute atomic ensemble by interaction
with a driven mode of an optical resonator, as recently demonstrated [I. D. L.,
M. H. S., and V. V., Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 073602 (2010)]. We show that
substantial squeezing can be achieved in the regime of strong collective
ensemble-resonator coupling. The squeezing is ultimately limited either by
photon emission into free space or by the curvature of the Bloch sphere. We
derive both limits and show where each prevails.
