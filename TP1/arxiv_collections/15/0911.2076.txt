Statistical classical mechanics and quantum mechanics are developed and
well-known theories that represent a basis for modern physics. The two
described theories are well known and have been well studied. As these theories
contain numerous paradoxes, many scientists doubt their internal consistencies.
However, these paradoxes can be resolved within the framework of the existing
physics without the introduction of new laws. To clarify the paper for the
inexperienced reader, we include certain necessary basic concepts of
statistical physics and quantum mechanics in this paper without the use of
formulas. Exact formulas and explanations are included in the Appendices. The
text is supplemented by illustrations to enhance the understanding of the
paper. The paradoxes underlying thermodynamics and quantum mechanics are also
discussed. The approaches to the solutions of these paradoxes are suggested.
The first approach is dependent on the influence of the external observer
(environment), which disrupts the correlations in the system. The second
approach is based on the limits of the self-knowledge of the system for the
case in which both the external observer and the environment are included in
the considered system. The concepts of observable dynamics, ideal dynamics, and
unpredictable dynamics are introduced. The phenomenon of complex (living)
systems is contemplated from the point of view of these dynamics.
