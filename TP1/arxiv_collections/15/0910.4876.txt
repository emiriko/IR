I present a review of phenomenological implications of the Randall-Sundrum
(RS) model with bulk fermions and brane-localized Higgs boson. Modifications to
the W-boson mass, corrections to the Peskin-Takeuchi parameters and to the Z ->
bb couplings will be discussed. From these observables severe bounds on the
mass scale of Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes arise. Constraints from all three
observables are very sensitive to the exact value of the Higgs boson mass and
the bounds can be significantly lowered by allowing for a heavy Higgs boson
(m_h ~ 1 TeV). Consequences thereof, as well as other approaches like "little
RS" models and models with custodial symmetry will also be briefly discussed.
