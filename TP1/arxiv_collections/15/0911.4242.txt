In the past decade low-temperature Glauber dynamics for the one-dimensional
Ising system has been several times observed experimentally and occurred to be
one of the most important theoretical approaches in a field of molecular
nanomagnets. On the other hand, it has been shown recently that Glauber
dynamics with the Metropolis flipping probability for the zero-temperature
Ising ferromagnet under synchronous updating can lead surprisingly to the
antiferromagnetic steady state. In this paper the generalized class of Glauber
dynamics at zero-temperature will be considered and the relaxation into the
ground state, after a quench from high temperature, will be investigated. Using
Monte Carlo simulations and a mean field approach, discontinuous phase
transition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases for a
one-dimensional ferromagnet will be shown.
