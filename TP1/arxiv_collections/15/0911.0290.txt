A logarithmic type Harnack inequality is established for the semigroup of
solutions to a stochastic differential equation in Hilbert spaces with
non-additive noise. As applications, the strong Feller property as well as the
entropy-cost inequality for the semigroup are derived with respect to the
corresponding distance (cost function).
