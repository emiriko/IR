Kuiper belt object 136108 Haumea is one of the most fascinating bodies in our
solar system. Approximately 2000x1600x1000 km in size, it is one of the largest
Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) and an unusually elongated one for its size. The
shape of Haumea is the result of rotational deformation due to its extremely
short 3.9-hour rotation period. Unlike other 1000 km-scale KBOs which are
coated in methane ice the surface of Haumea is covered in almost pure
water-ice. The bulk density of Haumea, estimated around 2.6 g/cc, suggests a
more rocky interior composition, different from the water-ice surface.
Recently, Haumea has become the second KBO after Pluto to show observable signs
of surface features. A region darker and redder than the average surface of
Haumea has been identified, the composition and origin of which remain unknown.
I discuss this recent finding and what it may tell us about Haumea.
