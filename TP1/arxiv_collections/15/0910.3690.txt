We describe the current status of solar modelling and focus on the problems
originated with the introduction of solar abundance determinations with low CNO
abundance values. We use models computed with solar abundance compilations
obtained during the last decade, including the newest published abundances by
Asplund and collaborators. Results presented here make focus both on
helioseismic properties and the models as well as in the neutrino fluxes
predictions. We also discuss changes in radiative opacities to restore
agreement between helioseismology, solar models, and solar abundances and show
the effect of such modifications on solar neutrino fluxes.
