We report on the results of new simulations of near-infrared (NIR)
observations of the Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) counterpart associated with the
super-massive black hole at the Galactic Center. The observations have been
carried out using the NACO adaptive optics (AO) instrument at the European
Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope and CIAO NIR camera on the Subaru
telescope (13 June 2004, 30 July 2005, 1 June 2006, 15 May 2007, 17 May 2007
and 28 May 2008). We used a model of synchrotron emission from relativistic
electrons in the inner parts of an accretion disk. The relativistic simulations
have been carried out using the Karas-Yaqoob (KY) ray-tracing code. We probe
the existence of a correlation between the modulations of the observed flux
density light curves and changes in polarimetric data. Furthermore, we confirm
that the same correlation is also predicted by the hot spot model. Correlations
between intensity and polarimetric parameters of the observed light curves as
well as a comparison of predicted and observed light curve features through a
pattern recognition algorithm result in the detection of a signature of
orbiting matter under the influence of strong gravity. This pattern is detected
statistically significant against randomly polarized red noise. Expected
results from future observations of VLT interferometry like GRAVITY experiment
are also discussed.
