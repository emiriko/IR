This technical note shows how Electrodynamics and a Yukawa model are dressed
after integrating out perturbative brane fluctuations, and it is found that
first order corrections in the inverse of the brane tension occur for the
fermion and scalar wave functions, the couplings and the masses. Nevertheless,
field redefinitions actually lead to effective actions where only masses are
dressed to this first order. We compare our results with the literature and
find discrepancies at the next order, which, however, might not be measurable
in the valid regime of low-energy brane fluctuations.
