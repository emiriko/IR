Understanding of the weak force is traced from Fermi's theory of beta decay
to the V-A theory of the mid 1950's. The theoretical suggestion and
experimental confirmation of parity violation in the weak force is discussed.
Topics are presented chronologically, leaving room for biographical sketches
and introducing basic mathematical and physical concepts as needed.
