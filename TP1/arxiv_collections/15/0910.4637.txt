The implementation of fractional differential calculations can give new
possibilities for image processing tools, in particular for those that are
devoted to astronomical images analysis. As discussed in arxiv:0910.2381, the
fractional differentiation is able to enhance the quality of images, with
interesting effects in edge detection and image restoration. Here, we propose
the AstroFracTool, developed to provide a simple yet powerful enhancement
tool-set for astronomical images. This tool works evaluating the fractional
gradient of an image map. It can help produce an output image useful for
further research and scientific purposes, such as the detection of faint
objects and galaxy structures, or, in the case of planetary studies, the
enhancement of surface details.
