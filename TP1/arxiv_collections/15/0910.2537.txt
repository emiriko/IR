We study the finite-size scaling of heavy-light mesons in the static limit.
We compute two-point functions of chiral current densities as well as
pseudoscalar densities in the epsilon-regime of heavy meson Chiral Perturbation
Theory (HMChPT). As expected, finite volume dependence turns out to be
significant in this regime and can be predicted in the effective theory in
terms of the infinite-volume low-energy couplings. These results might be
relevant for extraction of heavy-meson properties from lattice simulations.
