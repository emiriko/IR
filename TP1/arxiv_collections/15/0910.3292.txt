Sorting a Permutation by Transpositions (SPbT) is an important problem in
Bioinformtics. In this paper, we improve the running time of the best known
approximation algorithm for SPbT. We use the permutation tree data structure of
Feng and Zhu and improve the running time of the 1.375 Approximation Algorithm
for SPbT of Elias and Hartman to $O(n\log n)$. The previous running time of EH
algorithm was $O(n^2)$.
