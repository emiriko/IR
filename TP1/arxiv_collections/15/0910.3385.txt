In this paper a new method for inverting the Laplace transform from the real
axis is formulated. This method is based on a quadrature formula. We assume
that the unknown function $f(t)$ is continuous with (known) compact support. An
adaptive iterative method and an adaptive stopping rule, which yield the
convergence of the approximate solution to $f(t)$, are proposed in this paper.
