High-resolution non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the turbulent
magnetized ISM, powered by supernovae types Ia and II at Galactic rate,
including self-gravity and non-equilibriuim ionization (NEI), taking into
account the time evolution of the ionization structure of H, He, C, N, O, Ne,
Mg, Si, S and Fe, were carried out. These runs cover a wide range (from kpc to
sub-parsec) of scales, providing resolution independent information on the
injection scale, extended self-similarity and the fractal dmension of the most
dissipative structures.
