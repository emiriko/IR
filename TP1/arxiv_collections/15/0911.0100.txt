We propose a quantum surface wave functional describing the interaction
between a colored membrane and a quantized Yang Mills. Additionally, we deduce
its associated wave equation in the t'Hooft Nc-infinite limit. We show that it
reproduces the Yang Mills Field Theory at a large rigid random surface scale.
