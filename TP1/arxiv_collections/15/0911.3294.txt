In this paper, we study submanifolds with constant $r$th mean curvature
$S_r$. We investigate, the stability of such submanifolds in the case when they
are leaves of a codimension one foliation. We also generalize recent results by
Barros - Sousa and Al\'{i}as - Colares, concerning conformal fields, to an
arbitrary manifold. Using this we show that normal component of a Killing field
is a $r$th Jacobi field of a submanifold with $S_{r+1}$ constant. Finally, we
study relations between $r$th Jacobi fields and vector fields preserving a
foliation.
