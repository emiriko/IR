In the first lecture of this volume, we will present the basic fundamental
ideas regarding nuclear processes occurring in stars. We start from stellar
observations, will then elaborate on some important quantum-mechanical
phenomena governing nuclear reactions, continue with how nuclear reactions
proceed in a hot stellar plasma and, finally, we will provide an overview of
stellar burning stages. At the end, the current knowledge regarding the origin
of the elements is briefly summarized. This lecture is directed towards the
student of nuclear astrophysics. Our intention is to present seemingly
unrelated phenomena of nuclear physics and astrophysics in a coherent
framework.
