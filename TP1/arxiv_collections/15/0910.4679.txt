This paper investigates the dynamical evolution of embedded stellar clusters
from the protocluster stage, through the embedded star-forming phase, and out
to ages of 10 Myr -- after the gas has been removed from the cluster. The
relevant dynamical properties of young stellar clusters are explored over a
wide range of possible star formation environments using N-body simulations.
Many realizations of equivalent initial conditions are used to produce robust
statistical descriptions of cluster evolution including the cluster bound
fraction, radial probability distributions, as well as the distributions of
close encounter distances and velocities. These cluster properties are
presented as a function of parameters describing the initial configuration of
the cluster, including the initial cluster membership N, initial stellar
velocities, cluster radii, star formation efficiency, embedding gas dispersal
time, and the degree of primordial mass segregation. The results of this
parameter space survey, which includes about 25,000 simulations, provide a
statistical description of cluster evolution as a function of the initial
conditions. We also present a compilation of the FUV radiation fields provided
by these same cluster environments. The output distributions from this study
can be combined with other calculations, such as disk photoevaporation models
and planetary scattering cross sections, to ascertain the effects of the
cluster environment on the processes involved in planet formation.
