We have performed low temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy
measurements on exfoliated bilayer graphene on SiO2. By varying the back gate
voltage we observed a linear shift of the Dirac point and an opening of a band
gap due to the perpendicular electric field. In addition to observing a shift
in the Dirac point, we also measured its spatial dependence using spatially
resolved scanning tunneling spectroscopy. The spatial variation of the Dirac
point was not correlated with topographic features and therefore we attribute
its shift to random charged impurities.
