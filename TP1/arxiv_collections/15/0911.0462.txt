Last year, in 2008, I gave a talk titled {\it Quantum Calisthenics}. This
year I am going to tell you about how the work I described then has spun off
into a most unlikely direction. What I am going to talk about is how one maps
the problem of finding clusters in a given data set into a problem in quantum
mechanics. I will then use the tricks I described to let quantum evolution lets
the clusters come together on their own.
