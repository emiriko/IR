We develop a lattice model for the splay flexoelectric effect in nematic
liquid crystals. In this model, each lattice site has a spin representing the
local molecular orientation, and the interaction between neighboring spins
represents pear-shaped molecules with shape polarity. We perform Monte Carlo
simulations and mean-field calculations to find the behavior as a function of
interaction parameters, temperature, and applied electric field. The resulting
phase diagram has three phases: isotropic, nematic, and polar. In the nematic
phase, there is a large splay flexoelectric effect, which diverges as the
system approaches the transition to the polar phase. These results show that
flexoelectricity is a statistical phenomenon associated with the onset of polar
order.
