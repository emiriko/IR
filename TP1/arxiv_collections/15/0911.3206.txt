Here the electron-phonon Holstein model with Rashba spin-orbit interaction is
studied for a two dimensional square lattice in the adiabatic limit. It is
demonstrated that a delocalized electron at zero spin-orbit coupling localizes
into a large polaron state as soon as the Rashba term is nonzero. This
spin-orbit induced polaron state has localization length inversely proportional
to the Rashba coupling $\gamma$, and it dominates a wide region of the
$\gamma$-$\lambda$ phase diagram, where $\lambda$ is the electron-phonon
interaction.
