We report on the observations of cosmic rays with energies > 1.0 EeV from Jan
2004 to April 2009 by the Pierre Auger Observatory. During this period the
Observatory has grown from about 300 surface detectors to about 1600 upon its
completion in November 2008. The 1600 surface detectors are overlooked by 24
fluorescence telescopes. We report on measurements of the cosmic ray spectrum,
the arrival directions and the elongation rate. We also report limits for the
photon and neutrino components of this cosmic radiation.
