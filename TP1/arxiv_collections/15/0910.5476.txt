We present Spitzer observations of a sample of 12 starless cores selected to
have prominent 24 micron shadows. The Spitzer images show 8 and 24 micron
shadows and in some cases 70 micron shadows; these spatially resolved
absorption features trace the densest regions of the cores. We have carried out
a 12CO (2-1) and 13CO (2-1) mapping survey of these cores with the Heinrich
Hertz Telescope (HHT). We use the shadow features to derive optical depth maps.
We derive molecular masses for the cores and the surrounding environment; we
find that the 24 micron shadow masses are always greater than or equal to the
molecular masses derived in the same region, a discrepancy likely caused by CO
freeze--out onto dust grains. We combine this sample with two additional cores
that we studied previously to bring the total sample to 14 cores. Using a
simple Jeans mass criterion we find that ~ 2/3 of the cores selected to have
prominent 24 micron shadows are collapsing or near collapse, a result that is
supported by millimeter line observations. Of this subset at least half have
indications of 70 micron shadows. All cores observed to produce absorption
features at 70 micron are close to collapse. We conclude that 24 micron
shadows, and even more so the 70 micron ones, are useful markers of cloud cores
that are approaching collapse.
