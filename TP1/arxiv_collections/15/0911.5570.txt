In this paper, we mathematically formulate the interaction and dynamics of a
hierarchical complex social system where each agent is seen as an array of many
variables. The formation of identities and modifications can be studied by
using interaction physics in an energy landscape. The spin glass Hamiltonian is
modified to suit our needs in light of complexity. The expression of variables
subject to weights and topology is considered. Interactions within the same
hierarchy level as well as the effect of one hierarchy level on another are
studied. The effect of having many variables associated with a single agent
brings about interesting dynamics. The persistence of the identity units
subject to stiffness, continuous changes and also sudden reorganizations is
discussed.
