We apply a simple clustering algorithm to a large dataset of cellular
telecommunication records, reducing the complexity of mobile phone users' full
trajectories and allowing for simple statistics to characterize their
properties. For the case of two clusters, we quantify how clustered human
mobility is, how much of a user's spatial dispersion is due to motion between
clusters, and how spatially and temporally separated clusters are from one
another.
