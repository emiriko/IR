We calculate Wilson loops of various sizes up to loop order $n=20$ for
lattice sizes of $L^4 (L=4, 6, 8, 12)$ using the technique of Numerical
Stochastic Perturbation Theory in quenched QCD. This allows to investigate the
behaviour of the perturbative series at high orders. We discuss three models to
estimate the perturbative series: a renormalon inspired fit, a heuristic fit
based on an assumed power-law singularity and boosted perturbation theory. We
have found differences in the behavior of the perturbative series for smaller
and larger Wilson loops at moderate $n$. A factorial growth of the coefficients
could not be confirmed up to $n=20$. From Monte Carlo measured plaquette data
and our perturbative result we estimate a value of the gluon condensate
$<\frac{\alpha}{\pi}GG>$.
