The effects of a strong magnetic field in the dynamical response of a pure
neutron system to a weak neutrino probe are studied within the framework of the
Landau Fermi Liquid Theory in the non-relativistic Hartree-Fock approximation.
We use Skyrme forces to parametrize the partially magnetized nuclear
interacting plasma and describe its collective modes. We study the vector and
vector-axial matter response functions and the neutrino mean free path in this
two-component fermion system with net spin polarization and density dependent
in-medium correlations. We find a decrease in the neutrino opacity of
magnetized matter with respect to the non-magnetized case for fields $log_{10}
B(G) \gtrsim 17$.
