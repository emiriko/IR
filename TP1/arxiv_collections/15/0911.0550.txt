A fundamental role of the Hermann Grassmann anticommuting variables both in
physics and mathematics is discussed on the example of supersymmetry. The talk
describes how the D. Volkov question about possibility of the existence of
Nambu-Goldstone fermions, realized by the Grassmannian variables, resulted in
the discovery of the super-Poincare group, its spontaneous breaking and
gauging.
