We use Spitzer data to infer that the small infrared excess of V819 Tau, a
weak-lined T Tauri star in Taurus, is real and not attributable to a
"companion" 10 arcsec to the south. We do not confirm the mid-infrared excess
in HBC 427 and V410 X-ray 3, which are also non-accreting T Tauri stars in the
same region; instead, for the former object, the excess arises from a red
companion 9 arcsec to the east. A single-temperature blackbody fit to the
continuum excess of V819 Tau implies a dust temperature of 143 K; however, a
better fit is achieved when the weak 10 and 20 micron silicate emission
features are also included. We infer a disk of sub-micron silicate grains
between about 1 AU and several 100 AU with a constant surface density
distribution. The mid-infrared excess of V819 Tau can be successfully modeled
with dust composed mostly of small amorphous olivine grains at a temperature of
85 K, and most of the excess emission is optically thin. The disk could still
be primordial, but gas-poor and therefore short-lived, or already at the debris
disk stage, which would make it one of the youngest debris disk systems known.
