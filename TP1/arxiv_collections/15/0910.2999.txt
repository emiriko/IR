We study the effect of insulating oxide substrates on the energy band
structure of monolayer and bilayer graphene using a first principles density
functional based electronic structure method and a local exchange correlation
approximation. We consider two crystalline substrates, SiO2 (or alpha-quartz)
and Al2O3 (alpha-alumina or sapphire), each with two surface terminations. We
focus on the role of substrate surface dangling states and their passivation in
perturbing the linear energy spectrum of graphene. On non-passivated surface
terminations, with the relaxation of top surface layers, only Si-terminated
quartz retains the linear band structure of graphene due to relatively large
equilibrium separation from the graphene layer whereas the other three surface
terminations considerably distort it. However, without relaxations of the top
surface layer atoms, linear bands appear in the electronic spectrum but with
the Dirac point shifted away from the Fermi level. Interestingly, with a second
carbon layer on non-passivated oxygen terminated Quartz, with top surface
layers relaxation, graphene features appear in the spectrum but sapphire with
both surface terminations shows perturbed features even with two carbon layers.
By passivating the surface dangling states with hydrogen atoms and without top
layer atomic relaxations, the electron-hole symmetry occurs exactly at the
Fermi level. This suggests that surface dangling states play a less important
role than the atomic relaxations of the top surface layers in distorting the
linear spectrum. In all cases we find that the first layer of graphene forms
ripples, much like in suspended graphene, but the strength of rippling is found
to be weaker probably due to the presence of the substrate.
