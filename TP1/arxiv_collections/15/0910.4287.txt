We formulate a model of the time-resolved Kerr rotation experiment on a
single hole in a semiconductor nanostructure (e.g., a quantum dot) or on an
ensemble of trapped holes (e.g., in a quantum well) in a tilted magnetic field.
We use a generic Markovian description of the hole and trion dephasing and
focus on the interpretation of the time-resolved signal in terms of the
microscopic evolution of the spin polarization. We show that the signal in an
off-plane field contains components that reveal both the spin relaxation rate
and the spin coherence dephasing rate. We derive analytical formulas for the
hole spin polarization, which may be used to extract the two relevant rates by
fitting to the measurement data.
