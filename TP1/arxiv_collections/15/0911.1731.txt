Undulatory locomotion, as seen in the nematode \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans},
is a common swimming gait of organisms in the low Reynolds number regime, where
viscous forces are dominant. While the nematode's motility is expected to be a
strong function of its material properties, measurements remain scarce. Here,
the swimming behavior of \emph{C.} \emph{elegans} are investigated in
experiments and in a simple model. Experiments reveal that nematodes swim in a
periodic fashion and generate traveling waves which decay from head to tail.
The model is able to capture the experiments' main features and is used to
estimate the nematode's Young's modulus $E$ and tissue viscosity $\eta$. For
wild-type \emph{C. elegans}, we find $E\approx 3.77$ kPa and $\eta \approx-860$
Pa$\cdot$s; values of $\eta$ for live \emph{C. elegans} are negative because
the tissue is generating rather than dissipating energy. Results show that
material properties are sensitive to changes in muscle functional properties,
and are useful quantitative tools with which to more accurately describe new
and existing muscle mutants.
