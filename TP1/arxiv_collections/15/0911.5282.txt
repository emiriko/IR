By realizing in thin films a tensile stress state, superconductivity of 13 K
was introduced into FeTe, an non-superconducting parent compound of the iron
pnictides and chalcogenides, with transition temperature higher than that of
its superconducting isostructural counterpart FeSe. For these tensile stressed
films, the superconductivity is accompanied by the softening of the first-order
magnetic and structural phase transition; and also, the in-plane extension and
out-of-plane contraction are universal in all FeTe films independent of sign of
lattice mismatch, either positive or negative. Moreover, the correlations were
found exist between the transition temperatures and the tetrahedra bond angles
in these thin films.
