We give a complete analytical proof of existence and uniqueness of
extreme-like black hole initial data for Einstein equations, which possess a
cilindrical end, analogous to extreme Kerr, extreme Reissner Nordstrom, and
extreme Bowen-York's initial data. This extends and refines a previous result
\cite{dain-gabach09} to a general case of conformally flat, maximal initial
data with angular momentum, linear momentum and matter.
