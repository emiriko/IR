We discuss the surface Andreev bound states in Fe-based superconductors with
the use of an effective five-band model and investigate the surface-angle
dependence of the tunneling spectroscopy by a quasiclassical approach for an
isotropic and an anisotropic /pm s-wave gap superconductivity. We show that
information on the normal state is important for the Andreev bound state and
its peak positions do not depend on the gap amplitude anisotropy.
