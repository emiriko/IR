We present a careful and detailed light curve analysis of RR Lyrae stars in
the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) discovered by the Optical Gravitational
Lensing Experiment (OGLE) project. Out of 536 single mode RR Lyrae stars
selected from the database, we have investigated the physical properties of 335
`normal looking' RRab stars and 17 RRc stars that have good quality photometric
light curves. We have also been able to estimate the distance modulus of the
cloud which is in good agreement with those determined from other independent
methods. The Fourier decomposition method has been used to study the basic
properties of these variables. Accurate Fourier decomposition parameters of 536
RR Lyrae stars in the OGLE-II database are computed. Empirical relations
between the Fourier parameters and some physical parameters of these variables
have been used to estimate the physical parameters for the stars from the
Fourier analysis. Further, the Fourier decomposition of the light curves of the
SMC RR Lyrae stars yields their mean physical parameters as: [Fe/H] = -1.56
$\pm 0.25$, M = 0.55 $\pm $ 0.01 M$_{\odot}$, T$_{\rm eff} = 6404 \pm 12$ K,
$\log \rm L = 1.60 \pm0.01 \rm L_\odot$ and M$\rm_V = 0.78 \pm0.02 $ for 335
RRab variables and [Fe/H] = -1.90 $\pm$ 0.13, M = 0.82 $\pm $ 0.18 M$_{\odot}$,
T$_{\rm eff} = 7177 \pm 16$ K, $\log \rm L = 1.62 \pm 0.02 \rm L_{\odot}$ and
M$\rm_V = 0.76 \pm 0.05$ for 17 RRc stars.
