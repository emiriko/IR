Polycrystalline samples of FeSe1-xTex (x = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00)
were synthesized by solid-state reaction to study the effects of substituting
Se with Te in the system. The magnetization properties of the resulting
compounds were investigated and the crystallographic structures of the samples
analyzed through X-ray diffraction. Moessbauer spectroscopy was used to
determine the ionic state of the Fe ions and the hyperfine fields. The magnetic
susceptibility curves of the samples with x = 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 show
superconducting behavior. The lattice parameters and the cell volume increase
monotonically with increasing Te concentration and the Moessbauer spectra
reveal the absence of internal magnetic hyperfine fields.
