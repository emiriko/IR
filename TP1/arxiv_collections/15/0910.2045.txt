It is widely believed that the celebrated 2D Ising model at criticality has a
universal and conformally invariant scaling limit, which is used in deriving
many of its properties. However, no mathematical proof of universality and
conformal invariance has ever been given, and even physics arguments support (a
priori weaker) M\"obius invariance. We introduce discrete holomorphic fermions
for the 2D Ising model at criticality on a large family of planar graphs. We
show that on bounded domains with appropriate boundary conditions, those have
universal and conformally invariant scaling limits, thus proving the
universality and conformal invariance conjectures.
