We demonstrate two-photon interference using two remote single molecules as
bright solid-state sources of indistinguishable photons. By varying the
transition frequency and spectral width of one molecule, we tune and explore
the effect of photon distinguishability. We discuss future improvements on the
brightness of single-photon beams, their integration by large numbers on chips,
and the extension of our experimental scheme to coupling and entanglement of
distant molecules.
