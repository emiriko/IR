We report the results of \textit{ab initio} simulations of the electronic
properties of a chain of C$_{60}$ molecules encapsulated in a boron nitride
nanotube - so called BN-nanopeapod. It is demonstrated that this structure can
be effectively doped by depositing potassium atoms on the external wall of the
BN-nanotube. The resulting material becomes a true metallic one-dimensional
crystal, where the conduction states are formed solely by the fullerene chain.
At the doping rate of one K atom per C$_{60}$ molecule, the system shows the
density of states at the Fermi level considerably higher than in any of the
fullerene crystals presently made. This makes the doped BN-peapod structure an
interesting candidate to study a possible superconducting state.
