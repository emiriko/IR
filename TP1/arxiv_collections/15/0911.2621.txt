We investigate nucleosynthesis and element formation in the early universe in
the framework of higher dimensional cosmology. For this purpose we utilize a
previous solution of the present author, which may be termed as the generalized
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model. We find that temperature decays less rapidly
in higher dimensional cosmology, which we believe may have nontrivial
consequences \emph{vis-a-vis} primordial physics.
