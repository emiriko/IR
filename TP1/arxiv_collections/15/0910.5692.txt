We discuss the particle-physics discovery potential of ground-based
gravitational-wave interferometers. With the use of pulsed magnetic fields,
current and future gravitational-wave interferometers could not only be
utilized to observe phenomena of strong-field QED, but they could also be
applied to sweep the parameter space of particles of the hidden sector.
