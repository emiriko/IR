We demonstrate that the quantum dynamics of a many-body Fermi-Bose system can
be simulated using a Gaussian phase-space representation method. In particular,
we consider the application of the mixed fermion-boson model to ultracold
quantum gases and simulate the dynamics of dissociation of a Bose-Einstein
condensate of bosonic dimers into pairs of fermionic atoms. We quantify
deviations of atom-atom pair correlations from Wick's factorization scheme, and
show that atom-molecule and molecule-molecule correlations grow with time, in
clear departures from pairing mean-field theories. As a first-principles
approach, the method provides benchmarking of approximate approaches and can be
used to validate dynamical probes for characterizing strongly correlated phases
of fermionic systems.
