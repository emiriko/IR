It is shown that nonlinear interaction between large amplitude circularly
polarized EM wave and dusty plasma leads to a nonstationary ponderomotive force
which in turn produces a vortex ring, and magnetic field. Then the ensuing
vortex ring in the direction of propagation of the pump wave can accelerate the
micron-size dust particles which are initially at rest and eventually form a
non relativistic dust jet. This effect is purely nonstationary and unlike
linear vortices, dust particles do not rotate here. Specifically, it is pointed
out that the vortex ring or closed filament can become potential candidate for
the acceleration of dust in tokamak plasmas.
