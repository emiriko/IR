We study the low energy properties of warped monolayer graphene, where the
symmetry of the original honeycomb lattice reveals itself. The zero energy
solutions are Majorana fermions, whose wavefunction, originating from the
corresponding modified Dirac equation is spatially localized. Experimental
consequences are discussed.
