Many analyses and parameter estimations undertaken in astronomy require a
large set (> 10^5) of non-analytical, theoretical spectra, each of these
defined by multiple parameters. We describe the construction of an
N-dimensional grid which is suitable for generating such spectra. The
theoretical spectra are designed to correspond to a targeted parameter grid but
otherwise to random positions in the parameter space, and they are interpolated
on-the-fly through a pre-calculated grid of spectra. The initial grid is
designed to be relatively low in parameter resolution and small in occupied
hard disk space and therefore can be updated efficiently when a new model is
desired. In a pilot study of stellar population synthesis of galaxies, the mean
square errors on the estimated parameters are found to decrease with the
targeted grid resolution. This scheme of generating a large model grid is
general for other areas of studies, particularly if they are based on
multi-dimensional parameter space and are focused on contrasting model
differences.
