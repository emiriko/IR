In this paper we sum up our works on multiscale programs, mainly simulations.
We first start with describing what multiscaling is about, how it helps
perceiving signal from a background noise in a ?ow of data for example, for a
direct perception by a user or for a further use by another program. We then
give three examples of multiscale techniques we used in the past, maintaining a
summary, using an environmental marker introducing an history in the data and
finally using a knowledge on the behavior of the different scales to really
handle them at the same time.
