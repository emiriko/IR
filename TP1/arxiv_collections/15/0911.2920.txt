We study the dynamic electrical response of a silicon-molecular
monolayer-metal junctions and we observe two contributions in the admittance
spectroscopy data. These contributions are related to dipolar relaxation and
molecular organization in the monolayer in one hand, and the presence of
defects at the silicon/molecule interface in the other hand. We propose a small
signal equivalent circuit suitable for the simulations of these molecular
devices in commercial device simulators. Our results concern monolayers of
alkyl chains considered as a model system but can be extended to other
molecular monolayers. These results open door to a better control and
optimization of molecular devices.
