The quantum oscillations in magnetic field of the critical current of
asymmetric superconducting rings with different widths of the half-rings are
shifted to opposite sides for measurement in the opposite direction. The value
of this shift found before equal half of the flux quantum for single ring with
radius 2 \mu m has smaller value at lower critical current and for system of
the rings with smaller radius.
