Two-state spin systems is a classical topic in statistical physics. We
consider the problem of computing the partition function of the systems on a
bounded degree graph. Based on the self-avoiding tree, we prove the systems
exhibits strong correlation decay under the condition that the absolute value
of "inverse temperature" is small. Due to strong correlation decay property, an
FPTAS for the partition function is presented under the same condition. This
condition is sharp for Ising model.
