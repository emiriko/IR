Earth-sized planets around nearby stars are being detected for the first time
by ground-based radial velocity and space-based transit surveys. This milestone
is opening the path towards the definition of missions able to directly detect
the light from these planets, with the identification of bio-signatures as one
of the main objectives. In that respect, both ESA and NASA have identified
nulling interferometry as one of the most promising techniques. The ability to
study distant planets will however depend on exozodiacal dust clouds
surrounding the target stars. In this paper, we assess the impact of
exozodiacal dust clouds on the performance of an infrared nulling
interferometer in the Emma X-array configuration. For the nominal mission
architecture with 2-m aperture telescopes, we found that point-symmetric
exozodiacal dust discs about 100 times denser than the solar zodiacal cloud can
be tolerated in order to survey at least 150 targets during the mission
lifetime. Considering modeled resonant structures created by an Earth-like
planet orbiting at 1 AU around a Sun-like star, we show that the tolerable dust
density for planet detection goes down to about 15 times the solar zodiacal
density for face-on systems and decreases with the disc inclination. The upper
limits on the tolerable exozodiacal dust density derived in this study must be
considered as rather pessimistic, but still give a realistic estimation of the
typical sensitivity that we will need to reach on exozodiacal discs in order to
prepare the scientific programme of future Earth-like planet characterisation
missions.
