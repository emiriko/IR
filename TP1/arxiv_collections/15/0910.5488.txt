We discuss the thermalisation process of the neutron stars crust described by
solving the heat transport equation with a microscopic input for the specific
heat of baryonic matter. The heat equation is solved with initial conditions
specific to a rapid cooling of the core. To calculate the specific heat of
inner crust baryonic matter, i.e., nuclear clusters and unbound neutrons, we
use the quasiparticle spectrum provided by the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach
at finite temperature. In this framework we analyse the dependence of the crust
thermalisation on pairing properties and on cluster structure of inner crust
matter. It is shown that the pairing correlations reduce the crust
thermalisation time by a very large fraction. The calculations show also that
the nuclear clusters have a non-negligible influence on the time evolution of
the surface temperature of the neutron star.
