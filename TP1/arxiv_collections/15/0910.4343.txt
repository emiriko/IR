A two-phonon version of the relativistic quasiparticle time blocking
approximation (RQTBA-2) represents a new class of many-body models for nuclear
structure calculations based on the covariant energy density functional. As a
fully consistent extension of the relativistic quasiparticle random phase
approximation (RQRPA), the two-phonon RQTBA implies a fragmentation of nuclear
states over two-quasiparticle and two-phonon configurations. This leads, in
particular, to a splitting-out of the lowest 1$^-$ state as a member of the
two-phonon $[2^+\otimes3^-]$ quintuplet from the RQRPA pygmy dipole mode, thus
establishing a physical mixing between these three modes. The inclusion of the
two-phonon configurations in the model space allows to describe the positions
and the reduced transition probabilities of the lowest 1$^-$ states in isotopes
$^{116,120}$Sn as well as the low-energy fraction of the dipole strength
without any adjustment procedures. The model is also applied to the low-lying
dipole strength in neutron-rich $^{68,70,72}$Ni isotopes. Recent experimental
data for $^{68}$Ni are reproduced fairly well.
