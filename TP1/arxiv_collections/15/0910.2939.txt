Derivation of the procedures that can be applied in evaluating two-time
correlation function in terms of coherent-state propagator and corresponding
Q-function is presented. On the basis that the involved functions are generally
exponential in nature, obtaining the two-time second-order correlation function
is essentially claimed to be reduced to carrying out relatively simple
integrations. Fundamentally, the time dependence of the operators is
transferred to the density operator. Moreover, manipulation in reordering the
operators is performed by applying the usual trace operation. With all details,
it is basically observed that the two-time correlation can be readily
determined once the pertinent coherent-state propagator or Q-function is known.
Since working with c-number equation is far more handy than the associated
operator equation, it is expected that the results derived in this contribution
can aid in easing the otherwise involving mathematical rigor.
