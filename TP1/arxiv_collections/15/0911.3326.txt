The phase separation mechanism of a binary liquid mixture off-critically
quenched in its miscibility gap is nucleation and growth, its homogeneous phase
reaching a metastable equilibrium state. The successive stages of growth of the
nucleated droplets are a diffusion-driven free growth, an intermediate regime
and a coarsening by reduction of interface (Ostwald ripening or Brownian
collisions induced coalescence). We have made light attenuation experiments to
investigate the sedimentation in such systems. These results have given us
access experimentally to two values predicted theoretically: the growth
exponent of the intermediate regime and the crossover time between this regime
and interface-reduction coarsening. These data, added to the literature
results, have permitted to get a quite complete view of the growth scenario in
very off-critical phase-separating liquids.
