We discuss current cosmological constraints on axions, as well as future
sensitivities. Bounds on axion hot dark matter are discussed first, and
subsequently we discuss both current and future sensitivity to models in which
axions play the role as cold dark matter, but where the Peccei-Quinn symmetry
is not restored during reheating.
