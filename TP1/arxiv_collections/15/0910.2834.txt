It is shown that within a quantum system, the wave field has a (potential)
energy content that can be exchanged with quantum particles. Energy
conservation in quantum systems holds if potential energy is correctly taken to
be a field attribute. From this perspective, a transfer of energy occurs on
measurement from the wave field to a quantum particle and this provides a
physical explanation of what is commonly referred to as the collapse of the
wavefunction.
