Conventionally, long GRBs are thought to be caused by the core collapses of
massive stars. During the lifetime of a massive star, a stellar wind bubble
environment should be produced. Furthermore, the microphysics shock parameters
may vary along with the evolution of the fireball. Here we investigate the
variation of the microphysics shock parameters under the condition of wind
bubble environment, and allow the microphysics shock parameters to be
discontinuous at shocks in the ambient medium. It is found that our model can
acceptably reproduce the rebrightenings observed in GRB afterglows, at least in
some cases. The effects of various model parameters on rebrightenings are
investigated. The rebrightenings observed in both the R-band and X-ray
afterglow light curves of GRB 060206, GRB 070311 and GRB 071010A are reproduced
in this model.
