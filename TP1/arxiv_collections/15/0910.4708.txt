We propose a new method to use gapped graphene as barrier to confine
electrons in gapless graphene and form a good quantum dot, which can be
realized on an oxygen-terminated $SiO_{2}$ substrate partly H-passivated. In
particular, we use ferromagnetic insulators deposited on top of barrier which
give rise to a spin related energy spectrum and transport properties. Compared
to the complexity of etched quantum dots in graphene, the setup suggested here
is a promising candidate for practical applications.
