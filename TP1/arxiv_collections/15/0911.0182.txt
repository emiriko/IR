We describe some basic results for Quantum Stochastic Processes and present
some new results about a certain class of processes which are associated to
Quantum Iterated Function Systems (QIFS). We discuss questions related to the
Markov property and we present a definition of entropy which is induced by a
QIFS. This definition is a natural generalization of the Shannon-Kolmogorov
entropy from Ergodic Theory. This definition is different from the one in the
paper "A Thermodynamic Formalism for density matrices in Quantum Information"
by the same authors.
