We demonstrate how to simulate both discrete and continuous stochastic
evolution of a quantum many body system subject to measurements using matrix
product states. A particular, but generally applicable, measurement model is
analyzed and a simple representation in terms of matrix product operators is
found. The technique is exemplified by numerical simulations of the
anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-chain model subject to various instances of
the measurement model. In particular we focus on local measurements with small
support and non-local measurements which induces long range correlations.
