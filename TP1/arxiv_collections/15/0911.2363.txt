We study nucleon momentum distributions of even-even isotopes of Ni, Kr, and
Sn in the framework of deformed self-consistent mean-field Skyrme HF+BCS
method, as well as of theoretical correlation methods based on light-front
dynamics and local density approximation. The isotopic sensitivities of the
calculated neutron and proton momentum distributions are investigated together
with the effects of pairing and nucleon-nucleon correlations. The role of
deformation on the momentum distributions in even-even Kr isotopes is
discussed. For comparison, the results for the momentum distribution in nuclear
matter are also presented.
