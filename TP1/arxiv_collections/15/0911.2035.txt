We prove a compactness theorem in the context of Hennessy-Milner logic. It is
used to derive a sufficient condition on modal characterizations for the
Approximation Induction Principle to be sound modulo the corresponding process
equivalence. We show that this condition is necessary when the equivalence in
question is compositional with respect to the projection operators.
