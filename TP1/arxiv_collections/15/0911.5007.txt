An improved generator for continuous unitary transformations is introduced to
describe systems with unstable quasiparticles. Its general properties are
derived and discussed. To illustrate this approach we investigate the
asymmetric antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladder which allows for
spontaneous triplon decay. We present results for the low energy spectrum and
the momentum resolved spectral density of this system. In particular, we show
the resonance behavior of the decaying triplon explicitly.
