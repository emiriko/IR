Hot stars are sources of X-ray emission originating in their winds. Although
hydrodynamical simulations that are able to predict this X-ray emission are
available, the inclusion of X-rays in stationary wind models is usually based
on simplifying approximations. To improve this, we use results from
time-dependent hydrodynamical simulations of the line-driven wind instability
(seeded by the base perturbation) to derive the analytical approximation of
X-ray emission in the stellar wind. We use this approximation in our non-LTE
wind models and find that an improved inclusion of X-rays leads to a better
agreement between model ionization fractions and those derived from servations.
Furthermore, the slope of the L_x-L relation is in better agreement with
observations, however the X-ray luminosity is underestimated by a factor of
three. We propose a possible solution for this discrepancy.
