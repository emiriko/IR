In our earlier work [M. Hafez, {\em et al.}, Phys. Lett. A {\bf 373} (2009)
4479] we employed the flow equation method to obtain a classic effective model
from a quantum mechanical parent Hamiltonian called, the ionic Hubbard model
(IHM). The classical ionic Hubbard model (CIHM) obtained in this way contains
solely Fermionic occupation numbers of two species corresponding to particles
with $\up$ and $\down$ spin, respectively. In this paper, we employ the
transfer matrix method to analytically solve the CIHM at finite temperature in
one dimension. In the limit of zero temperature, we find two insulating phases
at large and small Coulomb interaction strength, $U$, mediated with a gap-less
metallic phase, resulting in two continuous metal-insulator transitions. Our
results are further supported with Monte Carlo simulations.
