We study the charge density, form factors and spin distributions of the
electron induced by its |e \gamma> light-front Fock state in impact parameter
space. Only transversally compact Fock states contribute to the leading
behavior of the Dirac and Pauli form factors as the momentum transfer tends to
infinity. Power suppressed contributions are not compact, and distributions
weighted by the transverse size have end-point contributions. The Fock state
conserves the spin of the parent electron locally, but the separate
contributions of the electron, photon and orbital angular momentum depend on
longitudinal momentum and impact parameter. The sign of the anomalous magnetic
moment of the electron may be understood intuitively from the density
distribution, addressing a challenge by Feynman.
