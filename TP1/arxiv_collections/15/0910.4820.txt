We study by the Gutzwiller approximation the melting of the valence bond
crystal phase of a bilayer Hubbard model at sufficiently large inter-layer
hopping. We find that a superconducting domain, with order parameter
$d_{z^2-r^2}$, $z$ being the inter-layer direction and $r$ the intra-layer one,
is stabilized variationally close to the half-filled non-magnetic Mott
insulator. Superconductivity exists at half-filling just at the border of the
Mott transition and extends away from half-filling into a whole region till a
critical doping, beyond which it gives way to a normal metal phase. This result
suggests that superconductivity should be unavoidably met by liquefying a
valence bond crystal, at least when each layer is an infinite coordination
lattice and the Gutzwiller approximation becomes exact. Remarkably, this same
behavior is well established in the other extreme of two-leg Hubbard ladders,
showing it might be of quite general validity.
