Non-minimally coupled scalar field models of dark energy are equivalent to an
interacting quintessence in the Einstein's frame. Considering two special
important choices of the potential of the scalar field, i.e. nearly flat and
thawing potential, one has an analytical expression for the equation of state
parameter as a function of the density parameter of the scalar field for any
choice. Here we investigate the non-minimal quintessence model by applying the
method of statefinder diagnosis to it and plotting the evolutionary
trajectories of the statefinder parameters.
