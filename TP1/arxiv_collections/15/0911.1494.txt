The work presented in this paper is related to the area of Situational Method
Engineering (SME) which focuses on project-specific method construction. We
propose a faceted framework to understand and classify issues in system
development SME. The framework identifies four different but complementary
viewpoints. Each view allows us to capture a particular aspect of situational
methods. Inter-relationships between these views show how they influence each
other. In order to study, understand and classify a particular view of SME in
its diversity, we associate a set of facets with each view. As a facet allows
an in-depth description of one specific aspect of SME, the views show the
variety and diversity of these aspects.
