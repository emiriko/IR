Here we investigate specifically the transient of a synchronizing system,
considering synchronization as a relaxation phenomenon. The stepwise
establishment of synchronization is studied in the system of dynamically
coupled maps introduced by Ito & Kaneko (Phys. Rev. Lett., 88, 028701, 2001 &
Phys. Rev. E, 67, 046226, 2003), where the plasticity of dynamical couplings
might be relevant in the context of neuroscience. We show the occurrence of
logarithmically slow dynamics in the transient of a fully deterministic
dynamical system.
