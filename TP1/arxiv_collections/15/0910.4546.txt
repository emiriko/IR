Many multi-planet systems have been discovered in recent years. Some of them
are in mean-motion resonances (MMR). Planet formation theory was successful in
explaining the formation of 2:1, 3:1 and other low resonances as a result of
convergent migration. However, higher order resonances require high initial
orbital eccentricities in order to be formed by this process and these are in
general unexpected in a dissipative disk. We present a way of generating large
initial eccentricities using additional planets. This procedure allows us to
form high order MMRs and predict new planets using a genetic N-body code.
