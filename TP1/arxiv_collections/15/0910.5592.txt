We investigate the entanglement evolution of two qubits interacting with a
common environment trough an Heisenberg XX mechanism. We reveal the possibility
of realizing the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death as well as the
entanglement sudden birth acting on the environment. Such analysis is of
maximal interest at the light of the large applications that spin systems have
in quantum information theory.
