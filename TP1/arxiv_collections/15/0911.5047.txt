We explore the possibilities of using the fermionic functional
renormalization group to compute the phase diagram of systems with competing
instabilities. In order to overcome the ubiquituous divergences encountered in
RG flows, we propose to use symmetry breaking counterterms for each
instability, and employ a self-consistency condition for fixing the
counterterms. As a validity check, results are compared to known exact results
for the case of one-dimensional systems. We find that whilst one-dimensional
peculiarities, in particular algebraically decaying correlation functions, can
not be reproduced, the phase boundaries are reproduced accurately, encouraging
further explorations for higher-dimensional systems.
