We report coupling between magnetic and electric orders for antiferromagnetic
polycrystalline FeVO4 in which magnetism-induced polarization has been recently
found in noncollinear antiferromagnetic state below the second
antiferromagnetic phase transition at TN2=15.7K. In this low symmetry phase
space group P-1, the magnetic field dependence of electric polarization
evidences a clear magnetoelectric coupling in the noncollinear spin-configured
antiferromagnetic phase. The discontinuity of magnetodielectric effect observed
at the vicinity of the polar to nonpolar transition evidences competition
between different magnetodielectric couplings in the two different
antiferromagnetic states. The existence of thermal expansion anomaly near TN2
and magnetostriction effect support magnetoelastically mediated scenario of the
observed magnetoelectric effect.
