Newly synthesized perovskite NaOsO3 shows Curie-Weiss metallic nature at high
temperature and suddenly goes into an antiferromagnetically insulating state at
410 K on cooling. Electronic specific heat at the low temperature limit is
absent, indicating that the band gap fully opens. In situ observation in
electron microscopy undetected any lattice anomalies in the vicinity of the
transition temperature. It is most likely that the antiferromagnetic
correlation plays an essential role of the gap opening.
