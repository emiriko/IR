The physical origin of the leap second is discussed in terms of the new
gravity model. The calculated time shift of the earth rotation around the sun
for one year amounts to $\displaystyle{\Delta T \simeq 0.621 s/ year}$.
According to the data, the leap second correction for one year corresponds to
$\Delta T \simeq 0.63 \pm 0.03 s/ year $, which is in perfect agreement with
the prediction. This shows that the leap second is not originated from the
rotation of the earth in its own axis. Instead, it is the same physics as the
Mercury perihelion shift. We propose a novel dating method (Leap Second Dating)
which enables to determine the construction date of some archaeological objects
such as Stonehenge.
