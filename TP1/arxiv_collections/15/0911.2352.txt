A Monte Carlo simulation is carried out to investigate the magnetic ordering
in magnets with random anisotropy (RA). Our results show peculiar similarities
to recent experiments that the real part of ac susceptibility presents two
peaks for weak RA and only one for strong RA regardless of glassy critical
dynamics manifested for them. We demonstrate that the thermodynamic nature of
the low-temperature peak is a ferromagnetic-like dynamic phase transition to
quasi-long range order (QLRO) for the former. Our simulation, therefore, is
able to be incorporated with the experiments to help clarify the existence of
the QLRO theoretically predicted so far.
