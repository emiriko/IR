We present a method to enact a deterministic, measurement-free, optically
generated controlled-phase gate on two qubits defined by single electrons
trapped in large-area quantum dots in a planar microcavity. This method is
robust to optical quantum dot inhomogeneity, requires only a modest-$Q$ planar
cavity, employs only a single laser pulse, and allows the integration of many
entangled qubits on one semiconductor chip. We present the gate in the contexts
of both adiabatic evolution and geometric phases, and calculate the degradation
of performance in the presence of both spontaneous emission and cavity loss.
