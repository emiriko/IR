The SciBooNE experiment (Fermilab) recently published results of a search for
charged current coherent pion production in neutrino mode: muon neutrinos
scattering on carbon. The results of this study are that no evidence for
coherent pion production is observed, and SciBooNE set 90% confidence level
upper limits on the cross section ratio of charged current coherent pion
production to the total charged current cross section. Recently proposed new
coherent pion models predict a production of charged current coherent pion
events just below the SciBooNE's upper limit. Motivated by this, we performed a
search for charged current coherent pion production using SciBooNE's collected
antineutrino data since antineutrino data are expected to be more sensitive to
look at coherent pion production than neutrino data. This paper describes
preliminary results of a search for antineutrino charged current coherent pion
production at the SciBooNE experiment.
