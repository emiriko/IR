Spin susceptibility of superfluid 3He-B film with specular surfaces is
calculated. It is shown that, when the magnetic field is applied in a direction
perpendiculr to the film, the suseptibility is significantly enhanced by the
contribution from the surface bound states. No such enhancement is found for
the magnetic field parallel to the film. A simplified model with spatially
constant order parameter is used to elucidate the magnetic properties of the
surface bound states. The Majorana nature of the zero energy bound state is
also mentioned.
