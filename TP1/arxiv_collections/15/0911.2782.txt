The intersection of string theory with cosmology is unavoidable in the early
universe, and its exploration may shine light on both fields. In this thesis,
three papers at this intersection are presented and reviewed, with the aim of
providing a thorough and pedagogical guide to their results.
  First, we address the longstanding problem of finding a string theory
realisation of the axion. Using warped compactifications in heterotic string
theory, we show that the axion decay constant can be lowered to acceptable
values by the warp factor. Next, we move to the subject of cosmic strings,
whose network evolution could have important consequences for astrophysics and
cosmology. In particular, there are quantitative differences between cosmic
superstring networks and GUT cosmic string networks. We investigate the
properties of cosmic superstring networks in warped backgrounds, giving the
tension and properties of three-string junctions in these backgrounds. Finally,
we examine the possibility that cosmic strings in heterotic string theory could
be responsible for generating the galactic magnetic fields that seeded those
observed today.
