The aim of this paper is to give a unified definition of a large class of
discriminants arising in algebraic geometry using the discriminant of a
morphism of locally free sheaves. The discriminant of a morphism of locally
free sheaves has a geometric definition in terms of grassmannian bundles,
tautological sequences and projections and is a simultaneous generalization of
the discriminant of a morphism of schemes, the discriminant of a linear system
on a smooth projective scheme and the classical discriminant of degree $d$
polynomials. We study the discriminant of a morphism in various situations: The
discriminant of a finite morphism of schemes, the discriminant of a linear
system on the projective line and the discriminant of a linear system on a flag
variety. The main result of the paper is that the discrimiant of any linear
system on any flag variety is irreducible.
