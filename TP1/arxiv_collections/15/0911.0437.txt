In this paper we perform the calculation of the spectral dimension of
spacetime in 4d quantum gravity using the Barrett-Crane (BC) spinfoam model. We
realize this considering a very simple decomposition of the 4d spacetime
already used in the graviton propagator calculation and we introduce a boundary
state which selects a classical geometry on the boundary. We obtain that the
spectral dimension of the spacetime runs from $\approx 2$ to 4, across a
$\approx 1.5$ phase, when the energy of a probe scalar field decreases from
high $E \lesssim E_P/25$ to low energy. The spectral dimension at the Planck
scale $E \approx E_P$ depends on the areas spectrum used in the calculation.
For three different spectra $l_P^2 \sqrt{j(j+1)}$, $l_P^2 (2 j+1)$ and $l_P^2
j$ we find respectively dimension $\approx 2.31$, 2.45 and 2.08.
