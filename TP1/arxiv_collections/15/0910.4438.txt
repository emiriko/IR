Crystalline Bi5NbO10 nanoparticles have been achieved through a modified
sol-gel process using a mixture of ethylenediamine and ethanolamine as a
solvent. The Bi5NbO10 nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction
(XRD), differential scanning calorimetry/thermogravimetry, fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman
spectroscopy. The results showed that well-dispersed 5-60 nm Bi5NbO10
nanoparticles were prepared through heat-treating the precursor at 650C and the
high density pellets were obtained at temperatures lower than those commonly
employed. The frequency and temperature dependence of the dielectric constant
and the electrical conductivity of the Bi5NbO10 solid solutions were
investigated in the 0.1 Hz - 1 MHz frequency range. Two distinct relaxation
mechanisms were observed in the plots of dielectric loss and the imaginary part
of impedance versus frequency in the temperature range of 200-350oC. The
dielectric constant and the loss in the low frequency regime were electrode
dependent. The ionic conductivity of Bi5NbO10 solid solutions at 700oC is
2.86(ohm m)-1 which is in same order of magnitude for Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2
ceramics at same temperature. These results suggest that Bi5NbO10 is a
promising material for an oxygen-ion conductor.
