For volume reflection process in a bent crystal, exact analytic expressions
for positively- and negatively-charged particle trajectories are obtained
within a model of parabolic continuous potential in each interplanar interval,
with the neglect of incoherent multiple scattering. In the limit of the crystal
bending radius greatly exceeding the critical value, asymptotic formulas are
obtained for the particle mean deflection angle in units of Lindhard's critical
angle, and for the final beam profile. Volume reflection of negatively charged
particles is shown to contain effects of rainbow scattering and orbiting,
whereas with positively charged particles none of these effects arise within
the given model. The model predictions are compared with experimental results
and numerical simulations. Estimates of the volume reflection mean angle and
the final beam profile robustness under multiple scattering are performed.
