Quantum dimer models exhibit quantum critical points and liquid states when
the ground state is the resonating-valence bond (RVB) state. We construct
SU(2)-invariant spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with the same RVB ground state. The main
technical obstacle overcome is the fact that different "dimer" configurations
in the spin model are not orthogonal to each other. We show that the physics
depends on how dimers are related to the spins, and find a Hamiltonian that may
be quantum critical.
