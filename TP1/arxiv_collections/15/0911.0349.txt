Exceptional observational breakthroughs in the field of Gamma Ray Burst
research are not paralleled by theoretical advances. In this review, based on
the introductory talk given at the "The Shocking Universe" meeting, I argue
that any present day model of GRBs, especially of Short type, is grossly
incomplete. I will highlight various contradictions with observations that many
models face and briefly mention a number of ideas that might or might not work.
In particular, I will discuss (i) a possibility that early X-ray afterglows are
coming from internal dissipation, and not from the forwards shock; (ii) that
prompt radiation is beamed in the outflow frame.
