We study the sigma term and the strange quark content of nucleon in
2+1-flavor QCD with dynamical overlap fermions. We analyze the lattice data of
nucleon mass taken at two different strange quark masses with five values of up
and down quark masses each. Using the reweighting technique, we study the
strange quark mass dependence of the nucleon and extract the strange quark
content.
