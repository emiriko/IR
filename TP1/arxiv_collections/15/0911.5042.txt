Study design Are there neuro-anatomical abnormalities associated with
idiopathic scoliosis (IS)? Posterior Basicranium (PBA) reflects cerebellum
growth and contains vestibular organs, two structures suspected to be involved
in scoliosis. Objective The aim of this study was to compare posterior
basicranium asymmetry (PBA) in Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) and normal subjects.
  Method: To measure the shape of PBA in 3D, we defined an intra-cranial frame
of reference based on CNS and guided by embryology of the neural tube.
Measurements concerned three directions of space referred to a specific intra
cranial referential. Data acquisition was performed with T2 MRI (G.E. Excite
1.5T, mode Fiesta). We explored a scoliosis group of 76 women and 20 men with a
mean age of 17, 2 and a control group of 26 women and 16 men, with a mean age
of 27, 7.
  Results: IS revealed a significant asymmetry of PBA (Pr>|t|<.0001) in 3
directions of space compared to the control group. This asymmetry was more
pronounced in antero-posterior (AP) and lateral direction, forming a torque of
the posterior base shape associated with identical cerebellar torque.
