The properties of the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance have been investigated from
radiative decay of $K^- p\to Y\gamma$ and photoproduction $\gamma p\to
K^+\Lambda(1405)$ within the framework of the isobar model. For a consistent
result with recently measured branching ratios, the axial vector meson
$K_1(1270)$ is taken into account. Strong and electromagnetic coupling
constants of $\Lambda(1405)$ are extracted from these branching ratios and are
applied to the analysis of $K^+\Lambda(1405)$ photoproduction. The total and
differential cross sections are predicted.
