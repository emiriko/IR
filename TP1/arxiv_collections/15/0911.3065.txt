A new method, the Dynamical Systems Method (DSM), justified recently, is
applied to solving ill-conditioned linear algebraic system (ICLAS). The DSM
gives a new approach to solving a wide class of ill-posed problems. In this
paper a new iterative scheme for solving ICLAS is proposed. This iterative
scheme is based on the DSM solution. An a posteriori stopping rules for the
proposed method is justified. This paper also gives an a posteriori stopping
rule for a modified iterative scheme developed in A.G.Ramm, JMAA,330
(2007),1338-1346, and proves convergence of the solution obtained by the
iterative scheme.
