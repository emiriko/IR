We present a study of the frequency dependence of the vortex dynamics in a
conventional superconductor. We have employed a swept-frequency, Corbino-disk
technique to investigate the temperature (3.6K-Tc) and high-field (from Hc2/2
to Hc2) microwave complex resistivity in Nb thin (20-40 nm) films as a function
of the frequency (1-20 GHz). We have found several previously unnoticed
features: (i) a field-dependent depinning frequency in the GHz range; (ii)
deviations from the accepted frequency dependence, that can be ascribed to some
kind of vortex creep; (iii) the presence of switching phenomena, reminiscent of
vortex instabilities. We discuss the possible origin of the features here
reported.
