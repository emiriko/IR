We apply the heat kernel method (using Avramidi's non-recursive technique) to
the study of the effective action of chiral matter in a complex representation
of an arbitrary gauge sector coupled to background U(1) supergravity. This
generalizes previous methods, which restricted to 1) real representations of
the gauge sector in traditional Poincar\'e supergravity or 2) vanishing
supergravity background. In this new scheme, we identify a classical ambiguity
in these theories which mixes the supergravity U(1) with the gauge U(1). At the
quantum level, this ambiguity is maintained since the effective action changes
only by a local counterterm as one shifts a U(1) factor between the
supergravity and gauge sectors.
  An immediate application of our formalism is the calculation of the one-loop
gauge, Kahler, and reparametrization anomalies of chiral matter coupled to
minimal supergravity from purely chiral loops. Our approach gives an anomaly
whose covariant part is both manifestly supersymmetric and non-perturbative in
the Kahler potential.
