The properties of low-density neutron matter are important for the
understanding of neutron star crusts and the exterior of large neutron-rich
nuclei. We examine various properties of dilute neutron matter using quantum
Monte Carlo methods, with s- and p-wave terms in the interaction. Our results
provide a smooth evolution of the equation of state and pairing gap from
extremely small densities, where analytic expressions are available, up to the
strongly interacting regime probed experimentally and described theoretically
in cold atomic systems, where the Fermi momentum is approximately half an
inverse fermi and the pairing gap becomes of the order of magnitude of the
Fermi energy. We also present results for the momentum distribution and pair
distributions, displaying the same evolution from weak to strong coupling.
Combined with previous quantum Monte Carlo and other calculations at moderate
densities, these results provide strong constraints on the neutron matter
equation of state up to saturation densities.
