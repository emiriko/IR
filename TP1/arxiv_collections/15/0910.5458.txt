We propose and apply the finite-element discrete variable representation to
express the nonequilibrium Green's function for strongly inhomogeneous quantum
systems. This method is highly favorable against a general basis approach with
regard to numerical complexity, memory resources, and computation time. Its
flexibility also allows for an accurate representation of spatially extended
hamiltonians, and thus opens the way towards a direct solution of the two-time
Schwinger/Keldysh/Kadanoff-Baym equations on spatial grids, including e.g. the
description of highly excited states in atoms. As first benchmarks, we compute
and characterize, in Hartree-Fock and second Born approximation, the ground
states of the He atom, the H$_2$ molecule and the LiH molecule in one spatial
dimension. Thereby, the ground-state/binding energies, densities and
bond-lengths are compared with the direct solution of the time-dependent
Schr\"odinger equation.
