As an introduction to the special issue on "emerging nanotechnologies", this
paper puts in perspective contemporary debates and challenges about
nanotechnology. It presents an overview of diverse analyses and expectations
about this presumably revolutionary set of technological, scientific and
industrial developments. Three main lines of argument can then be delineated:
first of all, the degree of cumulativeness of science and technologies and the
respective roles of newcomers and incumbents in the industrial dynamics; second
the knowledge dynamics in nanotechnologies, especially the linkages by science
and technology and third the role of institutions (network, geographic
agglomeration and job market). It finally discusses methodologies to delineate
the field of nanotechnologies and to collect data.
