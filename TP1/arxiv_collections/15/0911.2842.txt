We shall present and analyze two examples of extended theories of gravitation
in Palatini formalism with matter that couples to the connection. This will
show that the class of Further Extended Theories of Gravitation introduced in
ref. [1] does not trivially reduce to f(R) models. It will also produce an
example of theory that on-shell endowes spacetime with a non-trivial Weyl
geometry where the connection is not induced by the metric structure (though it
is compatible with it in the sense of Ehlers-Pirani-Schild; see ref. [2]).
