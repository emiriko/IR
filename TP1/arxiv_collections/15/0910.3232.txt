Enslaved phase-separation fronts that move with a speed just smaller than
that of a free front will leave in their wake a morphology of alternating
domains that are roughly aligned with the front. However, these alternating
domains will typically not be in phase initially. Instead there are defects.
Here we present novel phase-separation morphologies that are formed in such
systems where the defects are reminiscent of spiral dislocations in crystal
growth.
