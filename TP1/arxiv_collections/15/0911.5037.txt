Tightness of a triangulated manifold is a topological condition, roughly
meaning that any simplexwise linear embedding of the triangulation into
euclidean space is "as convex as possible". It can thus be understood as a
generalization of the concept of convexity. In even dimensions,
super-neighborliness is known to be a purely combinatorial condition which
implies the tightness of a triangulation.
  Here we present other sufficient and purely combinatorial conditions which
can be applied to the odd-dimensional case as well. One of the conditions is
that all vertex links are stacked spheres, which implies that the triangulation
is in Walkup's class $\mathcal{K}(d)$. We show that in any dimension $d\geq 4$
\emph{tight-neighborly} triangulations as defined by Lutz, Sulanke and Swartz
are tight.
  Furthermore, triangulations with $k$-stacked vertex links and the centrally
symmetric case are discussed.
