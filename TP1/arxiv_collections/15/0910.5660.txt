This is a reply to the comment of Schmelzer on my earlier paper. In contrast
to Schmelzer's claims, it is shown that passive locality does not correspond to
the completeness condition of EPR. Nevertheless, it is argued that Schmelzer
has found several errors in my article which, fortunately, can be corrected. In
spite of Schmelzer's arguments, the Fritsche-Haugk theory can be used to define
a local hidden variable theory for the singlet state.
