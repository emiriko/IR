We have constructed an optical clock with a fractional frequency inaccuracy
of 8.6e-18, based on quantum logic spectroscopy of an Al+ ion. A simultaneously
trapped Mg+ ion serves to sympathetically laser-cool the Al+ ion and detect its
quantum state. The frequency of the 1S0->3P0 clock transition is compared to
that of a previously constructed Al+ optical clock with a statistical
measurement uncertainty of 7.0e-18. The two clocks exhibit a relative stability
of 2.8e-15/ sqrt(tau), and a fractional frequency difference of -1.8e-17,
consistent with the accuracy limit of the older clock.
