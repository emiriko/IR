Adaptive control technique is adopted to synchronize two identical
non-autonomous systems with unknown parameters in finite time. A virtual
unknown parameter is introduced in order to avoid the unknown parameters from
appearing in the controllers and parameters update laws. The Duffing equation
and a gyrostat system are chosen as the numerical examples to show the validity
of the present method.
