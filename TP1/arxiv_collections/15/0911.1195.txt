We discuss some problems concerning the application of perturbative QCD to
high energy processes. In particular for hard processes, we analyze higher
order and higher twist corrections. It is argued that these effects are of
great importance for understanding the behaviour of pion electromagnetic form
factor at moderately large momentum transfers. For soft processes, we show that
summing the contributions of the lowest twist operators leads to a Regge-like
amplitude.
