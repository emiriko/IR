Determining the magnetic field related to solar spicules is vital for
developing adequate models of these plasma jets, which are thought to play a
key role in the thermal, dynamic and magnetic structure of the Chromosphere.
Here we report on the magnetic properties of off-limb spicules in a very quiet
region of the solar atmosphere, as inferred from new spectropolarimetric
observations in the He I 10830 A triplet obtained with the Tenerife Infrared
Polarimeter. We have used a novel inversion code for Stokes profiles caused by
the joint action of atomic level polarization and the Hanle and Zeeman effects
(HAZEL) to interpret the observations. Magnetic fields as strong as ~40G were
detected in a very localized area of the slit, which could represent a possible
lower value of the field strength of organized network spicules.
