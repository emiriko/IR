For the session on future facilities at DIS09 discussions were organized on
DIS related measurements that can be expected in the near and medium - or
perhaps far - future, including plans from JLab, CERN and FNAL fixed target
experiments, possible measurements and detector upgrades at RHIC, as well as
the plans for possible future electron proton/ion colliders such as the EIC and
the LHeC project.
