We report significant transport critical currents firstly achieved in
Sr0.6K0.4Fe2As2 wires and tapes with a Tc = 34 K, which were fabricated through
an in-situ powder-in-tube process. Silver was used as a chemical addition as
well as a sheath material. Transport measurements were performed by a standard
four-probe resistive method. All the wire and tape samples have shown transport
properties. Critical current density Jc was enhanced upon silver addition, and
at 4.2 K, a best Jc of ~1200 A/cm^2 (Ic = 9 A) was achieved for 20 % silver
added tapes, which is the highest in iron-based wires and tapes so far. The Jc
is almost field independent between 1 T and 10 T, exhibiting a strong vortex
pinning. Such a high transport critical current density is attributed to the
absence of reaction layer between the silver sheath and superconducting core,
as well as an improved connectivity between grains. We also identify a
weak-link behavior from the creep drop of Jc at low fields and a hysteretic
phenomenon. Finally, we found that compared to Fe, Ta and Nb tubes, Ag was the
best sheath material for the fabrication of high-performance 122 type pnictide
wires and tapes.
