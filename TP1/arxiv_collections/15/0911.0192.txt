We analytically examine the pair interaction for parallel, discrete helices
of charge. Symmetry arguments allow for the energy to be decomposed into a sum
of terms, each of which has an intuitive geometric interpretation. Truncated
Fourier expansions for these terms allow for accurate modeling of both the
axial and azimuthal terms in the interaction energy and these expressions are
shown to be insensitive to the form of the interaction. The energy is evaluated
numerically through application of an Ewald-like summation technique for the
particular case of unscreened Coulomb interactions between the charges of the
two helices. The mode structures and electrostatic energies of flexible helices
are also studied. Consequences of the resulting energy expressions are
considered for both F-actin and A-DNA aggregates.
