This is a limited review and update of the status of Heavy Flavor Physics.
After we review the flavor problem we discuss a number of topics: recent
puzzles in purely leptonic D and B decays and their possible resolutions,
mixing in neutral B and D mesons, the determination of |Vcb| and |Vub| from
semileptonic decays, and we conclude with radiative B decays.
