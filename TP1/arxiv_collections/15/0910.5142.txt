Cosmology is operating now on a well established and tightly constraining
empirical basis. The relativistic LambdaCDM hot big bang theory is consistent
with all the present tests; it has become the benchmark. But the many open
issues in this subject make it reasonable to expect that a more accurate
cosmology will have more interesting physics in the invisible sector of the
universe, and maybe also in the visible part.
