Coronal emission line intensities are commonly used to measure electron
temperatures using emission measure and/or line ratio methods. In the presence
of systematic errors in atomic excitation calculations and data noise, the
information on underlying temperature distributions is fundamentally limited.
Increasing the number of emission lines used does not necessarily improve the
ability to discriminate between different kinds of temperature distributions.
