A collective electron transfer (ET) process was discovered by studying the
current noise in a field effect transistor with light-sensitive gate formed by
nanocrystals linked by organic molecules to its surface. Fluctuations in the ET
through the organic linker are reflected in the fluctuations of the transistor
conductivity. The current noise has an avalanche character. Critical exponents
obtained from the noise power spectra, avalanche distributions, and the
dependence of the average avalanche size on avalanche duration are consistent
with each other. A plausible model is proposed for this phenomenon
