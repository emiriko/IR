These notes were originally prepared as additional material for the lessons I
have given at the summer school Gamma-ray Astrophysics and Multifrequency: Data
analysis and astroparticle problems, organized by the Department of Physics of
the University of Perugia (Italy) on July 3-7, 2006. The necessarily limited
time of the lessons forced to a drastic selection of the topics and, therefore,
I have thought it was useful to complete the slides of the presentation with
the notes you find in these few pages. These notes are a kind of ``link''
between the theoretical approach of the University lessons and the practice of
the real use. During these years, I have seen that this material is useful for
students that are beginning their thesis on research topics based on the use
and the interpretation of data from X- and gamma-ray satellites. Therefore, I
have thought to update the content of these notes, to translate them into
English and to post on arXiv, in order to make them available to a larger
public, hoping to give a useful help to other beginners. Since the public is
basically composed of graduating students, I have assumed a well-grounded
knowledge of basic astrophysics, the principles of instrumentation for physical
sciences and the statistical analysis. Therefore, I have focused my notes on
the practical issues and given some bibliographic references, just some advice,
just to draw the attention on some points that are too much detailed for a
university lesson. Nevertheless, the bibliography should be also a good
starting point for those who want to further explore these topics.
