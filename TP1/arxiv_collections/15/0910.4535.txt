We study SU(2) lattice gauge theory with two flavours of Dirac fermions in
the adjoint representation. We measure the running of the coupling in the
Schroedinger Functional (SF) scheme and find it is consistent with existing
results. We discuss how systematic errors affect the evidence for an infrared
fixed point (IRFP). We present the first measurement of the running of the mass
in the SF scheme. The anomalous dimension of the chiral condensate, which is
relevant for phenomenological applications, can be easily extracted from the
running of the mass, under the assumption that the theory has an IRFP. At the
current level of accuracy, we can estimate 0.05 < gamma < 0.56 at the IRFP.
