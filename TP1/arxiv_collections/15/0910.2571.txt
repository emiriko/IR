We study gauge symmetry in F-theory in light of global aspects. For this, we
consider not only a simple (local) group, but also a semi-simple group with
Abelian factors. Once we specify the complete gauge group by decomposing the
discriminant, analogous to arranging 7-branes, we can derive the matter
contents, their localization and the relation to enhanced groups. Global
constraints coming from Calabi--Yau conditions and anomaly cancellations imply
a unified group. The semisiple group shows explicit formation of matter curves
and nontriviality of its embedding into exceptional group. Also the dual
heterotic string vacua with line bundles provide a guide on the unification.
