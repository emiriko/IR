We study charged excitations of the non-abelian Moore-Read liquid at filling
factor nu=5/2, allowing for spin depolarization. Using a combination of
numerical studies, and taking account of non-zero well widths, we find that at
sufficiently low Zeeman energy it is energetically favourable for charge e/4
quasiholes to bind into "skyrmions" of charge e/2. We show that skyrmion
formation is further promoted by disorder, and argue that this can lead to a
depolarized nu=5/2 ground state in realistic experimental situations. We
comment on the consequences for the activated transport.
