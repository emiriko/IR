The production cross sections of $e^+e^- $ to a heavy quarkonium with
$C$-parity even $S-$wave and $P-$wave associated with a photon are analyzed in
the framework of non-relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics(NRQCD) factorization
formalism. The short-distance coefficients are determined up to the
next-to-leading order(NLO) QCD radiative corrections for $S-$ and $P-$wave and
NLO relativistic corrections for $S-$wave in analytical forms. Applying the
results to estimate the cross sections we find that both the radiative and
relativistic corrections are considerable.
