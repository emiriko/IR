We present new high spatial resolution (<~ 0.1") 1-5 micron adaptive optics
images, interferometric 1.3 mm continuum and 12CO 2-1 maps, and 350 micron, 2.8
and 3.3 mm fluxes measurements of the HV Tau system. Our adaptive optics images
reveal an unusually slow orbital motion within the tight HV Tau AB pair that
suggests a highly eccentric orbit and/or a large deprojected physical
separation. Scattered light images of the HV Tau C edge-on protoplanetary disk
suggest that the anisotropy of the dust scattering phase function is almost
independent of wavelength from 0.8 to 5 micron, whereas the dust opacity
decreases significantly over the same range. The images further reveal a marked
lateral asymmetry in the disk that does not vary over a timescale of 2 years.
We further detect a radial velocity gradient in the disk in our 12CO map that
lies along the same position angle as the elongation of the continuum emission,
which is consistent with Keplerian rotation around an 0.5-1 Msun central star,
suggesting that it could be the most massive component in the triple system. We
use a powerful radiative transfer model to compute synthetic disk observations
and use a Bayesian inference method to extract constraints on the disk
properties. Each individual image, as well as the spectral energy distribution,
of HV Tau C can be well reproduced by our models with fully mixed dust provided
grain growth has already produced larger-than-interstellar dust grains.
However, no single model can satisfactorily simultaneously account for all
observations. We suggest that future attempts to model this source include more
complex dust properties and possibly vertical stratification. (Abridged)
