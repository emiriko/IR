An infinite square well with a discontinuous step is one of the simplest
systems to exhibit non-Newtonian ray-splitting periodic orbits in the
semiclassical limit. This system is analyzed using both time-independent
perturbation theory (PT) and periodic-orbit theory and the approximate formulas
for the energy eigenvalues derived from these two approaches are compared. The
periodic orbits of the system can be divided into classes according to how many
times they reflect from the potential step. Different classes of orbits
contribute to different orders of PT. The dominant term in the second-order PT
correction is due to non-Newtonian orbits that reflect from the step exactly
once. In the limit in which PT converges the periodic-orbit theory results
agree with those of PT, but outside of this limit the periodic-orbit theory
gives much more accurate results for energies above the potential step.
