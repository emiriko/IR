Common wisdom associates all the unraveled and theoretically challenging
aspects of gravity with its UV-completion. However, there appear to be few
difficulties afflicting the effective framework for gravity already at low
energy, that are likely to be detached from the high-energy structure. Those
include the black hole information paradox, the cosmological constant problem
and the rather involved and fine tuned model building required to explain our
cosmological observations. I review some on-going research that aims to
generalize and extend the low-energy framework for gravity. In a quantum
informational fashion, regions of space at a given time are treated and
described as quantum subsystems, rather than submanifolds. The idea is to
define a region of space through the quantum degrees of freedom of the matter
fields "living therein". I show how the correspondence sub-system/sub-manifold
is realized in standard semi-classical gravity ("standard localization") and
discuss the implications of alternative localization schemes. By exploiting
further the subsystem description, I then consider the possibility that the
usual GR metric manifold description might break down in the infra-red. This
has implications on the description of the Universe on the largest scales and
on dark energy.
