We reconsider the problem of the compatibility of quantum nonlocality and the
requests for a relativistically invariant theoretical scheme. We begin by
discussing a recent important paper by T. Norsen [arXiv:0808.2178] on this
problem and we enlarge our considerations to give a general picture of the
conceptually relevant issue to which this paper is devoted.
