A large set of data on proton-proton differential cross sections, analyzing
powers and the double polarization parameter A_NN is analyzed employing the
Regge formalism. We find that the data available at proton beam momenta from 3
GeV/c to 50 GeV/c exhibit features that are very well in line with the general
characteristics of Regge phenomenology and can be described with a model that
includes the rho, omega, f_2, and a_2 trajectories and single Pomeron exchange.
Additional data, specifically for spin-dependent observables at forward angles,
would be very helpful for testing and refining our Regge model.
