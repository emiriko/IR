High energy inclusive hadron production in the central kinematical region is
analyzed within the models of unitarized pomeron. It is shown that the sum of
multipomeron exchanges with intercept $\alpha_P(0)>1$ reproduce qualitatively
contribution of the triple pole (at $t=0$) pomeron to inclusive cross section.
Basing on this analogy we then suggest a general form of unitarized pomeron
contributions (in particular the dipole or tripole pomeron) to inclusive cross
section. They lead to a parabolic form of the rapidity distribution giving
$<n>\propto \ln^3s$ (tripole) or $<n>\propto \ln^2s$ (dipole). The models
considered with suggested parametrization of $p_t$-dependence for cross
sections well describe the rapidity distributions data in $pp$ and $\bar pp$
interactions at energy $\sqrt{s}\geq 200$ GeV. The predictions for one particle
inclusive production at LHC energies are given.
