We re-examine the evolutionary dynamics of RNA secondary structures under
directional selection towards an optimum RNA structure. We find that the
punctuated equilibria lead to a very slow approach to the optimum, following on
average an inverse power of the evolutionary time. In addition, our study of
the trajectories shows that the out-of-equilibrium effects due to the
evolutionary process are very weak. In particular, the distribution of
genotypes is close to that arising during equilibrium stabilizing selection. As
a consequence, the evolutionary dynamics leave almost no measurable
out-of-equilibrium trace, only the transition genotypes (close to the border
between different periods of stasis) have atypical mutational properties.
