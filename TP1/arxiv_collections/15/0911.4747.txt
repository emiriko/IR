We have constructed a detailed spectral atlas covering the wavelength region
930A to 1225A for 10 sharp-lined B0-B9 stars near the main sequence. Most of
the spectra we assembled are from the archives of the FUSE satellite, but for
nine stars wavelength coverage above 1188A was taken from high-resolution IUE
or echelle HST/STIS spectra. To represent the tenth star at type B0.2 V we used
the Copernicus atlas of tau Sco. We made extensive line identifications in the
region 949A to 1225A of all atomic features having published oscillator
strengths at types B0, B2, and B8. These are provided as a supplementary data
product - hence the term detailed atlas. Our list of found features totals
2288, 1612, and 2469 lines, respectively. We were able to identify 92%, 98%,
and 98% of these features with known atomic transitions with varying degrees of
certainty in these spectra. The remaining lines do not have published
oscillator strengths. Photospheric lines account for 94%, 87%, and 91%,
respectively, of all our iden- tifications, with the remainder being due to
interstellar (usually molecular H2) lines. We also discuss the numbers of lines
with respect to the distributions of various ions for these three most studied
spectral subtypes. A table is also given of 167 least blended lines that can be
used as possible diagnostics of physical conditions in B star atmospheres.
