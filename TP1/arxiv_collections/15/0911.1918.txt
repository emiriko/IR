The two-step cascade method previously used in neutron capture experiments is
now applied to a proton capture reaction. The spectrum of two-step cascades
populating the first 2+ level of 60Ni has been measured with 59Co(p,2gamma)60Ni
reaction. The simulation technique used for the spectrum analysis allows one to
reveal the range of possible shapes of both E1 and M1 gamma-strength functions.
The low-energy enhancement previously observed in 3He induced reactions is seen
to appear in M1 strength functions of 60Ni.
