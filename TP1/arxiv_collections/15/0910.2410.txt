The amplification obtained using weak values is quantified through a detailed
investigation of the signal to noise ratio for an optical beam deflection
measurement. We show that for a given deflection, input power and beam radius,
the use of interferometric weak values allows one to obtain the optimum signal
to noise ratio using a coherent beam. This method has the advantage of reduced
technical noise and allows for the use of detectors with a low saturation
intensity. We report on an experiment which improves the signal to noise ratio
for a beam deflection measurement by a factor of 54 when compared to a
measurement using the same beam size and a quantum limited detector.
