We review Darboux-Crum transformation of Heun's differential equation. By
rewriting an integral transformation of Heun's differential equation into a
form of elliptic functions, we see that the integral representation is a
generalization of Darboux-Crum transformation. We also consider conservation of
monodromy with respect to the transformations.
