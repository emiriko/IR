We study heating effects of a single metallic quantum dot weakly coupled to
two leads. The dominant mechanism for heating at low temperatures is due to
inelastic electron cotunneling processes. We calculate the grain temperature
profile as a function of grain parameters, bias voltage, and time and show that
for nanoscale size grains the heating effects are pronounced and easily
measurable in experiments.
