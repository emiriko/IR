Weight-balanced and doubly stochastic digraphs are two classes of digraphs
that play an essential role in a variety of cooperative control problems,
including formation control, distributed averaging, and optimization. We refer
to a digraph as doubly stochasticable (weight-balanceable) if it admits a
doubly stochastic (weight-balanced) adjacency matrix. This paper studies the
characterization of both classes of digraphs, and introduces distributed
algorithms to compute the appropriate set of weights in each case.
