We experimentally demonstrate that critical Casimir forces in colloidal
systems can be continuously tuned by the choice of boundary conditions. The
interaction potential of a colloidal particle in a mixture of water and
2,6-lutidine has been measured above a substrate with a gradient in its
preferential adsorption properties for the mixture's components. We find that
the interaction potentials at constant temperature but different positions
relative to the gradient continuously change from attraction to repulsion. This
demonstrates that critical Casimir forces respond not only to minute
temperature changes but also to small changes in the surface properties.
