We used Suzaku observations of the molecular cloud MBM20 and a low neutral
hydrogen column density region nearby to separate and characterize the
foreground and background diffuse X-ray emission. A comparison with a previous
observation of the same regions with XMM-Newton indicates a significant change
in the foreground flux which is attributed to Solar Wind Charge eXchange
(SWCX). The data have also been compared with previous results from similar
"shadow" experiments and with a SWCX model to characterize its O VII and O VIII
emission.
