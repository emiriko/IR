We present Chandra snapshot observations of the first large X-ray sample of
optically identified fossil groups. For 9 of 14 candidate groups, we are able
to determine the X-ray luminosity and temperature, which span a range typical
of large ellipticals to rich groups of galaxies. We discuss these initial
results in the context of group IGM and central galaxy ISM evolution, and we
also describe plans for a deep X-ray follow-up program.
