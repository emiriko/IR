Innovation and technology management is an inevitable issue in the high end
technological and innovative organizations. Today, most of the innovations are
limited with developed countries like USA, Japan and Europe while developing
countries are still behind in the field of innovation and management of
technology. But it is also becoming a subject for rapid progress and
development in developing countries. Innovation and technology environment in
developing countries are by nature, problematic, characterized by poor business
models, political instability and governance conditions, low education level
and lack of world-class research universities, an underdeveloped and mediocre
physical infrastructure, and lack of solid technology based on trained human
resources. This paper provides a theoretical and conceptual framework analysis
for managing innovation and technology in developing countries like India and
China. We present the issues and challenges in innovation and technology
management and come up with proposed solutions.
