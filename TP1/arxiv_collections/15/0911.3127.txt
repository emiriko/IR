I discuss the role of lattice QCD in testing the Standard Model and searching
for physics beyond the Standard Model in the quark flavor sector. I first
review the Standard Model CKM framework. I then present the current status of
the CKM matrix, focusing on determinations of CKM matrix elements and
constraints on the CKM unitarity triangle that rely on lattice QCD calculations
of weak matrix elements. I also show the potential impact of improved lattice
QCD calculations on the global CKM unitarity triangle fit. I then describe
several hints of new physics in the quark flavor sector that rely on lattice
QCD calculations of weak matrix elements, such as evidence of a ~2-3 sigma
tension in the CKM unitarity triangle and the "f_{D_s} puzzle". I finish with a
discussion of lattice QCD calculations of rare B- and K-decays needed to probe
physics beyond the Standard Model at future experiments.
