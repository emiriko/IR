The Double Chooz experiment will use the electron antineutrinos produced by
the Chooz nuclear power station to search for a non-vanishing value of the
Theta_13 neutrino mixing angle. Double Chooz will be the first of a new
generation of neutrino experiments using identical detectors at different
distances from the neutrino source to reduce the systematic errors due to the
uncertainties on the neutrino flux and to the detector acceptance. The far
detector is expected to be operative by the beginning of 2010. Installation of
the near detector will occur in 2010.
