The structure of domain walls delimiting magnetic bubbles in L10 FePd thin
layers is described on the basis of Lorentz transmission electron microscopy
(LTEM) and multiscale magnetic simulations. Images obtained by high resolution
LTEM show the existence of magnetization reversal areas inside domain walls,
called vertical Bloch lines (VBLs). Combining these observations and multiscale
simulations on various geometries, we can identify the structure of these VBLs,
notably the presence or not of magnetic singularities.
