In this paper we present theoretical studies of spin dependent transport in
Fe/Cr/MgO/Fe tunnel junctions with non-collinear alignment of magnetizations of
metallic layers comprising these MTJs. Calculations are performed with use of
non-equilibrium Green function technique in the framework of Keldysh formalism.
WKB approximation is used for wave and Green functions in the trapezoidal
barrier region under applied voltage. Electronic structure of ferromagnetic
electrodes is modeled with two bands model, i.e. with majority s-electrons and
minority d-holes. Furthermore, we introduce s-d hybridization by calculating
the corresponding perturbation corrections for the wave and Green functions.
