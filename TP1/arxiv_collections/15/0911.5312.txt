We calculate a collective number of thermodynamic quantities in a
one-dimensional gas of hard elongated objects (such as needles) whose centers
mobile on a line. Our formalism uses an approximation for the probabilities of
contact between the objects. We show that in moderate pressures the quantities
extracted from the noncentral potential do not rely on its noncentrality,
instead we can extract them analytically from a central potential. Our
formalism reproduces the nontrivial features of a gas of elongated objects.
Finally, we show below a crossover pressure $p_o$ the rotational couplings
causes quantities proportional to inverse distance (such as density) are on
average deviated from the inverse of average distance.
