This article describes the fluid dynamics video, "A Numerical Simulation of a
Plunging Breaking Wave", which was submitted to the gallery of fluid motion at
the 2009 APS/DFD conference. The simulation was of a deep-water plunging
breaking wave. It was a two-phase calculation which used a Volume of Fluid
(VOF) method to simulate the interface between the two immiscible fluids.
Surface tension and viscous effects were not considered. The initial wave was
generated by applying a spatio-temporal pressure forcing on the free surface.
The video shows the 50% isocontour of the volume fraction from several
different perspectives. Significant air entrainment is observed as well as the
presence of stream-wise vortex structures.
