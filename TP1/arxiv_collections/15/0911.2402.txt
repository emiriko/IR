We investigate the transport properties of a one-dimensional
superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (S-N-S) system described within the
tight-binding approximation. We compute the equilibrium dc Josephson current
and the time-dependent oscillating current generated after the switch-on of a
constant bias. In the first case an exact embedding procedure to calculate the
Nambu-Gorkov Keldysh Green's function is employed and used to derive the
continuum and bound states contributions to the dc current. A general formalism
to obtain the Andreev bound states (ABS) of a normal chain connected to
superconducting leads is also presented. We identify a regime in which all
Josephson current is carried by the ABS and obtain an analytic formula for the
current-phase relation in the limit of long chains. In the latter case the
condition for perfect Andreev reflections is expressed in terms of the
microscopic parameters of the model, showing a limitation of the so called
wide-band-limit (WBL) approximation. When a finite bias is applied to the S-N-S
junction we compute the exact time-evolution of the system by solving
numerically the time-dependent Bogoliubov-deGennes equations. We provide a
microscopic description of the electron dynamics not only inside the normal
region but also in the superconductors, thus gaining more information with
respect to WBL-based approaches. Our scheme allows us to study the ac regime as
well as the transient dynamics whose characteristic time-scale is dictated by
the velocity of multiple Andreev reflections.
