For ghost imaging, pursuing high resolution images and short acquisition
times required for reconstructing images are always two main goals. We report
an image reconstruction algorithm called compressive sampling (CS)
reconstruction to recover ghost images. By CS reconstruction, ghost imaging
with both super-resolution and a good signal-to-noise ratio can be obtained via
short acquisition times. Both effect influencing and approaches further
improving the resolution of ghost images via CS reconstruction, relationship
between ghost imaging and CS theory are also discussed.
