In order to explain the inflated radii of some transiting extrasolar giant
planets, we investigate a tidal heating scenario for the inflated planets
WASP-4b, WASP-6b, WASP-12b, WASP-15b, and TrES-4. To do so, we assume that they
retain a nonzero eccentricity, possibly by dint of continuing interaction with
a third body. We calculate the amount of extra heating in the envelope that is
then required to fit the radius of each planet, and we explore how this
additional power depends on the planetary atmospheric opacity and on the mass
of a heavy-element central core. There is a degeneracy between the core mass
$M_{\rm core}$ and the heating $\dot{E}_{\rm heating}$. Therefore, in the case
of tidal heating, there is for each planet a range of the couple $\{M_{\rm
core},e^2/Q'_p\}$ that can lead to the same radius, where $Q'_p$ is the tidal
dissipation factor and $e$ is the eccentricity. With this in mind, we also
investigate the case of the non-inflated planet HAT-P-12b, which can admit
solutions combining a heavy-element core and tidal heating. A substantial
improvement of the measured eccentricities of such planetary systems could
simplify this degeneracy by linking the two unknown parameters $\{M_{\rm
core},Q'_p\}$. Further independent constraints on either of these parameters
would, through our calculations, constrain the other.
