We have observed the interferometric suspension of a free-falling
Bose-Einstein condensate periodically submitted to multiple-order diffraction
by a vertical 1D standing wave. The various diffracted matter waves recombine
coherently, resulting in high contrast interference in the number of atoms
detected at constant height. For long suspension times, multiple-wave
interference is revealed through a sharpening of the fringes. We use this
scheme to measure the acceleration of gravity.
