By coupling a solar surface flux transport model with an extrapolation of the
heliospheric field, we simulate the evolution of the Sun's open magnetic flux
and the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) based on observational data of sunspot
groups since 1976. The results are consistent with measurements of the
interplanetary magnetic field near Earth and with the tilt angle of the HCS as
derived from extrapolation of the observed solar surface field. This opens the
possibility for an improved reconstruction of the Sun's open flux and the HCS
into the past on the basis of empirical sunspot data.
