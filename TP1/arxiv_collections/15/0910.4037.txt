From the seismic data obtained by CoRoT for the star HD 49933 it is possible,
as for the Sun, to constrain models of the excitation of acoustic modes by
turbulent convection. We compare a stochastic excitation model described in
Paper I (arXiv:0910.4027) with the asteroseismology data for HD 49933, a star
that is rather metal poor and significantly hotter than the Sun. Using the mode
linewidths measured by CoRoT for HD 49933 and the theoretical mode excitation
rates computed in Paper I, we derive the expected surface velocity amplitudes
of the acoustic modes detected in HD 49933. Using a calibrated quasi-adiabatic
approximation relating the mode amplitudes in intensity to those in velocity,
we derive the expected values of the mode amplitude in intensity. Our amplitude
calculations are within 1-sigma error bars of the mode surface velocity
spectrum derived with the HARPS spectrograph. The same is found with the mode
amplitudes in intensity derived for HD 49933 from the CoRoT data. On the other
hand, at high frequency, our calculations significantly depart from the CoRoT
and HARPS measurements. We show that assuming a solar metal abundance rather
than the actual metal abundance of the star would result in a larger
discrepancy with the seismic data. Furthermore, calculations that assume the
``new'' solar chemical mixture are in better agreement with the seismic data
than those that assume the ``old'' solar chemical mixture. These results
validate, in the case of a star significantly hotter than the Sun and Alpha Cen
A, the main assumptions in the model of stochastic excitation. However, the
discrepancies seen at high frequency highlight some deficiencies of the
modelling, whose origin remains to be understood.
