We use the unitary and analytic model of the pion electromagnetic form factor
in order to evaluate in the lowest order the $e^{+}e^{-}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$
contribution into the muon magnetic anomaly. We demonstrate, that this
technique enables us to reduce the uncertainty of the theoretical prediction
importantly in comparison to usual approaches, where the measured data are
integrated directly.
