The WWW is the most important source of information. But, there is no
guarantee for information correctness and lots of conflicting information is
retrieved by the search engines and the quality of provided information also
varies from low quality to high quality. We provide enhanced trustworthiness in
both specific (entity) and broad (content) queries in web searching. The
filtering of trustworthiness is based on 5 factors: Provenance, Authority, Age,
Popularity, and Related Links. The trustworthiness is calculated based on these
5 factors and it is stored thereby increasing the performance in retrieving
trustworthy websites. The calculated trustworthiness is stored only for static
websites. Quality is provided based on policies selected by the user. Quality
based ranking of retrieved trusted information is provided using WIQA (Web
Information Quality Assessment) Framework.
