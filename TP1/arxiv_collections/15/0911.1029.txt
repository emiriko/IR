Active galactic nuclei (AGN) found at the centers of clusters of galaxies are
a possible source for weak cluster-wide magnetic fields. To evaluate this
scenario, we present 3D adaptive mesh refinement MHD simulations of a cool-core
cluster that include injection of kinetic, thermal, and magnetic energy via an
AGN-powered jet. Using the MHD solver in FLASH 2, we compare several
sub-resolution approaches that link the estimated accretion rate as measured on
the simulation mesh to the accretion rate onto the central black hole and the
resulting feedback. We examine the effects of magnetized outflows on the
accretion history of the black hole and discuss the ability of these models to
magnetize the cluster medium.
