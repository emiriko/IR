Instanton effects on the Euclidean correlation function of two Wilson loops
at an angle $\theta$, relevant to soft high-energy dipole-dipole scattering,
are calculated in the Instanton Liquid Model and compared with the existing
lattice data. Moreover, the instanton-induced dipole-dipole potential is
obtained from the same correlation function at $\theta=0$, and compared with
preliminary lattice data.
