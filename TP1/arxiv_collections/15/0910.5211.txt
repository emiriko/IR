We discuss the problem of the universal scalings in the double ionization of
atomic K-shell electrons caused by absorption of a single photon. In
particular, we envisage the following questions: Under which conditions and up
to which accuracy the universal scalings are realized? Does it make sense to
talk about different physical mechanisms in the double-ionization process?
Finally, we present also the theoretical analysis of recent experimental
measurements performed on neutral atoms. As a testing ground, QED perturbation
theory is employed.
