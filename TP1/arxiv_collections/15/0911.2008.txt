Analytical relations are derived for the amplitude of astrometric,
photometric and radial velocity perturbations caused by a single rotating spot.
The relative power of the star spot jitter is estimated and compared with the
available data for $\kappa^1$ Ceti and HD 166435, as well as with numerical
simulations for $\kappa^1$ Ceti and the Sun. A Sun-like star inclined at
$i=90\degr$ at 10 pc is predicted to have a RMS jitter of 0.087 \uas in its
astrometric position along the equator, and 0.38 m s$^{-1}$ in radial
velocities. If the presence of spots due to stellar activity is the ultimate
limiting factor for planet detection, the sensitivity of SIM Lite to Earth-like
planets in habitable zones is about an order of magnitude higher that the
sensitivity of prospective ultra-precise radial velocity observations of nearby
stars.
