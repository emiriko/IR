The SuperAGILE (SA) instrument is a X-ray detector for As- trophysics
measurements, part of the Italian AGILE satellite for X-Ray and Gamma-Ray
Astronomy launched at 23/04/2007 from India. SuperAGILE is now studying the sky
in the 18 - 60 KeV energy band. It is detecting sources with advanced imaging
and timing detection and good spectral detection capabilities. Several
astrophysical sources has been detected and localized, including Crab, Vela and
GX 301-2. The instrument has the skill to resolve correctly sources in a field
of view of [-40, +40] degrees interval, with the angular resolution of 6
arcmin, and a spectral analysis with the resolution of 8 keV. Transient events
are regularly detected by SA with the aid of its temporal resolution (2
microsec- onds) and using signal coincidence on different portions of the
instrument, with confirmation from other observatories. The SA data processing
scientic software performing at the AGILE Ground Segment is divided in modules,
grouped in a processing pipeline named SASOA. The processing steps can be
summarized in data reduction, photonlist building, sources extraction and
sources analysis. The software services allow orbital data processing (near
real-time), daily data set integration, Temporal Data Set (TDS) processing and
TDS processing with source target optimization (TDS SRC). Automatic data
processing monitoring and interactive data analysis is possible from an
internet connected worksta- tion, with the use of SA data processing Web
services. Many solutions were implemented in order to achieve fault tolerance.
Archive management and data storage are performed with the help of relational
database instruments.
