In this article, the interaction of an arbitrary number of quantum dots,
behaving as artificial molecules, with different energy levels and multi-mode
electromagnetic field is studied. We make the assumption that each quantum dot
can be represented as an atom with zero kinetic energy, and that all excitonic
effects except dipole-dipole interactions may be disregarded. We use
Jaynes-Cummings-Paul model with applications to quantum systems based on a
time-dependent Hamiltonian and entangled states. We obtain a system of
equations describing the interaction and present a method to solve the
equations analytically for a single mode field within the Rotating-Wave
Approximation. As an example of the applicability of this approach, we solve
the system of two two-level quantum dots in a lossless cavity with two modes of
electromagnetic field. We furthermore study the evolution of entanglement by
defining and computing the concurrency.
