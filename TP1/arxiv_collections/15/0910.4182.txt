With the discovery of the Higgs boson the LHC experiments have closed the
most important gap in our understanding of fundamental interactions. We now
know that the interactions between elementary particles can be described by
quantum field theory, more specifically by a renormalizable gauge theory. This
theory is valid to arbitrarily high energy scales and do not require an
ultraviolet completion. In these notes I cover three aspects to help understand
LHC results in the Higgs sector and in searches for physics beyond the Standard
Model: many facets of Higgs physics, QCD as it is relevant for LHC
measurements, and standard phenomenological background knowledge. The lectures
should put young graduate students into a position to really follow advanced
writeups and first research papers. In that sense they can serve as a starting
point for a research project in LHC physics. With this new, significantly
expanded version I am confident that also some more senior colleagues will find
them useful and interesting.
