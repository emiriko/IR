We present a formulation of domain wall fermions in the Schroedinger
functional by following the universality argument given by L\"uscher. To check
whether the formulation works, we examine the lowest eigenmode of the free
domain wall fermion operator. We confirm that the theory belongs to a correct
universality class and that the eigenvector is localized near the boundaries of
the fifth dimension. We also investigate the chiral symmetry breaking structure
of the four dimentional effective operator. We observe that the bulk chiral
symmetry breaking disappears for a large fifth dimensional size, while the
breaking originated by the boundary effects persists and exponetially decays
away from the time boundaries.
