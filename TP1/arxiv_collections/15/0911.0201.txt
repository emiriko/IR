We consider one-round games between a classical verifier and two provers. One
of the main questions in this area is the \emph{parallel repetition question}:
If the game is played $\ell$ times in parallel, does the maximum winning
probability decay exponentially in $\ell$? In the classical setting, this
question was answered in the affirmative by Raz. More recently the question
arose whether the decay is of the form $(1-\Theta(\eps))^\ell$ where $1-\eps$
is the value of the game and $\ell$ is the number of repetitions. This question
is known as the \emph{strong parallel repetition question} and was motivated by
its connections to the unique games conjecture. It was resolved by Raz who
showed that strong parallel repetition does \emph{not} hold, even in the very
special case of games known as XOR games.
  This opens the question whether strong parallel repetition holds in the case
when the provers share entanglement. Evidence for this is provided by the
behavior of XOR games, which have strong (in fact \emph{perfect}) parallel
repetition, and by the recently proved strong parallel repetition of linear
unique games. A similar question was open for games with so-called
non-signaling provers. Here the best known parallel repetition theorem is due
to Holenstein, and is of the form $(1-\Theta(\eps^2))^\ell$.
  We show that strong parallel repetition holds neither with entangled provers
nor with non-signaling provers. In particular we obtain that Holenstein's bound
is tight. Along the way we also provide a tight characterization of the
asymptotic behavior of the entangled value under parallel repetition of unique
games in terms of a semidefinite program.
