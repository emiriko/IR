We present Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements of 15 massive X-ray selected
galaxy clusters obtained with the South Pole Telescope. The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(SZ) cluster signals are measured at 150 GHz, and concurrent 220 GHz data are
used to reduce astrophysical contamination. Radial profiles are computed using
a technique that takes into account the effects of the beams and filtering. In
several clusters, significant SZ decrements are detected out to a substantial
fraction of the virial radius. The profiles are fit to the beta model and to a
generalized NFW pressure profile, and are scaled and stacked to probe their
average behavior. We find model parameters that are consistent with previous
studies: beta=0.86 and r_core/r_500 = 0.20 for the beta model, and (alpha,
beta, gamma, c_500)=(1.0,5.5,0.5,1.0) for the generalized NFW model. Both
models fit the SPT data comparably well, and both are consistent with the
average SZ profile out to the virial radius. The integrated Compton-y parameter
Y_SZ is computed for each cluster using both model-dependent and
model-independent techniques, and the results are compared to X-ray estimates
of cluster parameters. We find that Y_SZ scales with Y_X and gas mass with low
scatter. Since these observables have been found to scale with total mass, our
results point to a tight mass-observable relation for the SPT cluster survey.
