Ferromagnetic proximity effect is studied in InAs nanowire (NW) based quantum
dots (QD) strongly coupled to a ferromagnetic (F) and a superconducting (S)
lead. The influence of the F lead is detected through the splitting of the
spin-1/2 Kondo resonance. We show that the F lead induces a local exchange
field on the QD, which has varying amplitude and a sign depending on the charge
states. The interplay of the F and S correlations generates an exchange field
related supgap feature. This novel mini-gap allows now the visualization of the
exchange field also in even charge states
