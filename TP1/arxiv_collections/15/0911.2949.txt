We investigate the spectral evolution of white dwarfs by considering the
effects of hydrogen mass in the atmosphere and convective overshooting above
the convection zone. We notice the importance of the convective overshooting
and suggest that the overshooting length should be proportional to the
thickness of the convection zone to better fit the observations.
