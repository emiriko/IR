Whistler waves are present in solar wind plasma. These waves possess
characteristic turbulent fluctuations that are characterized typically by the
frequency and length scales that are respectively bigger than ion gyro
frequency and smaller than ion gyro radius. The electron inertial length is an
intrinsic length scale in whistler wave turbulence that distinguishably divides
the high frequency solar wind turbulent spectra into scales smaller and bigger
than the electron inertial length. We present nonlinear three dimensional, time
dependent, fluid simulations of whistler wave turbulence to investigate their
role in solar wind plasma. Our simulations find that the dispersive whistler
modes evolve entirely differently in the two regimes. While the dispersive
whistler wave effects are stronger in the large scale regime, they do not
influence the spectral cascades which are describable by a Kolmogorov-like
$k^{-7/3}$ spectrum. By contrast, the small scale turbulent fluctuations
exhibit a Navier-Stokes like evolution where characteristic turbulent eddies
exhibit a typical $k^{-5/3}$ hydrodynamic turbulent spectrum. By virtue of
equipartition between the wave velocity and magnetic fields, we quantify the
role of whistler waves in the solar wind plasma fluctuations.
