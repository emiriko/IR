Many image watermarking schemes have been proposed in recent years, but they
usually involve embedding a watermark to the entire image without considering
only a particular object in the image, which the image owner may be interested
in. This paper proposes a watermarking scheme that can embed a watermark to an
arbitrarily shaped object in an image. Before embedding, the image owner
specifies an object of arbitrary shape that is of a concern to him. Then the
object is transformed into the wavelet domain using in place lifting shape
adaptive DWT(SADWT) and a watermark is embedded by modifying the wavelet
coefficients. In order to make the watermark robust and transparent, the
watermark is embedded in the average of wavelet blocks using the visual model
based on the human visual system. Wavelet coefficients n least significant bits
(LSBs) are adjusted in concert with the average. Simulation results shows that
the proposed watermarking scheme is perceptually invisible and robust against
many attacks such as lossy compression (e.g.JPEG, JPEG2000), scaling, adding
noise, filtering, etc.
