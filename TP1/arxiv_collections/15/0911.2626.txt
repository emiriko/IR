The behavior of a massive scalar particle on the spacetime surrounding a
monopole is studied from a quantum mechanical point of view. All the boundary
conditions necessary to turn into self-adjoint the spatial portion of the wave
operator are found and their importance to the quantum interpretation of
singularities is emphasized.
