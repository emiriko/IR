In this paper, a linear system of equations with crisp coefficients and fuzzy
right-hand sides is investigated. All possible cases pertaining to the number
of variables, n, and the number of equations, m, are dealt with. A solution is
sought not as a fuzzy vector, as usual, but as a fuzzy set of vectors. Each
vector in the solution set solves the given fuzzy linear system with a certain
possibility. Assuming that the coefficient matrix is a full rank matrix, three
cases are considered: For m = n (square system), the solution set is shown to
be a parallelepiped in coordinate space and is expressed by an explicit
formula. For m > n (overdetermined system), the solution set is proved to be a
convex polyhedron and a novel geometric method is proposed to compute it. For m
< n (underdetermined system), by determining the contribution of free
variables, general solution is computed. From the results of three cases
mentioned above, a method is proposed to handle the general case, in which the
coefficient matrix is not necessarily a full rank matrix. Comprehensive
examples are provided and investigated in depth to illustrate each case and
suggested method.
