We study the transport properties of classical particles in the ballistic
regime trapped in a two-dimensional channel with dephased ripple boundaries. By
taking into account small ripple amplitudes an analytical approximate
expression for the classical resistivity is obtained. We show that the
resistivity can be increased considerably by dephasing the walls of the
channel. Our results are compared with those obtained for a channel composed of
a flat and a sinusoidal boundaries.
