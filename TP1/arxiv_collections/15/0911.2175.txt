We compute the O(alpha_s) corrections to the Wilson coefficients of the
dimension five operators emerging from the Operator Product Expansion of
inclusive radiative B decays. We discuss the impact of the resulting O(alpha_s
Lambda_QCD^2/m_b^2) corrections on the extraction of m_b and mu_pi^2 from the
moments of the photon spectrum.
