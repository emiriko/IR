We analyse the hadronization structure of both vector and axial-vector
currents leading to tau -> KKpi nu_tau decays. At leading order in the 1/Nc
expansion, and considering only the contribution of the lightest resonances, we
work out, within the framework of the resonance chiral Lagrangian, the
structure of the local vertices involved in those processes. The couplings in
the resonance theory are constrained by imposing the asymptotic behaviour of
vector and axial-vector spectral functions ruled by QCD. In this way we predict
the hadron spectra and conclude that, contrarily to previous assertions, the
vector contribution dominates by far over the axial-vector one in all KKpi
charge channels.
