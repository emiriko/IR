At Large Hadron Collider energy, the expected large multiplicities suggests
the presence of collective behavior even in pp collisions. A hydrodynamical
approach has been applied to estimate the expected elliptic flow measured by
the azimuthal asymmetry parameter $v_2$, in pp collisions at $\surd$s = 14 TeV.
$v_2$ of $\pi^-$ is found to be strongly dependent on the parton density
profile inside a proton [e.g., surface diffuseness parameter ($\xi$)]. For
$\xi$ = 0.105, $v_2$ is found to be positive while at $\xi$ = 0.25, $v_2$ is
close to zero and approaches negative values at large $p_t$. The impact
parameter dependence of $v_2$ has also been studied.
