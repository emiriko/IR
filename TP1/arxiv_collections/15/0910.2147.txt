We study the semidirect product of a Lie algebra with a representation up to
homotopy and provide various examples coming from Courant algebroids, string
Lie 2-algebras, and omni-Lie algebroids. In the end, we study the semidirect
product of a Lie group with a representation up to homotopy and use it to give
an integration of a certain string Lie 2-algebra.
