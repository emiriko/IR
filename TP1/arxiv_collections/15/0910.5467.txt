We review recent developments in models of fermion masses and mixing for both
quark and lepton sectors. Emphases are given to models based on finite group
family symmetries. In particular, we describe one recent model based on SU(5)
combined with a family symmetry based on the double tetrahedral group, T'. In
this model, a near tri-bimaximal MNS matrix and a realistic CKM matrix are
simultaneously generated; the MNS matrix gets slightly modified by virtue of
having the Georgi-Jarlskog relations. Due to the presence of complex
Clebsch-Gordon coefficients in T', CP violation in this model is entirely
geometrical in origin.
