We consider density matrices which are sums of projectors on states spanning
irreducible representations of the permutation group of L sites (eigenstates of
permutational invariant quantum system with L sites) and construct the reduced
density matrix (RDM) for blocks of size n<L by tracing out L-n sites, viewed as
environment. Explicit analytic expressions of the elements of the RDM are given
in the natural basis and the corresponding spectrum is derived. Results apply
to all quantum many-body systems with permutational symmetry for which the mean
field theory is exact.
