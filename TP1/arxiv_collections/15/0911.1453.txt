The vacuum of Yang-Mills theories can be imagined as a magnetically
disordered medium with domain structure, with color magnetic flux in each
domain quantized in units corresponding to the gauge group center. This model
leads to the prediction of Casimir scaling, i.e. the proportionality of string
tensions of potentials (at intermediate distances) between color sources from
higher-representations to eigenvalues of the quadratic Casimir operator. I
present evidence for Casimir scaling in G(2) lattice gauge theory. I also
discuss support for some ingredients of the model from the recently conjectured
form of the Yang-Mills ground-state wave-functional.
