We present non-standard optical Ramsey schemes that use pulses individually
tailored in duration, phase, and frequency to cancel spurious frequency shifts
related to the excitation itself. In particular, the field shifts and their
uncertainties of Ramsey fringes can be radically suppressed (by 2-4 orders of
magnitude) in comparison with the usual Ramsey method (using two equal pulses)
as well as with single-pulse Rabi spectroscopy. Atom interferometers and
optical clocks based on two-photon transitions, heavily forbidden transitions,
or magnetically induced spectroscopy could significantly benefit from this
method. In the latter case these frequency shifts can be suppressed
considerably below a fractional level of 10^{-17}. Moreover, our approach opens
the door for the high-precision optical clocks based on direct frequency comb
spectroscopy.
