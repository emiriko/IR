We discuss the existence of a dividing shell separating expanding and
collapsing regions in spherically symmetric solutions with pressure. We obtain
gauge invariant conditions relating not only the intrinsic spatial curvature of
the shells to the ADM mass, but also a function of the pressure which we
introduce that generalises the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equilibrium
condition, in the framework of a 3+1 spacetime splitting. We consider the
particular case of a Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi dust models with a cosmological
constant (a $\Lambda$-CDM model) as an example of our results.
