We prove optimal dispersive estimates at high frequency for the Schrodinger
group with real-valued potentials $V(x)=O(|x|^{-\delta})$, $\delta>n-1$, and
$V\in C^k({\bf R}^n$, $k>k_n$, where $n\ge 4$ and $(n-3)/2\le k_n<n/2$. We also
give a sufficient condition in terms of $L^1\to L^\infty$ bounds for the formal
iterations of Duhamel's formula, which might be satisfied for potentials of
less regularity.
