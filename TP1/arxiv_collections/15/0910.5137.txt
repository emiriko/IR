We address several different Casimir experiments where theory and experiment
disagree. First out is the classical Casimir force measurement between two
metal half spaces; here both in the form of the torsion pendulum experiment by
Lamoreaux and in the form of the Casimir pressure measurement between a gold
sphere and a gold plate as performed by Decca et al.; theory predicts a large
negative thermal correction, absent in the high precision experiments. The
third experiment is the measurement of the Casimir force between a metal plate
and a laser irradiated semiconductor membrane as performed by Chen et al.; the
change in force with laser intensity is larger than predicted by theory. The
fourth experiment is the measurement of the Casimir force between an atom and a
wall in the form of the measurement by Obrecht et al. of the change in
oscillation frequency of a 87 Rb Bose-Einstein condensate trapped to a fused
silica wall; the change is smaller than predicted by theory. We show that
saturation effects can explain the discrepancies between theory and experiment
observed in all these cases.
