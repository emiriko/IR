New UBV-photometry obtained in 2000-2008 is presented for the post-AGB star
IRAS 22272+5435=V354 Lac. The star showed semi-regular light variations with
varying amplitudes. The maximal amplitude did not exceed 0.5 in V-band. For
2000-2008, we have found a photometric period near 128 days. The analysis of
long-term observations in 1990-2008 reveals variations with two close periods:
128 and 131 days, causing amplitude modulation. The V-(B-V) diagram shows a
clear correlation: the star is generally bluer when brighter. From our UBV
data, we derive E(B-V)=0.5 and conclude that the spectral type of the star
varies between K1 to K7 during pulsations. The mean UBV-data of V354 Lac have
not changed during the past 19 years: V=8.60, B-V=2.06 and U-B=2.14.
