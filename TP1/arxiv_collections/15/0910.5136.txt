The E. coli glucose-galactose chemosensory receptor is a 309 residue, 32 kDa
protein consisting of two distinct structural domains. In this computational
study, we studied the protein's thermal fluctuations, including both the large
scale interdomain movements that contribute to the receptor's mechanism of
action, as well as smaller scale motions, using two different computational
methods. We employ extremely fast, "semi-atomistic" Library-Based Monte Carlo
(LBMC) simulations, which include all backbone atoms but "implicit" side
chains. Our results were compared with previous experiments and an all-atom
Langevin dynamics simulation. Both LBMC and Langevin dynamics simulations were
performed using both the apo and glucose-bound form of the protein, with LBMC
exhibiting significantly larger fluctuations. The LBMC simulations are also in
general agreement with the disulfide trapping experiments of Careaga & Falke
(JMB, 1992; Biophys. J., 1992), which indicate that distant residues in the
crystal structure (i.e. beta carbons separated by 10 to 20 angstroms) form
spontaneous transient contacts in solution. Our simulations illustrate several
possible "mechanisms" (configurational pathways) for these fluctuations. We
also observe several discrepancies between our calculations and experiment.
Nevertheless, we believe that our semi-atomistic approach could be used to
study the fluctuations in other proteins, perhaps for ensemble docking, or
other analyses of protein flexibility in virtual screening studies.
