An analytic Bethe ansatz is carried out related to the type 1 Lie
superalgebra C(s). We present eigenvalue formulae of transfer matrices in
dressed vacuum form (DVF) labeled by Young superdiagrams with one row or one
column. We also propose an DVF related to a one parameter family of finite
dimensional irreducible representations. A class of transfer matrix functional
relations among these formulae is discussed.
