Combined positron and visible light irradiations in the photodynamical
therapy (PDT) applications are analyzed. Objectives and goals of PDT are
killing or irreversible oxidative damage of pathogenic cells, or rather their
cell walls, cell membranes, peptides, and nucleic acids by photo-activated
oxygen of photosentizer injected into the target cell during light irradiation.
In this paper, the arguments for involving of lifetime positron annihilation
spectroscopy to control of photodamaging cells in the course of the PDT
procedure are given on the examples of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria
basing on a brief survey of the literature.
