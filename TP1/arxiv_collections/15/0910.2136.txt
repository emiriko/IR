The D0 and CDF collaborations recently published two independent analyses
that both claim to represent the observation of the Omega_b particle, a baryon
made up by a (bss) quark combination. Both signals are estimated to exceed the
statistical significance of five standard deviations; however, the mass
measurements derived from the candidates differ by over six standard
deviations, accounting for estimated systematics. Measured rates also appear to
differ, although they remain compatible within the large uncertainties.
  In this paper the author recomputes the significance of the D0 result,
showing that it was considerably overestimated in the original publication; he
then investigates with a pseudoexperiment-based approach which, among different
hypotheses, appears the most likely cause of the observed discrepancy between
the D0 and CDF signals.
