For any finite dimensional basic associative algebra, we study the
presentation spaces and their relation with the representation spaces. We prove
two propositions about a general presentation, one on its subrepresentations
and the other on its canonical decomposition. As a special case, we consider
rigid presentations. We show how to complete a rigid presentation and study the
number of nonisomorphic direct summands and different complements. Based on
that, we construct a simplicial complex governing the canonical decompositions
of rigid presentations and provide some examples.
