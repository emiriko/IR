In this note we give a simple proof of the classical fact that the hexagonal
lattice gives the highest density circle packing among all lattices in $R^2$.
With the benefit of hindsight, we show that the problem can be restricted to
the important class of well-rounded lattices, on which the density function
takes a particularly simple form. Our proof emphasizes the role of well-rounded
lattices for discrete optimization problems.
