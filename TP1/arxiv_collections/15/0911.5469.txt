Experiments on the direction-resolved full-counting statistics of
single-electron tunneling allow testing the fundamentally important Fluctuation
Theorem (FT). At the same time, the FT provides a frame for analyzing such
data. Here we consider tunneling through a double quantum dot system which is
coupled capacitively to a quantum point contact (QPC) detector. Fluctuations of
the environment, including the shot noise of the QPC, lead to an enhancement of
the effective temperature in the FT. We provide a quantitative explanation of
this effect; in addition we discuss the influence of the finite detector
bandwidth on the measurements.
