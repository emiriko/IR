Faraday waves are generated at the air/liquid interface inside an array of
square cells. As the free surface inside each cell is destabilizing due to the
oscillations, the shape of the free surface is drastically changing. Depending
on the value of the frequency f of oscillations, different patterns are
observed inside each cell. For well defined f values, neighboring cells are
observed to interact and a general organization is noticed. In such a
situation, initially disordered structures lead to a general pattern covering
the entire liquid pool and a spatial order appears all over the cell array.
