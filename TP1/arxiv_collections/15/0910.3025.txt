We evaluate gauge invariants, action and gauge invariant overlap, for
numerical solutions which satisfy the "a-gauge" condition with various values
of $a$ in cubic open bosonic string field theory. We use the level truncation
approximation and an iterative procedure to construct numerical solutions in
the twist even universal space. The resulting gauge invariants are numerically
stable and almost equal to those of Schnabl's solution for tachyon
condensation. Our result provides further evidence that these numerical and
analytical solutions are gauge equivalent.
