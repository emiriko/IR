The nucleus-nucleus potential and energy dissipation in fusion reactions are
obtained from microscopic mean-field dynamics. The deduced potentials nicely
reproduce the one extracted from experimental data. Energy dissipation shows a
universal behaviour between different reactions. Also, the dispersion of mass
distribution in transfer reaction is investigated in a stochastic mean-field
dynamics. By including initial fluctuations in collective space, the
description of the dispersion is much improved compared to that of mean field
only. The result is consistent with the macroscopic phenomenological analysis
of the experimental data.
