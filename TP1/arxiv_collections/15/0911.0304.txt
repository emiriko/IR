We present an electron holography experiment enabling the local and
quantitative study of magnetic properties in magnetic tunnel junction. The
junction was fully characterized during the switching process and each possible
magnetic configuration was highlighted with magnetic induction maps. No
magnetic coupling was found between the two layers. We plot a local hysteresis
loop that was compared with magnetometry measurement at the macroscopic scale
confirming the validity of the local method.
