The growing rate of increase in the number of the discovered extra-solar
planets which has consequently raised the enthusiasm to explore the universe in
hope of finding earth-like planets has resulted in the wide use of
Gravitational Microlensing as a planet detection method. However, until
November 2009, only 9 out of the overall 405 discovered exoplanets have been
detected through Microlensing, a fact which shows that this method is
relatively new in the detection of extra-solar planets. Therefore, preparing a
map of the sky which pinpoints the regions with higher probability of planet
detection by this method and is drawn based on the available equipments and
other regional factors would, indeed, help speed up the discovery of
exoplanets. This paper provides calculations and reasoning to suggest looking
toward two distinct regions in constellations Centaurus and Sagittarius in
addition to the customary Galactic Bulge in the search for other habitable
worlds.
