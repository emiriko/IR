This paper introduces a space-continuous force-based model for simulating
pedestrian dynamics. The main interest of this work is the quantitative
description of pedestrian movement through a bottleneck. Measurements of flow
and density will be presented and compared with empirical data. The results of
the proposed model show a good agreement with empirical data. Furthermore, we
emphasize the importance of volume exclusion in force-based models.
