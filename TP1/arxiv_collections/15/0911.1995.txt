We show that an enslaved phase-separation front moving with diffusive speeds
U = C T^(-1/2) can leave alternating domains of increasing size in their wake.
We find the size and spacing of these domains is identical to Liesegang
patterns. For equal composition of the components we are able to predict the
exact form of the pattern analytically. We also show that there is a critical
value for C below which only two domains are formed. Our analytical predictions
are verified by numerical simulations using a lattice Boltzmann method.
