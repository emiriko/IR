A gravitational lens system can be perturbed by "rogue systems" in angular
proximities but at different distances. A point mass perturbed by another point
mass can be considered as a large separation approximation of the double
scattering two point mass (DSTP) lens. The resulting effective lens depends on
whether the perturber is closer to or farther from the observer than the main
lens system. The caustic is smaller than that of the large separation binary
lens when the perturber is the first scatterer; the caustic is similar in size
with the large separation binary lens when the perturber is the last scatterer.
Modelling of a gravitational lensing by a galaxy requires extra terms other
than constant shear for the perturbers at different redshifts. Double
scattering two distributed mass (DSTD) lens is considered. The perturbing
galaxy behaves as a monopole -- or a point mass -- because the dipole moment of
the elliptic mass distribution is zero.
