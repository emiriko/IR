It is shown that for a constituent quark in the intra-nucleon self-consistent
field the spin-orbit interaction lowers the quark rest energy to values
$\sim100$ MeV, which agrees with the DIS momentum sum rule. The possibility of
violation of the spectral condition for the light-cone momentum component of a
bound quark is discussed.
