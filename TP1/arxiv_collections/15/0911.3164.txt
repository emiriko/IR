We find spherically symmetric solutions in the modified Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz
gravity proposed recently by Blas, Pujolas and Sibiryakov. The non-linear
equations of the two derivative action turn out to be similar to those stemming
from the four-derivative action explored recently. We analyze the solutions and
derive constraints on the relevant new coupling constant. We also analyze the
case where the cosmological constant is non-zero.
  We derive the large distance expansion of solutions and show that the power
of the standard Newton's law is modified in the presence of a cosmological
constant.
