Magnetization and its relaxation have been measured in
$Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_x)_2As_2$ single crystals at various doping levels ranging
fromvery underdoped to very overdoped regimes. Sizable magnetization relaxation
rate has been observed in all samples, indicating a moderate vortex motion and
relatively small characteristic pinning energy. Detailed analysis leads to the
following conclusions: (1) A prominent second-peak (SP) effect was observed in
the samples around the optimal doping level (x $\approx$ 0.08), but it becomes
invisible or very weak in the very underdoped and overdoped samples; (2) The
magnetization relaxation rate is inversely related to the transient
superconducting current density revealing the non-monotonic field and
temperature dependence through the SP region; (3) A very sharp magnetization
peak was observed near zero field which corresponds to a much reduced
relaxation rate; (4) A weak temperature dependence of relaxation rate or a
plateau was found in the intermediate temperature region. Together with the
treatment of the Generalized-Inversion-Scheme, we suggest that the vortex
dynamics is describable by the collective pinning model. Finally, vortex phase
diagrams were drawn for all the samples showing a systematic evolution of
vortex dynamics.
