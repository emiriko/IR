We analyse diffractive electroweak vector boson production in hadronic
collisions and show that the single diffractive W boson production asymmetry in
rapidity is a particularly good observable at the LHC to test the concept of
the flavour symmetric pomeron parton distributions. It may also provide an
additional constraint for the parton distribution functions in the proton.
