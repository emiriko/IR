Despite the widespread presence of magnetic fields, their origin, evolution
and role are still not well understood. Primordial magnetism sounds appealing
but is not problem free. The magnetic implications for the large-scale
structure of the universe still remain an open issue. This paper outlines the
advantages and shortcomings of early-time magnetogenesis and the typical role
of B-fields in linear structure-formation scenarios.
