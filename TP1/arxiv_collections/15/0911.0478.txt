The magneto-conductance of an InAs nanowire is investigated with respect to
the relative orientation between external magnetic field and the nanowire axis.
It is found that both the perpendicular and the parallel magnetic fields induce
a positive magneto-conductance. Yet the parallel magnetic field induced
longitudinal magneto-conductance has a smaller magnitude. This anisotropic
magneto-transport phenomenon is studied as a function of temperature, magnetic
field strength and at an arbitrary angle between the magnetic field and the
nanowire. We show that the observed effect is in quantitative agreement with
the suppression of one-dimensional (1D) weak localization.
