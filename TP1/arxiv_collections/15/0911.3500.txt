CAKE (Cosmic Abundances below Knee Energies) was a prototype balloon
experiment for the determination of the charge spectra and of abundances of the
primary cosmic-rays (CR) with Z$>$10. It was a passive instrument made of
layers of CR39 and Lexan nuclear track detectors; it had a geometric acceptance
of $\sim$0.7 m$^2$sr for Fe nuclei. Here, the scanning and analysis strategies,
the algorithms used for the off-line filtering and for the tracking in
automated mode of the primary cosmic rays are presented, together with the
resulting CR charge distribution and their abundances.
