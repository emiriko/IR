We calculate the complete one-loop quantum corrections to the helicity
eigenstate chargino pair production cross sections in polarized electron
positron collisions, within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We
calculate the non-QED corrections using the helicity amplitudes formalism, and
Dimensional Regularization to deal with ultraviolet divergences. We calculate
QED corrections using the dipole subtraction formalism to extract soft and
collinear divergences in Bremsstrahlung, canceling them with the infrared
divergences from virtual QED corrections. We show numerical results for the
Focus Point scenario in mSUGRA, where we find important quantum corrections for
differential cross sections with definite chargino helicities.
