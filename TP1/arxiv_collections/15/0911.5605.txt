We propose a new protocol for quantum anonymous voting having serious
advantages over the existing protocols: it protects both the voters from a
curious tallyman and all the participants from a dishonest voter in
unconditional way. The central idea of the protocol is that the ballots are
given back to the voters after the voting process, which gives a possibility
for two voters to check the anonymity of the vote counting process by preparing
a special entangled state of two ballots. Any attempt of cheating from the side
of the tallyman results in destroying the entanglement, which can be detected
by the voters.
