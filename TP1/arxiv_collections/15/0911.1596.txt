Similar in spirit to the preceding work [Opt. Commun. 282 (2009) 3734] where
the relation between optical Fresnel transformation and quantum tomography is
revealed, we study this kind of relationship in the two-mode entangled case. We
show that under the two-mode Fresnel transformation the bipartite entangled
state density |eta><eta| becomes density operator F_2|eta><eta|F_2
^{dag}=|eta>_{r,s}<eta|, which is just the Radon transform of the two-mode
Wigner operator (sigma,gama) in entangled form, where F_2 is an two-mode
Fresnel operator in quantum optics, and s,r are the complex-value expression of
(A, B, C,D). So the probability distribution for the Fresnel quadrature phase
is the {tomography (Radon transform of the two-mode Wigner function),
correspondingly, {s,r}_<eta|phi>=<eta|F_2{dag}|phi>. Similarly, we find a
simial conclusion in the `frequency` domain.
