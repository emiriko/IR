It is shown here that there is no way for particle creation to occur by
quantum tunneling through an infinitesimal neighborhood of the black hole
horizon. This result is a trivial consequence of the regularity of the horizon,
the equivalence principle and the general covariance of the relativistic theory
of gravity. Moreover, we also confirm the less trivial statement that no
particle creation by quantum tunneling through the black hole horizon is
possible independent of the size of the presupposed tunneling domain.
