We consider the concept of mutual information in ecological networks, and use
this idea to analyse the Tangled Nature model of co-evolution. We show that
this measure of correlation has two distinct behaviours depending on how we
define the network in question: if we consider only the network of viable
species this measure increases, whereas for the whole system it decreases. It
is suggested that these are complimentary behaviours that show how ecosystems
can become both more stable and better adapted.
