Reliable atomic data have been computed for the spectral modeling of the
nitrogen K lines, which may lead to useful astrophysical diagnostics. Data sets
comprise valence and K-vacancy level energies, wavelengths, Einstein
$A$-coefficients, radiative and Auger widths and K-edge photoionization cross
sections. An important issue is the lack of measurements which are usually
employed to fine-tune calculations so as to attain spectroscopic accuracy. In
order to estimate data quality, several atomic structure codes are used and
extensive comparisons with previous theoretical data have been carried out. In
the calculation of K photoabsorption with the Breit--Pauli $R$-matrix method,
both radiation and Auger damping, which cause the smearing of the K edge, are
taken into account. This work is part of a wider project to compute atomic data
in the X-ray regime to be included in the database of the popular {\sc xstar}
modeling code.
