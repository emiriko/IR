We report measurements of structural phase transition of four parent
compounds $R$FeAsO ($R$ = La, Sm, Gd, and Tb) by means of low-temperature X-ray
diffraction (XRD). Magnetic transition temperatures associated with Fe ions
($T_{N1}$) are also determined from the temperature dependence of resistivity.
As $R$ is changed from La, through Sm and Gd, to Tb, both the c-axis and a-axis
lattice constants decrease significantly. Meanwhile both the structural phase
transition temperature ($T_S$) and $T_{N1}$ decrease monotonously. It is also
found that the temperature gap between $T_S$ and $T_{N1}$ becomes smaller when
the distance between FeAs layer becomes shorter. This result is consistent with
magnetically driven structural phase transition and suggests that the
dimensionality have an important effect on the AFM ordering.
