In the context of special relativity, we discuss the specific impulse of a
rocket whose exhaust jet consists of massive and/or massless particles. This
work generalizes previous results and corrects some errors of a recently
published paper by U. Walter. (The errors stem from the omission of a Lorentz
factor.)
