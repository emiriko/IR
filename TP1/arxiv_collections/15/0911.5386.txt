From the point of view of the Young superdiagrm method, an analytic Bethe
ansatz is carried out for Lie superalgebra sl(r+1|s+1). For the transfer matrix
eigenvalue formulae in dressed vacuum form, we present some expressions, which
are quantum analogue of Jacobi-Trudi and Giambelli formulae for Lie
superalgebra sl(r+1|s+1). We also propose transfer matrix functional relations,
which are Hirota bilinear difference equation with some constraints.
