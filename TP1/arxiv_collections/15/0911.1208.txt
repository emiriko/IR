Gowdy waves, one of the standard 'apples with apples' tests, is proposed as a
test-bed for constraint-preserving boundary conditions in the non-linear
regime. As an illustration, energy-constraint preservation is separately tested
in the Z4 framework. Both algebraic conditions, derived from energy estimates,
and derivative conditions, deduced from the constraint-propagation system, are
considered. The numerical errors at the boundary are of the same order than
those at the interior points.
