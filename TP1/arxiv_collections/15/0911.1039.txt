The study of flavor changing neutrinos is a very active field of research. I
will discuss the status of ongoing and near term experiments investigating
neutrino properties at short distances from the source. In the next few years,
the Double Chooz, RENO and Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiments will start
looking for signatures of a non-zero value of the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$
with much improved sensitivities. The MiniBooNE experiment is investigating the
LSND anomaly by looking at both the $\nu_{\mu} \to \nu_{e}$ and
$\bar{\nu}_{\mu} \to \bar{\nu}_{e}$ appearance channels. Recent results on
cross section measurements will be discussed briefly.
