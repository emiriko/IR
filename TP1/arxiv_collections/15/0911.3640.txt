The R-Parity symmetry Violating (RPV) version of the Next-to-Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) is attractive simultaneously with regard
to the so-called mu-problem and the accommodation of three-flavor neutrino data
at tree level. In this context, we show here that if the Lightest
Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) is the gravitino, it possesses a lifetime larger
than the age of the universe since its RPV induced decay channels are
suppressed by the weak gravitational strength. This conclusion holds if one
considers gravitino masses ~ 10^2 GeV like in supergravity scenarios, and is
robust if the lightest pseudoscalar Higgs field is as light as ~ 10 GeV [as may
occur in the NMSSM]. For these models predicting in particular an RPV
neutrino-photino mixing, the gravitino lifetime exceeds the age of the universe
by two orders of magnitude. However, we find that the gravitino cannot
constitute a viable dark matter candidate since its too large RPV decay widths
would then conflict with the flux data of last indirect detection experiments.
The cases of a sneutrino LSP or a neutralino LSP as well as the more promising
gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking scenario are also discussed. Both the
one-flavor simplification hypothesis and the realistic scenario of three
neutrino flavors are analyzed. We have modified the NMHDECAY program to extend
the neutralino mass matrix to the present framework.
