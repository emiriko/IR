A gapped quantum system that is adiabatically perturbed remains approximately
in its eigenstate after the evolution. We prove that, for constant gap, general
quantum processes that approximately prepare the final eigenstate require a
minimum time proportional to the ratio of the length of the eigenstate path to
the gap. Thus, no rigorous adiabatic condition can yield a smaller cost. We
also give a necessary condition for the adiabatic approximation that depends on
local properties of the path, which is appropriate when the gap varies.
