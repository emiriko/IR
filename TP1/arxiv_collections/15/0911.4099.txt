We present a simulation algorithm for Wilson fermions based on the exact
hopping expansion of the fermion action. The algorithm essentially eliminates
critical slowing down by sampling the fermionic two-point correlation function
and it allows simulations directly in the massless limit. As illustrative
examples, the algorithm is applied to the Gross-Neveu and the Schwinger model,
the latter in the strong coupling limit.
