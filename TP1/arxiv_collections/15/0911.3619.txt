We compute two-photon exchange corrections to the electromagnetic form factor
of the pion, taking into account the finite size of the pion. Compared to the
soft-photon approximation for the infrared divergent contribution which
neglects hadron structure effects, the corrections are found to be < 1% for
small Q^2 (Q^2 < 0.1 GeV^2), but increase to several percent for Q^2 > 1 GeV^2
at extreme backward angles.
