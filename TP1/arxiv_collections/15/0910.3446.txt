We consider a supersymmetric (SUSY) scenario including right-handed
neutrinos, one of whose scalar superpartners is the lightest SUSY particle
(LSP). The distinguishing feature in the collider signal of SUSY in such a case
is not missing energy but a pair of charged tracks corresponding to the
next-to- lightest SUSY particle, when it is, as in the case considered, a stau.
Following up on our recent work on neutralino reconstruction in such cases, we
explore the possibility of reconstructing charginos, too, through a study of
transverse mass distributions in specified final states. The various steps of
isolating the transverse momenta of neutrinos relevant for this are outlined,
and regions of the parameter space where our procedure works are identified.
