We revisit confinement/deconfinement transition in holographic QCD to
consider the back-reaction of a bulk scalar field. The bulk scalar field is
dual to a quark bi-linear operator $\bar qq$, and it encodes explicit and
spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of QCD. To perform the Hawking-Page
transition analysis with the back-reaction, we first obtain a deformed AdS
black hole solution due to a finite quark mass. Through the Hawking-Page
analysis with the back-reacted geometry, we study the flavor number $N_f$ and
finite quark mass dependence of the critical temperature of the QCD
confinement/deconfinement transition. In addition, we confirm that unphysical
QCD phase haunting around in a previous study disappears with the
back-reaction. We discuss our results in the light of lattice QCD observations.
