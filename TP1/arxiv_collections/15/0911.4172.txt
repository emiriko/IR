Recently, a striking experimental demonstration [G. Kirchmair \emph{et al.},
Nature, \textbf{460}, 494(2009)] of the state-independent quantum mechanical
violation of non-contextual realist models has been reported for any two-qubit
state using suitable choices of \emph{nine} product observables and \emph{six}
different measurement setups. In this report, a considerable simplification of
such a demonstration is achieved by formulating a scheme that requires only
\emph{five} product observables and \emph{two} different measurement setups. It
is also pointed out that the relevant empirical data already available in the
experiment by Kirchmair \emph{et al.} corroborate the violation of the NCR
models in accordance with our proof.
