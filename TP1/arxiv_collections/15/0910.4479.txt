We propose a nonlocal theory of single-particle excitations. It is based on
an off-diagonal effective medium and the projection operator method for
treating the retarded Green function. The theory determines the nonlocal
effective medium matrix elements by requiring that they are consistent with
those of the self-energy of the Green function. This arrows for a description
of long-range intersite correlations with high resolution in momentum space.
Numerical study for the half-filled Hubbard model on the simple cubic lattice
demonstrates that the theory is applicable to the strong correlation regime as
well as the intermediate regime of Coulomb interaction strength. Furthermore
the results show that nonlocal excitations cause sub-bands in the strong
Coulomb interaction regime due to strong antiferromagnetic correlations,
decrease the quasi-particle peak on the Fermi level with increasing Coulomb
interaction, and shift the critical Coulomb interaction Uc2 for the divergence
of effective mass towards higher energies at least by a factor of two as
compared with that in the single-site approximation.
