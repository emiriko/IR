We study two different types of simplified models for Kelvin wave turbulence
on quantized vortex lines in superfluids near zero temperature. Our first model
is obtained from a truncated expansion of the Local Induction Approximation
(Truncated-LIA) and it is shown to possess the same scalings and the essential
behaviour as the full Biot-Savart model, being much simpler than the latter
and, therefore, more amenable to theoretical and numerical investigations. The
Truncated-LIA model supports six-wave interactions and dual cascades, which are
clearly demonstrated via the direct numerical simulation of this model in the
present paper. In particular, our simulations confirm presence of the weak
turbulence regime and the theoretically predicted spectra for the direct energy
cascade and the inverse wave action cascade. The second type of model we study,
the Differential Approximation Model (DAM), takes a further drastic
simplification by assuming locality of interactions in $k$-space via a
differential closure that preserves the main scalings of the Kelvin wave
dynamics. DAMs are even more amenable to study and they form a useful tool by
providing simple analytical solutions in the cases when extra physical effects
are present, e.g. forcing by reconnections, friction dissipation and phonon
radiation. We study these models numerically and test their theoretical
predictions, in particular the formation of the stationary spectra, and the
closeness of the numerics for the higher-order DAM to the analytical
predictions for the lower-order DAM .
