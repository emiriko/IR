We argue relations between the Aharonov invariants and Tamanoi's Schwarzian
derivatives of higher order and give a recursion formula for Tamanoi's
Schwarzians. Then we propose a definition of invariant Schwarzian derivatives
of a nonconstant holomorphic map between Riemann surfaces with conformal
metrics. We show a recursion fomula also for our invariant Schwarzians.
