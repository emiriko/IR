For models of non-interacting fermions moving within sites arranged on a
surface in three dimensional space, there can be obstructions to finding
localized Wannier functions. We show that such obstructions are $K$-theoretic
obstructions to approximating almost commuting, complex-valued matrices by
commuting matrices, and we demonstrate numerically the presence of this
obstruction for a lattice model of the quantum Hall effect in a spherical
geometry. The numerical calculation of the obstruction is straightforward, and
does not require translational invariance or introducing a flux torus.
  We further show that there is a $Z_2$ index obstruction to approximating
almost commuting self-dual matrices by exactly commuting self-dual matrices,
and present additional conjectures regarding the approximation of almost
commuting real and self-dual matrices by exactly commuting real and self-dual
matrices. The motivation for considering this problem is the case of physical
systems with additional antiunitary symmetries such as time reversal or
particle-hole conjugation.
  Finally, in the case of the sphere--mathematically speaking three almost
commuting Hermitians whose sum of square is near the identity--we give the
first quantitative result showing this index is the only obstruction to finding
commuting approximations. We review the known non-quantitative results for the
torus.
