We describe an ultra-sensitive atomic magnetometer using optically-pumped
potassium atoms operating in spin-exchange relaxation free (SERF) regime. We
demonstrate magnetic field sensitivity of 160 aT/Hz$^{1/2}$ in a gradiometer
arrangement with a measurement volume of 0.45 cm$^3$ and energy resolution per
unit time of $44 \hbar$. As an example of a new application enabled by such a
magnetometer we describe measurements of weak remnant rock magnetization as a
function of temperature with a sensitivity on the order of 10$^{-10}$
emu/cm$^3$/Hz$^{1/2}$ and temperatures up to 420$^\circ$C.
