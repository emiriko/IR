The $\alpha$-stable distributions introduced by L\'evy play an important role
in probabilistic theoretical studies and their various applications, e.g., in
statistical physics, life sciences, and economics. In the present paper we
study sequences of long-range dependent random variables whose distributions
have asymptotic power law decay, and which are called $(q,\alpha)$-stable
distributions. These sequences are generalizations of i.i.d. $\alpha$-stable
distributions, and have not been previously studied. Long-range dependent
$(q,\alpha)$-stable distributions might arise in the description of anomalous
processes in nonextensive statistical mechanics, cell biology, finance. The
parameter $q$ controls dependence. If $q=1$ then they are classical i.i.d. with
$\alpha$-stable L\'evy distributions. In the present paper we establish basic
properties of $(q,\alpha)$-stable distributions, and generalize the result of
Umarov, Tsallis and Steinberg (2008), where the particular case $\alpha=2, q\in
[1,3),$ was considered, to the whole range of stability and nonextensivity
parameters $\alpha \in (0,2]$ and $q \in [1,3),$ respectively. We also discuss
possible further extensions of the results that we obtain, and formulate some
conjectures.
