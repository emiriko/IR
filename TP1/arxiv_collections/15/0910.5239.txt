Active motion is a concept in complex systems theory and was successfully
applied to various problems in nonlinear dynamics. Explicit studies for
gravitational potentials were missing so far. We interpret the Friedmann
equations with cosmological constant as a dynamical system, which can be made
active in a straightforward way. These active Friedmann equations lead to a
cyclic universe, which is shown numerically.
