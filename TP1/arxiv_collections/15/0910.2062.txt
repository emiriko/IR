This is a paper published in 2001 based on a talk given in 1999 celebrating
the 50th anniversary of W. N. Bailey's influential q-series paper "Identities
of the Rogers-Ramanujan type". In no more than 13 pages I give a brief but
reasonably complete overview of the mathematics related to Bailey's lemma.
