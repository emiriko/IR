Let $X$ be a complex quasiprojective variety. A result of
Noguchi-Winkelmann-Yamanoi shows that if $X$ admits a Zariski dense entire
curve, then its quasi-Albanese map is a fiber space. We show that the orbifold
structure induced by a properly birationally equivalent map on the base is
special in this case. As a consequence, if $X$ is of log-general type with
$\bar q(X)\geq\dim X$, then any entire curve is contained in a proper
subvariety in $X$.
