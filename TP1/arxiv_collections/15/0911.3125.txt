The data describing a process of echo-image formation in bottlenose dolphin
sonar perception were accumulated in our experimental explorations. These data
were formalized mathematically and used in the computational model, comparative
testing of which in echo-discrimination tasks revealed no less capabilities
then those of bottlenose dolphins.
