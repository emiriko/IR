In this paper, we define the geometric median of a probability measure on a
Riemannian manifold, give its characterization and a natural condition to
ensure its uniqueness. In order to calculate the median in practical cases, we
also propose a subgradient algorithm and prove its convergence as well as
estimating the error of approximation and the rate of convergence. The
convergence property of this subgradient algorithm, which is a generalization
of the classical Weiszfeld algorithm in Euclidean spaces to the context of
Riemannian manifolds, also answers a recent question in P. T. Fletcher et al.
