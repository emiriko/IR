The sum of charm and beauty in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV measured through
nonphotonic electrons, show similar suppression at high pT as light hadrons, in
contrast to expectations based on the dead cone effect. To understand this
observation, it is important to separate the charm and beauty components.
Non-photonic electron-D0 and electron-hadron azimuthal angular correlations are
used to disentangle the contributions from charm and beauty decays. The beauty
contribution in p+p collisions at 200 GeV is found to be comparable to charm at
pT 5.5 GeV, indicating that beauty may contribute significantly to the non
photonic electrons from heavy flavour decays in Au+Au data at high pT.
Furthermore, in Au+Au collisions we present the status of D0 meson
reconstruction using microvertexing techniques made possible with the addition
of the silicon detectors.
