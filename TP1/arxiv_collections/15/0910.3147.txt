We investigate the properties of charmonia in a thermal medium, showing that
with increasing temperature the decay widths of these mesons behave in a
non-trivial way. Employing a potential model with interaction potential
extracted from thermal lattice QCD calculations of the free-energy of a static
quark-antiquark pair, we study some decay processes in the crossover region. We
find that at temperatures $T \sim T_c$ the decay widths of the $J/\Psi$ that
depend on the value of the wave function at the origin are enhanced with
respect to the values in vacuum. In the same temperature range the decay width
of the process $\chi_{cJ} \to J/\Psi + \gamma$ is enhanced by approximately a
factor 6 with respect to the value in vacuum. At higher temperatures the
charmonia states dissociate and the widths of both decay processes become
vanishing small.
