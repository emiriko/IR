In the paper we study closures of classes of log--concave measures under
taking weak limits, linear transformations and tensor products. We consider
what uniform measures on convex bodies can one obtain starting from some class
$\mathcal{K}$. In particular we prove that if one starts from one--dimensional
log--concave measures, one obtains no non--trivial uniform mesures on convex
bodies.
