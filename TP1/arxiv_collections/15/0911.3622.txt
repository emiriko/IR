We investigate the effects of new physics scenarios containing a high mass
vector resonance on top pair production at the LHC, using the polarization of
the produced top. In particular we use kinematic distributions of the secondary
lepton coming from top decay, which depends on top polarization, as it has been
shown that the angular distribution of the decay lepton is insensitive to the
anomalous tbW vertex and hence is a pure probe of new physics in top quark
production. Spin sensitive variables involving the decay lepton are used to
probe top polarization. Some sensitivity is found for the new couplings of the
top.
