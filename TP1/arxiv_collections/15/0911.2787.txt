We study the spectroscopy and dominant decays of the bottomonium-like
tetraquarks (bound diquarks-antidiquarks), focusing on the lowest lying P-wave
$[bq][\bar{b}\bar{q}]$ states $Y_{[bq]}$ (with $q=u,d$), having
$J^{PC}=1^{--}$. To search for them, we analyse the BABAR data \cite{:2008hx}
obtained during an energy scan of the $e ^+ e^- \to b \bar{b}$ cross section in
the range of $\sqrt{s}=10.54$ to 11.20 GeV. We find that these data are
consistent with the presence of an additional $b \bar{b}$ state $Y_{[bq]}$ with
a mass of 10.90 GeV and a width of about 30 MeV apart from the $\Upsilon (5S)$
and $\Upsilon(6S)$ resonances. A closeup of the energy region around the
$Y_{[bq]}$-mass may resolve this state in terms of the two mass eigenstates,
$Y_{[b,l]}$ and $Y_{[b,h]}$, with a mass difference, estimated as about 6 MeV.
We tentatively identify the state $Y_{[bq]}(10900)$ from the $R_b$-scan with
the state $Y_b(10890)$ observed by BELLE \cite{Abe:2007tk} in the process
$e^+e^- \to Y_b(10890) \to \Upsilon (1S, 2S) \pi^+ \pi^-$ due to their
proximity in masses and decay widths.
