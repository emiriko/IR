The MACHO Project generated two-colour photometric lightcurves for 73 million
stars in the LMC, SMC, and the Galactic bulge during its 8 years of observing.
This photometry, along with all images from the over 100 thousand observations
from which it was derived, and an associated catalogue of 21 thousand LMC
variable stars, is now available via web-services which comply with standards
defined by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA).
