Roughly, the Church-Turing thesis is a hypothesis that describes exactly what
can be computed by any real or feasible conceptual computing device. Generally
speaking, the computational metaphor is the idea that everything, including the
universe itself, has a computational nature. However, if the Church-Turing
thesis is not valid, then does it make sense to expect the construction of a
computer program capable of simulating the whole Universe? In the lights of
hypercomputation, the scientific discipline that is about computing beyond the
Church-Turing barrier, the most natural answer to this question is: No. This
note is a justification of this answer and its deeper meaning based on
arguments from physics, the philosophy of the mind, and, of course,
(hyper)computability theory.
