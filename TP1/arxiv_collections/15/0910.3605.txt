The SXI telescope is one of the three instruments on board EXIST, a
multiwavelength observatory in charge of performing a global survey of the sky
in hard X-rays searching for Supermassive Black Holes. One of the primary
objectives of EXIST is also to study with unprecedented sensitivity the most
unknown high energy sources in the Universe, like high redshift GRBs, which
will be pointed promptly by the Spacecraft by autonomous trigger based on hard
X-ray localization on board. The recent addition of a soft X-ray telescope to
the EXIST payload complement, with an effective area of ~950 cm2 in the energy
band 0.2-3 keV and extended response up to 10 keV will allow to make broadband
studies from 0.1 to 600 keV. In particular, investigations of the spectra
components and states of AGNs and monitoring of variability of sources, study
of the prompt and afterglow emission of GRBs since the early phases, which will
help to constrain the emission models and finally, help the identification of
sources in the EXIST hard X-ray survey and the characterization of the
transient events detected. SXI will also perform surveys: a scanning survey
with sky coverage of about 2pi and limiting flux of 5x10^{-14}cgs plus other
serendipitous. We give an overview of the SXI scientific performance and also
describe the status of its design emphasizing how it has been derived by the
scientific requirements.
