We consider the possibility that the Higgs can be produced in dark matter
annihilations, appearing as a line in the spectrum of gamma rays at an energy
determined by the masses of the WIMP and the Higgs itself. We argue that this
phenomenon occurs generally in models in which the the dark sector has large
couplings to the most massive states of the SM and provide a simple example
inspired by the Randall-Sundrum vision of dark matter, whose 4d dual
corresponds to electroweak symmetry-breaking by strong dynamics which respect
global symmetries that guarantee a stable WIMP. The dark matter is a Dirac
fermion that couples to a Z' acting as a portal to the Standard Model through
its strong coupling to top quarks. Annihilation into light standard model
degrees of freedom is suppressed and generates a feeble continuum spectrum of
gamma rays. Loops of top quarks mediate annihilation into gamma Z, gamma h, and
gamma Z', providing a forest of lines in the spectrum. Such models can be
probed by the Fermi/GLAST satellite and ground-based Air Cherenkov telescopes.
