As the silicon industry continues to push the limits of device dimensions,
tools such as Raman spectroscopy are ideal to analyze and characterize the
doped silicon channels. The effect of inter-valence band transitions on the
zone center optical phonon in heavily p-type doped silicon is studied by Raman
spectroscopy for a wide range of excitation wavelengths extending from the red
(632.8 nm) into the ultra-violet (325 nm). The asymmetry in the one-phonon
Raman lineshape is attributed to a Fano interference involving the overlap of a
continuum of electronic excitations with a discrete phonon state. We identify a
transition above and below the one-dimensional critical point (E = 3.4 eV) in
the electronic excitation spectrum of silicon. The relationship between the
anisotropic silicon band structure and the penetration depth is discussed in
the context of possible device applications.
