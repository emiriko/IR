In 1922, Cartan introduced in differential geometry, besides the Riemannian
curvature, the new concept of torsion. He visualized a homogeneous and
isotropic distribution of torsion in three dimensions (3d) by the "helical
staircase", which he constructed by starting from a 3d Euclidean space and by
defining a new connection via helical motions. We describe this geometric
procedure in detail and define the corresponding connection and the torsion.
The interdisciplinary nature of this subject is already evident from Cartan's
discussion, since he argued - but never proved - that the helical staircase
should correspond to a continuum with constant pressure and constant internal
torque. We discuss where in physics the helical staircase is realized: (i) In
the continuum mechanics of Cosserat media, (ii) in (fairly speculative) 3d
theories of gravity, namely a) in 3d Einstein-Cartan gravity - this is Cartan's
case of constant pressure and constant intrinsic torque - and b) in 3d Poincare
gauge theory with the Mielke-Baekler Lagrangian, and, eventually, (iii) in the
gauge field theory of dislocations of Lazar et al., as we prove for the first
time by arranging a suitable distribution of screw dislocations. Our main
emphasis is on the discussion of dislocation field theory.
