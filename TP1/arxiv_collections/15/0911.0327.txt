The charge density wave phase transition of 1T-TiSe2 is studied by
angle-resolved photoemission over a wide temperature range. An important
chemical potential shift which strongly evolves with temperature is evidenced.
In the framework of the exciton condensate phase, the detailed temperature
dependence of the associated order parameter is extracted. Having a
mean-field-like behaviour at low temperature, it exhibits a non-zero value
above the transition, interpreted as the signature of strong excitonic
fluctuations, reminiscent of the pseudo-gap phase of high temperature
superconductors. Integrated intensity around the Fermi level is found to
display a trend similar to the measured resistivity and is discussed within the
model.
