The MAP model was introduced in information system engineering in order to
model processes on a flexible way. The intentional level of this model helps an
engineer to execute a process with a strong relationship to the situation of
the project at hand. In the literature, attempts for having a practical use of
maps are not numerous. Our aim is to enhance the guidance mechanisms of the
process execution by reusing graph algorithms. After clarifying the existing
relationship between graphs and maps, we improve the MAP model by adding
qualitative criteria. We then offer a way to express maps with graphs and
propose to use Graph theory algorithms to offer an automatic guidance of the
map. We illustrate our proposal by an example and discuss its limitations.
