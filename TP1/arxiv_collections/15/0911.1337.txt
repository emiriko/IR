Planets have been observed in tight binary systems with separations less than
20 AU. A likely formation scenario for such systems involves a dynamical
capture, after which high relative inclinations are likely and may lead to
Kozai oscillations.
  We numerically investigate the fate of an initially coplanar double-planet
system in a class of binaries with separation ranging between $12 - 20 $ AU.
Dynamical integrations of representative four-body systems are performed, each
including a hot Jupiter and a second planet on a wider orbit. We find that,
although such systems can remain stable at low relative inclinations ($\lesssim
40^\circ$), high relative inclinations are likely to lead to instabilities.
This can be avoided if the planets are placed in a \emph{Kozai-stable zone}
within which mutual gravitational perturbations can suppress the Kozai
mechanism.
  We investigate the possibility of inducing Kozai oscillations in the inner
orbit by a weak coupling mechanism between the planets in which the coplanarity
is broken due to a differential nodal precession. Propagating perturbations
from the stellar companion through a planetary system in this manner can have
dramatic effects on the dynamical evolution of planetary systems, especially in
tight binaries and can offer a reasonable explanation for eccentricity trends
among planets observed in binary systems. We find that inducing such
oscillations into the orbit of a hot Jupiter is more likely in tight binaries
and an upper limit can be set on the binary separation above which these
oscillations are not observed.
