We report the investigation of electron transport through a four-terminal
graphene-superconductor hybrid system. Due to the quantum interference of the
reflected holes from two graphene-superconductor interfaces with phase
difference $\theta$, it is found that the specular Andreev reflection vanishes
at $\theta=0$ while the Andreev retroreflection disappears at $\theta=\pi$.
This means that the retroreflection and specular reflection can be easily
controlled and separated in this device. In addition, due to the diffraction
effect in the narrow graphene nanoribbon, the reflected hole can exit from both
graphene terminals. As the width of nanoribbon increases, the diffraction
effect gradually disappears and the reflected hole eventually exits from a
particular graphene terminal depending on the type of Andreev reflection.
