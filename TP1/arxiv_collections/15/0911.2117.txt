It is well known that neutrinoless double decay is going to play a crucial
role in settling the neutrino properties, which cannot be extracted from the
neutrino oscillation data. It is, in particular, expected to settle the
absolute scale of neutrino mass and determine whether the neutrinos are
Majorana particles, i.e. they coincide with their own antiparticles. In order
to extract the average neutrino mass from the data one must be able to estimate
the contribution all possible high mass intermediate particles. The latter,
which occur in practically all extensions of the standard model, can, in
principle, be differentiated from the usual mass term, if data from various
targets are available. One, however, must first be able reliably calculate the
corresponding nuclear matrix elements. Such calculations are extremely
difficult since the effective transition operators are very short ranged. For
such operators processes like pionic contributions, which are usually
negligible, turn out to be dominant. We study such an effect in a non
relativistic quark model for the pion and the nucleon.
