Hadrons interaction at high energies is carried out by one color gluon
exchange. All quarks and gluons contained in colliding hadrons take part in
interaction and production of particles. The contribution of multiple parton
interactions is negligible. Multiple hadrons production at high energies occurs
only in three types of processes. The first process is hadrons production in
gluon string, the second is hadrons production in two quark strings and the
third is hadrons production in three quark strings. In proton-proton
interaction production of only gluon string and two quark strings is possible.
In proton-antiproton interaction production of gluon string, two quark strings
and three quark strings is possible. Therefore multiplicity distributions in
proton-proton and proton-antiproton interactions are different.
