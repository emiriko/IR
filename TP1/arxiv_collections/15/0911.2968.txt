Neutron deficient isotopes of Francium (Z=87, N=121-123) as excited nuclei
were produced in the fusion-evaporation reaction: 197Au(16O,xn)[213-x]Fr at 100
MeV. The gamma-rays from the residues were observed through the high
sensitivity Germanium Clover detector array INGA. The decay of the high spin
states and the isomeric states of the doubly-odd 208Fr nuclei, identified from
the known sequence of ground state transitions, were observed. The half lives
of the 194(2) keV isomeric transition, known from earlier observations, was
measured to be 233(18) ns. A second isomeric transition at 383(2) keV and half
life of 33(7) ns was also found. The measured half lives were compared with the
corresponding single particle estimates, based on a the level scheme obtained
from the experiment.
