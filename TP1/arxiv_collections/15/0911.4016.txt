Measurements of the sound velocities in a single crystal of FeSi were
performed in the temperature range 4-300 K. Elastic constants $C_{12}$ and
$C_{44}$ deviate from a quasiharmonic behavior at high temperature; whereas,
$C_{12}$ increases anomalously in the entire range of temperature, indicating a
change in the electron structure of this material
