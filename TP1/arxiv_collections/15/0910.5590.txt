We present new optical long-slit data along 6 position angles of the bulge
region of M31. We derive accurate stellar and gas kinematics reaching 5 arcmin
from the center, where the disk light contribution is always less than 30%, and
out to 8 arcmin along the major axis, where the disk makes 55% of the total
light. We show that the velocity dispersions of McElroy (1983) are severely
underestimated (by up to 50 km/s) and previous dynamical models have
underestimated the stellar mass of M31's bulge by a factor 2. Moreover, the
light-weighted velocity dispersion of the galaxy grows to 166 km/s, thus
reducing the discrepancy between the predicted and measured mass of the black
hole at the center of M31. The kinematic position angle varies with distance,
pointing to triaxiality. We detect gas counterrotation near the bulge minor
axis. We measure eight emission-corrected Lick indices. They are approximately
constant on circles. We derive the age, metallicity and alpha-element
overabundance profiles. Except for the region in the inner arcsecs of the
galaxy, the bulge of M31 is uniformly old (>12 Gyr, with many best-fit ages at
the model grid limit of 15 Gyr), slightly alpha-elements overabundant
([alpha/Fe]~0.2) and at solar metallicity, in agreement with studies of the
resolved stellar components. The predicted u-g, g-r and r-i Sloan color
profiles match reasonably well the dust-corrected observations. The stellar
populations have approximately radially constant mass-to-light ratios (M/L_R ~
4-4.5 for a Kroupa IMF), in agreement with stellar dynamical estimates based on
our new velocity dispersions. In the inner arcsecs the luminosity-weighted age
drops to 4-8 Gyr, while the metallicity increases to above 3 times the solar
value.
