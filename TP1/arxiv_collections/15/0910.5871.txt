The gap symmetries of superconductivity are studied in this work. It is found
that the gap symmetries are simply determined by the 4-fold rotational
symmetries of the coupling potential on neighbor sites. A local on-site
coupling potential results in the on-site pairing with the conventional s-wave
symmetry, but a coupling potential between the nearest neighbors or the
next-nearest neighbors results in the pairing on neighbor sites with the $s^-$,
$d_{x^2-y^2}$, $d_{xy}$, or $s_{x^2y^2}$ gap symmetries. It is proved that both
isotropic and anisotropic gap functions are allowed by the 4-fold rotational
symmetries of the coupling potential. Finally a numerical computation is
performed to demonstrate the gap symmetries. This neighbor coupling provides a
unified picture for the gap functions of the conventional and the high Tc
superconductivity.
