We study the non-Markovian effect on the dynamics of the quantum discord by
exactly solving a model consisting of two independent qubits subject to two
zero-temperature non-Markovian reservoirs, respectively. Considering the two
qubits initially prepared in Bell-like or extended Werner-like states, we show
that there is no occurrence of the sudden death, but only instantaneous
disappearance of the quantum discord at some time points, in comparison to the
entanglement sudden death in the same range of the parameters of interest. It
implies that the quantum discord is more useful than the entanglement to
describe quantum correlation involved in quantum systems.
