We present the case for a dark matter detector with directional sensitivity.
This document was developed at the 2009 CYGNUS workshop on directional dark
matter detection, and contains contributions from theorists and experimental
groups in the field. We describe the need for a dark matter detector with
directional sensitivity; each directional dark matter experiment presents their
project's status; and we close with a feasibility study for scaling up to a one
ton directional detector, which would cost around $150M.
