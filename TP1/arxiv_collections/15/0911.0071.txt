In this presentation, I argue that weak measurements empirically support the
notion of quantum superpositions as statistical alternatives. In short, weak
measurements show that Schroedinger's cat is already dead or alive before the
measurement. The collapse of the wavefunction in a strong measurement should
therefore be separated into the statistical selection of one of the available
alternatives and a physical interaction that causes decoherence. The
application to entanglement reveals that measurements in A have no physical
effect in B, resolving the paradox of Bell`s inequality violation in favor of
locality and against (non-empirical) realism.
