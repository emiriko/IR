We report on the study of a magnetic dislocation in pure chromium. Coherent
x-ray diffraction profiles obtained on the incommensurate Spin Density Wave
(SDW) reflection are consistent with the presence of a dislocation of the
magnetic order, embedded at a few micrometers from the surface of the sample.
Beyond the specific case of magnetic dislocations in chromium, this work may
open up a new method for the study of magnetic defects embedded in the bulk.
