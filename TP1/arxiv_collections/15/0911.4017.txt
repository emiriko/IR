The transmission T and conductance G through one or multiple one-dimensional,
delta-function barriers of two-dimensional fermions with a linear energy
spectrum are studied. T and G are periodic functions of the strength P of the
delta-function barrier V(x,y) / hbar v_F = P delta(x). The dispersion relation
of a Kronig-Penney (KP) model of a superlattice is also a periodic function of
P and causes collimation of an incident electron beam for P = 2 pi n and n
integer. For a KP superlattice with alternating sign of the height of the
barriers the Dirac point becomes a Dirac line for P = (n + 1/2) pi.
