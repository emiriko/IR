Little Higgs models with T-parity can easily satisfy electroweak precision
tests and at the same time give a stable particle which is a candidate for cold
dark matter. In addition to little Higgs heavy gauge bosons, this type of
models predicts a set of new T-odd fermions, which may show quite interesting
signatures at colliders. We study purely leptonic signatures of T-odd leptons
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
