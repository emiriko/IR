In the objective of building intelligent searching systems for Elibraries or
online bookstores, we have proposed a searching system model based on a
Vietnamese language query processing component. Such document searching systems
based on this model can allow users to use Vietnamese queries that represent
content information as input, instead of entering keywords for searching in
specific fields in database. To simplify the realization process of system
based on this searching system model, we set a target of building a framework
to support the rapid development of Vietnamese language query processing
components. Such framework let the implementation of Vietnamese language query
processing component in similar systems in this domain to be done more easily.
