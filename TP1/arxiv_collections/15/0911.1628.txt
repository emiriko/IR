We study the Nernst effect due to vortex motion in two-dimensional granular
superconductors using simulations with Langevin or resistively shunted
Josephson-junction dynamics. In particular, we show that the geometric
frustration of both regular and irregular granular materials can lead to
thermally driven transport of vortices from colder to hotter regions, resulting
in a sign reversal of the Nernst signal. We discuss the underlying mechanisms
of this anomalous behavior in terms of heat transport by mobile vacancies in an
otherwise pinned vortex lattice.
