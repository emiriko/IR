Localization properties of non-interacting quantum particles in
one-dimensional incommensurate lattices are investigated with an exponential
short-range hopping that is beyond the minimal nearest-neighbor tight-binding
model. Energy dependent mobility edges are analytically predicted in this model
and verified with numerical calculations. The results are then mapped to the
continuum Schrodinger equation, and an approximate analytical expression for
the localization phase diagram and the energy dependent mobility edges in the
ground band obtained.
