Nanocluster impact on a free-standing graphene is performed by the molecular
dynamics simulation, and the dynamical motion of the free-standing graphene is
investigated. The graphene is bended by the incident nanocluster, and a
transverse deflection wave isotropically propagated in the graphene is
observed. We find that the time evolution of the deflection is
semi-quantitatively described by the linear theory of elasticity. We also
analyze the time evolution of the temperature profile of the graphene, and the
analysis based on the least dissipation principle reproduces the result in the
early stage of impact.
