We demonstrate that possession of a single negative mode is not a sufficient
criterion for an instanton to mediate exponential decay. For example, de Sitter
space is generically stable against decay via the Coleman-De Luccia instanton.
This is due to the fact that the de Sitter Euclidean action is bounded below,
allowing for an approximately de Sitter invariant false vacuum to be
constructed.
