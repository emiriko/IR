The summation of the small x-corrections to hard-scattering QCD amplitudes by
collinear factorisation method is reconsidered and the K-factor is derived in
leading ln x approximation with a result differing from the corresponding
expression by Catani and Hautmann (Nucl. Phys. B 427, 475, 1994). The
significance of the difference is demonstrated in the examples of structure
function F_L and of exclusive vector meson electroproduction. The formulation
covers the channels of non-vanishing conformal spin n paving the way for new
applications.
