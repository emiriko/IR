In a variety of applications, most notably microfluidic design, slip-based
boundary conditions have been sought to characterize fluid flow over patterned
surfaces. We focus on laminar shear flows over surfaces with periodic height
fluctuations and/or fluctuating Navier scalar slip properties. We derive a
general formula for the "effective slip", which describes equivalent fluid
motion at the mean surface as depicted by the linear velocity profile that
arises far from it. We show that the slip and the applied stress are related
linearly through a tensorial mobility matrix, and the method of domain
perturbation is then used to derive an approximate formula for the mobility law
directly in terms of surface properties. The specific accuracy of the
approximation is detailed, and the mobility relation is then utilized to
address several questions, such as the determination of optimal surface shapes
and the effect of random surface fluctuations on fluid slip.
