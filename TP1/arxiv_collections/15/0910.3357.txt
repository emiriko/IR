In this write-up we summarize main result of our recent analysis on the
mixing between transverse $\rho$ and $a_1$ mesons through a set of $\omega\rho
a_1$-type interactions in dense baryonic matter. In the analysis, we showed
that a clear enhancement of the vector spectral function appears below
$\sqrt{s}=m_\rho$ for small three-momenta of the $\rho$ meson, and thus the
vector spectrum exhibits broadening.
