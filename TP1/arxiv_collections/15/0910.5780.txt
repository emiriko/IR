Multiple genome alignment remains a challenging problem. Effects of
recombination including rearrangement, segmental duplication, gain, and loss
can create a mosaic pattern of homology even among closely related organisms.
We describe a method to align two or more genomes that have undergone
large-scale recombination, particularly genomes that have undergone substantial
amounts of gene gain and loss (gene flux). The method utilizes a novel
alignment objective score, referred to as a sum-of-pairs breakpoint score. We
also apply a probabilistic alignment filtering method to remove erroneous
alignments of unrelated sequences, which are commonly observed in other genome
alignment methods. We describe new metrics for quantifying genome alignment
accuracy which measure the quality of rearrangement breakpoint predictions and
indel predictions. The progressive genome alignment algorithm demonstrates
markedly improved accuracy over previous approaches in situations where genomes
have undergone realistic amounts of genome rearrangement, gene gain, loss, and
duplication. We apply the progressive genome alignment algorithm to a set of 23
completely sequenced genomes from the genera Escherichia, Shigella, and
Salmonella. The 23 enterobacteria have an estimated 2.46Mbp of genomic content
conserved among all taxa and total unique content of 15.2Mbp. We document
substantial population-level variability among these organisms driven by
homologous recombination, gene gain, and gene loss. Free, open-source software
implementing the described genome alignment approach is available from
