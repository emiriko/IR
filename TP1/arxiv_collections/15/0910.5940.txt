We use graded Specht modules to calculate the graded decomposition numbers
for the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of the symmetric group over a field of
characteristic zero at a root of unity. The algorithm arrived at is the
Lascoux-Leclerc-Thibon algorithm in disguise. Thus we interpret the algorithm
in terms of graded representation theory.
