Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber detectors are ideally suited for
studying neutrino interactions and probing the parameters that characterize
neutrino oscillations. The ability to drift ionization particles over long
distances in purified argon and to trigger on abundant scintillation light
allows for excellent particle identification and triggering capability. In
these proceedings the details of the ArgoNeuT test-beam project will be
presented after a brief introduction to the detector technique. ArgoNeuT is a
175 liter detector exposed to Fermilab's NuMI neutrino beamline. The first
neutrino interactions observed in ArgoNeuT will be presented, along with
discussion of the various physics analyses to be performed on this data sample.
