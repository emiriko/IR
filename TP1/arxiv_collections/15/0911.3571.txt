We study the charged cosmic rays arising from the slow decay of gravitino
dark matter within supersymmetric scenarios with trilinear R-parity violation.
It is shown that operators of the LLE type can very well account for the recent
anomalies in cosmic ray electron and positron data reported by PAMELA, ATIC and
Fermi LAT, without violating any other bounds. This scenario will soon be
tested by the Fermi LAT data on diffuse gamma ray emission.
