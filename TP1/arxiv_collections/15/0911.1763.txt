The replicator equation is interpreted as a continuous inference equation and
a formal similarity between the discrete replicator equation and Bayesian
inference is described. Further connections between inference and the
replicator equation are given including a discussion of information divergences
and exponential families as solutions for the replicator dynamic, using Fisher
information and information geometry.
