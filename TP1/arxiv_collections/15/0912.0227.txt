BaIrO3 is a novel insulator with coexistent weak ferromagnetism, charge and
spin density wave. Dilute RE doping for Ba induces a metallic state, whereas
application of modest pressure readily restores an insulating state
characterized by a three-order-of-magnitude increase of resistivity. Since
pressure generally increases orbital overlap and broadens energy bands, a
pressure-induced insulating state is not commonplace. The profoundly dissimilar
responses of the ground state to light doping and low hydrostatic pressures
signal an unusual, delicate interplay between structural and electronic degrees
of freedom in BaIrO3.
