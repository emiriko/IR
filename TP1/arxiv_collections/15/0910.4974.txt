For the deterministic dyadic model of turbulence, there are examples of
initial conditions in $l^2$ which have more than one solution. The aim of this
paper is to prove that uniqueness, for all $l^2$-initial conditions, is
restored when a suitable multiplicative noise is introduced. The noise is
formally energy preserving. Uniqueness is understood in the weak probabilistic
sense.
