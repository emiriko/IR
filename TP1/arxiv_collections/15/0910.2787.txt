The exotic physics in condensed matter systems, such as high-Tc
superconductivity in cuprates, is due to the properties of the elementary
excitations and their interactions. The dispersion of the electronic states
revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) provides a chance
to understand these excitations. Recently, a "high energy anomaly" or
"waterfall-like" feature in cuprates' dispersion has been reported and studied
theoretically. Most of the current views argue that it is the result of some
many-body effect at a specific high energy scale (e.g. ~ 0.3eV), though there
are other arguments that this is an artificial effect. Here, we report a
systematic ARPES study on the "high energy anomaly" in Bi2212 samples over
multiple Brillouin zones and with a large variety of ARPES matrix elements. We
find that the incoherent weight of the electron spectral function at high
binding energy is intimately linked to the energy of the dispersive coherent
weight through an unexpected but simple relationship with no special energy
scales. This behavior in concert with strong k-dependent matrix element effects
gives rise to the heavily studied "waterfall" behavior.
