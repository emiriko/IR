We present two measures of distance between quantum processes based on the
superfidelity, introduced recently to provide an upper bound for quantum
fidelity. We show that the introduced measures partially fulfill the
requirements for distance measure between quantum processes. We also argue that
they can be especially useful as diagnostic measures to get preliminary
knowledge about imperfections in an experimental setup. In particular we
provide quantum circuit which can be used to measure the superfidelity between
quantum processes.
  As the behavior of the superfidelity between quantum processes is crucial for
the properties of the introduced measures, we study its behavior for several
families of quantum channels. We calculate superfidelity between arbitrary
one-qubit channels using affine parametrization and superfidelity between
generalized Pauli channels in arbitrary dimensions. Statistical behavior of the
proposed quantities for the ensembles of quantum operations in low dimensions
indicates that the proposed measures can be indeed used to distinguish quantum
processes.
