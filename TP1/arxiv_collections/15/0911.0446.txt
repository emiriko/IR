The cosmological evolution of neutrino energy densities driven by cosmon-type
field equations is introduced assuming that active and sterile neutrinos are
intrinsically connected by cosmon fields through the {\em seesaw} mechanism.
Interpreting sterile neutrinos as dark matter adiabatically coupled with dark
energy results in a natural decoupling of (active) mass varying neutrino
(MaVaN) equations. Identifying the dimensionless scale of the {\em seesaw}
mechanism, $m/M$, with a power of the cosmological scale factor, $a$, allows
for embedding the resulting masses into the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG)
scenario for the dark sector. Without additional assumptions, our findings
establish a precise connection among three distinct frameworks: the cosmon
field dynamics for MaVaN's, the {\em seesaw} mechanism for dynamical mass
generation and the GCG scenario. Our results also corroborate with previous
assertions that mass varying particles can be the right responsible for the
stability issue and for the cosmic acceleration of the universe.
