In this paper we show that QUASAR-370 large area hybrid phototube developed
for and successfully used in a number of astroparticle physics experiments, the
lake Baikal deep underwater neutrino experiment among them, could be used as a
prototype of a photodetector for the next generation of giant neutrino
telescopes.
