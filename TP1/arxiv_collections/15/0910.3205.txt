We show that with a realistic treatment of spectator momentum distributions
the RHIC detector trigger sensitivity is high even when RHIC is run below
injection energies. In particular, a problem region with $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=10 to
60 or 80 GeV assuming a simple Fermi step model is not found when using a more
realistic one. We argue also that production of fast nucleons (with momenta $>
p_F$ in the nucleus rest frame) provides complementary information about the
collision process.
