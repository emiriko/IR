Predictions for energy levels, production and decay rate of gluinonia,
non-relativistic boundstates of gluinos, are presented. The potential between
color-octet constituents is derived in next-to-next-to leading order and
one-loop QCD corrections are derived for the production cross section and the
decay rate into gluon jets. In addition we evaluate the decay rate into top
quarks and into two photons. The signal-to-background ratio is estimated for
the dominant decay mode and found to be around 0.5%. For relatively light
gluinos the bound states thus might be detectable.
