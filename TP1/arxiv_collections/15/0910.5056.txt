With nonequilibrium Green's function approach combined with density
functional theory, we perform an ab initio calculation to investigate transport
properties of graphene nanoribbon junctions self-consistently. Tight-binding
approximation is applied to model the zigzag graphene nanoribbon (ZGNR)
electrodes, and its validity is confirmed by comparison with GAUSSIAN03 PBC
calculation of the same system. The origin of abnormal jump points usually
appearing in the transmission spectrum is explained with the detailed
tight-binding ZGNR band structure. Transport property of an edge defect ZGNR
junction is investigated, and the tunable tunneling current can be sensitively
controlled by transverse electric fields.
