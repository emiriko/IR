My answer to the question in the title is "No". In support of this point of
view, we analyze some examples of saddle-point methods, especially as applied
to quantum "tunneling" in nonrelativistic particle mechanics and in cosmology.
Along the way we explore some of the interrelationships among different ways of
thinking about path-integrals and saddle-point approximations to them.
