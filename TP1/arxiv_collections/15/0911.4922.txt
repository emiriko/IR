Using molecular dynamics simulation, we examine the dynamics of crystal,
polycrystal, and glass in a Lennard-Jones binary mixture composed of small and
large particles in two dimensions. The crossovers occur among these states as
the composition c is varied at fixed size ratio. Shear is applied to a system
of 9000 particles in contact with moving boundary layers composed of 1800
particles. The particle configurations are visualized with a sixfold
orientation angle alpha_j(t) and a disorder variable D_j(t) defined for
particle j, where the latter represents the deviation from hexagonal order.
Fundamental plastic elements are classified into dislocation gliding and grain
boundary sliding. At any c, large-scale yielding events occur on the acoustic
time scale. Moreover, they multiply occur in narrow fragile areas, forming
shear bands. The dynamics of plastic flow is highly hierarchical with a wide
range of time scales for slow shearing. We also clarify the relationship
between the shear stress averaged in the bulk region and the wall stress
applied at the boundaries.
