Based on the nearest-neighbor tight-binding model, we present analytical
description of low-energy electron transport through a symmetrical junction of
two semimetal armchair ribbons. The results obtained demonstrate the
transmission suppression in the vicinity of the neutrality point except for the
junction of the ribbons consisting of 3p-1 and 3p+5 dimer lines, p/2 is odd.
Unlike other interconnections, these compounds are shown to be free of even
local levels arising at the junction interface and exhibit electron
backscattering to be inversely as the square of p+1.
