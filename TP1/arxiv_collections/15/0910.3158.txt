Eta Car, with its historical outbursts, visible ejecta and massive, variable
winds, continues to challenge both observers and modelers. In just the past
five years over 100 papers have been published on this fascinating object. We
now know it to be a massive binary system with a 5.54-year period. In January
2009, Eta Car underwent one of its periodic low-states, associated with
periastron passage of the two massive stars. This event was monitored by an
intensive multi-wavelength campaign ranging from gamma-rays to radio. A large
amount of data was collected to test a number of evolving models including 3-D
models of the massive interacting winds. August 2009 was an excellent time for
observers and theorists to come together and review the accumulated studies, as
have occurred in four meetings since 1998 devoted to Eta Car. Indeed, Eta Car
behaved both predictably and unpredictably during this most recent periastron,
spurring timely discussions. Coincidently, WR140 also passed through periastron
in early 2009. It, too, is a intensively studied massive interacting binary.
Comparison of its properties, as well as the properties of other massive stars,
with those of Eta Car is very instructive. These well-known examples of evolved
massive binary systems provide many clues as to the fate of the most massive
stars. What are the effects of the interacting winds, of individual stellar
rotation, and of the circumstellar material on what we see as
hypernovae/supernovae? We hope to learn.
