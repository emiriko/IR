The ESA gamma-ray observatory INTEGRAL, launched on 17 October 2002,
continues to produce a wealth of discoveries and new results on compact high
energy Galactic objects, nuclear gamma-ray line emission, diffuse line and
continuum emission, cosmic background radiation, AGN, high energy transients
and sky surveys. The observing programme, fully open to the scientific
community at large, is built from the community's feedback to the Announcements
of Opportunity, issued about once per year. The mission's technical status is
healthy and INTEGRAL is continuing its scientific operations well beyond its
5-year technical design lifetime. This paper will briefly summarize the overall
current status.
