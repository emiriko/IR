The observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) such as 980425, 031203 and
060218, with luminosities much lower than those of other classic bursts, lead
to the definition of a new class of GRBs -- low-luminosity GRBs. The nature of
the outflow responsible for them is not clear yet. Two scenarios have been
suggested: one is the conventional relativistic outflow with initial Lorentz
factor of order of $\Gamma_0\ga 10$ and the other is a trans-relativistic
outflow with $\Gamma_0\simeq 1-2$. Here we compare the high energy gamma-ray
afterglow emission from these two different models, taking into account both
synchrotron self inverse-Compton scattering (SSC) and the external
inverse-Compton scattering due to photons from the cooling supernova or
hypernova envelope (SNIC). We find that the conventional relativistic outflow
model predicts a relatively high gamma-ray flux from SSC at early times ($<10^4
{\rm s}$ for typical parameters) with a rapidly decaying light curve, while in
the trans-relativistic outflow model, one would expect a much flatter light
curve of high-energy gamma-ray emission at early times, which could be
dominated by both the SSC emission and SNIC emission, depending on the
properties of the underlying supernova and the shock parameter $\epsilon_e$ and
$\epsilon_B$. The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope should be able to distinguish
between the two models in the future.
