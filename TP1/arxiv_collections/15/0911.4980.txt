We derive a factorization theorem that describes an energetic hadron h
fragmenting from a jet produced by a parton i, where the jet invariant mass is
measured. The analysis yields a "fragmenting jet function" G_i^h(s,z) that
depends on the jet invariant mass s, and on the energy fraction z of the
fragmentation hadron. We show that G^h_i can be computed in terms of
perturbatively calculable coefficients, J_{ij}(s,z/x), integrated against
standard non-perturbative fragmentation functions, D_j^{h}(x). We also show
that the sum over h of the integral over z of z G_i^h(s,z) is given by the
standard inclusive jet function J_i(s) which is perturbatively calculable in
QCD. We use Soft-Collinear Effective Theory and for simplicity carry out our
derivation for a process with a single jet, B -> X h l nu, with invariant mass
m_{X h}^2 >> Lambda_QCD^2. Our analysis yields a simple replacement rule that
allows any factorization theorem depending on an inclusive jet function J_i to
be converted to a semi-inclusive process with a fragmenting hadron h. We apply
this rule to derive factorization theorems for B -> X K gamma which is the
fragmentation to a Kaon in b -> s gamma, and for e^+e^- -> (dijets)+h with
measured hemisphere dijet invariant masses.
