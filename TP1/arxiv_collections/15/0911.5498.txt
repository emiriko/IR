Normal surface theory is a central tool in algorithmic three-dimensional
topology, and the enumeration of vertex normal surfaces is the computational
bottleneck in many important algorithms. However, it is not well understood how
the number of such surfaces grows in relation to the size of the underlying
triangulation. Here we address this problem in both theory and practice. In
theory, we tighten the exponential upper bound substantially; furthermore, we
construct pathological triangulations that prove an exponential bound to be
unavoidable. In practice, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of millions of
triangulations and find that in general the number of vertex normal surfaces is
remarkably small, with strong evidence that our pathological triangulations may
in fact be the worst case scenarios. This analysis is the first of its kind,
and the striking behaviour that we observe has important implications for the
feasibility of topological algorithms in three dimensions.
