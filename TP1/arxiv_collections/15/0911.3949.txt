Recently, Paolo Facchi et al. [Phys. Rev. A. 77, 060304 (R) (2008)]
introduced the notion of maximally multipartite entangled states of n qubits.
Here, we give a criterion for faithful controlled teleportation of an arbitrary
two-qubit state via a five-qubit entangled state and obtain the general
relation between the genuine five-qubit entangled state and controlled
teleportation. This criterion can be extended to teleportation of an arbitrary
N-qubit state using 2N+1-qubit entangled state. Furthermore, we study the
optimal match of measuring basis and quantum channel.
