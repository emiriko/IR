A set of global optical potential has been derived to describe the
interactions of $^{6}$He at low energies. The elastic scattering angular
distribution data measured so far for many systems, ranging from $^{12}$C to
$^{209}$Bi, have been considered within the framework of the optical model in
order to find a global potential set to describe the experimental data
consistently. We report that very good agreement between theoretical and
experimental results has been obtained with small $\chi^{2}/N$ values by using
the derived potential set. The reaction cross section and volume integrals of
the potentials have been deduced from the theoretical calculations for all
studied systems at relevant energies.
