Recently, aggregated journal-journal citation networks were made accessible
from the perspective of each journal included in the Science Citation Index see
(http://www.leydesdorff.net/). The local matrices can be used to inspect the
relevant citation environment of a journal using statistical analysis and
visualization techniques from social network analysis. The inspection gives an
answer to the question what the local impact of this and other journals in the
environment is. In this study the citation environment of Angewandte Chemie was
analysed. Angewandte Chemie is one of the prime chemistry journals in the
world. Its environment was compared with that of the Journal of the American
Chemical Society. The results of the environment analyses give a detailed
insight into the field-embeddedness of Angewandte Chemie. The impacts of the
German and international editions of this journal are compared.
