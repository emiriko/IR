We developed an improved model in order to predict the RF behavior and the
slow light properties of the SOA valid for any experimental conditions. It
takes into account the dynamic saturation of the SOA, which can be fully
characterized by a simple measurement, and only relies on material fitting
parameters, independent of the optical intensity and the injected current. The
present model is validated by showing a good agreement with experiments for
small and large modulation indices.
