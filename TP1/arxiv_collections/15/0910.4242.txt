CCD UBVRI photometry is presented for type IIb SN 2008ax for about 320 days.
The photometric behavior is typical for core-collapse SNe with low amount of
hydrogen. The main photometric parameters are derived and the comparison with
SNe of similar types is reported. Preliminary modeling is carried out, and the
results are compared to the observed light curves. The main parameters of the
hydrodynamical models are close to those used for SN IIb 1993J.
