The classical Mie theory - electromagnetic radiation scattering by the
homogeneous spherical particles - is considered in the epsilon near zero limits
separately for the materials of the particles and the surrounding medium. The
maxima of a scattered transverse electrical (TE) field for the surrounding
medium materials with the epsilon near zero limits are revealed. The effective
multipole polarizabilities of the corresponding scattering particles are
investigated. The possibility to achieve magnetic dipole resonance and
accordingly to construct metamaterials with negative refractive index for the
aggregates spherical particles in surrounding medium with the epsilon near zero
limits is considered.
