The central result of this paper is an analytic duality relation for
real-valued L\'evy processes killed upon exiting a half-line. By Nagasawa's
theorem, this yields a remarkable time-reversal identity involving the L\'evy
process conditioned to stay positive. As examples of applications, we construct
a version of the L\'evy process indexed by the entire real line and started
from $-\infty$ which enjoys a natural spatial-stationarity property, and point
out that the latter leads to a natural Lamperti-type representation for
self-similar Markov processes in $(0,\infty)$ started from the entrance point
0+.
