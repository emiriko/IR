The relation between Pearson's correlation coefficient and Salton's cosine
measure is revealed based on the different possible values of the division of
the L1-norm and the L2-norm of a vector. These different values yield a sheaf
of increasingly straight lines which form together a cloud of points, being the
investigated relation. The theoretical results are tested against the author
co-citation relations among 24 informetricians for whom two matrices can be
constructed, based on co-citations: the asymmetric occurrence matrix and the
symmetric co-citation matrix. Both examples completely confirm the theoretical
results. The results enable us to specify an algorithm which provides a
threshold value for the cosine above which none of the corresponding Pearson
correlations would be negative. Using this threshold value can be expected to
optimize the visualization of the vector space.
