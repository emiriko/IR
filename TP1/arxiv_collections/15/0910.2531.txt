The generalised eigenvalues for a pair of $N\times N$ matrices $(X_1,X_2)$
are defined as the solutions of the equation $\det (X_1-\lambda X_2)=0$, or
equivalently, for $X_2$ invertible, as the eigenvalues of $X_2^{-1}X_1$. We
consider Gaussian real matrices $X_1,X_2$, for which the generalised
eigenvalues have the rotational invariance of the half-sphere, or after a
fractional linear transformation, the rotational invariance of the unit disk.
In these latter variables we calculate the joint eigenvalue probability density
function, the probability $p_{N,k}$ of finding $k$ real eigenvalues, the
densities of real and complex eigenvalues (the latter being related to an
average over characteristic polynomials), and give an explicit Pfaffian formula
for the higher correlation functions $\rho_{(k_1,k_2)}$. A limit theorem for
$p_{N,k}$ is proved, and the scaled form of $\rho_{(k_1,k_2)}$ is shown to be
identical to the analogous limit for the correlations of the eigenvalues of
real Gaussian matrices. We show that these correlations satisfy sum rules
characteristic of the underlying two-component Coulomb gas.
