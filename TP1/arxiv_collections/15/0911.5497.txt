We study the cusp configuration of pre-seeded magnetic field for laser-driven
flux-compression. The proposed configuration provides better particle
confinement than that in Ref. [O.V. Gotchev et al., Journal of Fusion Energy 27
(2008) 25-31.] thereby leading to better magnetic insulation of hot fusion
plasma. We develop the model that takes into account (i) magnetized target
implosion, (ii) magnetic flux compression; (iii) particle losses from magnetic
trap. The key parameter governing the process is the ratio of the implosion
time to the particle loss time.
