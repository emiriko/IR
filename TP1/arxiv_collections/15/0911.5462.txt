Recognition of iris based on Visible Light (VL) imaging is a difficult
problem because of the light reflection from the cornea. Nonetheless, pigment
melanin provides a rich feature source in VL, unavailable in Near-Infrared
(NIR) imaging. This is due to biological spectroscopy of eumelanin, a chemical
not stimulated in NIR. In this case, a plausible solution to observe such
patterns may be provided by an adaptive procedure using a variational technique
on the image histogram. To describe the patterns, a shape analysis method is
used to derive feature-code for each subject. An important question is how much
the melanin patterns, extracted from VL, are independent of iris texture in
NIR. With this question in mind, the present investigation proposes fusion of
features extracted from NIR and VL to boost the recognition performance. We
have collected our own database (UTIRIS) consisting of both NIR and VL images
of 158 eyes of 79 individuals. This investigation demonstrates that the
proposed algorithm is highly sensitive to the patterns of cromophores and
improves the iris recognition rate.
