Quantum dot (QD) lay-outs are becoming more complex as the technology is
being applied to more complex multi-QD structures. This increase in complexity
requires improved capacitance modeling both for design and accurate
interpretation of QD properties from measurement. A combination of process
simulation, electrostatic simulation, and computer assisted design (CAD)
lay-out packages are used to develop a three dimensional (3D) classical
capacitance model. The agreement of the capacitances of the classical model is
tested against two different, experimentally measured, topographically complex
silicon QD geometries. Agreement with experiment, within 10-20%, is
demonstrated for the two structures when the details of the structure are
transferred from the CAD to the model capturing the full 3D topography. Small
uncertainty in device dimensions due to uncontrolled variation in processing,
like layer thickness and gate size, are calculated to be sufficient to explain
the disagreement. The sensitivity of the capacitances to small variations in
the structure also highlights the limits of accuracy of capacitance models for
QD analysis. We furthermore observe that a critical density, the metal
insulator transition, can be used as a good approximation of the metallic edge
of the quantum dot when electron density in the dot is calculated directly with
a semi-classical simulation.
