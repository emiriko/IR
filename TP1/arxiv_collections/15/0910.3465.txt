We have performed an On-The-Fly (OTF) mapping survey of ${\rm
^{12}{CO(J=1-0)}}$ emission in 28 Virgo cluster spiral galaxies using the Five
College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO) 14-m telescope. This survey aims to
characterize the CO distribution, kinematics, and luminosity of a large sample
of galaxies covering the full extents of stellar disks, rather than sampling
only the inner disks or the major axis as was done by many previous single dish
and interferometric CO surveys. CO emission is detected in 20 galaxies among
the 28 Virgo spirals observed. An atlas consisting of global measures, radial
measures, and maps, is presented for each detected galaxy. A note summarizing
the CO data is also presented along with relevant information from the
literature. The CO properties derived from our OTF observations are presented
and compared with the results from the FCRAO Extragalactic CO Survey by Young
et al. (1995) which utilized position-switching observations along the major
axis and a model fitting method. We find that our OTF derived CO properties
agree well with the Young et al. results in many cases, but the Young et al.
measurements are larger by a factor of 1.4 - 2.4 for seven (out of 18) cases.
We will explore further the possible causes for the discrepancy in the analysis
paper currently under preparation.
