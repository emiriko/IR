To improve the planet detection efficiency, current planetary microlensing
experiments are focused on high-magnification events searching for planetary
signals near the peak of lensing light curves. However, it is known that
central perturbations can also be produced by binary companions and thus it is
important to distinguish planetary signals from those induced by binary
companions. In this paper, we analyze the light curves of microlensing events
OGLE-2007-BLG-137/MOA-2007-BLG-091, OGLE-2007-BLG-355/MOA-2007-BLG-278, and
MOA-2007-BLG-199/OGLE-2007-BLG-419, for all of which exhibit short-term
perturbations near the peaks of the light curves. From detailed modeling of the
light curves, we find that the perturbations of the events are caused by binary
companions rather than planets. From close examination of the light curves
combined with the underlying physical geometry of the lens system obtained from
modeling, we find that the short time-scale caustic-crossing feature occurring
at a low or a moderate base magnification with an additional secondary
perturbation is a typical feature of binary-lens events and thus can be used
for the discrimination between the binary and planetary interpretations.
