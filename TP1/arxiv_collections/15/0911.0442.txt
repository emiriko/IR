We obtain the canonical and symmetrical Belinfante energy-momentum tensors of
Dirac--K\"{a}hler's fields. It is shown that the traces of the energy-momentum
tensors are not equal to zero. We find the canonical and Belinfante dilatation
currents which are not conserved, but a new conserved dilatation current is
obtained. It is pointed out that the conformal symmetry is broken. The
canonical quantization is performed and the propagator of the massless fields
in the first-order formalism is found.
