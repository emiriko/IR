We briefly review a recently developed semiclassical theory for quantum
oscillations in the spatial (particle and kinetic energy) densities of finite
fermion systems and present some examples of its results. We then discuss the
inclusion of correlations (finite temperatures, pairing correlations) in the
semiclassical theory.
