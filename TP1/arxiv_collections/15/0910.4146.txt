Whilst standard field theoretic Cosmic Strings cannot end, Cosmic
Superstrings can form three string junctions, at which each string ends. This
opens up a new class of possible boundary conditions for such strings and we
show that, at least when the junctions are close together, a string ending of
two such junctions will generically have cusps. Cusps are of particular
interest as they are strong emitters of radiation (both gravitational and
particle) and hence are possible observables. The detection of cusps from
Cosmic Superstrings between junctions would be a rare observational window into
the realm of String theory and Brane inflation models.
