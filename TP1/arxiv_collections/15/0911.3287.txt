This paper focuses on disagreement between theoretical predictions and
experimental results of the production properties of Bc meson. Hadronic decays
of Bc are used to separate predictions of production cross section and
predictions of branching ratio. The branching ratios of Bc decays to J/psi +
\pi and to J/psi + 3\pi are also presented.
