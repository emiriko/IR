This paper reviews the current status of graphene transistors as potential
supplement to silicon CMOS technology. A short overview of graphene
manufacturing and metrology methods is followed by an introduction of
macroscopic graphene field effect transistors (FETs). The absence of an energy
band gap is shown to result in severe shortcomings for logic applications.
Possibilities to engineer a band gap in graphene FETs including quantum
confinement in graphene Nanoribbons (GNRs) and electrically or substrate
induced asymmetry in double and multi layer graphene are discussed. Graphene
FETs are shown to be of interest for analog radio frequency applications.
Finally, novel switching mechanisms in graphene transistors are briefly
introduced that could lead to future memory devices.
