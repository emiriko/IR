We consider the 2-dimensional spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation for
hard potentials. We assume that the initial condition is a probability measure
that has some exponential moments and is not a Dirac mass. We prove some
regularization properties: for a class of very hard potentials, the solution
instantaneously belongs to $H^r$, for some $r\in (-1,2)$ depending on the
parameters of the equation. Our proof relies on the use of a well-suited
Malliavin calculus for jump processes.
