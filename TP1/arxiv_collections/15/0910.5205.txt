Diffractive physics program for ATLAS and CMS is discussed with emphasis on
measurements of central exclusive processes. At low luminosities, a L1 trigger
based on requiring rapidity gaps can be used, while at high luminosities, the
use of proton taggers proposed to be placed at 220 m and 420 m from the
interaction point is foreseen.
