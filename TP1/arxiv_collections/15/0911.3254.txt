We investigate an alternative to the Sequential Propagator Method used in
Lattice QCD calculations of semileptonic form factors. We replace the
sequential propagator with a stochastic propagator so that, in principle, all
momentum and sink smearing combinations are available with only a single
spin-color inversion. Practically, the stochastic noise is significant and must
be reduced at the cost of more inversions. We study the behavior of the
stochastic noise and compare the computational costs of this stochastic
technique and the Sequential Propagator Method. We also present preliminary
semileptonic form factor results using the stochastic technique on N_f=2
configurations with a non-perturbatively improved Sheikoleslami-Wohlert action
generated by the QCDSF collaboration. At a fixed cost, measured in terms of the
number of heavy-quark inversions, the method provides more correlators for the
extraction of the form factors at various q^2's than the Sequential Propagator
Method. These additional correlators reduce the total statistical errors of
certain kinematic points, although the stochastic error is still comparable to
the gauge error at other points.
