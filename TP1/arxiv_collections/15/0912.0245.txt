The universal scaling behavior is studied for nonequilibrium transport
through a quantum dot. To describe the dot we use the standard Anderson
impurity model and use the non-equilibrium non-crossing approximation in the
limit of infinite Coulomb repulsion. After solving de hamiltonian, we calculate
the conductance through the system as a function of temperature $T$ and bias
voltage $V$ in the Kondo and in the mixed valent regime. We obtain a good
scaling function in both regimes. In particular, in the mixed valent regime, we
find excellent agreement with recent experiments and previous theoretical
works.
