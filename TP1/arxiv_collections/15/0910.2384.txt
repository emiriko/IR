Magnetic properties of polycrystalline samples of
RuSr$_2$(Gd$_{1.5}$Ce$_{0.5}$)Cu$_{2}$O$_{10-\delta}$, as-prepared (by
solid-state reaction) and annealed (12 hours at 845$^{\circ}$C) in pure oxygen
at different pressure (30, 62 and 78 atm) are presented. Specific heat and
magnetization were investigated in the temperature range 1.8--300 K with a
magnetic field up to 8 T. Specific heat, $C(T)$, shows a jump at the
superconducting transition (with onset at $T\approx 37.5$ K). Below 20 K, a
Schottky-type anomaly becomes apparent in $C(T)$. This low-temperature anomaly
can be attributed to splitting of the ground term ${^8}S_{7/2}$ of paramagnetic
Gd$^{3+}$ ions by internal and external magnetic fields. It is found that
curves $C(T)$ taken for different values of magnetic field have the same
crossing point (at $T_{\ast}\approx 2.7$ K) for all samples studied. At the
same time, $C(H)$ curves taken for different temperatures have a crossing point
at a characteristic field $H_{\ast}\approx 3.7$ T. These effects can be
considered as manifestation of the crossing-point phenomenon which is supposed
to be inherent for strongly correlated electron systems.
