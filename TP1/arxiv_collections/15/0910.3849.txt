We have analysed a number of experimental geometries (two and three-beam
geometry, general systematic row setup, zone axis orientation) for the electron
magnetic circular dichroism measurements (EMCD). The effect of asymmetries in
those setups is described in detail, explaining the advantages of the
three-beam geometry. We observe a complicated thickness and orientation
dependence of the dichroic signal and asymmetries. Therefore we stress the
importance of the simulations, which should accompany the EMCD experiments.
