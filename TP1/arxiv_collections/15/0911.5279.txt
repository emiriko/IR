We show that the duality symmetry of the BFKL equation can be interpreted as
a symmetry under rotation of the BFKL Kernel in the transverse space from
s-channel (color dipole model) to t-channel (reggeized gluon formulation). We
argue that the duality symmetry holds also in the non-forward case due to a
very special structure of the non-forward BFKL Kernel, which can be written as
a sum of three forward BFKL Kernels. The duality symmetry is established by
identifying the dual coordinates with the transverse coordinates of a
non-diagonal dipole scattered off the target.
