The major function of this model is to access the UCI Wisconsin Breast Can-
cer data-set[1] and classify the data items into two categories, which are
normal and anomalous. This kind of classifi cation can be referred as anomaly
detection, which discriminates anomalous behaviour from normal behaviour in
computer systems. One popular solution for anomaly detection is Artifi cial
Immune Sys- tems (AIS). AIS are adaptive systems inspired by theoretical
immunology and observed immune functions, principles and models which are
applied to prob- lem solving. The Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA)[2] is an AIS
algorithm that is developed specifi cally for anomaly detection. It has been
successfully applied to intrusion detection in computer security. It is
believed that agent-based mod- elling is an ideal approach for implementing
AIS, as intelligent agents could be the perfect representations of immune
entities in AIS. This model evaluates the feasibility of re-implementing the
DCA in an agent-based simulation environ- ment called AnyLogic, where the
immune entities in the DCA are represented by intelligent agents. If this model
can be successfully implemented, it makes it possible to implement more
complicated and adaptive AIS models in the agent-based simulation environment.
