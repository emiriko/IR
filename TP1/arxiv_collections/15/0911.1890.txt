Kinematics in Finsler space is investigated. It is showed that the result
based on the kinematics with a special Finsler structure is in good agreement
with the reported value of secular trend in the astronomical unit, $d{\rm
AU}/dt=15\pm4[{\rm m/century}]$. The space deformation parameter $\lambda$ in
this special structure is very small with scale of $10^{-6}$ and should be a
constant. This fact is consistent with the reported value of an anomalous
secular eccentricity variation of the Moon's orbit.
