We report on electronic properties of graphene synthesized by chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) on copper then transferred to SiO2/Si. Wafer-scale (up to 4
inches) graphene films have been synthesized, consisting dominantly of
monolayer graphene as indicated by spectroscopic Raman mapping. Low temperature
transport measurements are performed on micro devices fabricated from such CVD
graphene, displaying ambipolar field effect (with on/off ratio ~5 and carrier
mobilities up to ~3000 cm^2/Vs) and "half-integer" quantum Hall effect, a
hall-mark of intrinsic electronic properties of monolayer graphene. We also
observe weak localization and extract information about phase coherence and
scattering of carriers.
