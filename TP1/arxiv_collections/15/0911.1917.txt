A transition between energy levels at an avoided crossing is known as a
Landau-Zener transition. When a two-level system (TLS) is subject to periodic
driving with sufficiently large amplitude, a sequence of transitions occurs.
The phase accumulated between transitions (commonly known as the Stuckelberg
phase) may result in constructive or destructive interference. Accordingly, the
physical observables of the system exhibit periodic dependence on the various
system parameters. This phenomenon is often referred to as
Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg (LZS) interferometry. Phenomena related to LZS
interferometry occur in a variety of physical systems. In particular, recent
experiments on LZS interferometry in superconducting TLSs (qubits) have
demonstrated the potential for using this kind of interferometry as an
effective tool for obtaining the parameters characterizing the TLS as well as
its interaction with the control fields and with the environment. Furthermore,
strong driving could allow for fast and reliable control of the quantum system.
Here we review recent experimental results on LZS interferometry, and we
present related theory.
