We consider supersymmetric inflation with the hybrid-type potential. In the
absence of the symmetry that forbids Hubble-induced mass terms, the inflaton
mass will be as large as the Hubble scale during inflation. We consider
gravitational decay of the trigger field as the least decay mode and find that
the damping caused by the dissipation can dominate the friction of the inflaton
when the heavy trigger field is coupled to the inflaton. The dissipative
damping provides a solution to the traditional $\eta$ problem without
introducing additional symmetry and interactions. Considering the spatial
inhomogeneities of the dissipative coefficient, we find that modulated
inflation (modulation of the inflaton velocity) can create significant
curvature perturbations.
