From the geocentric, closed world model of Antiquity to the wraparound
universe models of relativistic cosmology, the parallel history of space
representations in science and art illustrates the fundamental role of
geometric imagination in innovative findings. Through the analysis of works of
various artists and scientists like Plato, Durer, Kepler, Escher, Grisey or the
present author, it is shown how the process of creation in science and in the
arts rests on aesthetical principles such as symmetry, regular polyhedra, laws
of harmonic proportion, tessellations, group theory, etc., as well as beauty,
conciseness and emotional approach of the world.
