For a multipartite quantum system of the dimension $d_1\otimes d_2\otimes...
d_n$, $d_1\ge d_2\ge...\ge d_n$, is there an entangled state {\em maximum} in
the sense that all other states in the system can be obtained from the state
through local quantum operations and classical communications (LOCC)? When
$d_1\ge\Pi_{i=2}^n d_i$, such state exists. We show that this condition is also
necessary. Our proof, somewhat surprisingly, uses results from algebraic
complexity theory.
