We investigate the infrared critical exponents of Coulomb gauge Yang-Mills
theory in the limit of very high temperature. This allows us to focus on one
scale (the spatial momentum) since all but the lowest Matsubara frequency
decouple from the deep infrared. From the first-order Dyson-Schwinger equations
in a bare-vertex truncation we obtain infrared exponents which correspond to
confining or overconfining (yet mathematically well-defined) solutions. For
three spatial dimensions the exponents are close to what is expected for a
linearly rising color-Coulomb potential.
