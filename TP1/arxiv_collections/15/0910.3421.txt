V893 Sco is an eclipsing dwarf nova that had attracted little attention from
X-ray astronomers until it was proposed as the identification of an RXTE
all-sky slew survey (XSS) source. Here we report on the pointed X-ray
observations of this object using Suzaku. V893 Sco was in quiescence at the
time, as indicated by the coordinated optical photometry we obtained at the
South African Astronomical Observatory. Our Suzaku data show V893 Sco to be
X-ray bright, with a highly absorbed spectrum. Most importantly, we have
discovered a partial X-ray eclipse in V893 Sco. This is the first time that a
partial eclipse is seen in X-ray light curves of a dwarf nova. Our preliminary
simulations demonstrate that the partial X-ray eclipse can be in principle
reproduced if the white dwarf in V893 Sco is partially eclipsed. Higher quality
observations of this object have the potential to place significant constraints
on the latitudinal extent of the X-ray emission region and thereby
discriminating between an equatorial boundary layer and a spherical corona. The
partial X-ray eclipse therefore makes V893 Sco a key object in understanding
the physics of accretion in quiescent dwarf nova.
