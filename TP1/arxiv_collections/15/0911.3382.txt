Recent proposals for a nontrivial quantization of covariant,
nonrenormalizable, self-interacting, scalar quantum fields have emphasized the
importance of quantum fields that obey affine commutation relations rather than
canonical commutation relations. When formulated on a spacetime lattice, such
models have a lattice version of the associated ground state, and this vector
is used as the fiducial vector for the definition of the associated affine
coherent states, thus ensuring that in the continuum limit, the affine field
operators are compatible with the system Hamiltonian. In this article, we
define and analyze the associated affine coherent states as well as briefly
review the author's approach to nontrivial formulations of such
nonrenormalizable models.
