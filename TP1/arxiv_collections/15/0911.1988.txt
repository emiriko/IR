We present an update of the search for the flavor-changing neutral current B+
-> K+vv decay using 351 x 10^6 BB pairs collected at the Y(4S) resonance with
the BABAR detector at the SLAC PEP-II B factory. Due to the presence of two
neutrinos in the final state, we require the reconstruction of the companion B
in the event through the decay channel B- -> D0l-v. We find 38 candidates in
the data with an expected background of 31 +/- 12. This allows us to set an
upper limit on the branching fraction for B+ -> K+vv of 4.5 x 10^-5 at 90%
confidence level.
