We present the first results from SWARMS (Sloan White dwArf Radial velocity
data Mining Survey), an ongoing project to identify compact white dwarf (WD)
binaries in the spectroscopic catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The
first object identified by SWARMS, SDSS 1257+5428, is a single-lined
spectroscopic binary in a circular orbit with a period of 4.56 hr and a
semiamplitude of 322.7+-6.3 km/s. From the spectrum and photometry, we estimate
a WD mass of 0.92(+0.28,-0.32) Msun. Together with the orbital parameters of
the binary, this implies that the unseen companion must be more massive than
1.62(+0.20,-0.25) Msun, and is in all likelihood either a neutron star or a
black hole. At an estimated distance of 48(+10,-19) pc, this would be the
closest known stellar remnant of a supernova explosion.
