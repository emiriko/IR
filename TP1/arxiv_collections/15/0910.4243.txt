In a recent paper, published at arXiv:0910.2381, we started a discussion on
the new possibilities arising from the use of fractional differential calculus
in image processing. We have seen that the fractional calculation is able to
enhance the quality of images, with interesting possibilities in edge detection
and image restoration. Here, we want to discuss more deeply its role as a tool
for the processing of astronomical images. In particular, the fractional
differentiation can help produce a 'content-matter' based image from a pretty
astronomical image that can be used for more research and scientific purposes,
for instance to reveal faint objects galactic matter, nebulosity, more stars
and planetary surface detail.
