In recent years quantum statistical mechanics have benefited of cultural
interchanges with quantum information science. There is a bulk of evidence that
quantifying the entanglement allows a fine analysis of many relevant properties
of many-body quantum systems. Here we review the relation between entanglement
and the various type of magnetic order occurring in interacting spin systems.
