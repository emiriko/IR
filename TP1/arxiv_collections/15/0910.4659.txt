The BEST wide-angle telescope installed at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence
and operated in remote control from Berlin by the Institut fuer
Planetenforschung, DLR, has observed the CoRoT target fields prior to the
mission. The resulting archive of stellar photometric lightcurves is used to
search for deep transit events announced during CoRoT's alarm-mode to aid in
fast photometric confirmation of these events. The "initial run" field of CoRoT
(IRa01) has been observed with BEST in November and December 2006 for 12
nights. The first "long run" field (LRc01) was observed from June to September
2005 for 35 nights. After standard CCD data reduction, aperture photometry has
been performed using the ISIS image subtraction method. About 30,000
lightcurves were obtained in each field. Transits of the first detected planets
by the CoRoT mission, CoRoT-1b and CoRoT-2b, were found in archived data of the
BEST survey and their lightcurves are presented here. Such detections provide
useful information at the early stage of the organization of follow-up
observations of satellite alarm-mode planet candidates. In addition, no period
change was found over ~4 years between the first BEST observation and last
available transit observations.
