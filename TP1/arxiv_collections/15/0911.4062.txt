Reliable predictions of light charged particle production in spallation
reactions are important to correctly assess gas production in spallation
targets. In particular, the helium production yield is important for assessing
damage in the window separating the accelerator vacuum from a spallation
target, and tritium is a major contributor to the target radioactivity. Up to
now, the models available in the MCNPX transport code, including the widely
used default option Bertini-Dresner and the INCL4.2-ABLA combination of models,
were not able to correctly predict light charged particle yields. The work done
recently on both the intranuclear cascade model INCL4, in which cluster
emission through a coalescence process has been introduced, and on the
de-excitation model ABLA allows correcting these deficiencies. This paper shows
that the coalescence emission plays an important role in the tritium and $^3He$
production and that the combination of the newly developed versions of the
codes, INCL4.5-ABLA07, now lead to good predictions of both helium and tritium
cross sections over a wide incident energy range. Comparisons with other
available models are also presented.
