We study chiral symmetry breaking in the holographic D3-D7 system in a simple
model with an arbitrary running coupling. We derive equations for the D7
embedding and show there is a light pion. In particular we present simple
integral equations, involving just the running coupling and the quark self
energy, for the quark condensate and the pion decay constant. We compare these
to the Pagels-Stokar or constituent quark model equivalent. We discuss the
implications for walking Technicolour theories. We also perform a similar
analysis in the four dimensional field theory whose dual is the
non-supersymmetric D3-D5 system and propose that it represents a walking theory
in which the quark condensate has dimension 2 + sqrt{3}.
