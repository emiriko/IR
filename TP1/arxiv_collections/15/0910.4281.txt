Amorphous solids that underwent a strain in one direction such that they
responded in a plastic manner `remember' that direction also when relaxed back
to a state with zero mean stress. We address the question `what is the order
parameter that is responsible for this memory?' and is therefore the reason for
the different subsequent responses of the material to strains in different
directions. We identify such an order parameter which is readily measurable, we
discuss its trajectory along the stress-strain curve, and propose that it and
its probability distribution function must form a necessary component of a
theory of elasto-plasticity.
