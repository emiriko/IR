Psychological and social systems provide us with a natural domain for the
study of anticipations because these systems are based on and operate in terms
of intentionality. Psychological systems can be expected to contain a model of
themselves and their environments social systems can be strongly anticipatory
and therefore co-construct their environments, for example, in techno-economic
(co-)evolutions. Using Duboi's hyper-incursive and incursive formulations of
the logistic equation, these two types of systems and their couplings can be
simulated. In addition to their structural coupling, psychological and social
systems are also coupled by providing meaning reflexively to each other's
meaning-processing. Luhmann's distinctions among (1) interactions between
intentions at the micro-level, (2) organization at the meso-level, and (3)
self-organization of the fluxes of meaningful communication at the global level
can be modeled and simulated using three hyper-incursive equations. The global
level of self-organizing interactions among fluxes of communication is retained
at the meso-level of organization. In a knowledge-based economy, these two
levels of anticipatory structuration can be expected to propel each other at
the supra-individual level.
