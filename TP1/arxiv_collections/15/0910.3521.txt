We use Halpha and FUV GALEX data for a large sample of nearby objects to
study the high mass star formation activity of normal late-type galaxies. The
data are corrected for dust attenuation using the most accurate techniques at
present available, namely the Balmer decrement and the total far-infrared to
FUV flux ratio. The sample shows a highly dispersed distribution in the Halpha
to FUV flux ratio indicating that two of the most commonly used star formation
tracers give star formation rates with uncertainties up to a factor of 2-3. The
high dispersion is due to the presence of AGN, where the UV and the Halpha
emission can be contaminated by nuclear activity, highly inclined galaxies, for
which the applied extinction corrections are probably inaccurate, or starburst
galaxies, where the stationarity in the star formation history required for
transforming Halpha and UV luminosities into star formation rates is not
satisfied. Excluding these objects we reach an uncertainty of ~50% on the SFR.
The Halpha to FUV flux ratio increases with their total stellar mass. If
limited to normal star forming galaxies, however, this relationship reduces to
a weak trend that might be totally removed using different extinction
correction recipes. In these objects the Halpha to FUV flux ratio seems also
barely related with the FUV-H colour, the H band effective surface brightness,
the total star formation activity and the gas fraction. The data are consistent
with a Kroupa and Salpeter initial mass function in the high mass stellar range
and imply, for a Salpeter IMF, that the variations of the slope cannot exceed
0.25, from g=2.35 for massive galaxies to g=2.60 in low luminosity systems. We
show however that these observed trends, if real, can be due to the different
micro history of star formation in massive galaxies with respect to dwarf.
