We combine density functional theory (DFT) with molecular dynamics
simulations based on an accurate atomistic force field to calculate the
pressure derivative of the melting temperature of magnesium oxide at ambient
pressure - a quantity for which a serious disagreement between theory and
experiment has existed for almost 15 years. We find reasonable agreement with
previous DFT results and with a very recent experimental determination of the
slope. We pay particular attention to areas of possible weakness in theoretical
calculations and conclude that the long-standing discrepancy with experiment
could only be explained by a dramatic failure of existing density functionals
or by flaws in the original experiment.
