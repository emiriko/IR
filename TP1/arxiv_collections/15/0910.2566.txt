We prove that the notions of Krengel entropy and Poisson entropy for
infinite-measure-preserving transformations do not always coincide: We
construct a conservative infinite-measure-preserving transformation with zero
Krengel entropy (the induced transformation on a set of measure 1 is the Von
Neumann-Kakutani odometer), but whose associated Poisson suspension has
positive entropy.
