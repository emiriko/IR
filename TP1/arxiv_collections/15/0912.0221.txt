Light radioactive nuclei play an important role in many astrophysical
environments. Due to very low cross sections of some neutron and proton capture
reactions by these radioactive nuclei at energies of astrophysical interest,
direct laboratory measurements are very difficult. For radioactive nuclei such
as 8Li and 8B, the direct measurement of neutron capture reactions is
impossible. Indirect methods have been applied to overcome these difficulties.
In this work we will report on the results and discussion of phenomenological
potential models used to determine some proton and neutron capture reactions.
As a test we show the results for the 16O(p,g)17F_gs(5/2+) and
16O(p,g)17F_ex(1/2+) capture reactions.We also computed the nucleosynthesis
cross sections for the 7Li(n,g)8Li, 8Li(n,g)9Li and 8B(p,g)9C capture
reactions.
