We discuss how the finiteness of the system created in a heavy-ion collision
affects possible signatures of the QCD critical endpoint. We show sizable
results for the modifications of the chiral phase diagram at volume scales
typically encountered in current heavy-ion collisions and address the
applicability of finite-size scaling as a tool in the experimental search for
the critical endpoint.
