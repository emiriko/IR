We prove that the restriction of any nontrivial representation of the Ree
groups $^2F_{4}(q), q=2^{2n+1}\geq8$ in odd characteristic to any proper
subgroup is reducible. We also determine all triples $(K, V, H)$ such that $K
\in \{^2F_4(2), ^2F_4(2)'\}$, $H$ is a proper subgroup of $K$, and $V$ is a
representation of $K$ in odd characteristic restricting absolutely irreducibly
to $H$.
