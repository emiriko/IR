I outline motivations for believing that important quantum gravity effects
lie beyond the Planck scale at both higher energies and longer distances and
times. These motivations arise in part from the study of ultra-high energy
scattering, and also from considerations in cosmology. I briefly summarize some
inferences about such ultra-planckian physics, and clues we might pursue
towards the principles of a more fundamental theory addressing the known
puzzles and paradoxes of quantum gravity.
