Several conceptual points concerning the inclusion of the $\Delta$(1232)
resonance in the framework of chiral effective-field theory are discussed, with
an emphasis on the problem of power counting in the baryon sector in general. I
also formulate a new dispersion relation in the pion-mass squared (or, the
quark mass) and make a link between the power counting and the analytic
properties of chiral expansion. A controversy regarding the determination of
the proton's magnetic polarizability from Compton-scattering data is stressed
here as well.
