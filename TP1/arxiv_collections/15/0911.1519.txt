On the basis of the exact relations the general formula for the static
dielectric permittivity for Coulomb system is found in the region of small wave
vectors. The obtained formula describes the dielectric function of the Coulomb
system in both limits: in the "metallic" state and in the "dielectric" one. On
this basis the determinations of the "apparent" dielectric and the "apparent"
radius of screening are introduced. In the random phase approximation (RPA) the
exact relations for the function dielectric function of the electron gas in the
long-wavelength region of the wave vectors are found for an arbitrary
degeneration of the particles.
