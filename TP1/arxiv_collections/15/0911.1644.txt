By constructing a coupling with unbounded time-dependent drift,
dimension-free Harnack inequalities are established for a large class of
stochastic differential equations with multiplicative noise. These inequalities
are applied to the study of heat kernel upper bound and contractivity
properties of the semigroup. The main results are also extended to reflecting
diffusion processes on Riemannian manifolds with nonconvex boundary.
