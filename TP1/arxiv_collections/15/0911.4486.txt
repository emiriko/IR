The possibility is investigated that competition between fluctuations at
different symmetry-related ordering wave vectors may affect the quantum phase
transition between a fermi liquid and a longitudinal spin density wave state,
in particular giving rise to an intermediate 'nematic' state with broken
rotational symmetry but unbroken translational symmetry. At the marginal
dimension the nematic transition is found to be preempted by a first order
transition but a weak symmetry breaking field restores a second order magnetic
transition with an intermediate regime in which correlations substantially
enhance the broken rotational symmetry. Comparison to recent experiments is
made.
