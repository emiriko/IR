Based on the generalized principle of relativity and the ensuing symmetry, we
have shown that there are only two possible types of transformations between
uniformly accelerated systems. The first allowable type of transformation holds
if and only if the Clock Hypothesis is true. If the Clock Hypothesis is not
true, the transformation is of Lorentz-type and implies the existence of a
universal maximal acceleration $a_m$.
  We present an extension of relativistic dynamics for which all admissible
solutions will have have a speed bounded by the speed of light $c$ and the
acceleration bounded by $a_m$. An additional Doppler type shift for an
accelerated source is predicted. The formulas for such shift are the same as
for the usual Doppler shift with $v/c$ replaced by $a/a_m$.
  The W. K\"{u}ndig experiment of measurement of the transverse Doppler shift
in an accelerated system was also exposed to a longtitudal shift due to the
acceleration. This experiment, as reanalyzed by Kholmetskii et al, shows that
the Clock Hypothesis is not valid. Based on the results of this experiment, we
predict that the value of the maximal acceleration $a_m$ is of the order
$10^{19}m/s^2$. Moreover, our analysis provides a way to measure experimentally
the maximal acceleration with existing technology.
