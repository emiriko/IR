The processes, resulting in the transcription of RNA, are intrinsically
noisy. It was observed experimentally that the synthesis of mRNA molecules is
driven by short, burst-like, events. An accurate prediction of the protein
level often requires one to take these fluctuations into account. Here, we
consider the stochastic model of gene expression regulated by small RNAs. Small
RNA post-transcriptional regulation is achieved by base-pairing with mRNA. We
show that in a strong pairing limit the mRNA steady state distribution can be
determined exactly. The obtained analytical results reveal large discrepancies
in the deterministic description, due to transcriptional bursting. The proposed
approach is expected to work for a large variety of multi-species models.
