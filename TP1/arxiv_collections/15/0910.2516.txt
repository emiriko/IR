Recently, we introduced a quantity, "node weight", to describe the
collaboration sharing or competition gain of the elements in the
collaboration-competition networks, which can be well described by bipartite
graphs. We find that the node weight distributions of all the networks follow
the so-called "shifted power law (SPL)". The common distribution function may
indicate that the evolution of the collaboration and competition in very
different systems obeys a general rule. In order to set up a base of the
further investigations on the universal system evolution dynamics, we now
present the definition of the networks and their node weights, the node weight
distributions, as well as the evolution durations of 15 real world
collaboration-competition systems which are belonging to diverse fields.
