We report measurements and analyses of resistivity, thermopower and Hall
coefficient of single-crystalline samples of the layered Rh oxide K_0.49RhO_2.
The resistivity is proportional to the square of temperature up to 300 K, and
the thermopower is proportional to temperature up to 140 K. The Hall
coefficient increases linearly with temperature above 100 K, which is ascribed
to the triangular network of Rh in this compound. The different transport
properties between Na_xCoO_2 and K_0.49RhO_2 are discussed on the basis of the
different band width between Co and Rh evaluated from the magnetotransport.
