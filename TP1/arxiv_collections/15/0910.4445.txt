We study the effects of varying the pre-implant film thickness and implant
temperature on the electrical and superconducting properties of metal-mixed
ion-implanted polymers. We show that it is possible to drive a
superconductor-insulator transition in these materials via control of the
fabrication parameters. We observe peaks in the magnetoresistance and
demonstrate that these are caused by the interplay between superconductivity
and weak localization in these films, which occurs due to their granular
structure. We compare these magnetoresistance peaks with those seen in
unimplanted films and other organic superconductors, and show that they are
distinctly different.
