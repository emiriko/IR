Various soliton-obstruction systems have been studied from analytical
perspective. We have used collective coordinate to approach the dynamics of
solitons as they meet a potential obstruction in a form of square barriers and
holes for three models in (1+1) dimensions, namely: $\lambda\phi^{4}$ model,
deformed Sine-Gordon model, and a model that give rise to Q-ball solution. We
have shown that our approximated field solution is valid enough to describe the
behaviour of solitons scattering off a potential obstruction.
