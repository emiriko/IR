The theory is presented of surface wave excitation by a fast moving charged
particle in a thin uniform metal film surrounded by a dielectric medium. It is
shown that the Vavilov-Cherenkov like effect for the sufface waves could arise
for particles whose velocities are ten- and even hundred-times lower than the
corresponding velocities in a uniform medium.
