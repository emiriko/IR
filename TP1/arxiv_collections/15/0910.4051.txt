We investigate the BCS pairing in a mixture of fermionic polar molecules with
two different hyperfine states. We derive a set of coupled gap equations and
find that this system supports both spin-singlet and -triplet BCS pairs. We
also calculate the critical temperatures and the angular dependence of order
parameters. In addition, by tuning short-range interaction between
inter-species molecules, the transition between singlet and triplet paired
states may be realized.
