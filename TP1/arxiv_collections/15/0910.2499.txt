A closer look at some proposed Gedanken-experiments on BECs promises to shed
light on several aspects of reduction and emergence in physics. These include
the relations between classical descriptions and different quantum treatments
of macroscopic systems, and the emergence of new properties and even new
objects as a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking.
