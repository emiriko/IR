We develop a technique for single qubit quantum state tomography using the
mathematical setup of generalized quantization scheme for games. In our
technique Alice sends an unknown pure quantum state to Bob who appends it with
|0><0| and then applies the unitary operators on the appended quantum state and
finds the payoffs for Alice and himself. It is shown that for a particular set
of unitary operators these elements become equal to Stokes parameters for an
unknown quantum state. In this way an unknown quantum state can be measured and
reconstructed. Strictly speaking this technique is not a game as no strategic
competitions are involved.
