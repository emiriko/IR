Trust plays an important role in making collaborative decisions about service
evaluation and service selection in pervasive computing. Context is a
fundamental concept in pervasive systems, which is based on the interpretation
of environment and systems. The dynamic nature of context can strongly affect
trust management and service selection. In this paper, we present a
context-based trust management model for pervasive computing systems. The
concept of context is considered in basic components of the model such as trust
computation module, recommender assessment module, transaction management
module, and request responder. In order to measure a predicted trustworthiness
according to the fuzzy nature of trust in pervasive environments, fuzzy
concepts are integrated in the proposed model.
