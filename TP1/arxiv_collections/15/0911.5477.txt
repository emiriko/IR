We analyze the entanglement spectrum of Laughlin states on the torus and show
that it is arranged in towers, each of which is generated by modes of two
spatially separated chiral edges. This structure is present for all torus
circumferences, which allows for a microscopic identification of the prominent
features of the spectrum by perturbing around the thin torus limit.
