Data collected around sqrt{s}=91 GeV by the OPAL experiment at the LEP e+e-
collider are used to study the mechanism of baryon formation. As the signature,
the fraction of Sigma-hyperons whose baryon number is compensated by the
production of a Sigma-, Lambda or Xi- antihyperon is determined. The method
relies entirely on quantum number correlations of the baryons, and not rapidity
correlations, making it more model independent than previous studies. The
diquark fragmentation model without the popcorn mechanism is strongly
disfavored with a significance of 3.8 standard deviations including systematic
uncertainties. It is shown that previous studies of the popcorn mechanism are
not conclusive if parameter uncertainties are considered.
