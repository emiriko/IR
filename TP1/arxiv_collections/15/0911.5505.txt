Let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over a number field $K$, the number of
torsion points rational over a finite extension $L$ is bounded polynomially in
terms of the degree $[L:K]$. When $A$ is isogenous to a product of simple
abelian varieties of $\GSp$ type, i.e. whose Mumford-Tate group is "generic"
(isomorphic to the group of symplectic similitudes) and which satisfy the
Mumford-Tate conjecture, we compute the optimal exponent for this bound in
terms of the dimensions of the abelian subvarieties of $A$. The result is
unconditional for a product of simple abelian varieties with endomorphism ring
$\Z$ and dimension outside an explicit exceptional set
$\mathcal{S}=\{4,10,16,32,...\}$. Furthermore, following a strategy of Serre,
we also prove that if the Mumford-Tate conjecture is true for some abelian
varieties of $\GSp$ type, it is then true for a product of such abelian
varieties.
