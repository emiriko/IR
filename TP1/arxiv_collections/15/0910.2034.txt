In this paper we adapt online estimation strategies to perform model-based
clustering on large networks. Our work focuses on two algorithms, the first
based on the SAEM algorithm, and the second on variational methods. These two
strategies are compared with existing approaches on simulated and real data. We
use the method to decipher the connexion structure of the political websphere
during the US political campaign in 2008. We show that our online EM-based
algorithms offer a good trade-off between precision and speed, when estimating
parameters for mixture distributions in the context of random graphs.
