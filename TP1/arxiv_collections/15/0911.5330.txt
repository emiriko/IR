We analyze the molecular dynamics heterogeneity of the liquid crystal
4-n-octyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl nanoconfined in porous silicon. We show that the
temperature dependence of the dynamic correlation length ?wall, which measures
the distance over which a memory of the interfacial slowing down of the
molecular dynamics persists, is closely related to the growth of the
short-range static order arising from quenched random fields. More generally,
this result may also shed some light on the connection between static and
dynamic heterogeneities in a wide class of condensed and soft matter systems.
