The purpose of our work is to extend the formulation of classical affine Toda
Models in the presence of jump defects to pure fermionic Thirring model. As a
first attempt we construct the Lagrangian of the Grassmanian Thirring model
with jump defect (of Backlund type) and present its conserved modified momentum
and energy expressions giving a first indication of its integrability.
