The $(\pi,\pi)$ shadow band (SB) in La-based cuprate family (La214) was
studied by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) over a wide doping
range from $x=0.01$ to $x=0.25$. Unlike the well-studied case of the Bi-based
cuprate family, an overall strong, monotonic doping dependence of the SB
intensity at the Fermi level ($E_F$) was observed. In contrast to a previous
report for the presence of the SB only close to $x=1/8$, we found it exists in
a wide doping range, associated with a doping-independent $(\pi,\pi)$ wave
vector but strongly doping-dependent intensity: It is the strongest at $x\sim
0.03$ and systematically diminishes as the doping increases until it becomes
negligible in the overdoped regime. This SB with the observed doping dependence
of intensity can in principle be caused by the antiferromagnetic fluctuations
or a particular form of low-temperature orthorhombic lattice distortion known
to persist up to $x\sim 0.21$ in the system, with both being weakened with
increasing doping. However, a detailed binding energy dependent analysis of the
SB at $x=0.07$ does not appear to support the former interpretation, leaving
the latter as a more plausible candidate, despite a challenge in quantitatively
linking the doping dependences of the SB intensity and the magnitude of the
lattice distortion. Our finding highlights the necessity of a careful and
global consideration of the inherent structural complications for correctly
understanding the cuprate Fermiology and its microscopic implication.
