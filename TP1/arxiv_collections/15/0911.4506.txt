We describe the realization of a 5 km free space coherent optical link
through the turbulent atmosphere between a telescope and a ground target. We
present the phase noise of the link, limited mainly by atmospheric turbulence
and mechanical vibrations of the telescope and the target. We discuss the
implications of our results for applications, with particular emphasis on
optical Doppler ranging to satellites and long distance frequency transfer.
