We present a comprehensive investigation of nonideal continuous-variable
quantum teleportation implemented with entangled non-Gaussian resources. We
discuss in a unified framework the main decoherence mechanisms, including
imperfect Bell measurements and propagation of optical fields in lossy fibers,
applying the formalism of the characteristic function. By exploiting
appropriate displacement strategies, we compute analytically the success
probability of teleportation for input coherent states, and two classes of
non-Gaussian entangled resources: Two-mode squeezed Bell-like states (that
include as particular cases photon-added and photon-subtracted de-Gaussified
states), and two-mode squeezed cat-like states. We discuss the optimization
procedure on the free parameters of the non-Gaussian resources at fixed values
of the squeezing and of the experimental quantities determining the
inefficiencies of the non-ideal protocol. It is found that non-Gaussian
resources enhance significantly the efficiency of teleportation and are more
robust against decoherence than the corresponding Gaussian ones. Partial
information on the alphabet of input states allows further significant
improvement in the performance of the non-ideal teleportation protocol.
