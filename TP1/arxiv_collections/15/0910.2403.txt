In most fluid models the generation mechanism and the magnetide of anomalous
transport are usually treated as auxiliary terms external to the model
description and are free to manipulate, the anomalous transport is indeed a
noticeably self-generated effect exhibited in a multi-fluid system. Comparing
the current relaxation levels with kinetic Vlasov simulation of the same
initial setups, it's found that there is a higher anomalous transport in the
multi-fluid plasma, i.e. a stronger current reduction in the multi-fluid
simulation than in the kinetic Vlasov simulation for the same setup. To isolate
the mechanism that causes the different anomalous transport levels, we hence
investigated the detailed wave-particle interaction by using spectrum analysis
of the generated waves, combined with a spatial-averaged distributions at
different instants. It shows that the Landau damping in kinetic simulation
takes a role that stablizes the plasma-drifting system, when the bulk veliocity
of electron drifts drop beneath the phase velocity of waves. The current
relaxation process stops while the relative drift velocity between electrons is
still high.
