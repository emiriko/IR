In this paper we describe the implementation of the SM process
$\gamma\gamma\to\gamma\gamma$ through a fermion and boson loops into the
framework of SANC system. The computations of this process takes into account
non-zero mass of loop particles. We briefly describe additional precomputation
modules used for calculation of massive box diagrams. We present the covariant
and helicity amplitudes for this process, some particular cases of $D_0$ and
$C_0$ Passarino--Veltman functions and also numerical results of corresponding
SANC module evaluation. Whenever possible, we compare the results with those
existing in the literature.
