We investigate effects of cluster particle correlations on two- and
three-particle azimuth correlator observables sensitive to local strong parity
violation. We use two-particle angular correlation measurements as input and
estimate the magnitudes of the effects with straightforward assumptions. We
found that the measurements of the azimuth correlator observables by the STAR
experiment can be entirely accounted for by cluster particle correlations
together with a reasonable range of cluster anisotropy in non-peripheral
collisions. Our result suggests that new physics, such as local strong parity
violation, may not be required to explain the correlator data.
