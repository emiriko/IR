Using non-local chiral quark model and currents satisfying Ward-Takahashi
identities we analyze Distribution Amplitudes (DA) of photon and pion-to-photon
Transition Distribution Amplitudes (TDA) in the low energy regime. Photon DA's
are calculated analytically up to twist-4 and reveal several interesting
features of photon structure. TDA's calculated in the present model satisfy
polynomiality condition. Normalization of vector TDA is fixed by the axial
anomaly. We also compute relevant form factors and compare them with existing
data. Axial form factor turns out to be much lower then the vector one, what
indeed is seen in the experimental data.
