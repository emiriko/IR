When it is oxidized, graphite can be easily exfoliated forming graphene oxide
(GO). GO is a critical intermediate for massive production of graphene, and it
is also an important material with various application potentials. With many
different oxidation species randomly distributed on the basal plane, GO has a
complicated nonstoichiometric atomic structure that is still not well
understood in spite of of intensive studies involving many experimental
techniques. Controversies often exist in experimental data interpretation. We
report here a first principles study on binding energy of carbon 1s orbital in
GO. The calculated results can be well used to interpret experimental X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data and provide a unified spectral
assignment. Based on the first principles understanding of XPS, a GO structure
model containing new oxidation species epoxy pair and epoxy-hydroxy pair is
proposed. Our results demonstrate that first principles computational
spectroscopy provides a powerful means to investigate GO structure.
