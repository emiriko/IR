The recently established universal uncertainty principle revealed that two
nowhere commuting observables can be measured simultaneously in some state,
whereas they have no joint probability distribution in any state. Thus, one
measuring apparatus can simultaneously measure two observables that have no
simultaneous reality. In order to reconcile this discrepancy, an approach based
on quantum logic is proposed to establish the relation between quantum reality
and measurement. We provide a language speaking of values of observables
independent of measurement based on quantum logic and we construct in this
language the state-dependent notions of joint determinateness, value identity,
and simultaneous measurability. This naturally provides a contextual
interpretation, in which we can safely claim such a statement that one
measuring apparatus measures one observable in one context and simultaneously
it measures another nowhere commuting observable in another incompatible
context.
