The study of Galactic orbits in the last eighty years has been dominated by
statistical assumptions made because of the lack of empirical evidence
available in the early 20th century. Using evidence from Hipparcos and recent
radial velocity surveys, Francis and Anderson recently showed that spiral
structure is primarily a consequence of gravitational alignments of stellar
orbits. I review the mechanism which creates spiral structure, consider the
validity of widely held assumptions in galactic dynamics and the implications
to notions such as the asymmetric drift and disc heating. I identify a number
of fundamental mathematical and physical errors in Lindblad's epicycle theory
and in density wave theory. Students should be made aware that these ideas can
no longer be considered as science, and authors of textbooks should consider
whether they merit anything more than a historical note.
