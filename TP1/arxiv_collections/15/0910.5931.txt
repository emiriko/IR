The paper generalizes the structure of gravitational waves from orbiting
spinning binaries under leading order spin-orbit coupling, as given in the work
by K\"onigsd\"orffer and Gopakumar [PRD 71, 024039 (2005)] for single-spin and
equal-mass binaries, to unequal-mass binaries and arbitrary spin
configurations. The orbital motion is taken to be quasi-circular and the
fractional mass difference is assumed to be small against one. The emitted
gravitational waveforms are given in analytic form.
