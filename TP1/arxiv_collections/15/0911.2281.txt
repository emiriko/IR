We present results from ab initio No-Core Full Configuration simulations of
the exotic proton-rich nucleus $^{14}$F whose first experimental observation is
expected soon. The calculations with JISP16 NN interaction are performed up to
the $N_{\max}=8$ basis space. The binding energy is evaluated using an
extrapolation technique. This technique is generalized to excitation energies,
verified in calculations of $^6$Li and applied to $^{14}$B, the $^{14}$F
mirror, for which some data are available.
