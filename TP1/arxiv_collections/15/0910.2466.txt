We propose a new heating mechanism in magnetar crusts. Magnetars' crustal
magnetic fields are much stronger than their surface fields; therefore,
magnetic pressure partially supports the crust against gravity. The crust loses
magnetic pressure support as the field decays and must compensate by increasing
the electron degeneracy pressure; the accompanying increase in the electron
Fermi energy induces nonequilibrium, exothermic electron captures. The total
heat released via field-decay electron captures is comparable to the total
magnetic energy in the crust. Thus, field-decay electron captures are an
important, if not the primary, mechanism powering magnetars' soft X-ray
emission.
