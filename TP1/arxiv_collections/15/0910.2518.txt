We report the observation of the quantized Hall effect in suspended graphene
probed with a two-terminal lead geometry. The failure of earlier Hall-bar
measurements is discussed and attributed to the placement of voltage probes in
mesoscopic samples. New quantized states are found at integer Landau level
fillings outside the sequence 2,6,10.., as well as at a fractional filling
\nu=1/3. Their presence is revealed by plateaus in the two-terminal conductance
which appear in magnetic fields as low as 2 Tesla at low temperatures and
persist up to 20 Kelvin in 12 Tesla. The excitation gaps, extracted from the
data with the help of a theoretical model, are found to be significantly larger
than in GaAs based electron systems.
