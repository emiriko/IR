We present some of our research activities dedicated to doped silica-based
optical fibers, aiming at understanding the spectral properties of luminescent
ions, such as rare-earth and transition metal elements. The influence of the
local environment on dopants is extensively studied: energy transfer mechanisms
between rare-earth ions, control of the valence state of chromium ions, effect
of the local phonon energy on thulium ions emission efficiency, and broadening
of erbium ions emission induced by oxide nanoparticles. Knowledge of these
effects is essential for photonics applications.
