The implication of primordial magnetic-field-induced structure formation for
the HI signal from the epoch of reionization is studied. Using semi-analytic
models, we compute both the density and ionization inhomogeneities in this
scenario. We show that: (a) The global HI signal can only be seen in emission,
unlike in the standard $\Lambda$CDM models, (b) the density perturbations
induced by primordial fields, leave distinctive signatures of the magnetic
field Jeans' length on the HI two-point correlation function, (c) the length
scale of ionization inhomogeneities is $\la 1 \rm Mpc$. We find that the peak
expected signal (two-point correlation function) is $\simeq 10^{-4} \rm K^2$ in
the range of scales $0.5\hbox{-}3 \rm Mpc$ for magnetic field strength in the
range $5 \times 10^{-10} \hbox{-}3 \times 10^{-9} \rm G$. We also discuss the
detectability of the HI signal. The angular resolution of the on-going and
planned radio interferometers allows one to probe only the largest magnetic
field strengths that we consider. They have the sensitivity to detect the
magnetic field-induced features. We show that thefuture SKA has both the
angular resolution and the sensitivity to detect the magnetic field-induced
signal in the entire range of magnetic field values we consider, in an
integration time of one week.
