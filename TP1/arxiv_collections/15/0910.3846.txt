Planar CdBxF2-x - p-CdF2 - CdBxF2-x sandwich nanostructures prepared on the
surface of the n-type CdF2 bulk crystal are studied to register the spin
transistor and quantum spin Hall effects. The current-voltage characteristics
of the ultra-shallow p+-n junctions verify the CdF2 gap, 7.8 eV, and the
quantum subbands of the 2D holes in the p-type CdF2 quantum well confined by
the CdBxF2-x delta-barriers. The temperature and magnetic field dependencies of
the resistance, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility demonstrate the high
temperature superconductor properties for the CdBxF2-x delta-barriers. The
value of the superconductor energy gap, 102.06 meV, determined by the tunneling
spectroscopy method appears to be in a good agreement with the relationship
between the zero-resistance supercurrent in superconductor state and the
conductance in normal state at the energies of the 2D hole subbands. The
results obtained are evidence of the important role of the multiple Andreev
reflections in the creation of the high spin polarization of the 2D holes in
the edged channels of the sandwich device. The high spin hole polarization in
the edged channels is shown to identify the mechanism of the spin transistor
and quantum spin Hall effects induced by varying the top gate voltage, which is
revealed by the first observation of the Hall quantum conductance staircase.
