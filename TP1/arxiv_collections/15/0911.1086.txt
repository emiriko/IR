We present a cursory overview of chameleon models of dark energy and their
laboratory tests with an emphasis on optical and Casimir experiments. Optical
experiments measuring the ellipticity of an initially polarised laser beam are
sensitive to the coupling of chameleons to photons. The next generation of
Casimir experiments may be able to unravel the nature of the scalar force
mediated by the chameleon between parallel plates.
