We present measurements of the top quark mass using the \mT2, a variable
related to the transverse mass in events with two missing particles. We use the
template method applied to t\tbar dilepton events produced in p\pbar collisions
at Fermilab's Tevatron and collected by the CDF detector. From a data sample
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.4 \invfb, we select 236 t\tbar
candidate events. Using the \mT2 distribution, we measure the top quark mass to
be M_{Top} = 168.0^{+4.8}_{-4.0} $\pm$ {2.9} GeV/c^{2}. By combining the \mT2
with the reconstructed top mass distributions based on a neutrino weighting
method, we measure M_{top}=169.3 $\pm$ 2.7 $\pm$ 3.2 GeV/c^{2}. This is the
first application of the \mT2 variable in a mass measurement at a hadron
collider.
