The Terrestrial Planet Finder Coronagraph (TPF-C) mission presented here is
an existence proof for a flagship-class internal coronagraph space mission
capable of detecting and characterizing Earth-like planets and planetary
systems at visible wavelengths around nearby stars, using an existing launch
vehicle. TPF-C will use spectroscopy to measure key properties of exoplanets
including the presence of atmospheric water or oxygen, powerful signatures in
the search for habitable worlds.
