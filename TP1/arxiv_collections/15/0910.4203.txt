We study the spatio-temporal pattern of the near-field intensity correlations
generated by parametric scattering processes in a planar optical cavity. A
generalized Bogolubov-de Gennes model is used to compute the second order field
correlation function. Analytic approximations are developed to understand the
numerical results in the different regimes. The correlation pattern is found to
be robust against a realistic disorder for state-of-the-art semiconductor
systems.
