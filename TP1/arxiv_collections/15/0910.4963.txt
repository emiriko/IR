We present some new exact results for general four-dimensional superconformal
field theories. We derive differential equations governing the coupling
constant dependence of chiral primary correlators. For N=2 theories we show
that the Zamolodchikov metric on the moduli space and the operator mixing of
chiral primaries are quasi-topological quantities and constrained by
holomorphy. The equations that we find are the four-dimensional analogue of the
tt* equations in two-dimensions, discovered by the method of "topological
anti-topological fusion" by Cecotti and Vafa. Our analysis relies on conformal
perturbation theory and the superconformal Ward identities and does not use a
topological twist.
