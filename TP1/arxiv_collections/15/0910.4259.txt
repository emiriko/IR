In this paper parametric formulas are presented to evaluate the flux of
atmospheric muons in the range of vertical depth between 1.5 to 5 km of water
equivalent (km w.e.) and up to 85^o for the zenith angle. We take into account
their arrival in bundles with different muon multiplicities. The energy of
muons inside bundles is then computed considering the muon distance from the
bundle axis. This parameterisation relies on a full Monte Carlo simulation of
primary Cosmic Ray (CR) interactions, shower propagation in the atmosphere and
muon transport in deep water [1]. The primary CR flux and interaction models,
in the range in which they can produce muons which may reach 1.5 km w.e.,
suffer from large experimental uncertainties. We used a primary CR flux and an
interaction model able to correctly reproduce the flux, the multiplicity
distribution, the spatial distance between muons as measured by the underground
MACRO experiment.
