We report optical spectroscopy and high speed photometry and polarimetry of
the INTEGRAL source IGRJ14536-5522 (=Swift J1453.4-5524). The photometry,
polarimetry and spectroscopy are modulated on an orbital period of 3.1564(1)
hours. Orbital circularly polarized modulations are seen from 0 to -18 per
cent, unambiguously identifying IGRJ14536-5522 as a polar.
  Some of the high speed photometric data show modulations that are consistent
with quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) on the order of 5-6 minutes.
Furthermore, for the first time, we detect the (5-6) minute QPOs in the
circular polarimetry. We discuss the possible origins of these QPOs. We also
include details of HIPPO, a new high-speed photo-polarimeter used for some of
our observations.
