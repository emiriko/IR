A new approach for calculations of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in
molecules and crystals is proposed. It is based on the exact perturbation
expansion of total energy of weak ferromagnets in the canting angle with the
only assumption of local Hubbard-type interactions. This scheme leads to a
simple and transparent analytical expression for Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector
with a natural separation into spin and orbital contributions. The main problem
was transferred to calculations of effective tight-binding parameters in the
properly chosen basis including spin-orbit coupling. Test calculations for
La$_2$CuO$_4$ give the value of canting angle in a good agreement with
experimental data.
