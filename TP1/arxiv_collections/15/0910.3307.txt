The details of the calculation of the two-boson exchange effects in the
parity-violating elastic $ep$ scattering within a simple hadronic model,
including both the nucleon and $\Delta(1232)$-resonance intermediate states,
are presented. We examine the sensitivity of our results with respect to choice
of form factors. We emphasize the importance to use correct relations relating
N to $\Delta$ and $\Delta$ to N transition vertex functions. The $N\Delta$
Coulomb quadrupole transition is found to play important role at higher
$Q^2\geq 3.0$ GeV$^2$. We also elucidate the relation between our results and
the well-known result on the $\gamma ZE$ effect given by Marciano and Sirlin
(MS). The effect of the nucleon contribution $\delta_N$ to parity-asymmetry
$A_{PV}$, is found to be in general, larger than the corresponding $\Delta$
contribution $\delta_\Delta$ except at extreme forward angles. The corrections
to the extracted values of the strange form factors $G^{s}_{E}+\beta G^{s}_{M}$
from the HAPPEX, A4, and G0 data are also presented. The total TBE corrections
to the extracted values of $G^{s}_{E}+\beta G^{s}_{M}$ in recent experiments of
HAPPEX G0, and A4 are, depending on kinematics, found to be small except in a
few cases where they range from -20.6% to $48.3 %$.
