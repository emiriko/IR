We examine deep XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) observations
of the X-ray luminous galaxy cluster A1835. For the first time in a galaxy
cluster we place direct limits on turbulent broadening of the emission lines.
This is possible because the coolest X-ray emitting gas in the cluster, which
is responsible for the lines, occupies a small region within the core. The most
conservative determination of the 90 per cent upper limit on line-of-sight,
non-thermal, velocity broadening is 274 km/s, measured from the emission lines
originating within 30 kpc radius. The ratio of turbulent to thermal energy
density in the core is therefore less than 13 per cent. There are no emission
lines in the spectrum showing evidence for gas below ~3.5 keV. We examine the
quantity of gas as a function of temperature and place a limit of 140 Msun/yr
(90 per cent) for gas cooling radiatively below 3.85 keV.
