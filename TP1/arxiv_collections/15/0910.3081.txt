The ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider, CERN has been under
construction for more than a decade. It is now largely complete and functional.
This paper will describe the state of the major subsystems of ATLAS. Results
from the brief single beam running period in 2008 will be shown. In addition,
results from a long period of cosmic ray running will be shown. These results
show that ATLAS is prepared to make major new physics discoveries as soon as we
get colliding beams in late 2009.
