We report the effects of quark-hadron phase transition on the structures of
general relativistic stars with purely toroidal magnetic field. For the mixed
phase, we take into account of the finite-size effects, which lead to
non-uniform "Pasta" structures. Our study is based on axisymetric and
stationary formalism including purely toroidal magnetic field. For hybrid
stars, we find the characteristic distribution of magnetic field, which has a
discontinuity originated in the quark-hadron mixed phase. These distributions
of magnetic field will change astrophysical phenomena, such as cooling
processes.
