We describe the design, performance, sensitivity and results of our recent
experiments using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) for lunar
Cherenkov observations with a very wide (600 MHz) bandwidth and nanosecond
timing, including a limit on an isotropic neutrino flux. We also make a first
estimate of the effects of small-scale surface roughness on the effective
experimental aperture, finding that contrary to expectations, such roughness
will act to increase the detectability of near-surface events over the neutrino
energy-range at which our experiment is most sensitive (though distortions to
the time-domain pulse profile may make identification more difficult). The aim
of our "Lunar UHE Neutrino Astrophysics using the Square Kilometer Array"
(LUNASKA) project is to develop the lunar Cherenkov technique of using
terrestrial radio telescope arrays for ultra-high energy (UHE) cosmic ray (CR)
and neutrino detection, and in particular to prepare for using the Square
Kilometer Array (SKA) and its path-finders such as the Australian SKA
Pathfinder (ASKAP) and the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) for lunar Cherenkov
experiments.
