Protein translation is a multistep process which can be represented as a
cascade of biochemical reactions (initiation, ribosome assembly, elongation,
etc.), the rate of which can be regulated by small non-coding microRNAs through
multiple mechanisms. It remains unclear what mechanisms of microRNA action are
most dominant: moreover, many experimental reports deliver controversal
messages on what is the concrete mechanism actually observed in the experiment.
Parker and Nissan (Parker and Nissan, RNA, 2008) demonstrated that it is
impossible to distinguish alternative biological hypotheses using the steady
state data on the rate of protein synthesis. For their analysis they used two
simple kinetic models of protein translation. In contrary, we show that
dynamical data allow to discriminate some of the mechanisms of microRNA action.
We demonstrate this using the same models as in (Parker and Nissan, RNA, 2008)
for the sake of comparison but the methods developed (asymptotology of
biochemical networks) can be used for other models. As one of the results of
our analysis, we formulate a hypothesis that the effect of microRNA action is
measurable and observable only if it affects the dominant system
(generalization of the limiting step notion for complex networks) of the
protein translation machinery. The dominant system can vary in different
experimental conditions that can partially explain the existing controversy of
some of the experimental data.
