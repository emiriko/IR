In this paper we describe a WSD experiment based on bilingual English-Spanish
comparable corpora in which individual noun phrases have been identified and
aligned with their respective counterparts in the other language. The
evaluation of the experiment has been carried out against SemCor.
  We show that, with the alignment algorithm employed, potential precision is
high (74.3%), however the coverage of the method is low (2.7%), due to
alignments being far less frequent than we expected.
  Contrary to our intuition, precision does not rise consistently with the
number of alignments. The coverage is low due to several factors; there are
important domain differences, and English and Spanish are too close languages
for this approach to be able to discriminate efficiently between senses,
rendering it unsuitable for WSD, although the method may prove more productive
in machine translation.
