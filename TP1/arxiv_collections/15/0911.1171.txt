The spherical-box approach is extended to calculate the resonance parameters
and the real part of the wave function for single particle resonances in a
potential containing the long-range Coulomb interaction. A model potential is
taken to demonstrate the ability and accuracy of this approach. The calculated
resonance parameters are compared with available results from other methods. It
is shown that in the presence of the Coulomb interaction, the spherical-box
approach works well for not so broad resonances. In particular, for very narrow
resonances, the present method gives resonance parameters in a very high
precision.
