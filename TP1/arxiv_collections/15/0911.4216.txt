We demonstrate that it is possible to confine electromagnetic radiation in
cavities that are significantly smaller than the wavelength of the radiation it
encapsulates. To this aim, we use the techniques of transformation optics.
First, we present a "perfect cavity" of arbitrarily small size in which such
confined modes can exist. Furthermore, we show that these eigenmodes have a
continuous spectrum and that bending losses are absent, in contrast to what is
observed in traditional microcavities. Finally, we introduce an alternative
cavity configuration that is less sensitive to material imperfections and still
exhibits deep subwavelength modes combined with high quality factor, even if
considerable material losses are included. Such a cavity may be interesting for
the storage of information in optical data processing and for applications in
quantum optics.
