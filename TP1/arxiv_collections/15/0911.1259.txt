We report measurements of the Hall coefficient $R_H$ for single crystals of
AFe$_2$As$_2$ with $A = Ba, Ca$ or $Sr$ which are the anti-ferromagnetic parent
compounds of some high temperature pnictide superconductors. We show that $R_H$
of Sr-122 is consistent with high field quantum oscillation data. Our $R_H(T)$
data can also be used to estimate values of the spin density wave gap, giving
$\Delta_{SDW}(0) = 710\pm 70$ K for Sr-122 and $435\pm 20$ K for Ba-122.
