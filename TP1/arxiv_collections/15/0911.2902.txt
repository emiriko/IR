The simulation of vehicular traffic as well as pedestrian dynamics meanwhile
both have a decades long history. The success of this conference series, PED
and others show that the interest in these topics is still strongly increasing.
This contribution deals with a combination of both systems: pedestrians
crossing a street. In a VISSIM simulation for varying demand jam sizes of
vehicles as well as pedestrians and the travel times of the pedestrians are
measured and compared. The study is considered as a study of VISSIM's con ict
area functionality as such, as there is no empirical data available to use for
calibration issues. Above a vehicle demand threshold the results show a
non-monotonic dependence of pedestrians' travel time on pedestrian demand.
