An incommensurate modulated structure was found recently in a light group V
element phosphorous in the phase P-IV stable in the pressure range 107-137 GPa.
We consider configurations of the Brillouin zone and Fermi sphere within a
nearly-free-electron model in order to analyze the importance of these
configurations for the crystal structure energy. For the phase P-IV with the
base-centered orthorhombic structure, oC2, we consider a commensurate
approximant with an 11-fold supercell along the c-axis and a modulation wave
vector equal 3/11 which is close to the experimentally observed value of 0.267.
Atomic shifts due to the modulation result in appearance of satellite
reflections and hence in a formation of additional Brillouin zone planes. The
stability of this structure is attributed to the lowering of the electronic
band structure energy due to Brillouin zone - Fermi surface interactions.
