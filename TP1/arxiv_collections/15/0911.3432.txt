In the present paper, we start from the canonical theory of loop quantum
gravity and the master constraint programme. The physical inner product is
expressed by using the group averaging technique for a single self-adjoint
master constraint operator. By the standard technique of skeletonization and
the coherent state path-integral, we derive a path-integral formula from the
group averaging for the master constraint operator. Our derivation in the
present paper suggests there exists a direct link connecting the canonical Loop
quantum gravity with a path-integral quantization or a spin-foam model of
General Relativity.
