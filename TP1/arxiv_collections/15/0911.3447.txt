We prove an analogue of the MacMahon Master Theorem for the right quantum
superalgebras. In particular, we obtain a new and simple proof of this theorem
for the right quantum algebras. In the super case the theorem is then used to
construct higher order Sugawara operators for the affine Lie superalgebra
$\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(m|n)$ in an explicit form. The operators are elements
of a completed universal enveloping algebra of $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(m|n)$
at the critical level. They occur as the coefficients in the expansion of a
noncommutative Berezinian and as the traces of powers of generator matrices.
The same construction yields higher Hamiltonians for the Gaudin model
associated with the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$. We also use the
Sugawara operators to produce algebraically independent generators of the
algebra of singular vectors of any generic Verma module at the critical level
over the affine Lie superalgebra.
