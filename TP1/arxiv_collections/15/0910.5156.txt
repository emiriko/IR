The ATLAS detector, built at one of the interaction points of the Large
Hadron Collider, is operational and has been collecting data from cosmic rays.
This paper describes the track based alignment of the ATLAS Inner Detector
tracker which was performed using cosmic rays collected in 2008. The alignment
algorithms are described and the performance of the alignment is demonstrated
by showing the resulting hit residuals and comparing track parameters of upper
and lower segments of tracks. The impact of the alignment on physics
measurements is discussed.
