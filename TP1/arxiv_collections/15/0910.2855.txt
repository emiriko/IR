Friedel oscillations of electron densities near step edges have an analog in
microwave billiards. A random plane wave model, normally only appropriate for
the eigenfunctions of a purely chaotic system, can be applied and is tested for
non-purely-chaotic dynamical systems with measurements on pseudo-integrable and
mixed dynamics geometries. It is found that the oscillations in the
pseudo-integrable microwave cavity matches the random plane-wave modeling.
Separating the chaotic from the regular states for the mixed system requires
incorporating an appropriate phase space projection into the modeling in
multiple ways for good agreement with experiment.
