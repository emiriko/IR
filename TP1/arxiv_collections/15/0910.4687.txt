Co islands and films are characterized by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism
photoemission electron microscopy (XMCD-PEEM). The spatial resolution
capabilties of the technique together with atomic growth control permit
obtaining perfectly flat triangular islands with a given thickness (3 ML), very
close to an abrupt spin-reorientation transition. The magnetic domain
configurations are found to depend on island size: while small islands can be
magnetized in a single-domain state, larger islands show more complex patterns.
Furthermore, the magnetization pattern of the larger islands presents a common
chirality. By means of dichroic spectro-microscopy at the Co L absorption
edges, an experimental estimate of the ratio of the spin- and orbital magnetic
moment for three monolayer thick films is obtained.
