We study Wilson loops in the 4-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric quiver/M theory
duality recently constructed by Gaiotto and Maldacena, that is conjectured to
be dual to M2 branes on AdS_5\times S^4 fibered over \Sigma_2. We use the
localization method raised by Pestun, in order to compute the Wilson loop in
4-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric linear quiver gauge theory. We obtained the
consistent results in the quiver gauge theory and the 11-dimensional
supergravity. This match supports the N=2 quiver SCFT / M theory supergravity
duality.
