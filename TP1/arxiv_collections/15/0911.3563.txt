The quantum-mechanical mechanisms by which the enzymes catalyze the hydrogen
transfer in biochemical reactions are considered. Up to date it was established
both experimentally and theoretically that in many cases the proton tunnelling
through the intermolecular potential barrier is essential. We argue that in
this case the enzyme excitation and internal motion facilitate proton transfer
between reactants by squeezing the potential barrier which otherwise is
practically impenetrable. In the similar fashion, the enzymes can facilitate
the formation of hydrogen (H) bonds between the molecules. By means of barrier
squeezing, the enzymes not only facilitate such reactions but also can control
their rate and their final outcome, depending of enzyme excitation. In
particular, such effects can play the major role in DNA polymerization
reactions where preliminary DNTP selection is quite important.
