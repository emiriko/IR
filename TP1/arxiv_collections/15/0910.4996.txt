Nuclear spin polarization is typically generated in GaAs quantum point
contacts (QPCs) when an out-of-plane magnetic field gives rise to
spin-polarized quantum Hall edge states, and a voltage bias drives transitions
between the edge states via electron-nuclear flip-flop scattering. Here, we
report a similar effect for QPCs in an in-plane magnetic field, where currents
are spin polarized but edge states are not formed. The nuclear polarization
gives rise to hysteresis in the d.c. transport characteristics, with relaxation
timescales around 100 seconds. The dependence of anomalous QPC conductance
features on nuclear polarization provides a useful test of their
spin-sensitivity.
