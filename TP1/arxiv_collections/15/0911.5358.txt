In the tidal disruption of a star by a black hole, roughly half of the
stellar mass becomes bound and falls into the black hole, while the other half
is ejected at high velocity. Several previous studies have considered the
emission resulting from the accretion of bound material; we consider the
possibility that the unbound debris may also radiate once it has expanded and
become transparent. We show that the gradual energy input from hydrogen
recombination compensates for adiabatic loses over significant expansion
factors. The opacity also drops dramatically with recombination, and the
internal energy can be radiated by means of a cooling-transparency wave
propagating from the surface layers inward. The result is a brief optical
transient occurring ~1 week after disruption and lasting 3-5 days with peak
luminosities of 10^40-10^42 ergs/s, depending on the mass of the disrupted
star. These recombination powered transients should accompany the
x-ray/ultraviolet flare from the accretion of bound material, and so may be a
useful signature for discriminating tidal disruption events, especially for
lower and intermediate mass black holes.
