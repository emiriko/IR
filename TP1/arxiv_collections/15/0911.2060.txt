The large, level-dependent g-factors in an InSb nanowire quantum dot allow
for the occurrence of a variety of level crossings in the dot. While we observe
the standard conductance enhancement in the Coulomb blockade region for aligned
levels with different spins due to the Kondo effect, a vanishing of the
conductance is found at the alignment of levels with equal spins. This
conductance suppression appears as a canyon cutting through the web of direct
tunneling lines and an enclosed Coulomb blockade region. In the center of the
Coulomb blockade region, we observe the predicted correlation-induced
resonance, which now turns out to be part of a larger scenario. Our findings
are supported by numerical and analytical calculations.
