A round disk with a harmonic disturbance impacts on a water surface and
creates a non-axisymmetric cavity which collapses under the influence of
hydrostatic pressure. We use disks deformed with mode m=2 to m=6. For all mode
numbers we find clear evidence for a phase inversion of the cavity wall during
the collapse. We present a fluid dynamics video showing high speed imaging of
different modes, pointing out the characteristic features during collapse.
