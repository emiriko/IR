This paper reports the effect of Fe doping on the structure and room
temperature ferromagnetism of CeO2 nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction and
selective area electron diffraction measurement reflects that Ce1-xFexO2 (x =
0.0 - 0.07) nanoparticles exhibit single phase nature with cubic structure and
none of the sample showed the presence of any secondary phase. The mean
particle size calculated by using a transmission electron microscopy
measurement was found to increase with increase in Fe content. DC magnetization
measurements performed at room temperature indicates that all the samples
exhibit ferromagnetism. The saturation magnetic moment has been found to
increase with an increase in the Fe content.
