This thesis investigates the jet-medium interactions in a Quark-Gluon Plasma
using a hydrodynamical model. It deals with the creation of Mach cones which
are supposed to exhibit a characteristic structure in the measured angular
particle distributions allowing for direct conclusions about the Equation of
State and in particular about the speed of sound of the medium. Several
different scenarios of jet energy loss are examined and different mechanisms of
energy and momentum loss are analyzed, ranging from weak interactions (based on
calculations from perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics, pQCD) to strong
interactions (formulated using the Anti-de-Sitter/Conformal Field Theory
Correspondence, AdS/CFT). Though they result in different angular particle
correlations which could in principle allow to distinguish the underlying
processes, it is shown that the characteristic structure observed in
experimental data can be obtained due to the different contributions of several
possible jet trajectories through an expanding medium. Such a structure cannot
directly be connected to the Equation of State. In this context, the impact of
a strong flow created behind the jet (the diffusion wake) is examined which is
common to almost all jet deposition scenarios. Besides that, the transport
equations for dissipative hydrodynamics are discussed which are fundamental for
any numerical computation of viscous effects in a Quark-Gluon Plasma.
