The unexpectedly rich structure of the multisoliton solutions of the KPII
equation has been explored by using different approaches, running from dressing
method to twisting transformations and to the tau-function formulation. All
these approaches proved to be useful in order to display different properties
of these solutions and their related Jost solutions. The aim of this paper is
to establish the explicit formulae relating all these approaches. In addition
some hidden invariance properties of these multisoliton solutions are
discussed.
