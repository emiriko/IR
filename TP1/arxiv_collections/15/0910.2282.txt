We study the transition time distribution for a particle moving between two
wells of a multidimensional potential in the low-noise limit of overdamped
Langevin dynamics. Possible transition paths are restricted to a thin tube
surrounding the most probable trajectory. We demonstrate that finding the
transition time distribution reduces to a one-dimensional problem. The
resulting transition time distribution has a universal and compact form. We
suggest that transition barriers can be estimated from a single-temperature
experiment if both the life times and the transition times are measured.
