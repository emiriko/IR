Late X-ray flares observed in X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
suggest late central engine activities at a few minuets to hours after the
burst. A few unambiguously confirmed cases of supernova associations with
nearby long GRBs imply that an accompanying supernova-like component might be a
common feature in all long GRB events. These motivate us to study the
interactions of a late jet, responsible for a x-ray flare, with various
components in a stellar explosion, responsible for a GRB. These components
include a supernova shell-like ejecta, and a cocoon that was produced when the
main jet producing the GRB itself was propagating through the progenitor star.
We find that the interaction between the late jet and the supernova ejecta may
produce a luminous (up to 10^49 erg s^-1) thermal X-ray transient lasting for ~
10 s. The interaction between the late jet and the cocoon produces synchrotron
self-absorbed non-thermal emission, with the observed peak X-ray flux density
from 0.001 micro Jy to 1 mJy at 1 keV and a peak optical flux density from 0.01
micro Jy to 0.1 Jy (for a redshift z= 2). The light curve due to the late jet -
cocoon interaction has very small pulse-width-to-time ratio, \Delta t / t
\approx 0.01 - 0.5, where t is the pulse peak time since the burst trigger.
Identifying these features in current and future observations would open a new
frontier in the study of GRB progenitor stars.
