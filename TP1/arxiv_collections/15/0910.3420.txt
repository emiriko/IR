We present a search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in
association with a W boson in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy
of $\sqrt{s} = 1.96$ TeV. The search is performed in the $WH\to \ell\nu
b\bar{b}$ channel using 2.7 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by both the CDF
detector and by the $D\O$ detector, at the Fermilab Tevatron. The searches
employ artificial neural network, matrix element and boosted decision tree
techniques to improve the separation between signal and background. Additional
techniques used to improve the Higgs sensitivity include the use of optimized
b-quark jet energy corrections and improved algorithms for identifying
b-quarks. In the absence of an observed excess in data, upper limits are set by
both experiments on the Higgs production rate times branching ratio for a range
of possible Higgs masses between 100 and 150 GeV.
