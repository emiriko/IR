Aims: Caustic-crossing binary-lens microlensing events are important
anomalous events because they are capable of detecting an extrasolar planet
companion orbiting the lens star. Fast and robust modelling methods are thus of
prime interest in helping to decide whether a planet is detected by an event.
Cassan (2008) introduced a new set of parameters to model binary-lens events,
which are closely related to properties of the light curve. In this work, we
explain how Bayesian priors can be added to this framework, and investigate on
interesting options. Methods: We develop a mathematical formulation that allows
us to compute analytically the priors on the new parameters, given some
previous knowledge about other physical quantities. We explicitly compute the
priors for a number of interesting cases, and show how this can be implemented
in a fully Bayesian, Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Results: Using
Bayesian priors can accelerate microlens fitting codes by reducing the time
spent considering physically implausible models, and helps us to discriminate
between alternative models based on the physical plausibility of their
parameters.
