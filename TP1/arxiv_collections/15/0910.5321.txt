The correlated motion of electrons in the presence of strong orbital
fluctuations and correlations is investigated with respect to magnetic
couplings and excitations in an orbitally degenerate ferromagnet. Introduction
of the orbital degree of freedom results in a class of diagrams representing
spin-orbital coupling which become particularly important near the orbital
ordering instability. Low-energy staggered orbital fluctuation modes,
particularly with momentum near (\pi/2,\pi/2,0) (corresponding to CE-type
orbital correlations), are shown to generically yield strong intrinsically
non-Heisenberg (1-\cos q)^2 magnon self energy correction, resulting in no spin
stiffness reduction, but strongly suppressed zone-boundary magnon energies in
the Gamma-X direction. The zone-boundary magnon softening is found to be
strongly enhanced with increasing hole doping and for narrow-band materials,
which provides insight into the origin of zone-boundary anomalies observed in
ferromagnetic manganites.
