Following an initial explosion that might be launched either by magnetic
interactions or neutrinos, a rotating magnetar radiating according to the
classic dipole formula could power a very luminous supernova. While some 56Ni
might be produced in the initial explosion, the peak of the light curve in a
Type I supernova would not be directly related to its mass. In fact, the peak
luminosity would be most sensitive to the dipole field strength of the
magnetar. The tail of the light curve could resemble radioactive decay for some
time but, assuming complete trapping of the pulsar emission, would eventually
be brighter. Depending on the initial explosion energy, both high and moderate
velocities could accompany a very luminous light curve.
