Mesoscopic dipolar Bose gases in triple-well potentials offer a minimal
system for the analysis of the long-range character of the dipole-dipole
interactions. We show that this long-range character may be clearly revealed by
a variety of possible ground-state phases. In addition, an appropriate control
of short-range and dipolar interactions may lead to novel scenarios for the
dynamics of atoms and polar molecules in lattices, including the dynamical
creation of mesoscopic Schr\"odinger cats, which may be employed as a source of
highly-nonclassical states for Heisenberg-limited interferometry.
