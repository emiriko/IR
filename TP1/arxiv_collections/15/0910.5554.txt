We study the mass ratio of W and Z bosons in an SU(5) gauge-Higgs unification
model with the left-right symmetry remaining locally for boundary conditions
and with no scalar fields except for the extra-dimensional component of gauge
bosons. We find that there are a variety of boundary conditions to yield
distinct values of the mass ratio.
