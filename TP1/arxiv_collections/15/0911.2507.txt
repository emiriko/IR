In this paper, we present the latest results on the measurement of the
Boltzmann constant kB, by laser spectroscopy of ammonia at 10 ?m. The Doppler
absorption profile of a ro-vibrational line of an NH3 gas sample at thermal and
pressure equilibrium is measured as accurately as possible. The absorption cell
is placed inside a large 1m3 thermostat filled with an ice-water mixture, which
sets the temperature very close to 273.15 K. Analysing this profile, which is
related to the Maxwell-Boltzmann molecular speed distribution, leads to a
determination of the Boltzmann constant via a measurement of the Doppler width
(proportional tosqrt(kBT)). A spectroscopic determination of the Boltzmann
constant with an uncertainty as low as 37 ppm is obtained. Recent improvements
with a new passive thermostat lead to a temperature accuracy, stability and
homogeneity of the absorption cell better than 1 ppm over a day.
