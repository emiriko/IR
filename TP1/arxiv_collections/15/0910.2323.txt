We present a versatile and highly configurable scanning acoustic platform.
This platform, comprising of a high frequency transducer, bespoke positioning
system and temperature-regulated sample unit, enables the acoustic probing of
materials over a wide range of length scales and with minimal thermal
aberration. In its bare form the platform acts as a reflection-mode acoustic
microscope, while optical capabilities are readily incorporated to extend its
abilities to the acousto-optic domain. Here we illustrate the capabilities of
the platform through its incarnation as an acoustic microscope. Operating at 55
MHz we demonstrate acoustic imaging with a lateral resolution of 25 microns. We
outline its construction, calibration and capabilities as an acoustic
microscope, and discuss its wider applications.
