The publication of a revised edition of a monograph devoted to the two-band
theory of superconductivity provides us the opportunity of a short comment on
two classical papers, published independently some 50 years ago, where the
generalization of the BCS theory for metals with overlapping energy bands at
the Fermi level has been proposed. The article includes Moskalenko's
recollections on some aspects of scientific life in the Soviet Union, in the
'50s.
