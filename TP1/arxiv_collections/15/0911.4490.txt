We discuss a particular source of error in the Numerical Renormalization
Group (NRG) method for quantum impurity problems, which is related to a
renormalization of impurity parameters due to the bath propagator. At any step
of the NRG calculation, this renormalization is only partially taken into
account, leading to systematic variation of the impurity parameters along the
flow. This effect can cause qualitatively incorrect results when studying
quantum critical phenomena, as it leads to an implicit variation of the phase
transition's control parameter as function of the temperature and thus to an
unphysical temperature dependence of the order-parameter mass. We demonstrate
the mass-flow effect for bosonic impurity models with a power law bath
spectrum, J(w) ~ w^s, namely the dissipative harmonic oscillator and the
spin-boson model. We propose an extension of the NRG to correct the mass-flow
error. Using this, we find unambiguous signatures of a Gaussian critical fixed
point in the spin-boson model for s<1/2, consistent with mean-field behavior as
expected from quantum-to-classical mapping.
