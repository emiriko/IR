We show that a TeV scale inverse seesaw model for neutrino masses can be
realized within the framework of a supersymmetric SO(10) model consistent with
gauge coupling unification and observed neutrino masses and mixing. We present
our expectations for non-unitarity effects in the leptonic mixing matrix some
of which are observable at future neutrino factories as well as the next
generation searches for lepton flavor violating processes such as \mu --> e +
\gamma. The model has TeV scale W_R and Z' bosons which are accessible at the
Large Hadron Collider.
