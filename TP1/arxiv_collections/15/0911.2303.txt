Effects of dynamical long-range correlations over a fluid cell size scale on
a relativistic fluid are discussed. It is shown that such correlations among
the fluid elements introduced into hydrodynamical model induce some weak
dissipation and viscosity into the fluid. The influence of the long-range
correlations on the entropy current is also discussed.
