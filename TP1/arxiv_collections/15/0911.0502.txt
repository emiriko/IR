Using pulsewidth data for 872 isolated radio pulsars we test the hypothesis
that pulsars evolve through a progressive narrowing of the emission cone
combined with progressive alignment of the spin and magnetic axes. The new data
provide strong evidence for the alignment over a time-scale of about 1 Myr with
a log standard deviation of around 0.8 across the observed population. This
time-scale is shorter than the time-scale of about 10 Myr found by previous
authors, but the log standard deviation is larger. The results are inconsistent
with models based on magnetic field decay alone or monotonic counter-alignment
to orthogonal rotation. The best fits are obtained for a braking index
parameter n_gamma approximately equal to 2.3, consistent the mean of the six
measured values, but based on a much larger sample of young pulsars. The
least-squares fitted models are used to predict the mean inclination angle
between the spin and magnetic axes as a function of log characteristic age.
Comparing these predictions to existing estimates it is found that the model in
which pulsars are born with a random angle of inclination gives the best fit to
the data. Plots of the mean beaming fraction as a function of characteristic
age are presented using the best-fitting model parameters.
