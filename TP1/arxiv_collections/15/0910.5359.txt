The description of high-energy hadronic interactions plays an important role
in the (astrophysical) interpretation of air shower data. The parameter space
important for the development of air showers (energy and kinematical range)
extends well beyond todays accelerator capabilities. Therefore, accurate
measurements of air showers are used to constrain modern models to describe
high-energy hadronic interactions. The results obtained are complementary to
information gained at accelerators and add to our understanding of high-energy
hadronic interactions.
