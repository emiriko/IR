The dynamics of fluid particles on cylindrical manifolds is investigated. The
velocity field is obtained by generalizing the isotropic Kraichnan ensemble,
and is therefore Gaussian and decorrelated in time. The degree of
compressibility is such that when the radius of the cylinder tends to infinity
the fluid particles separate in an explosive way. Nevertheless, when the radius
is finite the transition probability of the two-particle separation converges
to an invariant measure. This behavior is due to the large-scale
compressibility generated by the compactification of one dimension of the
space.
