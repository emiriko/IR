An overview of neutrino-mixing models is presented with emphasis on the types
of horizontal flavor and vertical family symmetries that have been invoked.
Distributions for the mixing angles of many models are displayed. Ways to
differentiate among the models and to narrow the list of viable models are
discussed.
