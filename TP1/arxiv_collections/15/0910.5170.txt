We present results of a search for anomalous production of two photons
together with an electron, muon, $\tau$ lepton, missing transverse energy, or
jets using $p\bar{p}$ collision data from 1.1-2.0 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated
luminosity collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF). The event
yields and kinematic distributions are examined for signs of new physics
without favoring a specific model of new physics. The results are consistent
with the standard model expectations. The search employs several new analysis
techniques that significantly reduce instrumental backgrounds in channels with
an electron and missing transverse energy.
