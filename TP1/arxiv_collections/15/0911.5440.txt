In this paper we describe the behavior of solutions of the Klein-Gordon
equation, (Box_g+lambda)u=f, on Lorentzian manifolds (X^o,g) which are anti-de
Sitter-like (AdS-like) at infinity. Such manifolds are Lorentzian analogues of
the so-called Riemannian conformally compact (or asymptotically hyperbolic)
spaces, in the sense that the metric is conformal to a smooth Lorentzian metric
g^ on X, where C has a non-trivial boundary, in the sense that g=x^{-2}g^, with
x a boundary defining function. The boundary is conformally time-like for these
spaces, unlike asymptotically de Sitter spaces, which are similar but with the
boundary being conformally space-like.
  Here we show local well-posedness for the Klein-Gordon equation, and also
global well-posedness under global assumptions on the (null)bicharacteristic
flow, for lambda below the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, (n-1)^2/4. These have
been known under additional assumptions, see the work of Breitenlohner-Freedman
and Holzegel.
  Further, we describe the propagation of singularities of solutions and obtain
the asymptotic behavior (at the boundary of X) of regular solutions. We also
define the scattering operator, which in this case is an analogue of the
hyperbolic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. Thus, it is shown that below the
Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, the Klein-Gordon equation behaves much like it
would for the conformally related metric, g^, with Dirichlet boundary
conditions, for which propagation of singularities was shown by Melrose,
Sj\"ostrand and Taylor, though the precise form of the asymptotics is
different.
