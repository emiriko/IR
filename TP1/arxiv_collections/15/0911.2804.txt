The rhombus tilings of a simply connected domain of the Euclidean plane are
known to form a flip-connected space (a flip is the elementary operation on
rhombus tilings which rotates 180{\deg} a hexagon made of three rhombi).
Motivated by the study of a quasicrystal growth model, we are here interested
in better understanding how "tight" rhombus tiling spaces are flip-connected.
We introduce a lower bound (Hamming-distance) on the minimal number of flips to
link two tilings (flip-distance), and we investigate whether it is sharp. The
answer depends on the number n of different edge directions in the tiling:
positive for n=3 (dimer tilings) or n=4 (octogonal tilings), but possibly
negative for n=5 (decagonal tilings) or greater values of n. A standard proof
is provided for the n=3 and n=4 cases, while the complexity of the n=5 case led
to a computer-assisted proof (whose main result can however be easily checked
by hand).
