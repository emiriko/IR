We study monoids generated by Zariski-van Kampen generators in the 17
fundamental groups of the complement of logarithmic free divisors in C^3 listed
by Sekiguchi (Theorem 1). Five of them are Artin monoids and eight of them are
free abelian monoids. The remaining four monoids are not Gaussian and, hence,
are neither Garside nor Artin (Theorem 2). However, we introduce, similarly to
Artin monoids, fundamental elements and show their existence (Theorem 3). One
of the four non-Gaussian monoids satisfies the cancellation condition (Theorem
4).
