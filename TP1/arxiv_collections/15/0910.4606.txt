We present a scheme that produces a strong U(1)-like gauge field on cold
atoms confined in a two-dimensional square optical lattice. Our proposal relies
on two essential features, a long-lived metastable excited state that exists
for alkaline-earth or Ytterbium atoms, and an optical superlattice. As in the
proposal by Jaksch and Zoller [New Journal of Physics 5, 56 (2003)],
laser-assisted tunneling between adjacent sites creates an effective magnetic
field. In the tight-binding approximation, the atomic motion is described by
the Harper Hamiltonian, with a flux across each lattice plaquette that can
realistically take any value between 0 and $\pi$. We show how to take advantage
of the superlattice to ensure that each plaquette acquires the same phase, thus
simulating a uniform magnetic field. We discuss the observable consequences of
the artificial gauge field on non-interacting bosonic and fermionic gases. We
also outline how the scheme can be generalized to non-Abelian gauge fields.
