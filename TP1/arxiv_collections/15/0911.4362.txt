We study the semiclassical measures for the solution of a dissipative
Helmholtz equation with a source term concentrated on a bounded submanifold.
The potential is not assumed to be non-trapping, but trapped trajectories have
to go through the region where the absorption coefficient is positive. In that
case, the solution is microlocally written around any point away from the
source as a sum (finite or infinite) of lagragian distributions. Moreover we
prove and use the fact that the outgoing solution of the dissipative Helmholtz
equation is microlocally zero in the incoming region.
