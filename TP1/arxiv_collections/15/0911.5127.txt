We consider the typical distance between vertices of the giant component of a
random intersection graph having a power law (asymptotic) vertex degree
distribution with infinite second moment. Given two vertices from the giant
component we construct O(log log n) upper bound (in probability) for the length
of the shortest path connecting them.
