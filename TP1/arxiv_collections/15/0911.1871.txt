We introduce new statistical methods for the study of cosmic voids, focusing
on the statistics of largest size voids. We distinguish three different types
of distributions of voids, namely, Poisson-like, lognormal-like and Pareto-like
distributions. The last two distributions are connected with two types of
fractal geometry of the matter distribution. Scaling voids with Pareto
distribution appear in fractal distributions with box-counting dimension
smaller than three (its maximum value), whereas the lognormal void distribution
corresponds to multifractals with box-counting dimension equal to three.
Moreover, voids of the former type persist in the continuum limit, namely, as
the number density of observable objects grows, giving rise to lacunar
fractals, whereas voids of the latter type disappear in the continuum limit,
giving rise to non-lacunar (multi)fractals. We propose both lacunar and
non-lacunar multifractal models of the cosmic web structure of the Universe. A
non-lacunar multifractal model is supported by current galaxy surveys as well
as cosmological $N$-body simulations. This model suggests, in particular, that
small dark matter halos and, arguably, faint galaxies are present in cosmic
voids.
