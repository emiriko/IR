In dealing with thermal transport in composite systems, high contrast
materials pose a special problem for numerical simulation: the time scale or
step size in the high conductivity material must be much smaller than in the
low conductivity material. In the limit that the higher conductivity inclusion
can be treated as having an infinite conductivity, we show how a standard
random walk algorithm can be alterred to improve speed while still preserving
the second law of thermodynamics. We demonstrate the principle in a 1D system,
and then apply it to 3D composites with spherical inclusions.
