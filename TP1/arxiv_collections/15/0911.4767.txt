The efficient generation of intense X-rays and $\gamma$-radiation is studied.
The scheme is based on the relativistic mirror concept, {\it i.e.}, a flying
thin plasma slab interacts with a counterpropagating laser pulse, reflecting
part of it in the form of an intense ultra-short electromagnetic pulse having
an up-shifted frequency. In the proposed scheme a series of relativistic
mirrors is generated in the interaction of the intense laser with a thin foil
target as the pulse tears off and accelerates thin electron layers. A
counterpropagating pulse is reflected by these flying layers in the form of an
ensemble of ultra-short pulses resulting in a significant energy gain of the
reflected radiation due to the momentum transfer from flying layers.
