Ho claims in his comment that our experiment is direct evidence that
itinerant ferromagnetism does not exist in ultracold Fermi gases. This claim is
incorrect and based on an invalid estimate of relaxation times and an erroneous
interpretation of the detectability of ferromagnetic domains. We point out that
the experimental evidence is consistent with the existence of ferromagnetism,
but further experiments are needed to distinguish a ferromagnetic ground state
from a non-magnetic ground state with ferromagnetic correlations.
