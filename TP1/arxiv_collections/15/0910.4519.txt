We investigated domain growth in switching processes between the low-spin and
high-spin phases in thermally induced hysteresis loops of spin-crossover (SC)
solids. Elastic interactions among the molecules induce effective long-range
interactions, and thus the boundary condition plays a significant role in the
dynamics. In contrast to SC systems with periodic boundary conditions, where
uniform configurations are maintained during the switching process, we found
that domain structures appear with open boundary conditions. Unlike Ising-like
models with short-range interactions, domains always grow from the corners of
the system. The present clustering mechanism provides an insight into the
switching dynamics of SC solids, in particular, in nano-scale systems.
