The combination of high spatial and spectral resolution in optical astronomy
enables new observational approaches to many open problems in stellar and
circumstellar astrophysics. However, constructing a high-resolution
spectrograph for an interferometer is a costly and time-intensive undertaking.
Our aim is to show that, by coupling existing high-resolution spectrographs to
existing interferometers, one could observe in the domain of high spectral and
spatial resolution, and avoid the construction of a new complex and expensive
instrument. We investigate in this article the different challenges which arise
from combining an interferometer with a high-resolution spectrograph. The
requirements for the different sub-systems are determined, with special
attention given to the problems of fringe tracking and dispersion. A concept
study for the combination of the VLTI (Very Large Telescope Interferometer)
with UVES (UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph) is carried out, and several other
specific instrument pairings are discussed. We show that the proposed
combination of an interferometer with a high-resolution spectrograph is indeed
feasible with current technology, for a fraction of the cost of building a
whole new spectrograph. The impact on the existing instruments and their
ongoing programs would be minimal.
