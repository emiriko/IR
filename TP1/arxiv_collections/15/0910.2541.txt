The origin of tilted disks in cataclysmic variables is explained in terms of
a model involving the stream-disk interactions. Tilted, precessing disk causes
periodically variable asymmetry in the irradiation of the two hemispheres of
the secondary component, resulting in variable vertical component of the
velocity of the stream. The following stream-disk interactions provide
additional vertical acceleration to disk elements needed to produce and
maintain disk tilt. Predictions based on this model compare favorably with
observations.
