We argue that specific fluctuations observed in high-energy nuclear
collisions can be attributed to intrinsic fluctuations of temperature of the
hadronizing system formed in such processes and therefore can be described by
the same nonextensivity parameter $q$ characterizing Tsallis statistics
describing such systems (for $q \to 1$ one recovers the usual Boltzmann-Gibbs
approach). It means that $|q-1|$, which is a direct measure of temperature
fluctuations, can also be expressed by the observed mean multiplicity, $<N>$,
and by its variance, $Var(N)$. This allows to deduce from the experimental data
the system size dependence of parameter $q$ with $q = 1$ corresponding to an
infinite, thermalized source with a fixed temperature, and with the observed $q
> 1$ corresponding to a finite source in which both the temperature and energy
fluctuate.
