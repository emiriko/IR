The special theme of DCM 2009, co-located with ICALP 2009, concerned
Computational Models From Nature, with a particular emphasis on computational
models derived from physics and biology. The intention was to bring together
different approaches - in a community with a strong foundational background as
proffered by the ICALP attendees - to create inspirational cross-boundary
exchanges, and to lead to innovative further research. Specifically DCM 2009
sought contributions in quantum computation and information, probabilistic
models, chemical, biological and bio-inspired ones, including spatial models,
growth models and models of self-assembly. Contributions putting to the test
logical or algorithmic aspects of computing (e.g., continuous computing with
dynamical systems, or solid state computing models) were also very much
welcomed.
