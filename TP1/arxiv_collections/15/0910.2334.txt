Study of parton distribution function (PDF) is a topic of significant
interest in QCD. To overcome the shortcomings of conventional PDFs, several
alternative methods have been suggested in recent years. The present work
reports the x distribution of the Non-singlet structure function in Leading
order using the complete solution of Taylor-approximated DGLAP equation. The
formalism is more general than the similar ones reported in recent literature.
Our predictions are compared with the CCFR neutrino data as well as exact
results.
