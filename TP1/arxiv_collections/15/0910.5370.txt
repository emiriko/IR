Isogenies, the mappings of elliptic curves, have become a useful tool in
cryptology. These mathematical objects have been proposed for use in computing
pairings, constructing hash functions and random number generators, and
analyzing the reducibility of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem.
With such diverse uses, understanding these objects is important for anyone
interested in the field of elliptic curve cryptography. This paper, targeted at
an audience with a knowledge of the basic theory of elliptic curves, provides
an introduction to the necessary theoretical background for understanding what
isogenies are and their basic properties. This theoretical background is used
to explain some of the basic computational tasks associated with isogenies.
Herein, algorithms for computing isogenies are collected and presented with
proofs of correctness and complexity analyses. As opposed to the complex
analytic approach provided in most texts on the subject, the proofs in this
paper are primarily algebraic in nature. This provides alternate explanations
that some with a more concrete or computational bias may find more clear.
