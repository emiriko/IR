The superstring theory in the light-cone gauge admits various gauge
symmetries. Therefore, we gauge the superstring sigma model in the light-cone
gauge under the gauge group SU(4). Some properties of the gauged action and the
corresponding current will be studied. Besides, two modified actions for the
superstring will be obtained.
