Fluids confined within narrow channels exhibit a variety of phases and phase
transitions associated with their reduced dimensionality. In this review paper,
we illustrate the crossover from quasi-one dimensional to higher effective
dimensionality behavior of fluids adsorbed within different carbon nanotubes
geometries. In the single nanotube geometry, no phase transitions can occur at
finite temperature. Instead, we identify a crossover from a quasi-one
dimensional to a two dimensional behavior of the adsorbate. In bundles of
nanotubes, phase transitions at finite temperature arise from the transverse
coupling of interactions between channels.
