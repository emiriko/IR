Inclined air showers - those arriving at ground with zenith angle with
respect to the vertical theta > 60 deg - are characterised by the dominance of
the muonic component at ground which is accompanied by an electromagnetic halo
produced mainly by muon decay and muon interactions. By means of Monte Carlo
simulations we give a full characterisation of the particle densities at ground
in ultra-high energy inclined showers as a function of primary energy and mass
composition, as well as for different hadronic models assumed in the
simulations. We also investigate the effect of intrinsic shower-to-shower
fluctuations in the particle densities.
