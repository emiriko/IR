Many, possibly most, stars form in binary and higher-order multiple systems.
Therefore, the properties and frequency of binary systems provide strong clues
to the star-formation process, and constraints on star-formation models.
However, the majority of stars also form in star clusters in which the birth
binary properties and frequency can be altered rapidly by dynamical processing.
Thus, we almost never see the birth population, which makes it very difficult
to know if star formation (as traced by binaries, at least) is universal, or if
it depends on environment. In addition, the field population consists of a
mixture of systems from different clusters which have all been processed in
different ways.
