If the total integral including both 0<V<c and c<V<infinity is considered,
divergence will be reduced.Firstly,we use the Cherenkov radiation in media as
analogue to confirm the formulation (7)-(10) of a tachyon in vacuum.Then these
equations are applied to calculate the Lamb shift and the cut-off frequency is
unnecessary.
