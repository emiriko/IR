A current series of papers on barrier-controlled and trapping processes in
solids and/or at solid surfaces have laid down the emphasis onto describing the
statistical event by means of the barrier currents method due to Bardeen and
Christov. The present study centered on photodesorption and
photoelectrification is the fourth of an arXiv series which also included rapid
statistical approaches to nucleation, diffusion and drift currents in state of
the art materials. We presently extend our arguments to spherical square and
oscillatory wells to deal with the photoprocesses.
