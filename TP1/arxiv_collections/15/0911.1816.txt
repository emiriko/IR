In the last decade, a variety of high-precision experiments have searched for
miniscule violations of Lorentz symmetry. These searches are largely motivated
by the possibility of uncovering experimental signatures from a fundamental
unified theory. Experimental results are reported in the framework called the
Standard-Model Extension (SME), which describes general Lorentz violation for
each particle species in terms of its coefficients for Lorentz violation.
Recently, the role of gravitational experiments in probing the SME has been
explored in the literature. In this talk, I will summarize theoretical and
experimental aspects of these works. I will also discuss recent lunar laser
ranging and atom interferometer experiments, which place stringent constraints
on gravity coefficients for Lorentz violation.
