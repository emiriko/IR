Inter-edge channel interactions in the quantum Hall regime at filling factor
nu= 2 are analyzed within a plasmon scattering formalism. We derive analytical
expressions for energy redistribution amongst edge channels and for high
frequency noise, which are shown to fully characterize the low energy plasmon
scattering. In the strong interaction limit, the predictions for energy
redistribution are compared with recent experimental data and found to
reproduce most of the observed features. Quantitative agreement can be achieved
by assuming 25 % of the injected energy is lost towards other degrees of
freedom, possibly the additional gapless excitations predicted for smooth edge
potentials.
