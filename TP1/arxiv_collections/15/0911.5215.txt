According to statistical turbulence theory, the ensemble averaged squared
vorticity rho_E is expected to grow not faster than drho_E/dt ~ rho_E^{3/2}.
Solving a variational problem for maximal bulk enstrophy (E) growth, velocity
fields were found for which the growth rate is as large as dE/dt ~ E^3. Using
numerical simulations with well resolved small scales and a quasi-Lagrangian
advection to track fluid subvolumes with rapidly growing vorticity, we study
spatially resolved statistics of vorticity growth. We find that the volume
ensemble averaged growth bound is satisfied locally to a remarkable degree of
accuracy. Elements with dE/dt ~ E^3 can also be identified, but their growth
tends to be replaced by the ensemble-averaged law when the intensities become
too large.
