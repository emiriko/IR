From simultaneous fits to the data from the 2+1 flavor DWF ensembles
generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations at two different lattice
spacings, we present preliminary continuum results for light hadrons. We focus
on light pseudoscalar decay constants and quark masses. Several approaches to
the calculation of the lattice spacing are discussed and the errors associated
with the chiral extrapolation are explained. We make use of reweighting in the
dynamical strange quark mass such that our ensembles have a self-consistently
determined strange quark mass.
