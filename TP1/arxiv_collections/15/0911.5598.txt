To investigate the nature and properties of far-infrared (FIR) sources from
the AKARI Deep Field South (ADF-S), we performed an extensive search for the
counterparts of 1000 ADF-S objects brighter than 0.0301 Jy in the WIDE-S (90
$\mu$m) AKARI band in the public databases (NED and SIMBAD). We analyzed the
properties of the resulting sample: statistic of the identified objects, number
counts, redshift distribution and morphological types. We also made a crude
analysis of the clustering properties of the sources and constructed spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) of 47 selected objects with the best photometry.
Among 1000 investigated ADF-S sources, 545 were identified at other
wavelengths. From them, 518 are known galaxies, and 343 of them were not known
previously as infra-red sources. We found redshifts of 48 extragalactic objects
and morphological types of 77 galaxies. We conclude that the bright FIR point
sources observed in the ADF-S are mostly nearby galaxies.Their properties are
very similar to properties of the local population of optically bright
galaxies, except an unusually high ratio of peculiar or interacting objects and
a smaller percentage of elliptical galaxies. The percentage of lenticular
galaxies is the same as in the optically bright population which suggests they
may frequently contain a significant amount of cool dust. It is possible that
source confusion plays a significant role in more than 34% of measurements. The
SEDs display a variety of galaxy types, from very actively star forming to very
quiescent. Thanks to the AKARI long wavelength bands it was revealed for the
first time that these galaxies form a population of objects with very cool
dust.
