A current objective of low-energy nuclear theory is to build non-empirical
nuclear energy density functionals (EDFs) from underlying inter-nucleon
interactions and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). The density matrix
expansion (DME) of Negele and Vautherin is a convenient method to map highly
non-local Hartree-Fock expressions into the form of a quasi-local Skyrme
functional with density-dependent couplings. In this work, we assess the
accuracy of the DME at reproducing the non-local exchange (Fock) contribution
to the energy. In contrast to the scalar part of the density matrix for which
the original formulation of Negele and Vautherin is reasonably accurate, we
demonstrate the necessity to reformulate the DME for the vector part of the
density matrix, which is needed for an accurate description of spin-unsaturated
nuclei. Phase-space averaging techniques are shown to yield a significant
improvement for the vector part of the density matrix compared to the original
formulation of Negele and Vautherin. The key to the improved accuracy is to
take into account the anisotropy that characterizes the local-momentum
distribution in the surface region of finite Fermi systems. Optimizing
separately the DME for the central, tensor and spin-orbit contributions to the
Fock energy, one reaches a few-percent accuracy over a representative set of
semi-magic nuclei. With such an accuracy at hand, one can envision using the
corresponding Skyrme-like energy functional as a microscopically-constrained
starting point around which future phenomenological parameterizations can be
built and refined.
