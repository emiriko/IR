We have used archival RXTE PCA data to investigate timing and spectral
characteristics of the transient XTE J1817-330. The data pertains to 160 PCA
pointed observations made during the outburst period 2006, January 27 to August
2. A detailed analysis of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in this black hole
X-ray binary is carried out. Power density spectra were obtained using the
light curves of the source. QPOs have been detected in the 2-8 keV band in 10
of the observations. In 8 of these observations, QPOs are present in the 8-14
keV and in 5 observations in the 15-25 keV band. XTE J1817-330 is the third
black hole source from which the low frequency QPOs are clearly detected in
hard X-rays. The QPO frequency lies in ~ 4-9 Hz and the rms amplitude in
1.7-13.3% range, the amplitude being higher at higher energies. We have fitted
the PDS of the observations with Lorentzian and power law models. Energy
spectra are derived for those observations in which the QPOs are detected to
investigate any dependence of the QPO characteristic on the spectral
parameters. These spectra are well fitted with a two component model that
includes the disk black body component and a power law component. The QPO
characteristics and their variations are discussed and its implication on the
origin of the QPOs are examined
