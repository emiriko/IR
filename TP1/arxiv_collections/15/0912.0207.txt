We present results from a numerical study of N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory using domain wall fermions. A set of dynamical simulations were
performed for the gauge group SU(2) using the Wilson gauge action on 8^3x8 and
16^3x32 lattices. We considered a range of gluino masses (i.e., fifth dimension
extents L_s=16-28 and input gluino mass values m_f=0.01-0.04) in order to
perform chiral limit extrapolations of physical quantities. In these
proceedings, we summarize our findings from a study of the Dirac spectrum and
present new results for the topological charge on beta=2.3, 2.353 and 2.4
ensembles.
