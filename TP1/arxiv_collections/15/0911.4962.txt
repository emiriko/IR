The Springer variety is the set of flags stabilized by a nilpotent operator.
In 1976, T.A. Springer observed that this variety's cohomology ring carries a
symmetric group action, and he offered a deep geometric construction of this
action. Sixteen years later, Garsia and Procesi made Springer's work more
transparent and accessible by presenting the cohomology ring as a graded
quotient of a polynomial ring. They combinatorially describe an explicit basis
for this quotient. The goal of this paper is to generalize their work. Our main
result deepens their analysis of Springer varieties and extends it to a family
of varieties called Hessenberg varieties, a two-parameter generalization of
Springer varieties. Little is known about their cohomology. For the class of
regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties, we conjecture a quotient presentation
for the cohomology ring and exhibit an explicit basis. Tantalizing new evidence
supports our conjecture for a subclass of regular nilpotent varieties called
Peterson varieties.
