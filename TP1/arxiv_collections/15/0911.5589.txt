This is a collection of examples showing how the GAP system can be used to
compute information about the generating graphs of finite groups. It includes
all examples that were needed for the computational results in the paper
"Hamiltonian cycles in the generating graphs of finite groups" by Thomas
Breuer, Robert M. Guralnick, Andrea Lucchini, Attila Mar\'oti, and G\'abor P.
Nagy. The purpose of this writeup is twofold. On the one hand, the computations
are documented this way. On the other hand, the GAP code shown for the examples
can be used as test input for automatic checking of the data and the functions
used.
