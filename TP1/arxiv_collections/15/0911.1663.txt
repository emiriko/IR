Quantum communication is concerned with the complexity of entanglement of a
state and statistical data analysis is concerned with the complexity of a
model. A common key word for both is "rank". In this paper we will show that
both community is tracing the same target and that the methods used are
slightly different. Two different methods, the range criterion method from
quantum communication and the determinant polynomial method, are shown as an
examples.
