We have developed a semi-analytic method of parameterizing N-body simulations
of self-gravity wakes in Saturn's rings, describing their properties by means
of only 6 numbers: 3 optical depths and 3 weighting factors. These numbers are
obtained using a density-estimation procedure that finds the frequencies of
various values of local density within a simulated ring patch.
  Application of our parameterization to a suite of N-body simulations implies
that the distribution of local optical depths is trimodal, rather than bimodal
as previous authors have assumed. Rings dominated by self-gravity wakes appear
to be mostly empty space.
  The implications of this result for the analysis of occultation data are more
conceptual than practical. The only adjustment needed is that the model
parameter $\tau_{gap}$ should be interpreted as representing the area-weighted
average optical depth within the gaps (or inter-wake regions).
  The most significant consequence of our results applies to the question of
why "propeller" structures observed in the mid-A ring are seen as
relative-bright features, even though the most prominent features of simulated
propellers are regions of relatively low density. We find preliminary
quantitative support for the hypothesis that propellers would be bright if they
involve a local and temporary disruption of self-gravity wakes, flooding the
region with more "photometrically active" material (i.e., material that can
contribute to the rings' local optical depth) even though the overall density
is lower, and thus raising their apparent brightnesses in agreement with
observations. We suggest that this mechanism be tested by future detailed
numerical models.
