We describe a new algorithm for the "perfect" extraction of one-dimensional
spectra from two-dimensional (2D) digital images of optical fiber
spectrographs, based on accurate 2D forward modeling of the raw pixel data. The
algorithm is correct for arbitrarily complicated 2D point-spread functions
(PSFs), as compared to the traditional optimal extraction algorithm, which is
only correct for a limited class of separable PSFs. The algorithm results in
statistically independent extracted samples in the 1D spectrum, and preserves
the full native resolution of the 2D spectrograph without degradation. Both the
statistical errors and the 1D resolution of the extracted spectrum are
accurately determined, allowing a correct chi-squared comparison of any model
spectrum with the data. Using a model PSF similar to that found in the red
channel of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrograph, we compare the
performance of our algorithm to that of cross-section based optimal extraction,
and also demonstrate that our method allows coaddition and foreground
estimation to be carried out as an integral part of the extraction step. This
work demonstrates the feasibility of current- and next-generation multi-fiber
spectrographs for faint galaxy surveys even in the presence of strong night-sky
foregrounds. We describe the handling of subtleties arising from fiber-to-fiber
crosstalk, discuss some of the likely challenges in deploying our method to the
analysis of a full-scale survey, and note that our algorithm could be
generalized into an optimal method for the rectification and combination of
astronomical imaging data.
