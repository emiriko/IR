We study a one-dimensional model of free fermions with $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$
supersymmetry and demonstrate how non-diagonal boundary conditions can be
incorporated into the framework of the graded Quantum Inverse Scattering Method
(gQISM) by means of \emph{super matrices} with entries from a superalgebra. For
super hermitian twists and open boundary conditions subject to a certain
constraint, we solve the eigenvalue problem for the super transfermatrix by
means of the graded algebraic Bethe ansatz technique (gABA) starting from a
fermionic coherent state. For generic boundary conditions the algebraic Bethe
ansatz can not be applied. In this case the spectrum of the super transfer
matrix is obtained from a functional relation.
