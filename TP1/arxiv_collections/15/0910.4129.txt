Graphs are closely related to quantum error-correcting codes: every
stabilizer code is locally equivalent to a graph code, and every codeword
stabilized code can be described by a graph and a classical code. For the
construction of good quantum codes of relatively large block length,
concatenated quantum codes and their generalizations play an important role. We
develop a systematic method for constructing concatenated quantum codes based
on "graph concatenation", where graphs representing the inner and outer codes
are concatenated via a simple graph operation called "generalized local
complementation." Our method applies to both binary and non-binary concatenated
quantum codes as well as their generalizations.
