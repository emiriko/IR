This communication is a natural and nontrivial continuation of the 2005 work
of Ahluwalia and Grumiller on Elko. Here we report that Elko breaks Lorentz
symmetry in a rather subtle and unexpected way by containing a `hidden'
preferred direction. Along this preferred direction, a quantum field based on
Elko enjoys locality. In the form reported here, Elko offers a mass dimension
one fermionic dark matter with a quartic self-interaction and a preferred axis
of locality. The locality result crucially depends on a judicious choice of
phases.
