Electronic Product Code (EPC) is the basis of a pervasive infrastructure for
the automatic identification of objects on supply chain applications (e.g.,
pharmaceutical or military applications). This infrastructure relies on the use
of the (1) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to tag objects in
motion and (2) distributed services providing information about objects via the
Internet. A lookup service, called the Object Name Service (ONS) and based on
the use of the Domain Name System (DNS), can be publicly accessed by EPC
applications looking for information associated with tagged objects. Privacy
issues may affect corporate infrastructures based on EPC technologies if their
lookup service is not properly protected. A possible solution to mitigate these
issues is the use of online anonymity. We present an evaluation experiment that
compares the of use of Tor (The second generation Onion Router) on a global
ONS/DNS setup, with respect to benefits, limitations, and latency.
