We study charmonium correlators and spectral functions in quenched QCD, using
Clover improved Wilson fermions on very fine (0.015 fm) isotropic lattices at
0.75 Tc and 1.5 Tc. We use a new approach to distinguish the zero mode
contribution from the other contributions. Once this is removed, we find that
the ratios of correlators to reconstructed correlators remain almost unity at
all distances. The ground state peaks of spectral functions obtained at 0.75 Tc
are reliable and robust. The present accuracy and limited number of points in
the temporal direction at 1.5 Tc do not allow for a reliable conclusion about a
possible melting of charmonium states in the QGP.
