We study synchronization of an array of rotors on a substrate that are
coupled by hydrodynamic interaction. The rotors that are modeled by an
effective rigid body, are driven by an internal torque and exerts an active
force on the surrounding fluid. The long-ranged nature of the hydrodynamic
interaction between the rotors causes a rich pattern of dynamical behaviors
including phase ordering and turbulent spiral waves. The model provides a novel
example of coupled oscillators with long-range interaction. Our results suggest
strategies for designing controllable microfluidic mixers using the emergent
behavior of hydrodynamically coupled active components.
