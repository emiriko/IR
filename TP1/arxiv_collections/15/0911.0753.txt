In this paper we propose an XML-based multi-agent recommender system for
supporting online recruitment services. Our system is characterized by the
following features: {\em (i)} it handles user profiles for personalizing the
job search over the Internet; {\em (ii)} it is based on the Intelligent Agent
Technology; {\em (iii)} it uses XML for guaranteeing a light, versatile and
standard mechanism for information representation, storing and exchange. The
paper discusses the basic features of the proposed system, presents the results
of an experimental study we have carried out for evaluating its performance,
and makes a comparison between the proposed system and other e-recruitment
systems already presented in the past.
