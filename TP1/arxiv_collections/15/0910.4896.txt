We introduce a droplet-jumping phenomenon on a superhydrophobic surface
driven by the resonant AC electrowetting. The resonant electrical actuation
enables a droplet to accumulate sufficient surface energy for jumping, and
superhydrophobic surface minimizes adhesion and hysteresis effects. They
provide the effective energy conversion from the surface energy to the kinetic
energy and improve the stability and the reproducibility of the droplet
jumping. The controlled droplet jumping made by the resonant AC electrowetting
could place another milestone in digital microfluidics by establishing a
potential way to realize the three-dimensional droplet manipulation based on
the conventional single plate EWOD configurations. This abstract is related to
a fluid dynamics video for the gallery of fluid motion 2009.
