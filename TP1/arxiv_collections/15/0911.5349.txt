We construct a class of anomaly-free supersymmetric U(1)' models that are
characterized by family non-universal U(1)' charges motivated from E_6
embeddings. The family non-universality arises from an interchange of the
standard roles of the two SU(5) 5* representations within the 27 of E_6 for the
third generation. We analyze U(1)' and electroweak symmetry breaking and
present the particle mass spectrum. The models, which include additional Higgs
multiplets and exotic quarks at the TeV scale, result in specific patterns of
flavor-changing neutral currents in the b to s transitions that can accommodate
the presently observed deviations inthis sector from the SM predictions.
