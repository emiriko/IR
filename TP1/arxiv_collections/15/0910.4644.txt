Near-threshold production of boson pairs is considered within the framework
of the model of unstable particles with smeared mass. We describe the principal
aspects of the model and consider the strategy of calculations including the
radiative corrections. The results of calculations are in good agreement with
LEP II data and Monte-Carlo simulations. Suggested approach significantly
simplifies calculations with respect to the standard perturbative one.
