Totally asynchronous code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems are
addressed. In Part I, the fundamental limits of asynchronous CDMA systems are
analyzed in terms of spectral efficiency and SINR at the output of the optimum
linear detector. The focus of Part II is the design of low-complexity
implementations of linear multiuser detectors in systems with many users that
admit a multistage representation, e.g. reduced rank multistage Wiener filters,
polynomial expansion detectors, weighted linear parallel interference
cancellers. The effects of excess bandwidth, chip-pulse shaping, and time delay
distribution on CDMA with suboptimum linear receiver structures are
investigated. Recursive expressions for universal weight design are given. The
performance in terms of SINR is derived in the large-system limit and the
performance improvement over synchronous systems is quantified. The
considerations distinguish between two ways of forming discrete-time
statistics: chip-matched filtering and oversampling.
