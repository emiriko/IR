We combine infinite-dimensional integration by parts procedures with a
recursive relation on moments (reminiscent of a formula by Barbour (1986)), and
deduce explicit expressions for cumulants of functionals of a general Gaussian
field. These findings yield a compact formula for cumulants on a fixed Wiener
chaos, virtually replacing the usual "graph/diagram computations" adopted in
most of the probabilistic literature.
