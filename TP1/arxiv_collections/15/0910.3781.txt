Within the framework of supersymmetry, charginos and/or neutralinos are often
the preferred topics of searches for experimental evidence. This is due to the
facts that in much of parameter space they are the lightest supersymmetric
partners and they offer unique final states to separate from standard model
backgrounds. The D0 experiment has performed several recent searches including
the traditional trilepton final state and a decay chain involving dark photons.
