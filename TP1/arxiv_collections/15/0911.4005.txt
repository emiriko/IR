A model -- by myself and Masao Ninomiya -- which in principle predicts the
initial conditions in a way as to minimze a certain functional of the history
of the Universe through both past and future -- a functional conceived of as an
imaginary part of the action -- is suggested to be also helpful in solving some
problems for quantum mechanics. Especially as our model almost makes it
possible in principle to calculate the full history of the universe, it even
makes it in principle calculable, which one among several measurement results
in a quantum experiment will actually be realized!
  Our "complex action model" thus is a special case of superdeterminism - in
Bells way - and does not have true causality, but rather even in some cases
true backward causation. In fact we claim in our model that the SSC
(Superconducting Supercollider) were stopped by the US Congress due to the
backward causation from the big amounts of Higgs particles, which it would have
produced, if it had been allowed to run. The noumenon ("das Ding an sich") in
our model is the Feyman path integrand or better some fundamental quantities
determined from second order effects of the latter integrand.
