We study the convergence rate of the solutions of the incompressible
Euler-$\alpha$, an inviscid second-grade complex fluid, equations to the
corresponding solutions of the Euler equations, as the regularization parameter
$\alpha$ approaches zero. First we show the convergence in $H^{s}$, $s>n/2+1$,
in the whole space, and that the smooth Euler-$\alpha$ solutions exist at least
as long as the corresponding solution of the Euler equations. Next we estimate
the convergence rate for two-dimensional vortex patch with smooth boundaries.
