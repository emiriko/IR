Discussing the limitations on the validity of classical electrodynamics, we
show that present day laser pulse technology applied to head-on-collisions with
relativistic electrons generates fields strong enough to permit experimentation
at the limits of validity of the Lorentz force, and the development of
experimental tests of Mach's principle. We also discuss more distant
opportunities for exploring the nature of laws of physics and the vacuum
structure. We then conclude that the predictions of quantum electrodynamics in
the presence of critical fields are not completely satisfactory and argue that
the study of Laser materialization into particle pairs opens a new domain of
quantum electrodynamics.
