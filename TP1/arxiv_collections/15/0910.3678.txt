Measurements of heat transport, as expressed by the Nusselt number $Nu$, are
reported for turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection of water containing up to
120 ppm by weight of poly-[ethylene oxide] with a molecular weight of
$4\times10^6$ g/mole. Over the Rayleigh number range $ 5\times 10^9 \alt Ra
\alt 7 \times 10^{10}$ $Nu$ is smaller than it is for pure water by up to 10%.
