It is shown in this paper that minisuperspace quantization of homogeneous and
isotropic geometries with phantom scalar fields, when examined in the light of
the Bohm-de Broglie interpretation of quantum mechanics, does not eliminate, in
general, the classical big rip singularity present in the classical model. For
some values of the Hamilton-Jacobi separation constant present in a class of
quantum state solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, the big rip can be
either completely eliminated or may still constitute a future attractor for all
expanding solutions. This is contrary to the conclusion presented in Ref.[1],
using a different interpretation of the wave function, where the big rip
singularity is completely eliminated ("smoothed out") through quantization,
independently of such separation constant and for all members of the above
mentioned class of solutions. This is an example of the very peculiar situation
where different interpretations of the same quantum state of a system are
predicting different physical facts, instead of just giving different
descriptions of the same observable facts: in fact, there is nothing more
observable than the fate of the whole Universe.
