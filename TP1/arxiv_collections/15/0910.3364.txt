As a natural extension of Fan's paper (arXiv: 0903.1769vl [quant-ph]) by
employing the formula of operators' Weyl ordering expansion and the bipartite
entangled state representation we find new two-fold complex integration
transformation about the Wigner operator (in its entangled form) in phase space
quantum mechanics and its inverse transformation. In this way, some operator
ordering problems can be solved and the contents of phase space quantum
mechanics can be enriched.
