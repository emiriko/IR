Using as ingredients the non-perturbative solutions of various QCD Green's
function obtained from Schwinger-Dyson equations (SDEs), we study two versions
of the QCD effective charge. The first one obtained from the pinch technique
gluon self-energy, and the second from the ghost-gluon vertex. Despite the
distinct nature of their buildings blocks, the two effectives charges are
almost identical in the entire range of momenta, due to a fundamental identity
relating the ghost dressing function with the two form factors of Green's
function, which is of central importance in the PT-BFM formalism. In this talk,
we outline how to derive this crucial identity from the SDEs of the
aforementioned Green's functions. The renormalization procedure that preserves
the validity of this identity is discussed in detail. Most importantly, we show
that due to the infrared finiteness of the gluon propagator, the QCD charge
obtained with either definition freezes in the deep infrared, in agreement with
theoretical and phenomenological expectations.
