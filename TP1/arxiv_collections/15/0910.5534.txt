We define the category of B-branes in a (not necessarily affine)
Landau-Ginzburg B-model, incorporating the notion of R-charge. Our definition
is a direct generalization of the category of perfect complexes. We then
consider pairs of Landau-Ginzburg B-models that arise as different GIT
quotients of a vector space by a one-dimensional torus, and show that for each
such pair the two categories of B-branes are quasi-equivalent. In fact we
produce a whole set of quasi-equivalences indexed by the integers, and show
that the resulting auto-equivalences are all spherical twists.
