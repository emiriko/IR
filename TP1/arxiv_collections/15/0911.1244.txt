We prove the so-called generalized Haff's law yielding the optimal algebraic
cooling rate of the temperature of a granular gas described by the homogeneous
Boltzmann equation for inelastic interactions with non constant restitution
coefficient. Our analysis is carried through a careful study of the infinite
system of moments of the solution to the Boltzmann equation for granular gases
and precise Lp estimates in the selfsimilar variables. In the process, we
generalize several results on the Boltzmann collision operator obtained
recently for homogeneous granular gases with constant restitution coefficient
to a broader class of physical restitution coefficients that depend on the
collision impact velocity. This generalization leads to the so-called
L1-exponential tails theorem. for this model.
