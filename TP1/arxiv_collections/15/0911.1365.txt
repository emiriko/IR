We present the first spectroscopic analysis of the faint M31 satellite
galaxies, AndXI and AndXIII, and a reanalysis of existing spectroscopic data
for two further faint companions, And IX and AndXII. By combining data obtained
using the DEIMOS spectrograph mounted on the Keck II telescope with deep
photometry from the Suprime-Cam instrument on Subaru, we have calculated global
properties for the dwarfs, such as systemic velocities, metallicites and
half-light radii.We find each dwarf to be very metal poor ([Fe/H] -2 both
photometrically and spectroscopically, from their stacked spectrum), and as
such, they continue to follow the luminosity-metallicity relationship
established with brighter dwarfs. We are unable to resolve a dispersion for And
XI due to small sample size and low S/N, but we set a one sigma upper limit of
sigma-v <5 km/s. For And IX, And XII and And XIII we resolve velocity
dispersions of v=4.5 (+3.4,-3.2), 2.6(+5.1,-2.6) and 9.7(+8.9,-4.5) km/s, and
derive masses within the half light radii of 6.2(+5.3,-5.1)x10^6 Msun, 2.4
(+6.5,-2.4)x10^6 Msun and 1.1(+1.4,-0.7)x10^7 Msun respectively. We discuss
each satellite in the context of the Mateo relations for dwarf spheroidal
galaxies, and the Universal halo profiles established for Milky Way dwarfs
(Walker et al. 2009). For both galaxies, this sees them fall below the
Universal halo profiles of Walker et al. (2009). When combined with the
findings of McConnachie & Irwin (2006a), which reveal that the M31 satellites
are twice as extended (in terms of both half-light and tidal radii) as their
Milky Way counterparts, these results suggest that the satellite population of
the Andromeda system could inhabit halos that are significantly different from
those of the Milky Way in terms of their central densities (abridged).
