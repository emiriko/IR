We discussed one-point functions of BPS Wilson loops in supersymmetric five
dimensional gauge theories defined on M_4\times S^1 by using path integral
expression of Wilson loops. We found that the Wilson loop gives interaction
terms between charged particles and certain gauge fields on the instanton
moduli space, and makes the non-charged particle charged under the gauge
fields.
