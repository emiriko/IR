Imaging of galaxies to study the interstellar medium on scales of a few pc is
difficult. However, for the Milky Way galaxy two major Galactic all sky HI
21-cm line surveys will become available soon with unprecedented quality. We
present the Galactic All Sky Survey (GASS) obtained with the Parkes 64-m
telescope for the southern hemisphere with a resolution of 15 arcmin. The
Effelsberg Bonn HI Survey (EBHIS) will complete the survey for the northern sky
with 9 arcmin resolution and we describe this project. A combined All Sky
Survey will become available in 2010/2011, early enough to serve as short
spacing information for ASKAP. We envision a Galactic 21-cm line database with
arcsecond resolution for all declinations <30 deg.
