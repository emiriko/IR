We describe algebraic certificates of positivity for functions belonging to a
finitely generated algebra of Borel measurable functions, with particular
emphasis to algebras generated by semi-algebraic functions. In which case the
standard global optimization problem with constraints given by elements of the
same algebra is reduced via a natural change of variables to the better
understood case of polynomial optimization. A collection of simple examples and
numerical experiments complement the theoretical parts of the article.
