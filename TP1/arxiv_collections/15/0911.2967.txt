A generalized Green-Kubo formula is derived for a quantum dissipative system
of driven Brownian particle, in which the coupling between the system and the
environment is linear. The structure is essentially the same as that for the
generalized Green-Kubo formula for driven granular particles. It is
demonstrated that the correction to the conventional Green-Kubo formula is zero
for a free Brownian particle.
