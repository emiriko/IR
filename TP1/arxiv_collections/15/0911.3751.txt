Three different approaches to derive mutual information via thermodynamics
are presented where the temperature-dependent energy is given by: (a) $\beta
\mathcal{E} = -\ln[P(X,Y)]$, (b) $\beta \mathcal{E} =-\ln[P(Y|X)]$ or (c)
$\beta \mathcal{E} =-\ln[P(X|Y)]$. All approaches require the extension of the
traditional physical framework and the modification of the 2nd law of
thermodynamics. A realization of a physical system with an effective
temperature-dependent Hamiltonian is discussed followed by a suggestion of a
physical information-heat engine.
