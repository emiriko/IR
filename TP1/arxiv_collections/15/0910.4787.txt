The recently observed X(3872) resonance, which is difficult to be assigned a
conventional $c\bar{c}$ charmonium state in the quark model, may be interpreted
as a molecular state. Such a molecular state is a hidden flavor four quark
state because of its charmonium-like quantum numbers. The s-channel one gluon
exchange is an interaction which only acts in the hidden flavor multi-quark
system. In this paper, we will study the X(3872) and other similiar hidden
flavor molecular states in a quark model by taking into account of the
s-channel one gluon exchange interaction.
