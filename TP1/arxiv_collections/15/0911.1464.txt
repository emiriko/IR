We present the most recent set of world averages for D0-D0bar mixing and CP
violation parameters, as obtained by the Heavy Flavor Averaging Group from a
global fit to various measurements. The values obtained for the mixing
parameters when allowing for CP violation are x= (0.98 +0.24 -0.26)% and y=
(0.83 +-0.16)%; the significance of mixing is 10.2 sigma. There is no evidence
for CP violation at the current level of sensitivity.
