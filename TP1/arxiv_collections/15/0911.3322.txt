We describe two complementary ways to show the presence of higher order
effects in the 1/m_Q expansion for inclusive B decays that have been dubbed
"Intrinsic Charm". Apart from the lessons they can teach us about QCD's
nonperturbative dynamics their consideration is relevant for precise
extractions of |V_{cb}|: for they complement the estimate of the potential
impact of 1/m_Q^4 contributions. We draw semiquantitative conclusions for the
expected scale of Weak Annihilation in semileptonic B decays, both for its
valence and non-valence components.
