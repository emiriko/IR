A method of measuring e+e- annihilation cross sections at low energy sqrt{s}<
5 GeV, using initial-state radiation, is described. Experimental data from the
PEP-II B-factory at 10.6 GeV center-of-mass energy, obtained via ISR, are
presented. The cross sections are measured for many processes e+e- --> 3pi,
4pi, 2K pi, 2K 2pi, 4K, p anti-p, Lambda anti-Lambda, D anti-D, ... . From the
measured cross sections the parameters of known resonances are improved, the
baryons form factors are derived and compared with theory predictions. New
states, e.g; Y(4260) and Y(2175), for which the internal structure is not yet
established, are observed.
