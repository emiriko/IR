The magnetic field dependence of the magnetisation ($M$) and the temperature
dependence of the ac susceptibility ($\chi' = dM/dH$) of CePd(1-x)Rh(x) single
crystals with $0.80 \leq x \leq 0.86$ are analysed within the frame of the
quantum Griffiths phase scenario, which predicts $M \propto H^{\lambda}$ and
$\chi' \propto T^{\lambda-1}$ with $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$. All $M$ vs $H$ and
$\chi'$ vs $T$ data follow the predicted power-law behaviour. The parameter
$\lambda$, extracted from $\chi'(T)$, is very sensitive to the Rh content $x$
and varies systematically with $x$ from -0.1 to 0.4. The value of $\lambda$,
derived from $M(H)$ measurements on a \cpr single crystal, seems to be rather
constant, $\lambda \approx 0.2$, in a broad range of temperatures between 0.05
and 2 K and fields up to about 10 T. All observed signatures and the $\lambda$
values are thus compatible with the quantum Griffiths scenario.
