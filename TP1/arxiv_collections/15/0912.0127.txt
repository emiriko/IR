A new accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar, IGR J17511-3057, was discovered in
outburst on 2009 September 12 during the INTEGRAL Galactic bulge monitoring
programme. To study the evolution of the source X-ray flux and spectral
properties during the outburst, we requested a Swift monitoring of
IGRJ17511-3057. In this paper we report on the results of the first two weeks
of monitoring the source. The persistent emission of IGR J17511-3057 during the
outburst is modeled well with an absorbed blackbody (kT~0.9 keV) and a
power-law component (photon index~1-2), similar to what has been observed from
other previously known millisecond pulsars. Swift also detected three type-I
Xray bursts from this source. By assuming that the peak luminosity of these
bursts is equal to the Eddington value for a pure helium type-I X-ray burst, we
derived an upper limit to the source distance of ~10 kpc. The theoretical,
expected recurrence time of the bursts according to the helium burst hypothesis
is 0.2-0.9 days, in agreement with the observations.
