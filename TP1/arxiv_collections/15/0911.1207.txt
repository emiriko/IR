The Casimir effect is investigated in cylindrical and toroidal carbon
nanotubes within the framework of the Dirac-like model for the electronic
states. The topological Casimir energy is positive for metallic cylindrical
nanotubes and is negative for semiconducting ones. The toroidal
compactification of a cylindrical nanotube along its axis increases the Casimir
energy for metallic-type (periodic) boundary conditions along its axis and
decreases the Casimir energy for the semiconducting-type compactifications. For
finite length metallic nanotubes the Casimir forces acting on the tube edges
are always attractive, whereas for semiconducting-type ones they are attractive
for small lengths of the nanotube and repulsive for large lengths.
