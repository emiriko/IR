Ground-state entanglement induces emergence of negative-energy-density
regions in quantum systems by squeezing zero-point oscillation, keeping total
energy of the systems nonnegative. By use of the negativity of quantum energy
density, protocols of quantum energy teleportation are proposed that transport
energy to distant sites by local operations and classical communication. The
energy is teleported without breaking any physical laws including causality and
local energy conservation. Because intermediate subsystems of the energy
transfer channel are not excited during the protocol execution, the protocol
attains energy transportation without heat generation in the channel. We
discuss the protocol focusing around qubit chains. In addition, we address a
related problem of breaking ground-state entanglement by measurements.
