We study a class of stochastic evolution equations with a dissipative forcing
nonlinearity and additive noise. The noise is assumed to satisfy rather general
assumptions about the form of the covariance function; our framework covers
examples of Gaussian processes, like fractional and bifractional Brownian
motion and also non Gaussian examples like the Hermite process. We give an
application of our results to the study of the stochastic version of a common
model of potential spread in a dendritic tree. Our investigation is specially
motivated by possibility to introduce long-range dependence in time of the
stochastic perturbation.
