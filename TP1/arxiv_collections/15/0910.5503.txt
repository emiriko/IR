On the example of a particular problem, the theory of vacancies, a new form
of kinetic equations symmetrically incorporation the internal and free energies
has been derived. The dynamical nature of irreversible phenomena at formation
and motion of defects (dislocations) has been analyzed by a computer
experiment. The obtained particular results are extended into a thermodynamic
identity involving the law of conservation of energy at interaction with an
environment (the 1st law of thermodynamics) and the law of energy
transformation into internal degree of freedom (relaxation). The identity is
compared with the analogous Jarzynski identity. The approach is illustrated by
simulation of processes during severe plastic deformation, the Rybin kinetic
equation for this case has been derived.
