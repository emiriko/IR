The dynamics of two coupled modes sharing one excitation is considered. A
scheme to inhibit the evolution of any initial state in subspace
$\{|1_{a},0_{b} >, |0_{a},1_{b}>\}$ is presented. The scheme is based on the
unitary interactions with an auxiliary subsystem, and it can be used to
preserve the initial entanglement of the system.
