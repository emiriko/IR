Spintronics is the generic term that describes magnetic systems coupled to an
electric generator, taking into account the spin attached to the charge
carriers. For this topical review of {\it Spin Caloritronics}, we focus our
attention on the study of {\it irreversible processes} occuring in spintronic
devices, that involve both the spins of the conduction electrons and the
ferromagnetic degrees of freedom. The aim of this report is to clarify the
nature of the different kinds of power dissipated in metallic ferromagnets
contacted to an electric generator, and to exploit it in the framework of the
theory of mesoscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The expression of the
internal power (i.e. the internal entropy production multiplied by the
temperature) dissipated by a generic system connected to different reservoirs,
allows the corresponding kinetic equations to be derived with the introduction
of the relevant phenomenological kinetic coefficients. After derivation of the
kinetic equations for the ferromagnetic degrees of freedom (i.e. the
Landau-Lifshitz equation) and the derivation of the kinetic equations for the
spin-accumulation effects (within a two channel model), the kinetic equations
describing spin-transfer are obtained. Both spin-dependent relaxation (usual
spin-accumulation) and spin-precession in quasi-ballistic regime (transverse
spin-accumulation) are taken into account. The generalization of the
Landau-Lifshitz equation to spin-accumulation is then performed with the
introduction of two potential energy terms, that are experimentally accessible.
