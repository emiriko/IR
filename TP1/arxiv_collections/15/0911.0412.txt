In this paper we parameterize non-negative matrices of sum one and rank at
most two. More precisely, we give a family of parameterizations using the least
possible number of parameters. We also show how these parameterizations relate
to a class of statistical models, known in Probability and Statistics as
mixture models for contingency tables.
