We study the well pronounced Moreton wave that occurred in as- sociation with
the X17.2 are/CME event of October 28, 2003. This Moreton wave is striking for
its global propagation and two separate wave centers, which implies that two
waves were launched simultane- ously. The mean velocity of the Moreton wave,
tracked within different sectors of propagation direction, lies in the range of
v ~ 900-1100 km/s with two sectors showing wave deceleration. The perturbation
profile analysis of the wave indicates amplitude growth followed by amplitude
weakening and broadening of the perturbation profile, which is con- sistent
with a disturbance first driven and then evolving into a freely propagating
wave. The EIT wavefront is found to lie on the same kinematical curve as the
Moreton wavefronts indicating that both are different signatures of the same
physical process. Bipolar coronal dim- mings are observed on the same opposite
East-West edges of the active region as the Moreton wave ignition centers. The
radio type II source, which is co-spatially located with the first wave front,
indicates that the wave was launched from an extended source region (& 60 Mm).
These findings suggest that the Moreton wave is initiated by the CME expanding
flanks.
