We discuss how to extract information about the cosmological constant from
the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, considered as an eigenvalue of a Sturm-Liouville
problem in a de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter background. The equation is
approximated to one loop with the help of a variational approach with Gaussian
trial wave functionals. A canonical decomposition of modes is used to separate
transverse-traceless tensors (graviton) from ghosts and scalar. We show that no
ghosts appear in the final evaluation of the cosmological constant. A zeta
function regularization is used to handle with divergences. A renormalization
procedure is introduced to remove the infinities together with a
renormalization group equation. We apply this procedure on the induced
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and, as an alternative, on the Newton constant
$G$. A brief discussion on the extension to a $f(R)$ theory is considered.
