The multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock equations are discussed
and solved for a one-dimensional model of the Helium atom. Results for the
ground state energy and two-particle density as well as the absorption spectrum
are presented and compared to direct solutions of the time-dependent
Schroedinger equation.
