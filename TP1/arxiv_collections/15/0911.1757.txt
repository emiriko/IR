It has proven a significant challenge to experiment and phenomenology to
extract precise values of the nucleon sigma terms. This difficulty opens the
window for lattice QCD simulations to lead the field in resolving this aspect
of nucleon structure. Here we report on recent advances in the extraction of
nucleon sigma terms in lattice QCD. In particular, the strangeness component is
now being resolved to a precision that far surpasses best phenomenological
estimates.
