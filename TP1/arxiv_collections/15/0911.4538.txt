We investigate the nonlinear response of photonic crystal waveguides with
suppressed two-photon absorption. A moderate decrease of the group velocity (~
c/6 to c/15, a factor of 2.5) results in a dramatic (30x) enhancement of
three-photon absorption well beyond the expected scaling, proportional to
1/(vg)^3. This non-trivial scaling of the effective nonlinear coefficients
results from pulse compression, which further enhances the optical field beyond
that of purely slow-group velocity interactions. These observations are enabled
in mm-long slow-light photonic crystal waveguides owing to the strong anomalous
group-velocity dispersion and positive chirp. Our numerical physical model
matches measurements remarkably.
