It is a long-standing question whether an arbitrary variety is desingularized
by finitely many normalized Nash blow-ups. We consider this question in the
case of a toric variety. We interpret the normalized Nash blow-up in polyhedral
terms, show how continued fractions can be used to give an affirmative answer
for a toric surface, and report on a computer investigation in which over a
thousand 3- and 4-dimensional toric varieties were successfully resolved.
