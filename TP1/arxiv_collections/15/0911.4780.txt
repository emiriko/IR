In this paper we analyze again a transition from the classical to quantum
description of bound charged particles, which involves a substantial
modification of the structure of their electromagnetic (EM) fields related to
the well-known fact that bound micro-particles do not radiate in sta-tionary
energy states. We show that a simple exclusion of the radiative component of EM
field produced by bound particles leads to a violation of the energy-momentum
conservation law, if the non-radiative EM field is left unmodified. In order to
restore the energy-momentum conservation, we make a closer look at the
interaction of two hypothetical classical charges with the prohibited radiation
component of their EM field and bring the appropriate modifications in the
structure of their bound EM field and, accordingly, in the Hamilton function of
this system. In comparison with the common Hamilton function for the one-body
problem, the electric interaction energy is multiplied by the Lorentz factor of
orbiting charged particle, and its rest mass m is replaced by an effective rest
mass parameter, which includes the interaction EM energy. We introduce, as a
novel postulate, these replacements into the Dirac equation for the bound
electron and show that the solution of the modified Dirac Coulomb equation
gives the same gross and fine structure of energy levels, as the one furnished
by the conventional approach, for hydrogen-like atoms. The correction to
spin-spin splitting of 1S state of hydrogen and heavier atoms is much smaller
than nuclear structure contribution and can be ignored. However, as discussed
in the part 2 of this paper, our approach does induce corrections to the energy
levels at the scale of hyperfine interactions, which at once remove a number of
long-standing discrepancies between theory and experiment in the atomic
physics.
