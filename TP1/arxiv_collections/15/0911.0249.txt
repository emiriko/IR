We study the implementation of quantum phase measurement in a superconducting
circuit, where two Josephson phase qubits are coupled to the photon field
inside a resonator. We show that the relative phase of the superposition of two
Fock states can be imprinted in one of the qubits. The qubit can thus be used
to probe and store the quantum coherence of two distinguishable Fock states of
the single-mode photon field inside the resonator. The effects of dissipation
of the photon field on the phase detection are investigated. We find that the
visibilities can be greatly enhanced if the Kerr nonlinearity is exploited. We
also show that the phase measurement method can be used to perform the Gauss
sum factorization of numbers (${\geq} 10^4$) into a product of prime integers,
as well as to precisely measure both the resonator's frequency and the
nonlinear interaction strength. The largest factorizable number is mainly
limited by the coherence time. If the relaxation time of the resonator were to
be ${\sim} 10$ $\mu$s (${\sim} 1$ ms), then the largest factorizable number can
be ${\geq} 10^4N$ (${\geq} 10^{7}N$), where $N$ is the number of photons in the
resonator.
