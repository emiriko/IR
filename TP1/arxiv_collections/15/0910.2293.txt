We look at the odd nilpotent orbits of osp(2n+1,2n), giving a combinatorial
interpretation which enables us, via the square map, to explain the link with
even nilpotent orbits. We then study the closure ordering of the odd nilpotent
orbits. Finally, we give a desingularization of the odd nilpotent cone.
