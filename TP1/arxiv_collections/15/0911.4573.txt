In this article we provide a comparison of classical dynamical x-ray
diffraction theory with the dynamical theory for the wide-angle case. It is
shown that it is possible for the true value of the angular variable to be
introduced without application of the dispersion theory. Wide-angle x-ray
diffraction theory is in an excellent agreement with Zaus correction of the
angular parameter.
