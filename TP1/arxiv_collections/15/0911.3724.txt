Melting behaviors of aluminum (111) perfect/nonperfect surfaces,
characterized by structure ordering parameter, have been investigated by
classical molecular dynamics simulation with embedded atom method potential. Al
(111) perfect surface has a superheating temperature above bulk Al melting
point Tm, in this work, by about 80 K. Al nonperfect (111) surface has somewhat
different local lattice structure from that on (111) perfect surface. Al
nonperfect (111) surfaces tempt to premelt when temperature is less than Tm, in
our simulation, by about 45 K. Aluminum atoms on the nonperfect surface zones
are the sources of surface melting, and have larger velocities than those on
the perfect surface zones.
