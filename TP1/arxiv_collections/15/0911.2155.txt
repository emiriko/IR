Single trapped and laser cooled Radium ion as a possible candidate for
measuring the parity violation induced frequency shift has been discussed here.
Even though the technique to be used is similar to that proposed by Fortson
[1], Radium has its own advantages and disadvantages. The most attractive part
of Radium ion as compared to that of Barium ion is its mass which comes along
with added complexity of instability as well as other issues which are
discussed here
