In this paper, we first review some basic concepts associated with a model
for social interaction previously proposed by us. Each agent is seen as an
array of variables that can be found in different states. The agents are then
allowed to interact and form groups based on their variables. We discuss how
spin-glass type physics may be appropriate for our model. Several types of
variables and costs associated with flipping the variables are discussed. Then
some simple graphs are presented to understand the formation of various levels
of identities within social clusters. In the end, we analyze events from the
French revolution and the Russian revolution to to understand how different
variables and identities interact within a hierarchical social structure.
