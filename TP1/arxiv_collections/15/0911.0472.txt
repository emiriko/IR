We present the results of fits to recent asqtad data in the light
pseudoscalar sector using SU(2) partially-quenched staggered chiral
perturbation theory. Superfine (a~0.06 fm) and ultrafine (a~0.045 fm) ensembles
are used, where light sea quark masses and taste splittings are small compared
to the strange quark mass. Our fits include continuum NNLO chiral logarithms
and analytic terms. We give preliminary results for the pion decay constant,
SU(2) low-energy constants and the chiral condensate in the two-flavor chiral
limit.
