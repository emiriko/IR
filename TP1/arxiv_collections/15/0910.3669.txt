Using a microlensing analysis of 11-years of OGLE V-band photometry of the
four image gravitational lens Q2237+0305, we measure the inclination i of the
accretion disk to be cos i > 0.66 at 68% confidence. Very edge on (cos i <
0.39) solutions are ruled out at 95% confidence. We measure the V-band radius
of the accretion disk, defined by the radius where the temperature matches the
monitoring band photon emission, to be R_V = 5.8 (+3.8) (-2.3) x 10^15 cm
assuming a simple thin disk model and including the uncertainties in its
inclination. The projected radiating area of the disk remains too large to be
consistent with the observed flux for a T proportional to R^-3/4 thin disk
temperature profile. There is no strong correlation between the direction of
motion (peculiar velocity) of the lens galaxy and the orientation of the disk.
