The CMS Collaboration conducted a month-long data taking exercise, the Cosmic
Run At Four Tesla, during October-November 2008, with the goal of commissioning
the experiment for extended operation. With all installed detector systems
participating, CMS recorded 270 million cosmic ray events with the solenoid at
a magnetic field strength of 3.8 T. This paper describes the data flow from the
detector through the various online and offline computing systems, as well as
the workflows used for recording the data, for aligning and calibrating the
detector, and for analysis of the data.
