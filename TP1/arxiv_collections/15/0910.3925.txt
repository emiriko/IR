We examine supersymmetric theories with approximately conformal sectors.
Without an IR cutoff the theory has a continuum of modes, which are often
referred to as "unparticles." Making use of the AdS/CFT correspondence we find
that in the presence of a soft-wall, a gap in the spectrum can arise,
separating the zero-modes from the continuum modes. In some cases there are
also discrete massive levels in the gap. We also show that when supersymmetry
is broken the superpartner of a quark or lepton may simply be a bosonic
continuum above a gap. Such extensions of the standard model have novel
signatures at the LHC.
