We study two-bodies gravitational problem where the mass of one of the bodies
varies and suffers a damping-antidamping effect due to star wind during its
motion. A constant of motion, a Lagrangian and a Hamiltonian are given for the
radial motion of the system, and the period of the body is studied using the
constant of motion of the system. An application to the comet motion is given,
using the comet Halley as an example.
