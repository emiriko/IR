Based on the points-set transformation concept about the motion
transformation in continuum, the macro classical strain is expressed by the
additive addition of the intrinsic stretching of material element and its
intrinsic local rotation. For zero classical strain (no macro deformation
observed on its configuration surface, suitable container is required for
liquid and gas to make up macro invariant configuration), the results show
that: (1) For solid, the local rotation angular is zero. The material element
has no intrinsic stretching. (2) For liquid, the local rotation will not change
the basic gauge tensor. The material element has intrinsic plane stretching on
the rotation plane. (3) For gas state, the intrinsic local rotation will
amplify the basic gauge tensor. The material element has intrinsic stretching
along the rotation direction. Hence, under the condition of no macro classical
strain be observed, the material element has three different physical states:
solid (no intrinsic stretching), fluid (plane intrinsic stretching), and gas
(directional intrinsic stretching). Furthermore, for the three states, the free
conditions are defined by zero intrinsic stretching. Referring to this free
condition, the constitutive equations for the materials at multiple states are
established.
