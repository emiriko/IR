An exact solution for the field of a charge in a uniformly accelerated
noninertial frame of reference (NFR) alongside the "Equivalent Situation
Postulate" allows one to find space-time structure as well as fields from
arbitrarily shaped charged conductors, without using Einstein's equations. In
particular, the space-time metric over a charged plane can be related to the
metric being obtained from an exact solution to Einstein-Maxwell's equations.
This solution describes an equilibrium of charged dust in parallel electric and
gravitational fields. The field and metric outside a conducting ball have been
found. The method proposed eliminates divergence of the proper energy and makes
classical electrodynamics consistent at any sufficiently small distances. An
experiment is proposed to verify the approach suggested.
