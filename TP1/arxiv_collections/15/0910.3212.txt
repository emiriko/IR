We present a parametric analysis of the intracluster medium and gravitating
mass distribution of a statistical sample of 20 galaxy clusters using the
phenomenological cluster model of Ascasibar and Diego. We describe an effective
scheme for the estimation of errors on model parameters and derived quantities
using bootstrap resampling. We find that the model provides a good description
of the data in all cases and we quantify the mean fractional intrinsic scatter
about the best-fit density and temperature profiles, finding this to have
median values across the sample of 2 and 5 per cent, respectively. In addition,
we demonstrate good agreement between r500 determined directly from the model
and that estimated from a core-excluded global spectrum. We compare cool core
and non-cool core clusters in terms of the logarithmic slopes of their gas
density and temperature profiles and the distribution of model parameters and
conclude that the two categories are clearly separable. In particular, we
confirm the effectiveness of the logarithmic gradient of the gas density
profile measured at 0.04 r500 in differentiating between the two types of
cluster.
