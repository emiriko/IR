Single molecule force spectroscopy methods can be used to generate folding
trajectories of biopolymers from arbitrary regions of the folding landscape. We
illustrate the complexity of the folding kinetics and generic aspects of the
collapse of RNA and proteins upon force quench, using simulations of an RNA
hairpin and theory based on the de Gennes model for homopolymer collapse. The
folding time, $\tau_F$, depends asymmetrically on $\delta f_S = f_S - f_m$ and
$\delta f_Q = f_m - f_Q$ where $f_S$ ($f_Q$) is the stretch (quench) force, and
$f_m$ is the transition mid-force of the RNA hairpin. In accord with
experiments, the relaxation kinetics of the molecular extension, $R(t)$, occurs
in three stages: a rapid initial decrease in the extension is followed by a
plateau, and finally an abrupt reduction in $R(t)$ that occurs as the native
state is approached.
  The duration of the plateau increases as $\lambda =\tau_Q/\tau_F$ decreases
(where $\tau_Q$ is the time in which the force is reduced from $f_S$ to $f_Q$).
Variations in the mechanisms of force quench relaxation as $\lambda$ is altered
are reflected in the experimentally measurable time-dependent entropy, which is
computed directly from the folding trajectories. An analytical solution of the
de Gennes model under tension reproduces the multistage stage kinetics in
$R(t)$. The prediction that the initial stages of collapse should also be a
generic feature of polymers is validated by simulation of the kinetics of
toroid (globule) formation in semiflexible (flexible) homopolymers in poor
solvents upon quenching the force from a fully stretched state. Our findings
give a unified explanation for multiple disparate experimental observations of
protein folding.
