We use exact numerical diagonalization in the search of fractional quantum
Hall states with non-Abelian quasiparticle statistics. For the (most promising)
states in a partially filled second Landau level, the search is narrowed to the
range of filling factors $7/3 <\nu_e<8/3$. In this range, the analysis of
energy spectra and correlation functions, calculated including finite width and
Landau level mixing, supports the prominent non-Abelian candidates at
$\nu_e=5/2$ (paired Moore--Read "pfafian" state) and 12/5 (clustered
Read--Rezayi "parafermion" state). Outside of this range, the noninteracting
composite fermion model with four attached flux quanta is validated, yielding
the family of quantum liquids with fractional, but Abelian statistics. The
borderline $\nu_e=7/3$ state is shown to be adiabatically connected to the
Laughlin liquid, but its short-range correlations are significantly different.
