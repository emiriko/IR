Quasars (Quasi Stellar Objects, abbreviated as QSOs) are still nowadays,
close to half a century after their discovery, objects which are not completel
y understood. In this brief review a description of the pending problems,
inconsistencies and caveats in the QSO's research is presented. The standard
paradigm model based on the existence of very massive black holes that are
responsible for the QSO's huge luminosities, resulting from to their
cosmological redshifts, leaves many facts without explanation. There are
several observations which lack a clear explanation, for instance: the absence
of bright QSOs at low redshifts, a mysterious evolution not properly
understood; the inconsistencies of the absorption lines, such as the different
structure of the clouds along the QSO's line of sight and their tangential
directions; the spatial correlation between QSOs and galaxies; and many others.
