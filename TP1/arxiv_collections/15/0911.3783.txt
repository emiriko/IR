We propose a method of manipulating a quantum register remotely with the help
of a single ancilla that steers the evolution of the register. The fully
controlled ancilla qubit is coupled to the computational register solely via a
fixed unitary two-qubit interaction, E, and then measured in suitable bases. We
characterize all interactions E that induce a unitary, step-wise deterministic
measurement back-action on the register sufficient to implement any arbitrary
quantum channel. Our scheme offers significant experimental advantages for
implementing computations, preparing states and performing generalized
measurements as no direct control of the register is required.
