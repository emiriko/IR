We compare two strategies of multi-detector detection of compact binary
inspiral signals, namely, the coincidence and the coherent for the realistic
case of geographically separated detectors.We compare the performances of the
methods by plotting the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) for the
strategies. Several results are derived analytically in order to gain insight.
Simulations are performed in order to plot the ROC curves. A single
astrophysical source as well as a distribution of sources is considered. We
find that the coherent strategy is superior to the two coincident strategies
that we consider. Remarkably, the detection probability of the coherent
strategy is 50% better than the naive coincident strategy. One the other hand,
difference in performance between the coherent strategy and enhanced coincident
strategy is not very large. Even in this situation, it is not difficult to
perform the real data analysis with the coherent strategy. The bottom line is
that the coherent strategy is a good detection strategy.
