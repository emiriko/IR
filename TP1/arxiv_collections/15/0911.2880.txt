We reexamine the conventional arguments concerned with the scaling and
decoupling solutions for the ghost and gluon propagators in the Landau gauge
Yang-Mills theory. We point out a few issues to be clarified, which seems to be
overlooked in the previous investigations in this field, in the fully
non-perturbative treatment. We propose a trick which enables one to incorporate
the Gribov horizon directly into the self-consistent Schwinger-Dyson equation
in the gauge-fixed Yang-Mills theory, using the Gribov-Zwanziger framework with
the horizon term. We obtain the following results, irrespective of the choice
of the horizon term. (i) We find that there exists a family of solutions
parameterized by one-parameter $w_R(0)$ which was assumed to be zero
implicitly. The family includes both the scaling and decoupling solutions, and
specification of the parameter discriminates between them. (ii) We observe that
the inclusion of the horizon term cancels the ultraviolet divergence in the
Schwinger-Dyson equation for the ghost propagator and the resulting
(non-perturbative) self-consistent solution becomes ultraviolet finite. In
other words, the horizon condition interpolates between the infrared behavior
and the ultraviolet one. This leads to the incompatibility of the conventional
multiplicative renormalization scheme with the Gribov
