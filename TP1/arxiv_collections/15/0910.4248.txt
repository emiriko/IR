Through a particularly chosen coordinate transformation, we propose an
optical carpet cloak that only requires homogeneous anisotropic dielectric
material. The proposed cloak could be easily imitated and realized by
alternative layers of isotropic dielectrics. To demonstrate the cloaking
performance, we have designed a two-dimensional version that a uniform silicon
grating structure fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator wafer could work as an
infrared carpet cloak. The cloak has been validated through full wave
electromagnetic simulations, and the non-resonance feature also enables a
broadband cloaking for wavelengths ranging from 1372 to 2000 nm.
