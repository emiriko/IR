Relativistic heavy-ion collisions at BNL/RHIC have created a hot and dense
nuclear matter, the strongly interacting Quark-Gluon Plasma (sQGP). Hard
probes, high transverse momentum particles and jets, interact with the sQGP
medium and lose energy. The interactions modify the properties of the hard
probes; the medium responds to the energy loss of those probes in a collective
way. Many properties of the sQGP have been learned from the modifications to
the probes and the medium responses. I will review jet-like correlation results
from RHIC, especially those measured by three-particle correlations, and
discuss some of the fascinating physics.
