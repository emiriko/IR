Self-consistent, mean-field description of charge injection into a dielectric
medium is modified to account for discreteness of charge carriers. The improved
scheme includes both the Schottky barrier lowering due to the individual image
charge and the barrier change due to the field penetration into the injecting
electrode that ensures validity of the model at both high and low injection
rates including the barrier dominated and the space-charge dominated regimes.
Comparison of the theory with experiment on an unipolar ITO/PPV/Au-device is
presented.
