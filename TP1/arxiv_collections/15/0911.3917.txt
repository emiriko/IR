The random diffusion model is a continuum model for a conserved scalar
density field driven by diffusive dynamics where the bare diffusion coefficient
is density dependent. We generalize the model from one with a sharp wavenumber
cutoff to one with a more natural large-wavenumber cutoff. We investigate
whether the features seen previously -- namely a slowing down of the system and
the development of a prepeak in the dynamic structure factor at a wavenumber
below the first structure peak -- survive in this model. A method for
extracting information about a hidden prepeak in experimental data is
presented.
