The work presented in this paper is related to the area of situational method
engineering (SME). In this domain, approaches are developed accordingly to
specific project specifications. We propose to adapt an existing method
construction process, namely the assembly-based one. One of the particular
features of assembly-based SME approach is the selection of method chunks. Our
proposal is to offer a better guidance in the retrieval of chunks by the
introduction of multicriteria techniques. To use them efficiently, we defined a
typology of projects characteristics, in order to identify all their critical
aspects, which will offer a priorisation to help the method engineer in the
choice between similar chunks.
