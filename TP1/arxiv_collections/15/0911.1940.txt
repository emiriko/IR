The role of Coulomb correlations in the iron pnictide LaFeAsO is studied by
generalizing exact diagonalization dynamical mean field theory to five
orbitals. For rotationally invariant Hund's rule coupling a continuous
transition from a paramagnetic Fermi-liquid phase to a non-Fermi-liquid
metallic phase exhibiting frozen moments is found at moderate Coulomb energies.
For Ising-like exchange, this transition is first order and occurs at a lower
critical Coulomb energy. The correlation-induced scattering rate as a function
of doping relative to half-filling, i.e., delta = n/5-1, where n=6 for the
undoped material, is shown to be qualitatively similar to the one in the
two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model. In this scenario, the parent Mott
insulator of LaFeAsO is the half-filled n=5 limit, while the undoped n=6
material corresponds to the critical doping region delta_c ~ 0.2 in the
cuprates, on the verge between the Fermi-liquid phase of the overdoped region
and the non-Fermi-liquid pseudogap phase in the underdoped region.
