We have measured the magnetic splitting, $\Delta_K$, of a Kondo peak in the
differential conductance of a Single-Electron Transistor while tuning the Kondo
temperature, $T_K$, along two different paths in the parameter space: varying
the dot-lead coupling at a constant dot energy, and vice versa. At a high
magnetic field, $B$, the changes of $\Delta_K$ with $T_K$ along the two paths
have opposite signs, indicating that $\Delta_K$ is not a universal function of
$T_K$. At low $B$, we observe a decrease in $\Delta_K$ with $T_K$ along both
paths, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we find
$\Delta_K/\Delta<1$ at low $B$ and $\Delta_K/\Delta>1$ at high $B$, where
$\Delta$ is the Zeeman energy of the bare spin, in the same system.
