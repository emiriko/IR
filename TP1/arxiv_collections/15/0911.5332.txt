In the planar N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, the conformal symmetry
constrains multi-loop n-edged Wilson loops to be basically given in terms of
the one-loop n-edged Wilson loop, augmented, for n greater than 6, by a
function of conformally invariant cross ratios. We identify a class of
kinematics for which the Wilson loop exhibits exact Regge factorisation and
which leave invariant the analytic form of the multi-loop n-edged Wilson loop.
In those kinematics, the analytic result for the Wilson loop is the same as in
general kinematics, although the computation is remarkably simplified with
respect to general kinematics. Using the simplest of those kinematics, we have
performed the first analytic computation of the two-loop six-edged Wilson loop
in general kinematics.
