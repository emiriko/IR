By exploring the scattering of specific helicity states in quark-gluon
scattering at tree level we show explicitly that the t-channel pole can be
described exactly as a contraction of two local currents. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that out of eight non-zero helicity possibilities, only two
suppressed channels have contributions that are not pure, factorised t-channel
poles. We thereby extract a gauge-invariant definition for the t-channel
current generated by the scattering of a gluon. This offers a slight
improvement in the description of gluon scattering in the framework of
arXiv:0908.2786 for the prediction of n-jet rates at hadron colliders.
