We numerically show fractal Weyl law behavior in an open Hamiltonian system
that is described by a smooth potential and which supports numerous
above-barrier resonances. This behavior holds even relatively far away from the
classical limit. The complex resonance wave functions are found to be localized
on the fractal classical repeller.
