This paper reports on H-band interferometric observations of Betelgeuse made
at the three-telescope interferometer IOTA. We image Betelgeuse and its
asymmetries to understand the spatial variation of the photosphere, including
its diameter, limb darkening, effective temperature, surrounding brightness,
and bright (or dark) star spots. We used different theoretical simulations of
the photosphere and dusty environment to model the visibility data. We made
images with parametric modeling and two image reconstruction algorithms: MIRA
and WISARD. We measure an average limb-darkened diameter of 44.28 +/- 0.15 mas
with linear and quadratic models and a Rosseland diameter of 45.03 +/- 0.12 mas
with a MARCS model. These measurements lead us to derive an updated effective
temperature of 3600 +/- 66 K. We detect a fully-resolved environment to which
the silicate dust shell is likely to contribute. By using two imaging
reconstruction algorithms, we unveiled two bright spots on the surface of
Betelgeuse. One spot has a diameter of about 11 mas and accounts for about 8.5%
of the total flux. The second one is unresolved (diameter < 9 mas) with 4.5% of
the total flux. Resolved images of Betelgeuse in the H band are asymmetric at
the level of a few percent. The MOLsphere is not detected in this wavelength
range. The amount of measured limb-darkening is in good agreement with model
predictions. The two spots imaged at the surface of the star are potential
signatures of convective cells.
