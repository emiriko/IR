We study a new inflation potential in the framework of the Randall-Sundrum
type 2 Braneworld model. Using the technic developped in(Phys. Rev. D75, 123504
(2007).1), we consider both an monomial and a new inflation potentials and
apply the Slow-Roll approximation in high energy limit, to derive analytical
expression of relevant perturabtion spectrum. We show that for some values of
the parameter n of the potential, we obtain an perturbation spectrum wich
present a good agreement with recent WMAP5 observations.
