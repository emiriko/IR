In the context of the semiclassical treatment of Hawking radiation we prove
the universality of the reduced canonical momentum for the system of a massive
shell self gravitating in a spherical gravitational field within the Painlev\'e
family of gauges. We show that one can construct modes which are regular on the
horizon both by considering as hamiltonian the exterior boundary term and by
using as hamiltonian the interior boundary term. The late time expansion is
given in both approaches and their time Fourier expansion computed to reproduce
the self reaction correction to the Hawking spectrum.
