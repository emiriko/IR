In a Comment [arXiv:0910.1256], Behnia contends that the surface theory put
forward in our recent Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 136803 (2009);
arXiv:0905.0689] as an alternative explanation of the anomalous peaks observed
in Nernst measurement on a single-crystal bismuth sample at high (> 9 T)
magnetic fields [Science 317, 1729 (2007); arXiv:0802.1993] is not consistent
with the order of magnitude and shape of the anomalous peaks observed in the
experiment. We explain in this Reply why this contention is not true.
