Evolutionary game theory has been successfully used to investigate the
dynamics of systems, in which many entities have competitive interactions. From
a physics point of view, it is interesting to study conditions under which a
coordination or cooperation of interacting entities will occur, be it spins,
particles, bacteria, animals, or humans. Here, we analyze the case, where the
entities are heterogeneous, particularly the case of two populations with
conflicting interactions and two possible states. For such systems, explicit
mathematical formulas will be determined for the stationary solutions and the
associated eigenvalues, which determine their stability. In this way, four
different types of system dynamics can be classified, and the various kinds of
phase transitions between them will be discussed. While these results are
interesting from a physics point of view, they are also relevant for social,
economic, and biological systems, as they allow one to understand conditions
for (1) the breakdown of cooperation, (2) the coexistence of different
behaviors ("subcultures"), (2) the evolution of commonly shared behaviors
("norms"), and (4) the occurrence of polarization or conflict. We point out
that norms have a similar function in social systems that forces have in
physics.
