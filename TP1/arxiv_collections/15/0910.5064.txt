We perform ideal-magnetohydrodynamic axisymmetric simulations of magnetically
confined mountains on an accreting neutron star, with masses less than ~0.12
solar masses. We consider two scenarios, in which the mountain sits atop a hard
surface or sinks into a soft, fluid base. We find that the ellipticity of the
star, due to a mountain grown on a hard surface, approaches ~2e-4 for accreted
masses greater than ~1.2e-3 solar masses, and that sinking reduces the
ellipticity by between 25% and 60%. The consequences for gravitational
radiation from low-mass x-ray binaries are discussed.
