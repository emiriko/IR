Full jet reconstruction in heavy-ion collisions enables a complete study of
the modification of jet structure due to energy loss in hot and dense QCD
matter, but is challenging due to the high multiplicity environment. The STAR
and PHENIX collaborations at RHIC have recently presented measurements of fully
reconstructed jets from p+p, Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 200 \mathrm{GeV}$. We review the first results on
inclusive jet spectra, di-jets and fragmentation functions and discuss their
implications on understanding of jet quenching.
