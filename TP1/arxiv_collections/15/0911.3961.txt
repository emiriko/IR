BACKGROUND: Pressure sores are localized injuries to the skin and underlying
tissues and are mainly resulting from overpressure. Paraplegic peoples are
particularly subjects to pressure sores because of long-time seated postures
and sensory deprivation at the lower limbs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
Here we report outcomes of a feasibility trial involving a biofeedback system
aimed at reducing buttock overpressure whilst an individual is seated. The
system consists of (1) pressure sensors, (2) a laptop coupling sensors and
actuator (3) a wireless Tongue Display Unit (TDU) consisting of a circuit
embedded in a dental retainer with electrodes put in contact with the tongue.
The principle consists in (1) detecting overpressures in people who are seated
over long periods of time, (2) estimating a postural change that could reduce
these overpressures and (3) communicating this change through directional
information transmitted by the TDU. Twenty-four healthy subjects voluntarily
participated in this study. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The findings suggest
that, in this trial, subjects were able to use a tongue tactile feedback system
to reduce buttock overpressure while seated. Further evaluation of this system
on paraplegic subjects remains to be done.
