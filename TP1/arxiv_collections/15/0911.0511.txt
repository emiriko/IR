The $T$-adic exponential sum of a polynomial in one variable is studied. An
explicit arithmetic polygon in terms of the highest two exponents of the
polynomial is proved to be a lower bound of the Newton polygon of the
$C$-function of the T-adic exponential sum. This bound gives lower bounds for
the Newton polygon of the $L$-function of exponential sums of $p$-power order.
