We define a quasiclassical limit of the Lian-Zuckerman homotopy BV algebra
(quasiclassical LZ algebra) on the subcomplex, corresponding to "light modes",
i.e. the elements of zero conformal weight, of the semi-infinite (BRST)
cohomology complex of the Virasoro algebra associated with vertex operator
algebra (VOA) with a formal parameter. We also construct a certain deformation
of the BRST differential parametrized by a constant two-component tensor, such
that it leads to the deformation of the $A_{\infty}$-subalgebra of the
quasiclassical LZ algebra. Altogether this gives a functor the category of VOA
with a formal parameter to the category of $A_{\infty}$-algebras. The
associated generalized Maurer-Cartan equation gives the analogue of the
Yang-Mills equation for a wide class of VOAs. Applying this construction to an
example of VOA generated by $\beta$-$\gamma$ systems, we find a remarkable
relation between the Courant algebroid and the homotopy algebra of the
Yang-Mills theory.
