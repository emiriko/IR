We have studied how the hysteretic voltage-induced torsional strain,
associated with charge-density-wave depinning, in orthorhombic tantalum
trisulfide depends on square-wave and triangle-wave voltages of different
frequencies and amplitudes. The strains are measured by placing the sample,
with a wire glued to the center as a transducer, in a radio frequency cavity
and measuring the modulated response of the cavity. From the triangle waves, we
map out the time dependence of the hysteresis loops, and find that the
hysteresis loops broaden for waves with periods less than 30 seconds. The
square-wave response shows that the dynamic response to positive and negative
voltages can be quite different. The overall frequency dependence is
relaxational, but with multiple relaxation times which typically decrease with
increasing voltage. The detailed dynamic response is very sample dependent,
suggesting that it depends in detail on interactions of the CDW with sample
defects.
