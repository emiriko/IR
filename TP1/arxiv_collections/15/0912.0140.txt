We performed combined infrared reflection and ellipsometry measurements of
the in-plane optical reponse of single crystals of the pnictide high
temperature superconductor BaFe$_{1.87}$Co$_{0.13}$As$_{2}$ with $T_{c}$ = 24.5
K. We observed characteristic superconductivity-induced changes which provide
evidence for at least three different energy gaps. We show that a BCS-model of
isotropic gaps with 2$\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}$ of 3.1, 4.7, and 9.2 reproduces the
experimental data rather well. We also determine the low-temperature value of
the in-plane magnetic penetration depth of 270 nm.
