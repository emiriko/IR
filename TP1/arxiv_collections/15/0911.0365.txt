The methodology for modeling grain-surface chemistry has been greatly
improved by taking into account the grain size and fluctuation effects.
However, the reaction rate coefficients currently used in all practical models
of gas-grain chemistry are inaccurate by a significant amount. We provide
expressions for these crucial rate coefficients that are both accurate and easy
to incorporate into gas-grain models.
  We use exact results obtained in earlier work, where the reaction rate
coefficient was defined by a first-passage problem, which was solved using
random walk theory.
  The approximate reaction rate coefficient presented here is easy to include
in all models of interstellar gas-grain chemistry. In contrast to the commonly
used expression, the results that it provides are in perfect agreement with
detailed kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. We also show the rate coefficient for
reactions involving multiple species.
