In this work we present a cosmic ray model that couples primary solar cosmic
rays at the top of the Earth's atmosphere with the secondary ones detected at
ground level by neutron monitors during Ground Level Enhancements (GLEs). The
Neutron Monitor Based Anisotropic GLE Pure Power Law (NMBANGLE PPOLA) Model
constitutes a new version of the already existing NMBANGLE Model, differing in
the solar cosmic ray spectrum assumed. The total output of the model is a
multi-dimensional GLE picture that reveals part of the characteristics of the
big solar proton events recorded at ground level. We apply both versions of the
model to the GLE of 15 April 2001 (GLE60) and compare the results.
