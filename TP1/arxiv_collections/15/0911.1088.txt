The blazar PG 1553+113 is a well known TeV gamma-ray emitter. In this paper,
we determine its spectral energy distribution using simultaneous
multi-frequency data in order to study its emission processes. An extensive
campaign was carried out between March and April 2008, where optical, X-ray,
high-energy (HE) gamma-ray, and very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray data were
obtained with the KVA, Abastumani, REM, RossiXTE/ASM, AGILE and MAGIC
telescopes, respectively. This is the first simultaneous broad-band (i.e.,
HE+VHE) gamma-ray observation, though AGILE did not detect the source. We
combine data to derive source's spectral energy distribution and interpret its
double peaked shape within the framework of a synchrotron self compton model
