Spin-valve based nanojunctions incorporating Co|Ni multilayers with
perpendicular anisotropy were used to study spin-torque driven ferromagnetic
resonance (ST-FMR) in a nonlinear regime. Perpendicular field swept resonance
lines were measured under a large amplitude microwave current excitation, which
produces a large angle precession of the Co|Ni layer magnetization. With
increasing rf power the resonance lines broaden and become asymmetric, with
their peak shifting to lower applied field. A nonhysteretic step jump in ST-FMR
voltage signal was also observed at high powers. The results are analyzed in in
terms of the foldover effect of a forced nonlinear oscillator and compared to
macrospin simulations. The ST-FMR nonhysteretic step response may have
applications in frequency and amplitude tunable nanoscale field sensors.
