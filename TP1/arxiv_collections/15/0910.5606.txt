In this work we consider quantum dynamical interaction of single photon with
beam splitter after which well-known superposition between reflected and
transmitted photon appears. Later reflected photon is absorbed by one and
transmitted photon is absorbed by other, distant of two two-level systems of
the same type (prepared initially in ground states). It implies entanglement
between mentioned two two-level systems. Any two-level system in excited state
represents an unstable system that quantum dynamically evolves in a
superposition of the initial excited (non-decayed) and ground (decayed) state.
We consider frequent detection at only one of two two-level systems and we
prove that here a modification of the usual quantum Zeno effect called
sub-systemic quantum Zeno effect appears. Namely after mentioned frequent
detection two two-level systems are in a specific entangled state with two
terms. First term (term of the "frozen" evolution) includes detected two-level
system in initial excited state and non-detected two-level system in the ground
state. Second term (term of free evolution) includes detected system in ground
state and non-detected system in free evolved excited state.
