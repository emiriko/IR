The second author had previously obtained explicit generating functions for
moments of characteristic polynomials of permutation matrices (n points). In
this paper, we generalize many aspects of this situation. We introduce random
shifts of the eigenvalues of the permutation matrices, in two different ways:
independently or not for each subset of eigenvalues associated to the same
cycle. We also consider vastly more general functions than the characteristic
polynomial of a permutation matrix, by first finding an equivalent definition
in terms of cycle-type of the permutation. We consider other groups than the
symmetric group, for instance the alternating group and other Weyl groups.
Finally, we compute some asymptotics results when n tends to infinity. This
last result requires additional ideas: it exploits properties of the Feller
coupling, which gives asymptotics for the lengths of cycles in permutations of
many points.
