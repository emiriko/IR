Masses, widths and photocouplings of baryon resonances are determined in a
coupled-channel partial wave analysis of a large variety of data. The
Bonn-Gatchina partial wave formalism is extended to include a decomposition of
t- and u-exchange amplitudes into individual partial waves. The multipole
transition amplitudes for $\gamma p\to p\pi^0$ and $\gamma p\to n\pi^+$ are
given and compared to results from other analyses.
