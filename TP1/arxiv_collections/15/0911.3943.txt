The kaon electroproduction reaction 1H(e,e'K+)Lambda was studied as a
function of the virtual-photon four-momentum, Q2, total energy, W, and momentum
transfer, t, for different values of the virtual- photon polarization
parameter. Data were taken at electron beam energies ranging from 3.40 to 5.75
GeV. The center of mass cross section was determined for 21 kinematics
corresponding to Q2 of 1.90 and 2.35 GeV2 and the longitudinal, sigmaL, and
transverse, sigmaT, cross sections were separated using the Rosenbluth
technique at fixed W and t. The separated cross sections reveal a flat energy
dependence at forward kaon angles not satisfactorily described by existing
electroproduction models. Influence of the kaon pole on the cross sections was
investigated by adopting an off-shell form factor in the Regge model which
better describes the observed energy dependence of sigmaT and sigmaL.
