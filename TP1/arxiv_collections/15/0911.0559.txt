The magnetization reversal in stripe-like exchange bias patterned $\rm
Ni_{81}Fe_{19}/IrMn$ thin films was investigated by complementary inductive and
high resolution magneto optical magnetometry, magneto optical Kerr microscopy,
and polarized neutron reflectometry to clarify the effects of competing
interfacial exchange bias and lateral interface contributions. Structures of
varying ferromagnetic layer thickness and stripe period were analyzed
systematically at the frozen-in domain state of oppositely aligned stripe
magnetization. For all samples the mean magnetization of the magnetic hybrid
structures was found to be aligned nearly orthogonally with respect to the
stripe axis and the set exchange bias direction. Due to the interaction of
interfacial coupling, exchange, and magneto-static energy contributions, the
opening angle of neighboring stripe magnetizations increases with decreasing
ferromagnetic layer thickness and increasing stripe period. The experimental
observations are in agreement with an earlier proposed model for designing
micro-patterned exchange bias films.
