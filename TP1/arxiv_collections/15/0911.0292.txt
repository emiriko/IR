Influence of forced mechanical vibrations of a suspended single-electron
transistor on electron tunneling through the quantum dot limited by the Coulomb
blockade is investigated. It is shown that mechanical oscillations of the
quantum dot lead to the Coulomb blockade breakdown, shown in sharp resonant
peaks in the transistor conductance dependence on the excitation frequency at
values corresponding to the mechanical oscillations eigen modes. Physical
mechanism of the observed effect is considered. It is presumably connected with
oscillations of the mutual electrical capacitances between the quantum dot and
surrounding electrodes.
