We present a summary of recent WW, WZ, and ZZ measurements carried out in
$\sqrt{s} = 1.96$ TeV at the Tevatron. The observation of rare ZZ events and
the precise measurement of the WW cross section in fully leptonic decay modes
are described. Results in semi-leptonic decay modes where one boson decays to
two quarks are also presented. The measurements described are all in good
agreement with the Standard Model and are relevant to searches for the Higgs
boson at the Tevatron.
