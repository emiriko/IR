The rate of convergence of the distribution of the length of the longest
increasing subsequence, toward the maximal eigenvalue of certain matrix
ensembles, is investigated. For finite-alphabet uniform and nonuniform i.i.d.
sources, a rate of $\log n/\sqrt{n}$ is obtained. The uniform binary case is
further explored, and an improved $1/\sqrt{n}$ rate obtained.
