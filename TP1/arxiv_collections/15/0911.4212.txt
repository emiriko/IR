We introduce a class of k-potential submanifolds in pseudo-Euclidean spaces
and prove that for an arbitrary positive integer k and an arbitrary nonnegative
integer p, each N-dimensional Frobenius manifold can always be locally realized
as an N-dimensional k-potential submanifold in ((k + 1) N + p)-dimensional
pseudo-Euclidean spaces of certain signatures. For k = 1 this construction was
proposed by the present author in a previous paper (2006). The realization of
concrete Frobenius manifolds is reduced to solving a consistent linear system
of second-order partial differential equations.
