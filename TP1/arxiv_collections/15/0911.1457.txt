The relation between the interaction parameters for fermions on the spatial
lattice and the two-body $T$ matrix is discussed. The presented method allows
determination of the interaction parameters through the relatively simple
computational scheme which include the effect of finite lattice spacing. In
particular the relation between the interaction parameters and the effective
range expansion parameters is derived in the limit of large lattices.
