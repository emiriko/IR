Taking into account the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors,
calculated from a new set of $t $-dependent GPDs, a new model including the
soft and hard pomerons is build. In the framework of this model the ualitative
description of all existing experimental data at $\sqrt{s} \leq 52.8 $ GeV,
including the Coulomb range and large momentum transfers, is obtained with only
4 free parameters. Predictions for LHC energies are made.
