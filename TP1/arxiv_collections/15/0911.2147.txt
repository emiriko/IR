The ability to actively tune the properties of a nanocavity is crucial for
future applications in photonics and quantum information. Two important
man-made classes of materials have emerged to mold the flow of electromagnetic
waves. Firstly, photonic crystals are dielectric nanostructures that can be
used to confine and slow down light and control its emission. They act
primarily on the electric component of the light field. More recently, a novel
class of metallo-dielectric nanostructures has emerged. These so-called
metamaterials enable fascinating phenomena, such as negative refraction,
super-focusing and cloaking. This second class of materials realizes light
control through effective interactions with both electric and magnetic
component. In this work, we combine both concepts to gain an active and
reversible control of light trapping on subwavelength length scales. By
actuating a nanoscale magnetic coil close to a photonic crystal nanocavity, we
interact with the rapidly varying magnetic field and accomplish an
unprecedented control of the optical properties of the cavity. We achieve a
reversible enhancement of the lifetime of photons in the cavity. By
successfully combining photonic crystal and metamaterials concepts, our results
open the way for new light control strategies based on interactions which
include the magnetic component of light.
