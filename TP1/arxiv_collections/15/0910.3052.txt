We report an improved measurement of $D^+ \to K_S^0 K^+$ and $D^+_s\to K_S^0
\pi^+$ branching ratios using 605 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected with the Belle
detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+ e^-$ collider. The measured
branching ratios with respect to the Cabibbo-favored modes are $\mathcal{B}(D^+
\to K_S^0 K^+)/\mathcal{B}(D^+ \to K_S^0 \pi^+)$ = 0.1899$\pm0.0011\pm$0.0022
and $\mathcal{B}(D^+_s \to K_S^0 \pi^+)/\mathcal{B}(D^+_s \to K_S^0 K^+)$ =
0.0803$\pm0.0024\pm$0.0019 where the first uncertainties are statistical and
the second are systematic.
