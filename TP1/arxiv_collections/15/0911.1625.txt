Loop Quantum Gravity (L.Q.G.) is one of the two most promising tentative
theory for a quantum description of gravity. When applied to the entire
universe, the so-called Loop Quantum Cosmology (L.Q.C.) framework offers
microscopical models of the very early stages of the cosmological history,
potentially solving the initial singularity problem via bouncing solutions or
setting the universe in the appropriate initial conditions for inflation to
start, via a phase of super-inflation. More interestingly, L.Q.C. could leave a
footprint on cosmological observables such as the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) anisotropies. Focusing on the modified dispersion relation when holonomy
and inverse-volume corrections arising from the L.Q.C. framework are
considered, it is shown that primordial gravity waves generated during
inflation are affected by quantum corrections. Depending on the type of
corrections, the primordial tensor power spectrum is either suppressed or
boosted at large length scales, and strongly departs from the power-law
behavior expected in the standard scenario.
