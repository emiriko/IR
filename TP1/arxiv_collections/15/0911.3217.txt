A generalized WKB approach for constructing WKB series endowed with some
properties of Taylor ones is presented. Apart from the Riccati equation itself
its formalism involves also the Riccati-equation's derivatives (REDs) obtained
by differentiating of the former with respect to a spatial variable. For any
smooth potential barrier given in the finite spatial interval to include
turning points, the zeroth-order term of presented WKB series is regular
everywhere in this interval. Moreover, the more REDs are used, the more exact
the zeroth-order solution is.
