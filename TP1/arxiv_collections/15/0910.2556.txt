The use of the equations of motion and meson field redefinitions allows the
simplification of the subleading operators required in the one-loop resonance
chiral theory calculation of the pi pi vector form-factor. The study of the
renormalization group equations of the relevant parameters shows the existence
of an infrared fixed point for all the couplings. It is important to remark
that this result does not rely on the high-energy form-factor constraints,
which are often considered in other works. The possibility of developing a
perturbative 1/Nc expansion in the slow running region around the fixed point
is shown here.
