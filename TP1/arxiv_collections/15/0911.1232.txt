The search for lepton-flavor-violation process e^+e^-\to e\mu in the energy
region \sqrt{s}=984 - 1060 MeV with SND detector at VEPP-2M e^+e^- collider is
reported. The model independent 90% CL upper limits on the e^+e^-\to e\mu cross
section, \sigma_{e\mu} < 11 pb, as well as on the corresponding \phi\to e\mu
branching fraction, B(\phi\to e\mu) < 2 \times 10^{-6}, for the final particles
polar angles 55^\circ<\theta<125^\circ, were obtained.
