The spectral density of random graphs with topological constraints is
analysed using the replica method. We consider graph ensembles featuring
generalised degree-degree correlations, as well as those with a community
structure. In each case an exact solution is found for the spectral density in
the form of consistency equations depending on the statistical properties of
the graph ensemble in question. We highlight the effect of these topological
constraints on the resulting spectral density.
