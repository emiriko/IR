We present a technique for automatic determination of flare-ribbon separation
and the energy released during the course of two-ribbon flares. We have used
chromospheric H$\alpha$ filtergrams and photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms
to analyse flare-ribbon separation and magnetic-field structures, respectively.
Flare-ribbons were first enhanced and then extracted by the technique of
"region growing", i.e., a morphological operator to help resolve the
flare-ribbons. Separation of flare-ribbons was then estimated from magnetic
polarity reversal line using an automatic technique implemented into
Interactive Data Language (IDL\tm) platform. Finally, the rate of flare-energy
release was calculated using photospheric magnetic-field data and the
corresponding separation of the chromospheric H$\alpha$ flare-ribbons. This
method could be applied to measure the motion of any feature of interest (e.g.,
intensity, magnetic, Doppler) from a given point of reference.
