The RCo2Mn (R= Ho and Er) alloys, crystallizing in the cubic MgCu2-type
structure, are isostructural to RCo2 compounds. The excess Mn occupies both the
R and the Co atomic positions. Magnetic, electrical and heat capacity
measurements have been done in these comounds. The Curie temperature is found
to be 248 K and 222 K for HoCo2Mn and ErCo2Mn respectively, which are
considerably higher than that of the corresponding RCo2 compounds. Saturation
magnetization values calculated in these samples are less compared to that of
the corresponding RCo2 compounds. Heat capacity data have been fitted with the
nonmagnetic contribution with Debye temperature =250 K and electronic
coefficient=26 mJ mol^-1K^-2.
