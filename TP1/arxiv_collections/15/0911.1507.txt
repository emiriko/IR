The last few decades have seen considerable research progress in
microelectronics and integrated circuits, system-on-chip design, wireless
communication, and sensor technology. This progress has enabled the seamless
integration of autonomous wireless sensor nodes around a human body to create a
Body Sensor Network (BSN). The development of a proactive and ambulatory BSN
induces a number of enormous issues and challenges. This paper presents the
technical hurdles during the design and implementation of a low-power Medium
Access Control (MAC) protocol for in-body and on-body sensor networks. We
analyze the performance of IEEE 802.15.4 protocol for the on-body sensor
network. We also provide a comprehensive insight into the heterogeneous
characteristics of the in-body sensor network. A low-power technique called
Pattern-Based Wake-up Table is proposed to handle the normal traffic in a BSN.
The proposed technique provides a reliable solution towards low-power
communication in the in-body sensor network.
