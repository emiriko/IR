The observed slow running of the gauge coupling in SU(3) lattice gauge theory
with two flavors of color sextet fermions naturally suggests it is a theory
with one relevant coupling, the fermion mass, and that at zero mass correlation
functions decay algebraically. I perform a finite-size scaling study on
simulation data at two values of the bare gauge coupling with this assumption
and observe a common exponent for the scaling of the correlation length with
the fermion mass, y_m ~ 1.5. An analysis of the scaling of valence Dirac
eigenvalues at one of these bare couplings produces a similar number.
