We theoretically show how the spin orientation of a single magnetic adatom
can be controlled by spin polarized electrons in a scanning tunneling
microscope configuration. The underlying physical mechanism is spin assisted
inelastic tunneling. By changing the direction of the applied current, the
orientation of the magnetic adatom can be completely reversed on a time scale
that ranges from a few nanoseconds to microseconds, depending on bias and
temperature. The changes in the adatom magnetization direction are, in turn,
reflected in the tunneling conductance.
