We discuss the equivalence between the categories of certain ribbon graphs
and subgroups of the modular group $\Gamma$ and use it to construct
exponentially large families of not Hurwitz equivalent simple braid monodromy
factorizations of the same element. As an application, we also obtain
exponentially large families of {\it topologically} distinct algebraic objects
such as extremal elliptic surfaces, real trigonal curves, and real elliptic
surfaces.
