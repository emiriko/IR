We report a chromospheric jet lasting for more than 1 hr observed by Hinode
Solar Optical Telescope in unprecedented detail. The ejection occurred in three
episodes separated by 12-14 min, with the amount and velocity of material
decreasing with time. The upward velocities range from 438 to 33 km/s, while
the downward velocities of the material falling back have smaller values (mean:
-56 km/s) and a narrower distribution (standard deviation: 14 km/s). The
average acceleration inferred from parabolic space-time tracks is 141 m/s^2, a
fraction of the solar gravitational acceleration. The jet consists of fine
threads (0.5-2.0 arcsec wide), which exhibit coherent, oscillatory transverse
motions perpendicular to the jet axis and about a common equilibrium position.
These motions propagate upward along the jet, with the maximum phase speed of
744 +/- 11 km/s at the leading front of the jet. The transverse oscillation
velocities range from 151 to 26 km/s, amplitudes from 6.0 to 1.9 Mm, and
periods from 250 to 536 s. The oscillations slow down with time and cease when
the material starts to fall back. The falling material travels along almost
straight lines in the original direction of ascent, showing no transverse
motions. These observations are consistent with the scenario that the jet
involves untwisting helical threads, which rotate about the axis of a single
large cylinder and shed magnetic helicity into the upper atmosphere.
