For diffusive systems that can be described by fluctuating hydrodynamics and
by the Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory of Bertini et al., the total current
fluctuations display universal features when the system is closed and in
equilibrium. When the system is taken out of equilibrium by a boundary-drive,
current fluctuations, at least for a particular family of diffusive systems,
display the same universal features as in equilibrium. To achieve this result,
we exploit a mapping between the fluctuations in a boundary-driven
nonequilibrium system and those in its equilibrium counterpart. Finally, we
prove, for two well-studied processes, namely the Simple Symmetric Exclusion
Process and the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti model for heat conduction, that the
distribution of the current out of equilibrium can be deduced from the
distribution in equilibrium. Thus, for these two microscopic models, the
mapping between the out-of-equilibrium setting and the equilibrium one is
exact.
