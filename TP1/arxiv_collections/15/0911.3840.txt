The survival probability for exclusive diffractive Higgs production is
calculated. The contribution of short distance interactions are taken into
account, by summing over Pomeron loops in perturbative QCD. The summation is
performed by developing an iterative technique to sum over loop diagrams with
higher and higher generations of loops. The results show that the survival
probability depends inversely on energy and is small for the LHC range of
energies, and could be even less than 1 %.
