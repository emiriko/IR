This paper studies two issues related to the paper on Computing by
Self-reproduction: Autopoietic Automata by Jiri Wiedermann. It is shown that
all results presented there extend to deterministic computations. In
particular, nondeterminism is not needed for a lineage to generate all
autopoietic automata.
