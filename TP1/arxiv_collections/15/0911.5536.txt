In this paper, we analyze the quantum phases of multiple component
Bose-Hubbard model in optical superlattices, using a mean-field method, the
decoupling approximation. We find that the phase diagrams exhibit complected
patterns and regions with various Charge Density Wave (CDW) for both one- and
two- component cases. We also analyze the effective spin dynamics for the
two-component case in strong-coupling region at unit filling, and show the
possible existence of a Spin Density Wave (SDW) order.
