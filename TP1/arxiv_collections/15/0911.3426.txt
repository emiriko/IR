Debris discs - analogous to the Asteroid and Kuiper-Edgeworth belts in the
Solar system - have so far mostly been identified and studied in thermal
emission shortward of 100 um. The Herschel space observatory and the SCUBA-2
camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope will allow efficient photometric
surveying at 70 to 850 um, which allow for the detection of cooler discs not
yet discovered, and the measurement of disc masses and temperatures when
combined with shorter wavelength photometry. The SCUBA-2 Unbiased Nearby Stars
(SUNS) survey and the DEBRIS Herschel Open Time Key Project are complimentary
legacy surveys observing samples of ~500 nearby stellar systems. To maximise
the legacy value of these surveys, great care has gone into the target
selection process. This paper describes the target selection process and
presents the target lists of these two surveys.
