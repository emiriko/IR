We present the first robust implementation of a coined quantum walk over five
steps using only passive optical elements. By employing a fiber network loop we
keep the amount of required resources constant as the walker's position Hilbert
space is increased. We observed a non-Gaussian distribution of the walker's
final position, thus characterizing a faster spread of the photon wave-packet
in comparison to the classical random walk. The walk is realized for many
different coin settings and initial states, which opens the way for the
implementation of a quantum walk-based search algorithm.
