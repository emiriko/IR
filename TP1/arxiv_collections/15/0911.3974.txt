The SPace Infrared telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics (SPICA) is a
proposed mid-to-far infrared (4-200 um) astronomy mission, scheduled for launch
in 2017. A single, 3.5m aperture telescope would provide superior image quality
at 5-200 um, and its very cold (~5 K) instrumentation would provide superior
sensitivity in the 25-200 um wavelength regimes. This would provide a
breakthrough opportunity for studies of exoplanets, protoplanetary and debris
disk, and small solar system bodies. This paper summarizes the potential
scientific impacts for the proposed instrumentation.
