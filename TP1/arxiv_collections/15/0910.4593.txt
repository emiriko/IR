The ringdown phase of a black hole formed from the merger of two orbiting
black holes is described by means of the close-limit (CL) approximation
starting from second-post-Newtonian (2PN) initial conditions. The 2PN metric of
point-particle binaries is formally expanded in CL form and identified with
that of a perturbed Schwarzschild black hole. The multipolar coefficients
describing the even-parity (polar) and odd-parity (axial) components of the
linear perturbation consistently satisfy the 2PN-accurate perturbative field
equations. We use these coefficients to build initial conditions for the
Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli wave equations, which we then evolve numerically. The
ringdown waveform is obtained in two cases: head-on collision with zero-angular
momentum, composed only of even modes, and circular orbits, for which both even
and odd modes contribute. In a separate work, this formalism is applied to the
study of the gravitational recoil produced during the ringdown phase of
coalescing binary black holes.
