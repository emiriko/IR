A simple explanation for the symmetry and degeneracy of the genetic code has
been suggested. An alternative to the wobble hypothesis has been proposed. This
hypothesis offers explanations for: i) the difference between thymine and
uracil, ii) encoding of tryptophan by only one codon, iii) why E. coli have no
inosine in isoleucine tRNA, but isoleucine is encoded by three codons. The
facts revealed in this study offer a new insight into physical mechanisms of
the functioning of the genetic code.
