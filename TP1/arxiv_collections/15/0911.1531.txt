Variations of frequency separations of low-degree p-modes are studied over
the solar activity cycle. The separations studied are obtained from the
frequencies of low-degree p-modes of the Global Oscillation Network Group
(GONG). 10.7 cm radio flux is used as an index of solar activity. Small
separations of the p-mode frequencies are considered to be mainly dependent on
the conditions in stellar interiors. Thus they could be applied to diagnose the
changes in the stellar interior. Our calculation results show that the
magnitudes of variations of the mean large separations are less than 1 $\sigma$
over the solar activity cycle. Small separations show different behaviors in
the ascending and descending phases of activity. In the ascending phase,
variations of the small separations are less than 1 $\sigma$. However, the
small separations have systematic shifts during 2004 - 2007. The shifts are
roughly 1 $\sigma$ or more. The variations of the ratios of the small to large
separations with time are similar to the changes of the small separations. The
effects of the changes in the large separations on the ratios are negligible.
The variations of the separations may be a consequence of the influence from
the surface activity or systematic errors in measurements or some processes
taking place in the solar interior.
