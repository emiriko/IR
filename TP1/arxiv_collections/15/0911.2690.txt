In this paper we present a generalized Cassi-Baxter equation to take into
account the effect of drop pressure on the apparent contact angle theta_{app}.
Also we determine the limiting pressure p_{W} which causes the impalement
transition to the Wenzel state and the pull-off pressure p_{out} at which the
drop detaches from the substrate. The calculations have been carried out for
axial-symmetric pillars of three different shapes: conical, hemispherical
topped and flat topped cylindrical pillars. Calculations show that, assuming
the same pillar spacing, conical pillars may be more incline to undergo an
impalement transition to the Wenzel state, but, on the other hand, they are
characterized by a vanishing pull-off pressure which causes the drop not to
adhere to the substrate and therefore to detach very easily. We infer that this
property should strongly reduce the contact angle hysteresis as experimentally
osberved in Ref. \cite{Martines-Conical-Shape}. It is possible to combine large
resistance to impalement transition (i.e. large value of p_{W}) and small (or
even vanishing) detaching pressure p_{out} by employing cylindrical pillars
with conical tips. We also show that depending on the particular pillar
geometry, the effect of drop pressure on the apparent contact angle theta_{app}
may be more or less significant. In particular we show that in case of conical
pillars increasing the drop pressure causes a significant decrease of
theta_{app} in agreement with some experimental investigations
\cite{LafunaTransitio}, whereas theta_{app} slightly increases for
hemispherical or flat topped cylindrical pillars.
