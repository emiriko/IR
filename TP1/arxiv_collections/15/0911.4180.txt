Motivated by phenomenological questions in quantum gravity, we consider the
propagation of a scalar field on a random lattice. We describe a procedure to
calculate the dispersion relation for the field by taking a limit of a periodic
lattice. We use this to calculate the lowest order coefficients of the
dispersion relation for a specific one-dimensional model.
