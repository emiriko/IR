We observed a drastic Tc suppression caused by no more than 3 at.% of Zn
doped to the optimized superconductor LaFeAsO0.85 (Tc = 26 K). The electrical
resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements suggested that it is
likely due to impurity scatterings rather than losing the metallic nature,
seeming to support the s+/- pairing model proposed for the Fe pnictide
superconductor.
