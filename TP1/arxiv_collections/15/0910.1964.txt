Within the context of agent-based Monte-Carlo simulations, we study the
well-known majority-vote model (MVM) with noise applied to tax evasion on
simple square lattices, Voronoi-Delaunay random lattices, Barabasi-Albert
networks, and Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs. In the order to analyse and to
control the fluctuations for tax evasion in the economics model proposed by
Zaklan, MVM is applied in the neighborhod of the noise critical $q_{c}$. The
Zaklan model had been studied recently using the equilibrium Ising model. Here
we show that the Zaklan model is robust and can be reproduced also through the
nonequilibrium MVM on various topologies.
