A dispersive-optical-model analysis has been performed for both protons and
neutrons on 40,42,44,48Ca isotopes. The fitted potentials describe accurately
both scattering and bound quantities and extrapolate well to other stable
nuclei.
  Further experimental information will be gathered to constrain extrapolations
toward the driplines.
