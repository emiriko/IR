One of the main challenges in theoretical physics over the last five decades
has been to reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity into a theory
of quantum gravity. However, such a theory has been proved to be hard to attain
due to i) conceptual difficulties present in both the component theories
(General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Theory); ii) lack of experimental
evidence, since the regimes at which quantum gravity is expected to be
applicable are far beyond the range of conceivable experiments. Despite these
difficulties, various approaches for a theory of Quantum Gravity have been
developed.
  In this thesis we focus on two such approaches: Loop Quantum Gravity and the
Topos theoretic approach. The choice fell on these approaches because, although
they both reject the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, their
underpinning philosophical approach to formulating a quantum theory of gravity
are radically different. In particular LQG is a rather conservative scheme,
inheriting all the formalism of both GR and Quantum Theory, as it tries to
bring to its logical extreme consequences the possibility of combining the two.
On the other hand, the Topos approach involves the idea that a radical change
of perspective is needed in order to solve the problem of quantum gravity,
especially in regard to the fundamental concepts of `space' and `time'. Given
the partial successes of both approaches, the hope is that it might be possible
to find a common ground in which each approach can enrich the other.
