Stimulated Raman interaction of a classically pumped single three-level
$\Lambda$-type atom in a resonator cavity featuring both radiative and unwanted
losses is studied. It is shown that in the regime of stimulated adiabatic Raman
passage the excited outgoing wave packet of the cavity-assisted electromagnetic
field can be prepared in a one-photon Fock state with high efficiency. In this
regime, the spatio-temporal shape of the wave packet does not depend on the
interaction shape of the pump field, provided that the interaction of the atom
with the pump is time-delayed with respect to the interaction of the atom with
the cavity-assisted field. Therefore, the scheme can be used to generate a
sequence of identical radiation pulses each of almost one-photon Fock state. It
is further shown that the spatio-temporal shape of the outgoing wave packet can
be manipulated by controlling the time of interaction between the atom and the
cavity-assisted electromagnetic field.
