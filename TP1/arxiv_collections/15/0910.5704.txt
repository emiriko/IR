We study and generalize some arithmetical properties of the classes (2^k+)
and (2^k-) introduced by V. I. Arnold: a number n belongs to the class (N+) if
N|\varphi(n) and 2^{\frac{\varphi(n)}{N}} \equiv 1 mod n where \varphi(n) is
the Euler function, and belongs to the class (M-) if M|\varphi(n) and
2^{\frac{\varphi(n)}{M}} \equiv -1 mod n. The classes (2+), (2-),(4+), (4-),
(8+)and (8-) are studied by V. I. Arnold and here we will show general
properties of the classes (2^k+) and (2^k-) and we will see that the properties
which is proved by V. I. Arnold are special cases of ours.
