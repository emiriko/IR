A new delivery option for cancer centers equipped with linear accelerators
fitted with multi-leaf collimators (MLC) -- i.e. centers which can perform
intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) -- is rotational delivery. In
rotational delivery, the beam is on while the gantry is rotating and the MLC
leaves are moving, thus treating the patient more efficiently (regarding time)
than in IMRT. A consideration that should be examined when evaluating this new
type of delivery method is the tradeoff between treatment plan quality and
delivery time: what do we sacrifice in terms of plan quality by guaranteeing a
2 minute delivery, for example? In this paper we examine this question by
studying a simplified 2D phantom where leaf and gantry motion are directly
included in the optimization model. We formulate the model as a linear mixed
integer program. Because of the difficulty in solving to optimality, we employ
additional models which allow us to trap the true optimal solution between
upper and lower bounds. The lower bound solutions reveal which beam directions
are most useful for treatment (i.e. where the gantry should slow down), and
this information is used to produce deliverable solutions close to the lower
bound solutions. For the phantom cases studied, we show that when time is not
an issue, IMRT solutions are optimal, but when allowable treatment time is
constrained sufficiently, rotational delivery is the preferred choice.
