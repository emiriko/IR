The problem of model selection arises in a number of contexts, such as
compressed sensing, subset selection in linear regression, estimation of
structures in graphical models, and signal denoising. This paper generalizes
the notion of \emph{incoherence} in the existing literature on model selection
and introduces two fundamental measures of coherence---termed as the worst-case
coherence and the average coherence---among the columns of a design matrix. In
particular, it utilizes these two measures of coherence to provide an in-depth
analysis of a simple one-step thresholding (OST) algorithm for model selection.
One of the key insights offered by the ensuing analysis is that OST is feasible
for model selection as long as the design matrix obeys an easily verifiable
property. In addition, the paper also characterizes the model-selection
performance of OST in terms of the worst-case coherence, \mu, and establishes
that OST performs near-optimally in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime for N
x C design matrices with \mu = O(N^{-1/2}). Finally, in contrast to some of the
existing literature on model selection, the analysis in the paper is
nonasymptotic in nature, it does not require knowledge of the true model order,
it is applicable to generic (random or deterministic) design matrices, and it
neither requires submatrices of the design matrix to have full rank, nor does
it assume a statistical prior on the values of the nonzero entries of the data
vector.
