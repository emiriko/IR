3D Silicon sensors fabricated at FBK-irst with the Double-side Double Type
Column (DDTC) approach and columnar electrodes only partially etched through
p-type substrates were tested in laboratory and in a 1.35 Tesla magnetic field
with a 180GeV pion beam at CERN SPS. The substrate thickness of the sensors is
about 200um, and different column depths are available, with overlaps between
junction columns (etched from the front side) and ohmic columns (etched from
the back side) in the range from 110um to 150um. The devices under test were
bump bonded to the ATLAS Pixel readout chip (FEI3) at SELEX SI (Rome, Italy).
We report leakage current and noise measurements, results of functional tests
with Am241 gamma-ray sources, charge collection tests with Sr90 beta-source and
an overview of preliminary results from the CERN beam test.
