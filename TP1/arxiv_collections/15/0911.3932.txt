We comment on a recent paper by Yuen-Zhou et al. [ Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.
2009, 11, 4509 ] which extends some of the results of Time-Dependent Current
Density Functional Theory applied to open quantum systems. Besides pointing out
some incorrect statements in the theorems, we show that in the proof of the
main result of the paper an arbitrary condition is introduced. Moreover, we
argue that, since this condition has not a physical origin, one can find two
systems with different vector potentials that lead to the same dynamics of the
physical quantities of interest, the current and particle densities.
