TACS is an extension of CCS where upper time bounds for delays can be
specified. Luettgen and Vogler defined three variants of bismulation-type
faster-than relations and showed that they all three lead to the same preorder,
demonstrating the robustness of their approach. In the present paper, the
operational semantics of TACS is extended; it is shown that two of the variants
still give the same preorder as before, underlining robustness. An explanation
is given why this result fails for the third variant. It is also shown that
another variant, which mixes old and new operational semantics, can lead to
smaller relations that prove the same preorder.
