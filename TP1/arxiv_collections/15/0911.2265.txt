In this letter we study a lattice gas system that undergoes a glassy
transition. When we approach the glass transition we find both a divergence of
a point to set correlation length and the vanishing of the thermodynamic
potential. These findings are similar to the predictions coming from mean-field
(replica) theory, but they differ from these predictions in some details: they
underline the need of a better theoretical understanding of the glassy
transition.
