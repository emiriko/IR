The prospects for the search of the Standard Model Higgs boson with the CMS
experiment at the LHC are presented. The analyses rely on a full simulation of
the detector response and emphasis is put on explicit strategies for the
measurement of experimental and background systematics from data. The discovery
reach is presented as a function of the Higgs boson mass. A new complete
strategy is presented for the early searches and for the control of systematics
at very low luminosities of O(1/fb).
