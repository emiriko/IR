A weighted sums of squares decomposition of positive Borel measurable
functions on a bounded Borel subset of the Euclidean space is obtained via
duality from the spectral theorem for tuples of commuting self-adjoint
operators. The analogous result for polynomials or certain rational functions
was amply exploited during the last decade in a variety of applications.
