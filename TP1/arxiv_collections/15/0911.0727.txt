Current security model in Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)
predominantly use symmetric key cryptography. The rapid advancement of Internet
technology facilitates online trading, banking, downloading, emailing using
resource-constrained handheld devices such as personal digital assistants and
cell phones. However, these applications require more security than the present
GSM supports. Consequently, a careful design of GSM security using both
symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography would make GSM security more
adaptable in security intensive applications. This paper presents a secure and
efficient protocol for GSM security using identity based cryptography. The
salient features of the proposed protocol are (i) authenticated key exchange;
(ii) mutual authentication amongst communicating entities; and (iii) user
anonymity. The security analysis of the protocol shows its strength against
some known threats observed in conventional GSM security.
