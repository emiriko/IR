Coalescing compact binaries of neutron stars and/or black holes are
considered as one of the most promising sources for Earth based gravitational
wave detectors. The LIGO-Virgo joint collaboration's Compact Binary Coalescence
(CBC) group is searching for gravitational waves emitted by these astrophysical
systems by matched filtering the data against theoretically modeled template
waveforms. A variety of waveform template families are employed depending on
the mass range probed by the search and the stage of the inspiral phase
targeted: restricted post-Newtonian for systems having total mass less than $35
\msun$, numerical relativity inspired complete inspiral-merger-ringdown
waveforms for more massive systems up to $100\msun$ and ringdown templates for
modeling perturbed black holes up to $500\msun$. We give a status update on CBC
group's current efforts and upcoming plans in detecting signatures of
astrophysical gravitational waves.
