We present the Modular Algorithm for Relativistic Treatment of heavy IoN
Interactions (MARTINI), an event generator for the hard and penetrating probes
in high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. The simulation consists of a time
evolution model for the soft background, such as hydrodynamics, PYTHIA 8.1 to
generate and hadronize the hard partons after the medium evolution, which is
based on the McGill-AMY formalism and includes both radiative and elastic
processes. MARTINI allows for the generation of full event configurations in
the high transverse momentum region. We present results for the neutral pion
and photon nuclear modification factor in Au+Au collisions at RHIC.
