We examine recent prescriptions for estimating the thermal Casimir force
between two metallic plates from the point of view of their consistency with
the Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem of classical statistical physics. We find that
prescriptions including the effect of ohmic dissipation satisfy the theorem,
while prescriptions that neglect ohmic dissipation do not.
