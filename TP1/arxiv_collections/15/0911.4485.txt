Certain types of globular clusters have the very important property that the
predictions for their kinematics in the Newtonian and modified Newtonian
dynamics (MOND) contexts are divergent. Here, we caution the recent claim that
the stellar kinematics data (using 17 stars) of the globular cluster Palomar 14
are inconsistent with MOND. We compare the observations to the theoretical
predictions using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which is appropriate for small
samples. We find that, with the currently available data, the MOND prediction
for the velocity distribution can only be excluded with a very low confidence
level, clearly insufficient to claim that MOND is falsified.
