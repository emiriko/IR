Spin-pumping generates pure spin currents in normal metals at the ferromagnet
(F)/normal metal (N) interface. The efficiency of spin-pumping is given by the
spin mixing conductance, which depends on N and the F/N interface. We directly
study the spin-pumping through an MgO tunnel-barrier using the inverse spin
Hall effect, which couples spin and charge currents and provides a direct
electrical detection of spin currents in the normal metal. We find that
spin-pumping is suppressed by the tunnel-barrier, which is contrary to recent
studies that suggest that the spin mixing conductance can be enhanced by a
tunnel-barrier inserted at the interface.
