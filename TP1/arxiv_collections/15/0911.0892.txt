In this paper we present a dust emission map of the starless core TMC-1C
taken at 2100 microns. Along with maps at 160, 450, 850 and 1200 microns, we
study the dust emissivity spectral index from the (sub)millimeter spectral
energy distribution, and find that it is close to the typically assumed value
of beta = 2. We also map the dust temperature and column density in TMC-1C, and
find that at the position of the dust peak (A_V ~ 50), the
line-of-sight-averaged temperature is ~7 K. Employing simple Monte Carlo
modeling, we show that the data are consistent with a constant value for the
emissivity spectral index over the whole map of TMC-1C.
