We present a simple supersymmetric model where the dominant decay mode of the
lightest Higgs boson is h->2eta->4c where eta is a light pseudoscalar and c is
the charm quark. For such decays the Higgs mass can be smaller than 100 GeV
without conflict with experiment. Together with the fact that both the Higgs
and the pseudoscalar eta are pseudo-Goldstone bosons, this resolves the little
hierarchy problem.
