The role of the inert magnetic source used in the Tonomura experiment that
has confirmed the magnetic Aharonov-Bohm effect is discussed. For this purpose,
an analysis of a thought experiment is carried out. Here the permanent magnet
is replaced by a classical source which is made of an ideal coil. A detailed
calculation of this noninert source proves that in this case the effect
disappears. This outcome provides another support for the crucial role of an
inert source in the Aharonov-Bohm effect. A new aspect of quantum nonlocality
is pointed out.
