Gamma-ray emission from pulsars is thought to arise from accelerating regions
in pulsar's outer magnetosphere. The shape of the light curves is thus
sensitive to the details of the magnetic geometry of the magnetosphere. In this
work, we show the first calculations of light curves from the more realistic
force-free field under the framework of conventional emission models. We
compare the properties of gamma-ray emission between the commonly used vacuum
dipole magnetic field and the new force-free field. We discuss the role of the
polar cap shape and aberration effect on the appearance of the light curves as
well as the formation of caustics on the sky map. With the force-free field,
the double-peak pulse profile is best reproduced if the emission zone lies in a
thin layer just outside the current sheet, and the peaks are mainly contributed
from regions near the light cylinder. The conventional two-pole caustic model
can produce up to four peaks in general, while the conventional outer-gap model
can normally produce only one peak. These results will be useful for
interpreting Fermi telescope observations.
