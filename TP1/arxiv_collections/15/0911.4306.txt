We discuss the way in which factorisation is partially maintained but
nevertheless modified by process-dependent colour factors in hadronic
single-spin asymmetries. We also examine QCD evolution of the twist-three
gluonic-pole strength defining an effective T-odd Sivers function in the
large-x limit, where evolution of the T-even transverse-spin DIS structure
function g2 is known to be multiplicative.
