We consider the steady state non-equilibrium physics of the multichannel
interacting resonant level model in the weak coupling regime. By using the
scattering state method we show in agreement with the rate equations that the
negative differential conductance at large enough voltages is due to the
renormalization of the hopping amplitude thus of the vertex.
