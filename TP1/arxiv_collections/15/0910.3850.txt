The three major theoretical principles of quantum mechanics relevant to its
interpretation are: (T1), linearity; (T2), invariance under certain groups; and
(T3) the orthogonality and isolation of the different branches of the state
vector. These three imply the particle-like properties of mass, energy,
momentum, spin, charge, and locality are actually properties of the state
vector; and this in turn implies there is no evidence for the existence of
particles. Experimentally there is no evidence for collapse (E1) and
theoretically linearity prohibits collapse. One also has the experimentally
verified probability law (E2), which is found to rule out the many-worlds
interpretation. The failure of these three major interpretation, particles,
collapse, and many-worlds, apparently implies an acceptable interpretation must
be based on perception. Rather than being a separate principle, probability
follows in this interpretation from a weak assumption on perception plus the
combinatorics when an experiment is run many times. This suggests a relatively
simple experimental test of the perception interpretation.
