We obtain a complete series solution of stationary Schr\"odinger's equation
in the general quantum systems. It is exact in the sense that any approximation
means is not used, or that the whole corrections or contributions from all
order perturbations are involved if the perturbation concept is introduced.
Furthermore, the useful forms of our exact solution and a new expression the
complete Green operator are given out. As a universal and analytical solution,
it is helpful for the theoretical derivations and practical calculations in
quantum theory.
