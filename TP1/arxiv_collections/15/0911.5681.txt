We prove the so-called inverse conjecture for the Gowers U^{s+1}-norm in the
case s = 3 (the cases s < 3 being established in previous literature). That is,
we establish that if f : [N] -> C is a function with |f(n)| <= 1 for all n and
|| f ||_{U^4} >= \delta then there is a bounded complexity 3-step nilsequence
F(g(n)\Gamma) which correlates with f. The approach seems to generalise so as
to prove the inverse conjecture for s >= 4 as well, and a longer paper will
follow concerning this.
  By combining this with several previous papers of the first two authors one
obtains the generalised Hardy-Littlewood prime-tuples conjecture for any linear
system of complexity at most 3. In particular, we have an asymptotic for the
number of 5-term arithmetic progressions p_1 < p_2 < p_3 < p_4 < p_5 <= N of
primes.
