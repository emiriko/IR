We study the halo bispectrum from non-Gaussian initial conditions. Based on a
set of large $N$-body simulations starting from initial density fields with
local type non-Gaussianity, we find that the halo bispectrum exhibits a strong
dependence on the shape and scale of Fourier space triangles near squeezed
configurations at large scales. The amplitude of the halo bispectrum roughly
scales as $f_nl^2$. The resultant scaling on the triangular shape is consistent
with that predicted by Jeong & Komatsu based on perturbation theory. We
systematically investigate this dependence with varying redshifts and halo mass
thresholds. It is shown that the $f_nl$ dependence of the halo bispectrum is
stronger for more massive haloes at higher redshifts. This feature can be a
useful discriminator of inflation scenarios in future deep and wide galaxy
redshift surveys.
