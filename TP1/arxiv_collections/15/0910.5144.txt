The construction elements of the factorised form of the Yang-Baxter R
operator acting on generic representations of q-deformed sl(n+1) are studied.
We rely on the iterative construction of such representations by the restricted
class of Jordan-Schwinger representations. The latter are formulated
explicitly. On this basis the parameter exchange and intertwining operators are
derived.
