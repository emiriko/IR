Intermediate state (IS) flux structures in mesoscopic type-I superconductors
are investigated within the Ginzburg-Landau theory. In addition to
well-established tubular and laminar structures, the strong confinement leads
to the formation of (i) a phase of singly quantized vortices, which is typical
for type-II superconductors and (ii) a ring of a normal domain at equilibrium.
The stability region and the formation process of these IS flux structures are
strongly influenced by the geometry of the sample.
