The ground-state properties of neutron-deficient Hg isotopes have been
investigated by the constrained self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov
approach with the Skyrme and Gogny effective forces. In the case of the Skyrme
interaction we h ave also applied the Hartree-Fock+BCS model with the
state-dependent $\delta$-pairing interaction. Potential energy surfaces and
pairing properties have been compared for the both types of forces.
