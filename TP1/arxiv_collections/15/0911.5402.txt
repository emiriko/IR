We study Hom-quantum groups, their representations, and module Hom-algebras.
Two Twisting Principles for Hom-type algebras are formulated, and construction
results are proved following these Twisting Principles. Examples include
Hom-quantum n-spaces, Hom-quantum enveloping algebras of Kac-Moody algebras,
Hom-Verma modules, and Hom-type analogs of U_q(sl_2)-module-algebra structures
on the quantum planes.
