By means of a semiclassical analysis we show that the trace anomaly does not
affect the cosmological constant. We calculate the evolution of the Hubble
parameter in quasi de Sitter spacetime, where the Hubble parameter varies
slowly in time, and in FLRW spacetimes. We show dynamically that a Universe
consisting of matter with a constant equation of state, a cosmological constant
and the quantum trace anomaly evolves either to the classical de Sitter
attractor or to a quantum trace anomaly driven one. There is no dynamical
effect that influences the effective value of the cosmological constant.
