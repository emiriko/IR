We study spiky configurations of membranes in the SO(d)xSU(N) invariant
matrix models. A class of exact solutions (analogous to plane-waves) of the
corresponding Schroedinger equation for an arbitrary N is discussed. If the
large N limit is performed so that the energy scales like N^2, the N=infinity
wavefunctions reduce to the ground state of the d-dimensional harmonic
oscillator.
