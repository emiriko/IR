The existence of topological solutions and axial anomaly open a possibility
of P and CP violation in QCD. For a reason that has not yet been established
conclusively, this possibility is not realized in strong interactions - the
experimental data indicate that a global P and CP violation in QCD is absent.
Nevertheless, the fluctuations of topological charge in QCD vacuum, although
not observable directly, are expected to play an important role in the breaking
of $U_A(1)$ symmetry and in the mass spectrum and other properties of hadrons.
Moreover, in the presence of very intense external electromagnetic fields
topological solutions of QCD can induce local P- and CP-odd effects in the
$SU_c(3)\times U_{em}(1)$ gauge theory that can be observed in experiment
directly. Here I show how these local parity-violating phenomena can be
described by using the Maxwell-Chern-Simons, or axion, electrodynamics as an
effective theory. Local P- and CP- violation in hot QCD matter can be observed
in experiment through the "chiral magnetic effect" - the separation of electric
charge along the axis of magnetic field. Very recently, STAR Collaboration
presented an observation of the electric charge asymmetry with respect to
reaction plane in relativistic heavy ion collisions at RHIC.
