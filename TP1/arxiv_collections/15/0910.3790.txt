We propose a mechanism for relaxing a constraint on the number of messengers
in low-scale gauge mediation models. The Landau pole problem for the
standard-model gauge coupling constants in the low-scale gauge mediation can be
circumvented by using our mechanism. An essential ingredient is a large
positive anomalous dimension of messenger fields given by a large Yukawa
coupling in a conformal field theory at high energies. The positive anomalous
dimension reduces the contribution of the messengers to the beta function of
the standard-model gauge couplings.
