When micrometric drops coalesce in-plane on a superhydrophobic surface, a
surprising out-of-plane jumping motion was observed. Such jumping motion
triggered by drop coalescence was reproduced on a Leidenfrost surface.
High-speed imaging revealed that this jumping motion results from the elastic
interaction of the bridged drops with the superhydrophobic/Leidenfrost surface.
Experiments on both the superhydrophobic and Leidenfrost surfaces compare
favorably to a simple scaling model relating the kinetic energy of the merged
drop to the surface energy released upon coalescence. The spontaneous jumping
motion on water repellent surfaces enables the autonomous removal of water
condensate independently of gravity; this process is highly desirable for
sustained dropwise condensation.
