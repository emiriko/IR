The consequences of a flavor broken SU(3)_f dynamical parton model are
studied in the context of the elastic scattering of supersymmetric dark matter
off nucleons. It is shown that the predictions of this model differ
considerably from those of the commonly applied `standard' parton model. Some
notable properties of the dynamical parton model are finally presented and
discussed.
