The limits placed by the non-measurement of atomic and neutron electric
dipole moments on CP violating phases beyond the SM are found to be not fully
justified since the calculations of the expected EDMs lack the full
understanding of the connection between perturbative and nonperturbative
regimes of QCD for the measured boundstates. As a consequence rather old
subroutines for the evaluation of EDMs are still usable.
