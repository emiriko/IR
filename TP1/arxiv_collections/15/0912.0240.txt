Three-nucleon scattering equations with irreducible three-nucleon force are
solved in momentum-space. The Coulomb interaction between the two protons is
included using the method of screening and renormalization. The need for the
renormalization of the scattering amplitudes is demonstrated numerically. The
Coulomb and Urbana IX three-nucleon force effects on the observables of elastic
proton-deuteron scattering and breakup are studied.
