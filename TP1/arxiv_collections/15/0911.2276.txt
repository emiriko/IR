Lorentz violation (LV) is predicted by some quantum gravity theories, where
photon dispersion relation is modified, and the speed of light becomes
energy-dependent. Consequently, it results in a tiny time delay between high
energy photons and low energy ones. Very high energy (VHE) photon emissions
from cosmological distance can amplify these tiny LV effects into observable
quantities. Here we analyze four VHE $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) from Fermi
observations, and briefly review the constraints from three TeV flares of
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as well. One step further, we present a first
robust analysis of VHE GRBs taking the intrinsic time lag caused by sources
into account, and give an estimate to quantum gravity energy $\sim 2 \times
10^{17}$ GeV for linear energy dependence, and $\sim 5 \times 10^9$ GeV for
quadratic dependence. However, the statistics is not sufficient due to the lack
of data, and further observational results are desired to constrain LV effects
better.
