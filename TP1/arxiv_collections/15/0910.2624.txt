In order to make graphene technologically viable, the transfer of graphene
films to substrates appropriate for specific applications is required. We
demonstrate the dry transfer of epitaxial graphene (EG) from the C-face of
4H-SiC onto SiO2, GaN and Al2O3 substrates using a thermal release tape. We
further report on the impact of this process on the electrical properties of
the EG films. This process enables EG films to be used in flexible electronic
devices or as optically transparent contacts.
