The $S$-wave $\pi K$ scattering lengths are calculated for both the isospin
1/2 and 3/2 channels in the lattice QCD by using the finite size formula. We
perform the calculation with $N_f=2+1$ gauge configurations generated on $32^3
\times 64$ lattice using the Iwasaki gauge action and nonperturbatively
$O(a)$-improved Wilson action at $1/a = 2.17$ GeV. The quark masses correspond
to $m_\pi = 0.30 - 0.70$ GeV. For $I=1/2$, to separate the contamination from
excited states, we construct a $2 \times 2$ matrix of the time correlation
function and diagonalize it. Here, we adopt the two kinds of operators,
$\bar{s}u$ and $\pi K$. It is found that the signs of the scattering lengths
are in agreement with experiment, namely attraction in $I=1/2$ and repulsion in
$I=3/2$. We investigate the quark-mass dependence of the scattering lengths and
also discuss the limitation of chiral perturbation theory.
