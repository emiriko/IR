We study two delay-coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo systems, introducing a mismatch
between the delay times, as the simplest representation of interacting neurons.
We demonstrate that the presence of delays can cause periodic oscillations
which coexist with a stable fixed point. Periodic solutions observed are of two
types, which we refer to as a "long" and a "short" cycle, respectively.
