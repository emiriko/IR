A general solution is found for a large class of time continuous autonomous
nonlinear dynamical systems, the so-called quasi-polynomial systems. This
solution is expressed in terms of a new type of special functions defined via
their Taylor series. The coefficients of these Taylor series are generated by a
tensor that generalizes the factorial function and has a combinatorial meaning.
The existence of these functions raises the question of the relation between
them and the chaotic behaviour of the solutions that may appear for the
quasi-polynomial dynamical systems.
