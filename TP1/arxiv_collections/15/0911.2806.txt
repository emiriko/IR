In models where supersymmetry-breaking is dominated by the Kahler moduli
and/or the universal dilaton, the B-parameter at the unification scale should
be consistent with the value of tan(beta) at the electroweak scale determined
by minimization of the Higgs potential triggering REWSB. We study such models
employing a self-consistent determination of the B-parameter. In particular, we
study the viability of a generic model, as well as M-theory and Type IIB flux
compactifications with modulus-dominated supersymmetric soft-terms from the GUT
scale, M_{GUT}=2x10^{16}GeV.
