Vilkovisky has claimed to have solved the black hole backreaction problem and
finds that black holes lose only ten percent of their mass to Hawking radiation
before evaporation ceases. We examine the implications of this scenario for
cold dark matter, assuming that primordial black holes are created during the
reheating period after inflation. The mass spectrum is expected to be dominated
by 10-gram black holes. Nucleosynthesis constraints and the requirement that
the earth presently exist do not come close to ruling out such black holes as
dark matter candidates. They also evade the demand that the photon density
produced by evaporating primordial black holes does not exceed the present
cosmic radiation background by a factor of about one thousand.
