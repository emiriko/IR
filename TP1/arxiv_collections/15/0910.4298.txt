Angular distributions of extensive air showers with different number of
charged particles in the range 2.5x10^5--4x10^7 are derived using the
experimental data obtained with the EAS MSU array. Possible approximations of
the obtained distributions with different empiric functions available in
literature, are analysed. It is shown that the exponential function provides
the best approximation of the angular distributions in the sense of the
chi-squared criterion.
