The generalized parton distributions of the pion are studied within different
light-front approaches for the quark-hadron and quark-photon vertices,
exploring different kinematical regions in both the valence and non-valence
sector. Moments of the generalized parton distributions which enter the
definition of generalized form factors are also compared with recent lattice
calculations.
