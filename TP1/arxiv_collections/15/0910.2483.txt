The projective construction is a powerful approach to deriving the bulk and
edge field theories of non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and
yields an understanding of non-Abelian FQH states in terms of the simpler
integer quantum Hall states. Here we show how to apply the projective
construction to the Z_k parafermion (Laughlin/Moore-Read/Read-Rezayi) FQH
states, which occur at filling fraction \nu = k/(kM+2). This allows us to
derive the bulk low energy effective field theory for these topological phases,
which is found to be a Chern-Simons theory at level 1 with a U(M) \times Sp(2k)
gauge field. This approach also helps us understand the non-Abelian quasiholes
in terms of holes of the integer quantum Hall states.
