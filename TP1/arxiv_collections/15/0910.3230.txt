A new class of solutions to the coupled, spherically symmetric
Einstein-Maxwell equations for a compact material source is constructed. Some
of these solutions can be made to satisfy a number of requirements for being
physically relevant, including having a causal speed of sound. In the case of
vanishing charge these solutions reduce to those found by Bayin and Tolman.
Only the latter can be considered as having physically realistic properties.
