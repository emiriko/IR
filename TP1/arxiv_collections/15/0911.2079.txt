Thirty-three eclipsing binaries were selected for an analysis from a huge
database of observations made by the INTEGRAL/OMC camera. The photometric data
were processed and analyzed, resulting in a first light-curve study of these
neglected eclipsing binaries. The system CY Lac was discovered to be an
eccentric one. In several systems from this sample even their orbital periods
have been confirmed or modified. Due to missing spectroscopic study of these
stars, further detailed analyses are still needed.
