Long-term monitoring of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) by the All Sky
Monitor on board the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer now covers ~13 yrs and shows
that certain LMXB types display very long-term (~several to tens of years)
quasi-periodic modulations. These timescales are much longer than any
"super-orbital" periods reported hitherto and likely have a different origin.
We suggest here that they are due to long-term variations in the mass-transfer
rate from the donor, which are a consequence of solar-like magnetic cycles that
lead to orbital period changes (as proposed by Richman, Applegate & Patterson
1994 for similar long-term variations in CVs). Atoll sources display much
larger amplitude modulations than Z sources over these timescales, presumably
because Z sources are Eddington limited and hence unable to respond as readily
as Atoll sources to fluctuations in the mass-transfer rate from the donor.
