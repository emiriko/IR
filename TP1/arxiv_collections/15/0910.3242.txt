We present simulations of the vortex dynamics associated with the
self-propelled motion of jellyfish. The geometry is obtained from image
segmentation of video recordings from live jellyfish. The numerical simulations
are performed using three-dimensional viscous, vortex particle methods with
Brinkman penalization to impose the kinematics of the jellyfish motion. We
study two types of strokes recorded in the experiment1. The first type (stroke
A) produces two vortex rings during the stroke: one outside the bell during the
power stroke and one inside the bell during the recovery stroke. The second
type (stroke B) produces three vortex rings: one ring during the power stroke
and two vortex rings during the recovery stroke. Both strokes propel the
jellyfish, with stroke B producing the highest velocity. The speed of the
jellyfish scales with the square root of the Reynolds number. The simulations
are visualized in a fluid dynamics video.
