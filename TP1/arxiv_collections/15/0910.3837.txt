We present the first direct measurements of Casimir-Polder forces between
solid surfaces and atomic gases in the transition regime between the
electrostatic short-distance and the retarded long-distance limit. The
experimental method is based on ultracold ground-state Rb atoms that are
reflected from evanescent wave barriers at the surface of a dielectric glass
prism. Our novel approach does not require assumptions about the potential
shape. The experimental data confirm the theoretical prediction in the
transition regime.
