We combine results from interferometry, asteroseismology and spectroscopic
analyses to determine accurate fundamental parameters (mass, radius and
effective temperature) of 10 bright solar-type stars covering the H-R diagram
from spectral type F5 to K1. Using ``direct'' techniques that are only weakly
model-dependent we determine the mass, radius and effective temperature. We
demonstrate that model-dependent or ``indirect'' methods can be reliably used
even for relatively faint single stars for which direct methods are not
applicable. This is important for the characterization of the targets of the
CoRoT and Kepler space missions.
