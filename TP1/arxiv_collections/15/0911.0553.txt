In this report the Co2 based Heusler compounds are discussed as potential
materials for spin voltage generation. The compounds were synthesized by
arcmelting and consequent annealing. Band structure calculations were performed
and revealed the compounds to be half-metallic ferromagnets. Magnetometry was
performed on the samples and the Curie temperatures and the magnetic moments
were determined. The Seebeck coefficients were measured from low to ambient
temperatures for all compounds. For selected compounds high temperature
measurements up to 900 K were performed.
