We present the stellar mass-size relations for elliptical, lenticular, and
spiral galaxies in the field and cluster environments using HST/ACS imaging and
data from the Space Telescope A901/2 Galaxy Evolution Survey (STAGES). We use a
large sample of ~1200 field and cluster galaxies, and a sub-sample of cluster
core galaxies, and quantify the significance of any putative environmental
dependence on the stellar mass-size relation. For elliptical, lenticular, and
high-mass (log M*/M_sun > 10) spiral galaxies we find no evidence to suggest
any such environmental dependence, implying that internal drivers are governing
their size evolution. For intermediate/low-mass spirals (log M*/M_sun < 10) we
find evidence, significant at the 2-sigma level, for a possible environmental
dependence on galaxy sizes: the mean effective radius a_e for lower-mass
spirals is ~15-20 per cent larger in the field than in the cluster. This is due
to a population of low-mass large-a_e field spirals that are largely absent
from the cluster environments. These large-a_e field spirals contain extended
stellar discs not present in their cluster counterparts. This suggests the
fragile extended stellar discs of these spiral galaxies may not survive the
environmental conditions in the cluster. Our results suggest that internal
physical processes are the main drivers governing the size evolution of
galaxies, with the environment possibly playing a role affecting only the discs
of intermediate/low-mass spirals.
