We introduce a mathematical model for ultrasound modulated optical tomography
and present a simple reconstruction scheme for recovering the spatially varying
optical absorption coefficient from scanning measurements with narrowly focused
ultrasound signals. Computational results for this model show that the
reconstruction of sharp features of the absorption coefficient is possible. A
formal linearization of the model leads to an equation with a Fredholm
operator, which explains the stability observed in our numerical experiments.
