We study all the s.a. Schrodinger and Dirac operators (Hamiltonians) both
with pure AB field and with magnetic-solenoid field. Then, we perform a
complete spectral analysis for these operators, which includes finding spectra
and spectral decompositions, or inversion formulas. In constructing the
Hamiltonians and performing their spectral analysis, we respectively follow the
von Neumann theory of s.a. extensions of symmetric differential operators and
the Krein method of guiding functionals. The examples of similar consideration
are given by us in arXiv:0903.5277, where a nonrelativistic particle in the
Calogero potential field is considered and in Theor. Math. Phys. 150 (1) (2007)
34, where a Dirac particle in the Coulomb field of arbitrary charge is
considered. However, due to peculiarities of the three-dimensional problems
under consideration, we elaborated a generalization of the approach used in the
study of the Dirac particle.
