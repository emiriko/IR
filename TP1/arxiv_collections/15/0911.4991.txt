The CMS Hadron Calorimeter in the barrel, endcap and forward regions is fully
commissioned. Cosmic ray data were taken with and without magnetic field at the
surface hall and after installation in the experimental hall, hundred meters
underground. Various measurements were also performed during the few days of
beam in the LHC in September 2008. Calibration parameters were extracted, and
the energy response of the HCAL determined from test beam data has been
checked.
