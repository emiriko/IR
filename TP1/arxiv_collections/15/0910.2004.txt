We describe an approach to parallel graph partitioning that scales to
hundreds of processors and produces a high solution quality. For example, for
many instances from Walshaw's benchmark collection we improve the best known
partitioning. We use the well known framework of multi-level graph
partitioning. All components are implemented by scalable parallel algorithms.
Quality improvements compared to previous systems are due to better
prioritization of edges to be contracted, better approximation algorithms for
identifying matchings, better local search heuristics, and perhaps most
notably, a parallelization of the FM local search algorithm that works more
locally than previous approaches.
