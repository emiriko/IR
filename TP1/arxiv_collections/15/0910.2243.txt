We have developed a homogeneous model of physical chemistry to investigate
the neutral-dominated, water-based Enceladus torus. Electrons are treated as
the summation of two isotropic Maxwellian distributions$-$a thermal component
and a hot component. The effects of electron impact, electron recombination,
charge exchange, and photochemistry are included. The mass source is neutral
H$_2$O, and a rigidly-corotating magnetosphere introduces energy via pickup of
freshly-ionized neutrals. A small fraction of energy is also input by Coulomb
collisions with a small population ($<$ 1%) of supra-thermal electrons. Mass
and energy are lost due to radial diffusion, escaping fast neutrals produced by
charge exchange and recombination, and a small amount of radiative cooling. We
explore a constrained parameter space spanned by water source rate, ion radial
diffusion, hot-electron temperature, and hot-electron density. The key findings
are: (1) radial transport must take longer than 12 days; (2) water is input at
a rate of 100--180 kg s$^{-1}$; (3) hot electrons have energies between 100 and
250 eV; (4) neutrals dominate ions by a ratio of 40:1 and continue to dominate
even when thermal electrons have temperatures as high as $\approx$ 5 eV; (5)
hot electrons do not exceed 1% of the total electron population within the
torus; (6) if hot electrons alone drive the observed longitudinal variation in
thermal electron density, then they also drive a significant variation in ion
composition.
