The Standard Model has been successful in describing many fundamental aspects
of particle physics. However, there are some remaining puzzles that are not
explained within the context of its present framework. We discuss the
possibility to discover new physics in the ATLAS Detector via a four-fermion
contact interaction, much in the same way Fermi first described Weak
interactions. Using a simple ratio method on dimuon events, we can set a 95%
C.L. lower limit on the effective scale Lambda = 7.5 TeV (8.7 TeV) for the
constructive Left-left Isoscalar Model of quark compositeness with 100 pb^-1
(200 pb^-1) of data at sqrt{s} = 10 TeV.
