In the framework of the so called link approach we study exact lattice
supersymmetry for the simplest supersymmetric model: N=1 supersymmetry in D=1.
The model is described by a lattice with spacing a/2, thus containing twice as
many sites as the conventional one. The boson and fermion are related through a
2pi/a momentum shift, which can provide an interpretation of them being species
doublers to each other. An exactly supersymmetric lattice action can be written
within this scheme in momentum representation, which however turns out to be
non local in coordinate space.
