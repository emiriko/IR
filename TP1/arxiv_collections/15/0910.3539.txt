Young stellar systems orbiting in the potential of their birth cluster can
accrete from the dense molecular interstellar medium during the period between
the star's birth and the dispersal of the cluster's gas. Over this time, which
may span several Myr, the amount of material accreted can rival the amount in
the initial protoplanetary disk; the potential importance of this `tail-end'
accretion for planet formation was recently highlighted by Throop & Bally
(2008). While accretion onto a point mass is successfully modeled by the
classical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton solutions, the more complicated case of
accretion onto a star-disk system defies analytic solution. In this paper we
investigate via direct hydrodynamic simulations the accretion of dense
interstellar material onto a star with an associated gaseous protoplanetary
disk. We discuss the changes to the structure of the accretion flow caused by
the disk, and vice versa. We find that immersion in a dense accretion flow can
redistribute disk material such that outer disk migrates inwards, increasing
the inner disk surface density and reducing the outer radius. The accretion
flow also triggers the development of spiral density features, and changes to
the disk inclination. The mean accretion rate onto the star remains roughly the
same with and without the presence of a disk. We discuss the potential impact
of this process on planet formation, including the possibility of triggered
gravitational instability; inclination differences between the disk and the
star; and the appearance of spiral structure in a gravitationally stable
system.
