Implications of texture specific mass matrices have been investigated for
both quarks and neutrinos. Interestingly, for the case of quarks Fritzsch-like
texture 4 zero mass matrices have been found to be compatible with the present
precisely known sin2\beta as well as other precise CKM matrix elements. In the
case of leptonic mass matrices, for both Majorana and Dirac neutrinos we find
that for texture 4, 5, 6 zero mass matrices the inverted hierarchy and
degenerate scenarios of neutrino masses are ruled out by the present data.
