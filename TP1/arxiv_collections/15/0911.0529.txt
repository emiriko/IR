The nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of NF-kB is characterized by damped
oscillations of the nuclear concentration with a time period of around 1-2
hours. The NF-kB network contains several feedback loops modulating the overall
response of NF-kB activity. While IkBa is known to drive and IkBe is known to
dampen the oscillations, the precise role of A20 negative feedback remains to
be elucidated. Here we propose a model of the NF-kB system focusing on three
negative feedback loops (IkBa, IkBe and A20) which capture the experimentally
observed responses in wild-type and knockout cells. We find that A20, like
IkBe, efficiently dampens the oscillations albeit through a distinct mechanism.
In addition, however, we have discovered a new functional role of A20 by which
it controls the oscillation period of nuclear NF-kB. The design based on three
nested feedback loops allows independent control of period and amplitude decay
in the oscillatory response. Based on these results we predict that adjusting
the expression level of A20, e.g. by siRNA, the period can be changed by up to
a factor 2.
