Understanding the nature of neutrino masses will require physics beyond the
long-standing Standard Model of particle physics. Neutrinoless double beta
decay experiments like the Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events
(CUORE) are uniquely suited for probing the remaining mysteries of neutrino
mass, particularly the question of the neutrino's Majorana nature. CUORE will
be a next-generation experiment at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in
Italy; it will consist of an array of 988 TeO2 detector crystals operated at
~10 mK, following the bolometric technique established by the Cuoricino
experiment. It will look for the energy signal produced by the
theoretically-predicted neutrinoless double beta decay in Te-130, and therefore
reliable energy calibration of the detector is crucial to the experiment's
success. We will present the most recent results from Cuoricino and discuss the
current status of the CUORE project, with a particular emphasis on the
development of the calibration system.
