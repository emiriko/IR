We access the suitability of the recently proposed Josephson LED for quantum
manipulation purposes. We show that the device can both be used for on-demand
production of entangled photon pairs and operated as a two-qubit gate. Besides,
one can entangle particle spin with photon polarization and/or measure the spin
by measuring the polarization.
