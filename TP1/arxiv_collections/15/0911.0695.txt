Quantum theory makes the most accurate empirical predictions and yet it lacks
simple, comprehensible physical principles from which the theory can be
uniquely derived. A broad class of probabilistic theories exist which all share
some features with quantum theory, such as probabilistic predictions for
individual outcomes (indeterminism), the impossibility of information transfer
faster than speed of light (no-signaling) or the impossibility of copying of
unknown states (no-cloning). A vast majority of attempts to find physical
principles behind quantum theory either fall short of deriving the theory
uniquely from the principles or are based on abstract mathematical assumptions
that require themselves a more conclusive physical motivation. Here, we show
that classical probability theory and quantum theory can be reconstructed from
three reasonable axioms: (1) (Information capacity) All systems with
information carrying capacity of one bit are equivalent. (2) (Locality) The
state of a composite system is completely determined by measurements on its
subsystems. (3) (Reversibility) Between any two pure states there exists a
reversible transformation. If one requires the transformation from the last
axiom to be continuous, one separates quantum theory from the classical
probabilistic one. A remarkable result following from our reconstruction is
that no probability theory other than quantum theory can exhibit entanglement
without contradicting one or more axioms.
