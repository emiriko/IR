The structure of the T=1 iso-triplet hypernuclei, $^7_{\Lambda}$He,
$^7_{\Lambda}$Li and $^7_{\Lambda}$Be within the framework of an $\alpha
+\Lambda +N+N$ four-body cluster model is studied. Interactions between the
constituent subunits are determined so as to reproduce reasonably well the
observed low-energy properties of the $\alpha N$,
  $\alpha \Lambda$, $\alpha NN$ and $\alpha \Lambda N$ subsystems.
  Furthermore, the two-body $\Lambda N$ interaction is adjusted so as to
reproduce the $0^+$-$1^+$ splitting of $^4_{\Lambda}$H. Also a phenomenological
$\Lambda N$ charge symmetry breaking(CSB) interaction is introduced. The
$\Lambda$ binding energy of the ground state in $^7_{\Lambda}$He is predicted
to be 5.16(5.36) MeV with(without) the CSB interaction. The calculated energy
splittings of the $3/2^+$-$5/2^+$ states in $^7_{\Lambda}$He and
$^7_{\Lambda}$Li are around 0.1 MeV. We point out that there is a three-layer
structure of the matter distribution, $\alpha$ particle, $\Lambda$ skin, proton
or neutron halo, in the $^7_{\Lambda}{\rm He}(J=5/2^+)$, $^7_{\Lambda}{\rm
Li}(J=5/2^+)$ and $^7_{\Lambda}{\rm Be}(J=1/2^+)$ states.
