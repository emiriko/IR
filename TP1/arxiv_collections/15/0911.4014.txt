Living organisms are the most complex, interesting and significant objects
regarding all substructures of the universe. Life science is regarded as a
science of the 21st century and one can expect great new discoveries in the
near futures. This article contains an introductory brief review of genetic
information, its coding and translation of genes to proteins through the
genetic code. Some theoretical approaches to the modelling of the genetic code
are presented. In particular, connection of the genetic code with number theory
is considered and the role of $p$-adic numbers is underlined.
