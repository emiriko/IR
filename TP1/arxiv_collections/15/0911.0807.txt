We propose a new theoretical formalism which describes the Bose Einstein
condensation of weakly interacting bosons with finite life time interacting
with a thermal bath. We show that if a quasi-thermal distribution function of
particles is achieved, the elementary excitations of the condensate show a
linear spectrum characteristic of a superfluid, with a renormalized sound
velocity with respect to the equilibrium case.
