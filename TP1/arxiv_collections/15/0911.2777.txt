We obtain exact solutions of charged asymptotically Lifshitz black holes in
arbitrary (d+2) dimensions, generalizing the four dimensional solution
investigated in 0908.2611[hep-th]. We find that both the conventional
Hamiltonian approach and the recently proposed method for defining mass in
non-relativistic backgrounds do not work for this specific example. Thus the
mass of the black hole can only be determined by the first law of
thermodynamics. We also obtain perturbative solutions in five-dimensional
Gauss-Bonnet gravity. The ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density and the
DC conductivity are calculated in the presence of Gauss-Bonnet corrections.
