In this paper we address the statistical problem of testing if a stationary
process is Gaussian. The observation consists in a finite sample path of the
process. Using a random projection technique introduced and studied in
Cuesta-Albertos et al. 2007 in the frame of goodness of fit test for functional
data, we perform some decision rules. These rules really stand on the whole
distribution of the process and not only on its marginal distribution at a
fixed order. The main idea is to test the Gaussianity on the marginal
distribution of some random linear combinations of the process. This leads to
consistent decision rules. Some numerical simulations show the pertinence of
our approach.
