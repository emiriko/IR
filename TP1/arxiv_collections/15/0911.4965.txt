We study dipole oscillations in a general fermionic mixture: starting from
the Boltzmann equation, we classify the different solutions in the parameter
space through the number of real eigenvalues of the small oscillations matrix.
We discuss how this number can be computed using the Sturm algorithm and its
relation with the properties of the Laplace transform of the experimental
quantities. After considering two components in harmonic potentials having
different trapping frequencies, we study dipole oscillations in three-component
mixtures. Explicit computations are done for realistic experimental setups
using the classical Boltzmann equation without intra-species interactions. A
brief discussion of the application of this classification to general
collective oscillations is also presented.
