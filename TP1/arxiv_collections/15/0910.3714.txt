This article gives a point of view on the studies of the muon-induced
background for the underground experiments using a liquid scintillator
detectors. The results obtained are in good agreement with the data, especially
for the neutron yield production. This is the first time, when a study of this
kind successes to get the same neutron yield as the one obtained from the
experiment.
