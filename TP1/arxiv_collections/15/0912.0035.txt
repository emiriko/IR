We report on experiments of drop impacting a hydrophobic micro-grid, of
typical spacing a few tens of $\mu$m. Above a threshold in impact speed, liquid
emerges to the other side, forming micro-droplets of size about that of the
grid holes. We propose a method to produce either a mono-disperse spray or a
single tiny droplet of volume as small as a few picoliters corresponding to a
volume division of the liquid drop by a factor of up to 10$^5$. We also discuss
the discrepancy of the measured thresholds with that predicted by a balance
between inertia and capillarity.
