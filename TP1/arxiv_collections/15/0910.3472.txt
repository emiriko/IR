We study the neutron scattering spectrum in iron pnictides based on the
random-phase approximation in the five-orbital model, for fully-gapped s-wave
states with sign reversal (s+-) and without sign reversal (s++). In the s++
wave state, we find that a prominent hump structure appears just above the
spectral gap, by taking account of the quasiparticle damping gamma due to
strong electron-electron correlation: As the superconductivity develops, the
reduction in gamma gives rise to the large overshoot in the spectrum above the
gap. The obtained hump structure looks similar to the resonance peak in the s+-
wave state, although the height and weight of the peak in the latter state is
much larger. In the present study, experimentally observed broad spectral peak
in iron pnictides is naturally reproduced by assuming the s++ wave state.
