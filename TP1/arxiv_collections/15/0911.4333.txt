Very high-energy (VHE; E>100 GeV) gamma-rays have been detected from a wide
range of astronomical objects, such as pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), supernova
remnants (SNRs), giant molecular clouds, gamma-ray binaries, the Galactic
Center, active galactic nuclei (AGN), radio galaxies, starburst galaxies, and
possibly star-forming regions as well. At lower energies, observations using
the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard Fermi provide a rich set of data which
can be used to study the behavior of cosmic accelerators in the MeV to TeV
energy bands. In particular, the improved angular resolution of current
telescopes in both bands compared to previous instruments significantly reduces
source confusion and facilitates the identification of associated counterparts
at lower energies. In this paper, a comprehensive search for VHE gamma-ray
sources which are spatially coincident with Galactic Fermi/LAT bright sources
is performed, and the available MeV to TeV spectra of coincident sources are
compared. It is found that bright LAT GeV sources are correlated with TeV
sources, in contrast to previous studies using EGRET data. Moreover, a single
spectral component seems unable to describe the MeV to TeV spectra of many
coincident GeV/TeV sources. It has been suggested that gamma-ray pulsars may be
accompanied by VHE gamma-ray emitting nebulae, a hypothesis that can be tested
with VHE observations of these pulsars.
