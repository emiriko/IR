Within the framework of periodic asymmetric Anderson model for Kondo
isoulators an effective singlet-triplet Hamiltonian with indirect
antiferromagnetic f-f exchange interaction is introduced which allows to study
analytically the dynamic magnetic susceptibilities of f-electrons. The approach
allows to describe the three-level spin excitation spectrum with a specific
dispersion in $YbB_{12}$. Distinctive feature of the consideration is the
introduction of small radius singlet and triplet collective f-d excitations
which at movement on a lattice form low - and high-energy spin bands.
