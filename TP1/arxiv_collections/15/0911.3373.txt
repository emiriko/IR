We present progress made by the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration (HSC) in
determining the tower of excited nucleon states using 2+1-flavor anisotropic
clover lattices. The HSC has been investigating interpolating operators
projected into irreducible representations of the cubic group in order to
better calculate two-point correlators for nucleon spectroscopy; results are
published for quenched and 2-flavor anisotropic Wilson lattices. In this work,
we present the latest results using a new technique, distillation, which allows
us to reach higher statistics than before. Future directions will be outlined
at the end.
