Using a variational Monte-Carlo approach with a recently proposed stripe wave
function, we showed that the strong correlation included in a t-J-type model
has essentially all the necessary ingredients to form these stripes with
modulations of charge density, spin magnetization, and pair field. If a
perturbative effect of electron-phonon coupling to renormalize the effective
mass or the hopping rate of holes is considered with the model, we find the
half-doped stripes, which has on the average one half of a hole in one period
of charge modulation, to be most stable, energetic wise in the underdoped
region, $1/12\leq\delta\leq1/8$. This is in good agreement with the observation
in the neutron scattering experiments. We also find long range Coulomb
interaction to be less effective in the formation of half-doped stripes.
