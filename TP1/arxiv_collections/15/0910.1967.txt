A large sample of low surface brightness (LSB) disk galaxies is selected from
SDSS with B-band central surface brightness mu_0(B) from 22 to 24.5 mag
arcsec^(-2). Some of their properties are studied, such as magnitudes, surface
brightness, scalelengths, colors, metallicities, stellar populations, stellar
masses and multiwavelength SEDs from UV to IR etc. These properties of LSB
galaxies have been compared with those of the galaxies with higher surface
brightnesses. Then we check the variations of these properties following
surface brightness.
