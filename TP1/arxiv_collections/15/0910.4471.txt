Nova V5116 Sgr 2005 No. 2, discovered on 2005 July 4, was observed with
XMM-Newton in March 2007, 20 months after the optical outburst. The X-ray
spectrum showed that the nova had evolved to a pure supersoft X-ray source,
indicative of residual H-burning on top of the white dwarf. The X-ray
light-curve shows abrupt decreases and increases of the flux by a factor 8 with
a periodicity of 2.97h, consistent with the possible orbital period of the
system. The EPIC spectra are well fit with an ONe white dwarf atmosphere model,
with the same temperature both in the low and the high flux periods. This rules
out an intrinsic variation of the X-ray source as the origin of the flux
changes, and points to a possible partial eclipse as the origin of the variable
light curve. The RGS high resolution spectra support this scenario showing a
number of emission features in the low flux state, which either disappear or
change into absorption features in the high flux state. A new XMM-Newton
observation in March 2009 shows the SSS had turned off and V5116 Sgr had
evolved into a weaker and harder X-ray source.
