These are the mini-proceedings of the CHARMEX workshop. The meeting focused
on recent developments in charm spectroscopy, especially on the possible role
of the states that do not fit into the quark model classification, the
so-called exotic states. The goal of this write-up is to provide the community
with a short summary of the individual talks as well as a comprehensive,
up-to-date list of relevant references.
