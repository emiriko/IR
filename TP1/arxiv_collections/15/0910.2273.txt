The gamma ray burst apparent average isotropic power versus their red-shift
of all known GRB (Sept.2009) is reported. It calls for an unrealistic Gamma Ray
Burst Evolution around us or it just probe the need of a very thin gamma
precession-jet model. These precessing and spinning jet are originated by
Inverse Compton and-or Synchrotron Radiation at pulsars or micro-quasars
sources, by ultra-relativistic electrons. These Jets are most powerful at
Supernova birth, blazing, once on axis, to us and flashing GRB detector. The
trembling of the thin jet (spinning, precessing, bent by magnetic fields)
explains naturally the observed erratic multi-explosive structure of different
GRBs and its rare re-brightening. The jets are precessing (by binary companion
or inner disk asymmetry) and decaying by power law on time scales to a few
hours. GRB blazing occurs inside the observer cone of view only a seconds
duration times; because relativistic synchrotron (or IC) laws the jet angle is
thinner in gamma but wider in X band. Its apparent brightening is so well
correlated with its hardness (The Amati correlation). This explain the wider
and longer X GRB afterglow duration and the (not so much) rare presence of
X-ray precursors well before the apparent main GRB explosion. The jet lepton
maybe originated by an inner primary hadron core (as well as pions and muons
secondary Jets). The EGRET, AGILE and Fermi few hardest and late GeV gamma
might be PeV neutron beta decay in flight observed in-axis under a relativistic
shrinkage.
