We store and control ultra-cold atoms in a new type of trap using magnetic
fields of vortices in a high temperature superconducting micro-structure. This
is the first time ultra-cold atoms have been trapped in the field of magnetic
flux quanta. We generate the attractive trapping potential for the atoms by
combining the magnetic field of a superconductor in the remanent state with
external homogeneous magnetic fields. We show the control of crucial atom trap
characteristics such as an efficient intrinsic loading mechanism, spatial
positioning of the trapped atoms and the vortex density in the superconductor.
The measured trap characteristics are in good agreement with our numerical
simulations.
