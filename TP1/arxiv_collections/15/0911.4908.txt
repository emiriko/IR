We examine the concept of universal quantized resistance in the AC regime
through the fully coherent quantum RC circuit comprising a cavity (dot)
capacitively coupled to a gate and connected via a single spin-polarized
channel to a reservoir lead. As a result of quantum effects such as the Coulomb
interaction in the cavity and global phase coherence, we show that the charge
relaxation resistance $R_q$ is identical for weak and large transmissions and
it changes from $h/2e^2$ to $h/e^2$ when the frequency (times $\hbar$) exceeds
the level spacing of the cavity; $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ the
electron charge. For large cavities, we formulate a correspondence between the
charge relaxation resistance $h/e^2$ and the Korringa-Shiba relation of the
Kondo model. Furthermore, we introduce a general class of models, for which the
charge relaxation resistance is universal. Our results emphasize that the
charge relaxation resistance is a key observable to understand the dynamics of
strongly correlated systems.
