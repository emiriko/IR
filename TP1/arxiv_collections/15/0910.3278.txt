Intense beams of cold and slow molecules are produced by supersonic expansion
out of a rapidly rotating nozzle, as first demonstrated by Gupta and
Herschbach. An improved setup is presented that allows to accelerate or
decelerate cold atomic and molecular beams by up to 500 m/s. Technical
improvements are discussed and beam parameters are characterized by detailed
analysis of time of flight density distributions. The possibility of combining
this beam source with electrostatic fields for guiding polar molecules is
demonstrated.
