We extend each higher Johnson homomorphism to a crossed homomorphism from the
automorphism group of a finite-rank free group to a finite-rank abelian group.
We also extend each Morita homomorphism to a crossed homomorphism from the
mapping class group of once-bounded surface to a finite-rank abelian group.
This improves on the author's previous results [Algebr. Geom. Topol. 7
(2007):1297-1326]. To prove the first result, we express the higher Johnson
homomorphisms as coboundary maps in group cohomology. Our methods involve the
topology of nilpotent homogeneous spaces and lattices in nilpotent Lie
algebras. In particular, we develop a notion of the "polynomial straightening"
of a singular homology chain in a nilpotent homogeneous space.
