Measurements of the Little-Parks oscillations at measuring current much lower
than the persistent current give unambiguous evidence of the dc current flowing
against the force of the dc electric field because of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
This result can assume that an additional force is needed for description of
the Aharonov-Bohm effect observed in semiconductor, normal metal and
superconductor nanostructures in contrast to the experimental result obtained
recently for the case of the two-slit interference experiment.
