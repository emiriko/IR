We apply the Standardized Candle Method (SCM) for Type II Plateau supernovae
(SNe II-P), which relates the velocity of the ejecta of a SN to its luminosity
during the plateau, to 15 SNe II-P discovered over the three season run of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey - II Supernova Survey. The redshifts of these SNe -
0.027 < z < 0.144 - cover a range hitherto sparsely sampled in the literature;
in particular, our SNe II-P sample contains nearly as many SNe in the Hubble
flow (z > 0.01) as all of the current literature on the SCM combined. We find
that the SDSS SNe have a very small intrinsic I-band dispersion (0.22 mag),
which can be attributed to selection effects. When the SCM is applied to the
combined SDSS-plus-literature set of SNe II-P, the dispersion increases to 0.29
mag, larger than the scatter for either set of SNe separately. We show that the
standardization cannot be further improved by eliminating SNe with positive
plateau decline rates, as proposed in Poznanski et al. (2009). We thoroughly
examine all potential systematic effects and conclude that for the SCM to be
useful for cosmology, the methods currently used to determine the Fe II
velocity at day 50 must be improved, and spectral templates able to encompass
the intrinsic variations of Type II-P SNe will be needed.
