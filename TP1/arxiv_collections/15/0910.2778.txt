In this paper, we describe a very simple method to calculate the positions of
the planets in the sky. The technique used enables us to calculate planetary
positions to an accuracy of $\stackrel{<}{_{\sim}} 1^{\circ}$ for $\pm 50$
years from the starting epoch. Moreover, this involves very simple calculations
and can be done using a calculator. All we need are the initial specifications
of planetary orbits for some standard epoch and the time periods of their
revolutions.
