Frozen parametric disorder can lead to appearance of sets of localized
convective currents in an otherwise stable (quiescent) fluid layer heated from
below. These currents significantly influence the transport of an admixture (or
any other passive scalar) along the layer. When the molecular diffusivity of
the admixture is small in comparison to the thermal one, which is quite typical
in nature, disorder can enhance the effective (eddy) diffusivity by several
orders of magnitude in comparison to the molecular diffusivity. In this paper
we study the effect of an imposed longitudinal advection on delocalization of
convective currents, both numerically and analytically; and report subsequent
drastic boost of the effective diffusivity for weak advection.
