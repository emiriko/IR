We demonstrate that in the atomic-scale limit the thermal conductance
$\mathcal K$ of the FPU model and its variants strongly deviates from the
mesoscopic behavior due to the relevance of contact resistance. As a result,
atomic chains follow $\log \mathcal K = \nu \log T$, where the power law
coefficient $\nu$ is exactly two times larger than the mesoscopic value. We
smoothly interconnect the atomic and mesoscopic limits, and demonstrate that
this turnover behavior takes place in other nonlinear FPU-like models. Our
results are significant for nanoscale applications, manifesting an atomic
thermal conductance with temperature scaling superior to the mesoscopic limit.
