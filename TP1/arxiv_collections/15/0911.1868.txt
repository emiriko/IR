We analyze the $5\sigma$ difference between the CP asymmetries of the $B^0
\to K^+ \pi^-$ and $B^+ \to K^+ \pi^0$ decays within the Soft Collinear
Effective Theory. We find that in the Standard Model, such a big difference
cannot be achieved. We classify then the requirements for the possible New
Physics models, which can be responsible for the experimental results. As an
example of a New Physics model we study minimal supersymmetric models, and find
that the measured asymmetry can be obtained with non-minimal flavor violation.
