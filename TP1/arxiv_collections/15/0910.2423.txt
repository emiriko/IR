We demonstrate that large class of PT-symmetric complex potentials, which can
have isospectral real partner potentials, possess two different
superpotentials. In the parameter domain, where the superpotential is unique,
the spectrum is real and shape-invariant, leading to translational shift in a
suitable parameter by \textit{real} units. The case of two different
superpotentials, leading to same potential, yields broken PT-symmetry, the
energy spectra in the two phases being separated by a bifurcation.
Interestingly, these two superpotentials generate the two disjoint sectors of
the Hilbert space. In the broken case, shape invariance produces
\textit{complex} parametric shifts.
