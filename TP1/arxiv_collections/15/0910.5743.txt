Relying on the quantization rule of Raab and Friedrich [Phys. Rev. A (2009)
in press], we derive simple and accurate formulae for the number of rotational
states supported by a weakly bound vibrational level of a diatomic molecular
ion. We also provide analytic estimates of the rotational constants of any such
levels up to threshold for dissociation and obtain a criterion for determining
whether a given weakly bound vibrational level is rotationless. The results
depend solely on the long-range part of the molecular potential.
