We show that dimensional recurrence relation and analytical properties of the
loop integrals as functions of complex variable $\mathcal{D}$ (space-time
dimensionality) provide a regular way to derive analytical representations of
loop integrals. The representations derived have a form of exponentially
converging sums. Several examples of the developed technique are given.
