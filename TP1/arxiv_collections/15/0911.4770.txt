The alignment system for the muon spectrometer of the CMS detector comprises
three independent subsystems of optical and analog position sensors. It aligns
muon chambers with respect to each other and to the central silicon tracker.
System commissioning at full magnetic field began in 2008 during an extended
cosmic ray run. The system succeeded in tracking muon detector movements of up
to 18 mm and rotations of several milliradians under magnetic forces. Depending
on coordinate and subsystem, the system achieved chamber alignment precisions
of 140-350 microns and 30-200 microradians, close to the precision requirements
of the experiment. Systematic errors on absolute positions are estimated to be
340-590 microns based on comparisons with independent photogrammetry
measurements.
