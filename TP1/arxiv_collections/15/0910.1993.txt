The recently formulated Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson (BLG) theory in three
dimensions is described in terms of a constrained chiral superfield in
light-cone superspace. We discuss the use of Superconformal symmetry to
determine the form of its interactions, in complete analogy with N=4
SuperYang-Mills in four dimensions.
