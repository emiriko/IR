We consider a self-consistent Einstein-Maxwell-Kalb-Ramond system in the bulk
D=4 space-time interacting with a variable-tension electrically charged
lightlike brane. The latter serves both as a material and charge source for
gravity and electromagnetism, as well as it dynamically generates a bulk space
varying cosmological constant. We find an asymmetric wormhole solution
describing two "universes" with different spherically symmetric black-hole-type
geometries connected through a "throat" occupied by the lightlike brane. The
electrically neutral "left universe" comprises the exterior region of
Schwarzschild-de-Sitter (or pure Schwarzschild) space-time above the inner
(Schwarzschild-type) horizon, whereas the electrically charged "right universe"
consists of the exterior Reissner-Nordstroem (or Reissner-Nordstroem-de-Sitter)
black hole region beyond the outer Reissner-Nordstroem horizon. All physical
parameters of the wormhole are uniquely determined by two free parameters - the
electric charge and Kalb-Ramond coupling of the lightlike brane.
