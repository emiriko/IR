In this paper, the author brings further details regarding his Lightning Ball
observation that were not mentioned in the first one (Ref.1-2). Additionally,
he goes more into detail as the three forces that are necessary to allow the
residual crescent form the hydrodynamic vortex ring to shrink into a
sphere.Further topics are the similarities and analogies between the Lightning
Ball formation's theory and the presently undertaken
Tokamak-Stellarator-Spheromak fusion reactor experiments. A new theory and its
experimental realisation are proposed as to make the shrinking of the hot
plasma of reactors into a ball possible by means of the so called long range
electromagnetic forces. In this way,the fusion ignition temperature could
possibly atteined.
