We study thermal transport in anisotropic Heisenberg spin chains using the
quantum master equation. It is found that thermal rectification changes sign
when the external homogeneous magnetic field is varied. This reversal also
occurs when the magnetic field becomes inhomogeneous. Moreover, we can tune the
reversal of rectification by temperatures of the heat baths, the anisotropy and
size of the spin chains.
