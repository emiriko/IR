Single fermionic degrees of freedom together with standard chiral symmetry at
finite lattice spacing, correct continuum limit and local interactions only are
precluded by the Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem. The class of minimally doubled
fermion actions exhibits exactly two chiral modes. Recent interest in these
actions has been sparked by the investigation of fermionic actions defined on
"hyperdiamond" lattices. Due to the necessity of breaking hypercubic symmetry
explicitly, radiative corrections generate operator mixings with relevant and
marginal operators that should vanish in continuum QCD. These cannot be avoided
and must be taken into account in particular by a peculiar wave-function
renormalisation and additive momentum renormalisation. Renormalisation
properties at one-loop level of the self-energy, local bilinears and conserved
vector and axial-vector currents are presented for Borici-Creutz and
Karsten-Wilczek actions. Distinct differences and similarities between both
actions are elucidated.
