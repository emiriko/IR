The evolution of the Internet during the last years, has lead to a dramatic
increase of the size of its graph at the Autonomous System (AS) level. Soon -
if not already - its size will make the latter impractical for use from the
research community, e.g. for protocol testing. Reproducing a smaller size,
snapshot of the AS graph is thus important. However, the first step towards
this direction is to obtain the ability to faithfully reproduce the full AS
topology. The objective of our work, is to create a generator able to
accurately emulate and reproduce the distinctive properties of the Internet
graph. Our approach is based on (a) the identification of the jellyfish-like
structure [1] of the Internet and (b) the consideration of the peer-to-peer and
customer-provider relations between ASs. We are the first to exploit the
distinctive structure of the Internet graph together with utilizing the
information provided by the AS relationships in order to create a tool with the
aforementioned capabilities. Comparing our generator with the existing ones in
the literature, the main difference is found on the fact that our tool does not
try to satisfy specific metrics, but tries to remain faithful to the conceptual
model of the Internet structure. In addition, our approach can lead to (i) the
identification of important attributes and patterns in the Internet AS
topology, as well as, (ii) the extraction of valuable information on the
various relationships between ASs and their effect on the formulation of the
Internet structure. We implement our graph generator and we evaluate it using
the largest and most recent available dataset for the AS topology. Our
evaluations, clearly show the ability of our tool to capture the structural
properties of the Internet topology at the AS level with high accuracy.
