The aim of this project is to determine the consistency of an assumed
cosmological model by means of a detailed analysis of the brightness profiles
of distant galaxies.Starting from the theory developed by Ellis and Perry
(1979) connecting the angular diameter distance obtained from a relativistic
cosmological model and the detailed photometry of galaxies, we assume the
presently most accepted cosmological model with non-zero cosmological constant
and attempt to predict the brightness profiles of galaxies of a given redshift.
Then this theoretical profile can be compared to observational data already
available for distant, that is, high redshift, galaxies. By comparing these two
curves we may reach conclusions about the observational feasibility of the
underlying cosmological model.
