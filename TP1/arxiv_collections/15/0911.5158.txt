At LHC extreme values of energy density will be reached even for
proton-proton collisions. Such values of energy density may be large enough to
generate a collective motion in the products of the collision, therefore
generating effects such as elliptic flow. Using ideal 3+1D hydrodynamical
simulations, we show that elliptic flow can occur at least for top
multiplicities p-p events at LHC and that the intensity of such effect is
strongly related to quantum fluctuations in the initial proton energy
distribution.
