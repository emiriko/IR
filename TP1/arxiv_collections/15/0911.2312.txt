Based on the full band electronic structure calculations, first we consider
the effect of n-type doping on the optical absorption and the refractive index
in wurtzite InN and GaN. We identify quite different dielectric response in
either case; while InN shows a significant shift in the absorption edge due to
n-type doping, this is masked for GaN due to efficient cancellation of the
Burstein-Moss effect by the band gap renormalization. For high doping levels
the intraband absorption becomes significant in InN. Furthermore, we observe
that the free-carrier plasma contribution to refractive index change becomes
more important than both band filling and the band gap renormalization for
electron densities above 10$^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ in GaN, and 10$^{20}$~cm$^{-3}$ in
InN. As a result of the two different characteristics mentioned above, the
overall change in the refractive index due to n-type doping is much higher in
InN compared to GaN, which in the former exceeds 4\% for a doping of
10$^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ at 1.55~$\mu$m wavelength. Finally, we consider intrinsic
InN under strong photoexcitation which introduces equal density of electron and
holes thermalized to their respective band edges. The change in the refractive
index at 1.55~$\mu$m is observed to be similar to the n-doped case up to a
carrier density of 10$^{20}$~cm$^{-3}$. However, in the photoexcited case this
is now accompanied by a strong absorption in this wavelength region due to
$\Gamma^v_5 \to \Gamma^v_6$ intravalence band transition. Our findings suggest
that the alloy composition of In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N can be optimized in the
indium-rich region so as to benefit from high carrier-induced refractive index
change while operating in the transparency region to minimize the losses. These
can have direct implications for InN-containing optical phase modulators and
lasers.
