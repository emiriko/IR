By developing the Tanaka theory for rank 2 distributions, we completely
classify classical Monge equations having maximal finite-dimensional symmetry
algebras with fixed (albeit arbitrary) pair of its orders. Investigation of the
corresponding Tanaka algebras leads to a new Lie-Backlund theorem. We prove
that all flat Monge equations are successive integrable extensions of the
Hilbert-Cartan equation. Many new examples are provided.
