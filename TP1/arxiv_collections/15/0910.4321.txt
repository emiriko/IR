We present a lattice study of fluctuations and correlations among the
conserved charges baryon number and strangeness in (2+1)-flavor QCD. The
lattice calculations are based on a Taylor expansion of the pressure. Results
are presented at zero and nonzero density on lattices with four and six time
slices, corresponding to a lattice spacing of $a\approx 0.25$ fm and $a\approx
0.16$ fm, respectively. The quark masses are almost physical, i.e. the light
quark mass has been chosen to one tenth of the physical strange quark mass
while the strange quark mass has been set to its physical value. We find that
all analyzed fluctuations and correlations develop a peak at nonzero density,
when they are treated in an expansion up to sixth order. Especially below the
critical temperature ($T_c$) fluctuations and correlations increase
drastically, whereas above $T_c$ they are rather unaffected.
