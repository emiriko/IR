We present an Evolutionary Placement Algorithm (EPA) for the rapid assignment
of sequence fragments (short reads) to branches of a given phylogenetic tree
under the Maximum Likelihood (ML) model. The accuracy of the algorithm is
evaluated on several real-world data sets and compared to placement by
pair-wise sequence comparison, using edit distances and BLAST.
  We test two versions of the placement algorithm, one slow and more accurate
where branch length optimization is conducted for each short read insertion and
a faster version where the branch lengths are approximated at the insertion
position. For the slow version, additional heuristic techniques are explored
that almost yield the same run time as the fast version, with only a small loss
of accuracy. When those additional heuristics are employed the run time of the
more accurate algorithm is comparable to that of a simple BLAST search for data
sets with a high number of short query sequences. Moreover, the accuracy of the
Evolutionary Placement Algorithm is significantly higher, in particular when
the taxon sampling of the reference topology is sparse or inadequate. Our
algorithm, which has been integrated into RAxML, therefore provides an equally
fast but more accurate alternative to BLAST for phylogeny-aware analysis of
short-read sequence data.
