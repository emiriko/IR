We consider spectroscopies of strongly interacting atomic gases, and we
propose a model for describing the coupling between quasiparticles and gapless
phonon-like modes. Our model explains features in a wide range of different
experiments in both fermionic and bosonic atom gases in various spectroscopic
methods.
