We present the results of a neutron scattering study of the high energy
phonons in the superconducting graphite intercalation compound CaC$_6$. The
study was designed to address hitherto unexplored aspects of the lattice
dynamics in CaC$_6$, and in particular any renormalization of the out-of-plane
and in-plane graphitic phonon modes. We present a detailed comparison between
the data and the results of density functional theory (DFT). A description is
given of the analysis methods developed to account for the highly-textured
nature of the samples. The DFT calculations are shown to provide a good
description of the general features of the experimental data. This is
significant in light of a number of striking disagreements in the literature
between other experiments and DFT on CaC$_6$. The results presented here
demonstrate that the disagreements are not due to any large inaccuracies in the
calculated phonon frequencies.
