To fully understand the present position concerning so-called dark matter, it
is necessary to examine the historical background since, only by following this
approach, do all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. Here an attempt is
made to do this briefly and it is found that an interesting and important
question is raised. This question relates to the position of electromagnetism
in astronomical considerations since history indicates that, in the years
following the beginning of the 20th century, interest in electromagnetic
effects appeared to wane. Hence, following an examination of the history and
the presently accepted position where reliance for solutions seems confined to
examining gravitational effects, attention is turned to hypotheses based on
plasma physics to see if a more feasible solution to the problem of the missing
mass can be furnished utilising its fundamental ideas. While the purpose here
is to concentrate on dark matter and the supposed need for its introduction
into physics, this consideration of electromagnetic effects combined with the
realisation that most matter in the Universe is in the form of plasma also
indicates alternative routes to seeking solutions for other puzzling
astronomical phenomena.
