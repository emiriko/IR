We introduce K-deformations of generalized complex structures on a compact
Kahler manifold $M=(X, J)$ with an effective anti-canonical divisor and show
that obstructions to K-deformations of generalized complex structures on $M$
always vanish. Applying the stability theorem of generalized Kahler structures,
together with unobstructed K-deformations, we construct deformations of
bihermitian structures in the form $(J, J^-_t, h_t)$ on a compact Kahler
surface with a non-zero holomorphic Poisson structure. Then we prove that a
compact Kahler surface $S$ admits a non-trivial bihermitian structure if and
only if $S$ has a non-zero holomorphic Poisson structure.
