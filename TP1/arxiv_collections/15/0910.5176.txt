We report the first resolved bispectrum speckle interferometry of the
symbiotic binary CH Cyg. The measured component separation, $\rho=42 \pm 2$
mas, is consistent with the one derived from the known spectroscopic orbit and
distance. In particular, our result implies a total mass of the binary of
$M_{\rm t}=M_{\rm g}+M_{\rm wd}=3.7^{+3.5}_{-1.7} \rm M_{\sun}$, which is in
good agreement with the value $M_{\rm t}=2.7^{+1.2}_{-0.6} \rm M_{\sun}$
derived from the spectroscopic orbit solution for the red giant and
evolutionary contraints. We also show that the radio jets and the bipolar
outflow are not orthogonal to the orbital plane of the binary system.
