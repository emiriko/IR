The Pauli--Villars (PV) regularization scheme is applied to a calculation of
the dressed-electron state and its anomalous magnetic moment in
light-front-quantized quantum electrodynamics (QED) in Feynman gauge. The
regularization is provided by heavy, negative-metric fields added to the
Lagrangian. The light-front QED Hamiltonian then leads to a well-defined
eigenvalue problem for the dressed-electron state expressed as a Fock-state
expansion. The Fock-state wave functions satisfy coupled integral equations
that come from this eigenproblem. A finite system of equations is obtained by
truncation to no more than two photons and no positrons; this extends earlier
work that was limited to dressing by a single photon. Numerical techniques are
applied to solve the coupled system and compute the anomalous moment, for which
we obtain agreement with experiment, within numerical errors, but observe a
small systematic discrepancy that should be due to the absence of
electron-positron loops and of three-photon self-energy effects. We also
discuss the prospects for application of the method to quantum chromodynamics.
