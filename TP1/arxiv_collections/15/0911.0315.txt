In this talk, after reviewing the dynamical gluon mass generation mechanism
within the pinch technique framework and its phenomenological predictions, we
will introduce the modern formulation of the pinch technique which makes
extensive use of the Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization formalism. In this
framework a certain auxiliary function \Lambda_{\mu\nu}(q) - and its associated
form factors G(q^2) and L(q^2) -play a prominent role. After showing that in
the (background) Landau gauge \Lambda_{\mu\nu}(q) fully constrains the QCD
ghost sector, we show that G(q^2) coincides with the Kugo-Ojima function
u(q^2), whose infrared behavior has traditionally served as the standard
criterion for the realization of the Kugo-Ojima confinement mechanism. The
determination of the behavior of G(q^2) (and therefore of the Kugo-Ojima
function) for all momenta through a combination of the available lattice data
on the gluon and ghost propagators as well as the dynamical equation G(q^2)
satisfies, will be then discussed. In particular we will show that (i) in the
deep infrared the function deviates considerably from the value associated with
the realization of the Kugo-Ojima confinement scenario, and (ii) establish the
dependence on the renormalization point of u(q^2), and especially of its value
at q^2=0.
