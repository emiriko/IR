Recent results from the HERA ep collider are reviewed in these proceedings.
The results are from measurements that probe QCD at high-energy scales, as
defined by $Q^2$, the four-momentum-transfer squared of the collisions. These
cross-section measurements provide information about the parton distribution
functions (PDFs) of the proton and can be used to constrain global fits of
these PDFs. Recent measurements of the strong coupling $\alpha_S$ and jet
substructure from HERA at similar energy scales are also reviewed.
