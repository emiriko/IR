We present a general method to characterize the quantum correlations obtained
after local measurements on multipartite systems. Sufficient conditions for a
quantum system to be fully-nonlocal according to a given partition, as well as
being (genuinely) multipartite fully-nonlocal, are derived. These conditions
allow us to identify all completely-connected graph states as multipartite
fully-nonlocal quantum states. Moreover, we show that this feature can also be
observed in mixed states: the tensor product of five copies of the Smolin
state, a biseparable and bound entangled state, is multipartite fully-nonlocal.
