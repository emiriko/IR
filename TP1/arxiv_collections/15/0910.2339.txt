We study the effect of resonant scatterers on the local density of states in
a rectangular graphene setup with metallic leads. We find that the density of
states in a vicinity of the Dirac point acquires a strong position dependence
due to both metallic proximity effect and impurity scattering. This effect may
prevent uniform gating of weakly-doped samples. We also demonstrate that even a
single-atom impurity may essentially alter electronic states at low-doping on
distances of the order of the sample size from the impurity.
