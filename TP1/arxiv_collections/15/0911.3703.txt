Cooperative jump motions are studied for mutually interacting particles in a
one-dimensional periodic potential. The diffusion constant for the cooperative
motion in systems including a small number of particles is numerically
calculated and it is compared with theoretical estimates. We find that the size
distribution of the cooperative jump motions obeys an exponential law in a
large system.
