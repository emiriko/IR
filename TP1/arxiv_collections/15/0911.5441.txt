In an Endex reactor endothermic and exothermic reactions are directly
thermally coupled and kinetically matched to achieve intrinsic thermal
stability, efficient conversion, autothermal operation, and minimal heat
losses. Applied to the problem of in-line carbon dioxide separation from flue
gas, Endex principles hold out the promise of effecting a carbon dioxide
capture technology of unprecedented economic viability. In this work we
describe an Endex Calcium Looping reactor, in which heat released by
chemisorption of carbon dioxide onto calcium oxide is used directly to drive
the reverse reaction, yielding a pure stream of carbon dioxide for compression
and geosequestration. In this initial study we model the proposed reactor as a
continuous-flow dynamical system in the well-stirred limit, compute the steady
states and analyse their stability properties over the operating parameter
space, flag potential design and operational challenges, and suggest an optimum
regime for effective operation.
