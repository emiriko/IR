The purpose of this paper is to give a convergence analysis of the iterative
scheme: \bee u_n^\dl=qu_{n-1}^\dl+(1-q)T_{a_n}^{-1}K^*f_\dl,\quad
u_0^\dl=0,\eee where $T:=K^*K,\quad T_a:=T+aI,\quad q\in(0,1),\quad
a_n:=\alpha_0q^n, \alpha_0>0,$ with finite-dimensional approximations of $T$
and $K^*$ for solving stably Fredholm integral equations of the first kind with
noisy data.
