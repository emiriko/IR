The late part of the gravitational wave signal of binary neutron star
inspirals can in principle yield crucial information on the nuclear equation of
state via its dependence on relativistic tidal parameters. In the hope of
analytically describing the gravitational wave phasing during the late inspiral
(essentially up to contact) we propose an extension of the effective one body
(EOB) formalism which includes tidal effects. We compare the prediction of this
tidal-EOB formalism to recently computed nonconformally flat quasi-equilibrium
circular sequences of binary neutron star systems. Our analysis suggests the
importance of higher-order (post-Newtonian) corrections to tidal effects, even
beyond the first post-Newtonian order, and their tendency to {\it
significantly} increase the ``effective tidal polarizability'' of neutron
stars. We compare the EOB predictions to some recently advocated, nonresummed,
post-Newtonian based (``Taylor-T4'') description of the phasing of inspiralling
systems. This comparison shows the strong sensitivity of the late-inspiral
phasing to the choice of the analytical model, but raises the hope that a
sufficiently accurate numerical--relativity--``calibrated'' EOB model might
give us a reliable handle on the nuclear equation of state
