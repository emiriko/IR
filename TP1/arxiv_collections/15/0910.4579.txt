(Abridged) The dynamical ejection of stars from star clusters affects the
shape of the stellar mass function (MF) in these clusters, because the escape
probability of a star depends on its mass. The objective of this paper is to
provide and to apply a simple physical model for the evolution of the MF in
star clusters for a large range of the parameter space. The model is derived
from the basic principles of two-body encounters and energy considerations. It
is independent of the adopted mass loss rate or initial mass function (IMF),
and contains stellar evolution, stellar remnant retention, dynamical
dissolution in a tidal field, and mass segregation. It is found that the MF
evolution in star clusters depends on the disruption time, remnant retention
fraction, initial-final stellar mass relation, and IMF. Low-mass stars are
preferentially ejected after t~400 Myr. Before that time, masses around 15-20%
of the maximum stellar mass are lost. The degree of low-mass star depletion
grows for increasing disruption times, but can be quenched when the retained
fraction of massive remnants is large. The highly depleted MFs of certain
Galactic globular clusters are explained by the enhanced low-mass star
depletion that occurs for low remnant retention fractions. Unless the retention
fraction is exceptionally large, dynamical evolution always decreases the
mass-to-light ratio. The modeled evolution of the MF is consistent with N-body
simulations when adopting identical boundary conditions. However, it is found
that the results from N-body simulations only hold for their specific boundary
conditions and should not be generalised to all clusters. It is concluded that
the model provides an efficient method do understand the evolution of the
stellar MF in star clusters under widely varying conditions.
