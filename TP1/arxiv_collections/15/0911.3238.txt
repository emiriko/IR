The range corrections to the universal properties and structure of
two-neutron halo nuclei are investigated within an effective quantum mechanics
framework. Treating the nucleus as an effective three-body system, we make a
systematic improvement upon previous calculations by calculating the linear
range corrections at next-to-leading order. Since the effective ranges for the
neutron-core interactions are not known, we estimate the effective range to be
set by the inverse of the pion mass. We investigate the possibility of excited
Efimov states in two-neutron halo nuclei and calculate their mean square radii
to next-to-leading order. We find that the effective range corrections are
generally small and the leading order predictions are very robust.
