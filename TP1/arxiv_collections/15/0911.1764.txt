A family of replicator-like dynamics, called the escort replicator equation,
is constructed using information-geometric concepts and generalized information
entropies and diverenges from statistical thermodynamics. Lyapunov functions
and escort generalizations of basic concepts and constructions in evolutionary
game theory are given, such as an escorted Fisher's Fundamental theorem and
generalizations of the Shahshahani geometry.
