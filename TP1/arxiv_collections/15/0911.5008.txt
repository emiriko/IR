We investigate J/psi transverse momentum distribution in a transport
approach. While the nuclear modification factor R_{AA}(N_p) at RHIC is almost
the same as at SPS, the averaged transverse momentum square <p_t^2> and
R_{AA}(p_t) are very different at SPS, RHIC and LHC and can be used to
differentiate from the J/psi production mechanisms in high energy nuclear
collisions.
