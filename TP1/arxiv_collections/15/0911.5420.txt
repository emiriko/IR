The magnetic field dependence of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth for
optimally doped SmFeAsO_(1-x)F_y was investigated by combining torque
magnetometry, SQUID magnetometry, and muon-spin rotation. The results obtained
from these techniques show all a pronounced decrease of the superfluid density
as the field is increased up to 1.4 T. This behavior is analysed within a
two-band model with self-consistently derived coupled gaps, where the
superfluid density related to the larger gap is field independent and the
superfluid density related to the smaller gap is strongly suppressed with
increasing field.
