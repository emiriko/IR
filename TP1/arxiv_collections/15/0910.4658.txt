We report the coupling of individual InAs quantum dots (QDs) to an
external-mirror microcavity. The external mirror is bonded to a fiber and
positioned above a semiconductor sample consisting of a QD-containing GaAs
layer on top of a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR). This open cavity can be
rapidly tuned with a piezoelectric actuator without negatively affecting the QD
linewidth. A mirror radius of curvature of 42 microns and a cavity length of 10
microns enable good mode-matching and thus high collection efficiency directly
into the fiber. With an improved finesse this system may enter the strong
coupling regime.
