Applying general symmetry properties of electromagnetic interaction,
information from electron proton elastic scattering data can be related to
charge asymmetry in the annihilation channels $e^++e^-\leftrightarrow \bar p +
p$ and to the ratio of the cross section of elastic electron and positron
scattering on the proton. A compared analysis of the existing data allows to
draw conclusions on the reaction mechanism.
