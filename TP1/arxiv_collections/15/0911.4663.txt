The continuous wavelet transform is adapted to account for signal truncation
through renormalization and by modifying the shape of the analyzing window.
Comparison is made of the instant and integrated wavelet power with previous
algorithms. The edge adapted and renormalized admissible wavelet transforms are
used to estimate the level of solar magnetic activity from the sunspot record.
The solar activity is compared to Oerlemans' temperature reconstruction and to
the Central England Temperature record. A correlation is seen for years between
1610 and 1990, followed by a strong deviation as the recently observed
temperature increases.
