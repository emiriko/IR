I review results recently obtained within the Hamiltonian approach to
Yang-Mills theory in Coulomb gauge. In particular, I will present results for
the ghost and gluon propagators and compare these with recent lattice data.
Furthermore, I will give an interpretation of the inverse of the ghost form
factor as the dielectric function of the Yang-Mills vacuum. Our ansatz for the
vacuum wave functional will be checked by means of functional renormalization
group flow equations, which are solved for the gluon energy and the ghost form
factor. Finally, we calculate the Wilson loop for the vacuum wave functional
obtained from the variational approach, using a Dyson equation.
