We processed the data about radial velocities and HI linewidths for 1678 flat
edge-on spirals from the Revised Flat Galaxy Catalogue. We obtained the
parameters of the multipole components of large-scale velocity field of
collective non-Hubble galaxy motion as well as the parameters of the
generalized Tully-Fisher relationship in the "HI line width - linear diameter"
version. All the calculations were performed independently in the framework of
three models, where the multipole decomposition of the galaxy velocity field
was limited to a dipole, quadrupole and octopole terms respectively. We showed
that both the quadrupole and the octopole components are statistically
significant.
  On the basis of the compiled list of peculiar velocities of 1623 galaxies we
obtained the estimations of cosmological parameters Omega_m and sigma_8. This
estimation is obtained in both graphical form and as a constraint of the value
S_8=sigma_8(Omega_m/0.3)^0.35 = 0.91 +/- 0.05.
