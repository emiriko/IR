We adapt a biomechanical argument of Rashevsky, which places limits on the
stress experienced by a torso supported by the legs, to deduce that body mass
$m$ of growing children should scale as the $p$th power of height $h$ with
$7/3<p<8/3$. Further arguments based on stability and heat loss suggest that
$p$ should be close to 8/3. The arguments are extended to suggest that waist
circumference $w$ should scale as $h^q$ with $q$ near the lower end of $2/3\leq
q \leq 1$. Data from Hong Kong and British children are consistent with these
hypotheses.
