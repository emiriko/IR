We have reported elsewhere in this conference on our continuing project to
determine non-perturbative Wilson coefficients on the lattice, as a step
towards a completely non-perturbative determination of the nucleon structure.
In this talk we discuss how these Wilson coefficients can be used to extract
Nachtmann moments of structure functions, using the case of off-shell
Landau-gauge quarks as a first simple example. This work is done using overlap
fermions, because their improved chiral properties reduce the difficulties due
to operator mixing.
