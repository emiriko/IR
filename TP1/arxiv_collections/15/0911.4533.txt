We have given a new description of the lattice Yang-Mills theory a la
Cho-Faddeev-Niemi-Shabanov, which has enabled us to confirm in a
gauge-independent manner "Abelian"-dominance and magnetic-monopole dominance in
the Wilson loop average, yielding a gauge-independent dual superconductor
picture for quark confinement. In particular, we have given a new procedure
(called reduction) for obtaining a gauge-independent magnetic monopole from a
given Yang-Mills field. In this talk, we demonstrate how some of known
topological configurations in the SU(2) Yang-Mills theory such as merons and
instantons generate closed loops of magnetic-monopole current as the quark
confiner, both of which are characterized by the gauge-invariant topological
index, topological charge (density) and magnetic charge (density),
respectively. We also try to detect which type of topological configurations
exist in the lattice data involving magnetic-monopole loops generated by Monte
Carlo simulation. Here we apply a new geometrical algorithm based on
"computational homology" to discriminating each closed loop from clusters of
magnetic-monopole current, since the magnetic-monopole current on a lattice is
integer valued.
