We propose a way of generating optical lattices embedded in photonic
crystals. By setting up extended modes in photonic crystals, ultracold atoms
can be mounted in different types of field intensity distributions. This novel
way of constructing optical lattices can be used to produce more elaborate
periodic potentials by manufacturing appropriate geometries of photonic
crystals. We exemplify this with a square lattice and comment on the
possibility of using geometries with defects.
