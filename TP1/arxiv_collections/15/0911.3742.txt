In this paper, we apply transformation-based optics to the derivation of a
general class of transparent metamaterial slabs. By means of analytical and
numerical full-wave studies, we explore their image displacement/formation
capabilities, and establish intriguing connections with configurations already
known in the literature. Starting from these revisitations, we develop a number
of nontrivial extensions, and illustrate their possible applications to the
design of perfect radomes, anti-cloaking devices, and focusing devices based on
double-positive (possibly nonmagnetic) media. These designs show that such
anomalous features may be achieved without necessarily relying on
negative-index or strongly resonant metamaterials, suggesting more practical
venues for the realization of these devices.
