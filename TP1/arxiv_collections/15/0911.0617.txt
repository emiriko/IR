Beams of neutral polar molecules in a low-field seeking quantum state can be
slowed down using a Stark decelerator, and can subsequently be loaded and
confined in electrostatic quadrupole traps. The efficiency of the trap loading
process is determined by the ability to couple the decelerated packet of
molecules into the trap without loss of molecules and without heating. We
discuss the inherent difficulties to obtain ideal trap loading, and describe
and compare different trap loading strategies. A new "split-endcap" quadrupole
trap design is presented that enables improved trap loading efficiencies. This
is experimentally verified by comparing the trapping of OH radicals using the
conventional and the new quadrupole trap designs.
