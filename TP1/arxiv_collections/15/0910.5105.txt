We present an evaluation of the running coupling constant and the quark mass
renormalization factor for $N_f=2+1$ QCD. The Schr\"odinger functional scheme
is used as the intermediate scheme to carry out non-perturbative running from
the low energy region, where physical input is introduced, to deep in the high
energy perturbative region, where conversion to the ${\ovl{\rm MS}}$ scheme is
safely performed.
  For numerical simulations we adopted Iwasaki gauge action and
non-perturbatively improved Wilson fermion action with the clover term. Seven
renormalization scales are used to cover from low to high energy region and
three lattice spacings to take the continuum limit at each scale.
  Physical inputs are introduced from the previous $N_f=2+1$ simulation of the
CP-PACS/JL-QCD collaboration, which covered the up-down quark mass range
heavier than $m_\pi\sim 500$ MeV, and that of PACS-CS collaboration for much
lighter quark masses down to $m_\pi=155$ MeV.
