The average ground state energies for spin glasses on Bethe lattices of
connectivities r=3,...,15 are studied numerically for a Gaussian bond
distribution. The Extremal Optimization heuristic is employed which provides
high-quality approximations to ground states. The energies obtained from
extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit smoothly approach the ground-state
energy of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model for r->\infty. Consistently for all
values of r in this study, finite-size corrections are found to decay
approximately with ~N^{-4/5}. The possibility of ~N^{-2/3} corrections, found
previously for Bethe lattices with a bimodal +-J bond distribution and also for
the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, are constrained to the additional assumption
of very specific higher-order terms. Instance-to-instance fluctuations in the
ground state energy appear to be asymmetric up to the limit of the accuracy of
our heuristic. The data analysis provides insights into the origin of trivial
fluctuations when using continuous bonds and/or sparse networks.
