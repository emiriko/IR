In this paper, a family of radial deformations of the realization of the Lie
superalgebra osp(1|2) in the theory of Dunkl operators is obtained. This leads
to a Dirac operator depending on 3 parameters. Several function theoretical
aspects of this operator are studied, such as the associated measure, the
related Laguerre polynomials and the related Fourier transform. For special
values of the parameters, it is possible to construct the kernel of the Fourier
transform explicitly, as well as the related intertwining operator.
