We present a bigraphical framework suited for modeling biological systems
both at protein level and at membrane level. We characterize formally bigraphs
corresponding to biologically meaningful systems, and bigraphic rewriting rules
representing biologically admissible interactions. At the protein level, these
bigraphic reactive systems correspond exactly to systems of kappa-calculus.
Membrane-level interactions are represented by just two general rules, whose
application can be triggered by protein-level interactions in a well-de\"ined
and precise way. This framework can be used to compare and merge models at
different abstraction levels; in particular, higher-level (e.g. mobility)
activities can be given a formal biological justification in terms of low-level
(i.e., protein) interactions. As examples, we formalize in our framework the
vesiculation and the phagocytosis processes.
