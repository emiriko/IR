The classic example of a Type IIb supernova is SN 1993J, which had a cool
extended progenitor surrounded by a dense wind. There is evidence for another
category of Type IIb supernova which has a more compact progenitor with a lower
density, probably fast, wind. Distinguishing features of the compact category
are: weak optical emission from the shock heated envelope at early times;
nonexistent or very weak H emission in the late nebular phase; rapidly evolving
radio emission; rapid expansion of the radio shell; and expected nonthermal as
opposed to thermal X-ray emission. Type IIb supernovae that have one or more of
these features include SNe 1996cb, 2001ig, 2003bg, 2008ax, and 2008bo. All of
these with sufficient radio data (the last four) show evidence for presupernova
wind variability. We estimate a progenitor envelope radius ~1e11 cm for SN
2008ax, a value consistent with a compact Wolf-Rayet progenitor. Supernovae in
the SN 1993J extended category include SN 2001gd and probably the Cas A
supernova. We suggest that the compact Type IIb events be designated Type cIIb
and the extended ones Type eIIb. The H envelope mass dividing these categories
is ~0.1 Msun.
