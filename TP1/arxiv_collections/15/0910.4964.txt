The relation between the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF,
dN/dlogL) and globular cluster mass function (GCMF, dN/dlogM) is considered.
Due to low-mass star depletion, dissolving GCs have mass-to-light (M/L) ratios
that are lower than expected from their metallicities. This has been shown to
lead to an M/L ratio that increases with GC mass and luminosity. We model the
GCLF and GCMF and show that the power law slopes inherently differ (1.0 versus
0.7, respectively) when accounting for the variability of M/L. The observed
GCLF is found to be consistent with a Schechter-type initial cluster mass
function and a mass-dependent mass-loss rate.
