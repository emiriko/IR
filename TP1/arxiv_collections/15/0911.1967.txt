According to the Einstein, Weinberg, and M{\o}ller energy-momentum complexes,
we evaluate the energy distribution of the singularity-free solution of the
Einstein field equations coupled to a suitable nonlinear electrodynamics
suggested by Ay\'{o}n-Beato and Garc\'{i}a. The results show that the energy
associated with the definitions of Einstein and Weinberg are the same, but
M{\o}ller not. Using the power series expansion, we find out that the first two
terms in the expression are the same as the energy distributions of the
Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solution, and the third term could be used to survey the
factualness between numerous solutions of the Einstein field eqautions coupled
to a nonlinear electrodynamics.
