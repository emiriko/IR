The United States Code (Code) is an important source of Federal law that is
produced by the interactions of many heterogeneous actors in a complex, dynamic
space. The Code can be represented as the union of a hierarchical network and a
citation network over the vertices representing the language of the Code. In
this paper, we investigate the properties of the Code's citation network by
examining the directed degree distributions of the network. We find that the
power-law model is a plausible fit for the outdegree distribution but not for
the indegree distribution. In order to better understand this result, we
construct a model with the assumption that the probability of citation is a
per-word rate. We calculate the adjusted degree of each vertex under this model
and study the directed adjusted degree distributions. These adjusted degree
distributions indicate that both the adjusted indegree and outdegree
distributions seems to follow a log-normal form, not a power-law form. Our
findings indicate that the power-law is not generally applicable to degree
distributions within the United States Code but that the distribution of degree
per word is well-described by a log-normal model.
