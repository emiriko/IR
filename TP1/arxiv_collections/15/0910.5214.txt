We propose to use ferroelectric (Eu,Ba)TiO$_3$ ceramics just above their
magnetic ordering temperature for a sensitive electron electric dipole moment
search. We have synthesized a number of such ceramics with various Eu
concentrations and measured their properties relevant for such a search:
permeability, magnetization noise, and ferroelectric hysteresis loops. The
results of our measurements indicate that a search for the electron electric
dipole moment with Eu$_{0.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$ should lead to an order of
magnitude improvement on the current best limit.
