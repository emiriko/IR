Polarization dependent Raman scattering experiments realized on single GaAs
nanowires with different percentages of zinc-blende and wurtzite structure are
presented. The selection rules for the special case of nanowires are found and
discussed. In the case of zinc-blende, the transversal optical mode E1(TO) at
267 cm-1 exhibits the highest intensity when the incident and analyzed
polarization are parallel to the nanowire axis. This is a consequence of the
nanowire geometry and dielectric mismatch with the environment, and in quite
good agreement with the Raman selection rules. We also find a consistent
splitting of 1 cm-1 of the E1(TO). The transversal optical mode related to the
wurtzite structure, E2H, is measured between 254 and 256 cm-1, depending on the
wurtzite content. The azymutal dependence of E2H indicates that the mode is
excited with the highest efficiency when the incident and analyzed polarization
are perpendicular to the nanowire axis, in agreement with the selection rules.
The presence of strain between wurtzite and zinc-blende is analyzed by the
relative shift of the E1(TO) and E2H modes. Finally, the influence of the
surface roughness in the intensity of the longitudinal optical mode on {110}
facets is presented.
