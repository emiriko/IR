We study the agility of current-tunable oscillators based on a magnetic
vortex orbiting around a point contact in spin-valves. Theory predicts
frequency-tuning by currents occurs at constant orbital radius, so an
exceptional agility is anticipated. To test this, we have inserted an
oscillator in a microwave interferometer to apply abrupt current variations
while time resolving its emission. Using frequency shift keying, we show that
the oscillator can switch between two stabilized frequencies differing by 25%
in less than ten periods. With a wide frequency tunability and a good agility,
such oscillators possess desirable figures of merit for modulation-based rf
applications.
