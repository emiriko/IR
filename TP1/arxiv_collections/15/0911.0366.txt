The article reviews the general version of the Bohr collective model for the
description of quadrupole collective states, including a detailed study the
model's kinematics. The general form of the classical and quantum Bohr
Hamiltonian is presented together with a discussion of the tensor structure of
the collective wave functions and with a short review of various methods of
solving the Bohr Hamiltonian eigenvalue equation.The methods of derivation of
the classical and quantum Bohr Hamiltonian from the microscopic many-body
theory are recalled and the microscopic approach to the Bohr Hamiltonian is
applied to interpret collective properties of 12 heavy even-even nuclei in the
Hf-Hg region.
