Convergence of the classical Newton's method and its DSM version for solving
operator equations $F(u)=h$ is proved without any smoothness assumptions on
$F'(u)$. It is proved that every solvable equation $F(u)=f$ can be solved by
Newton's method if the initial approximation is sufficiently close to the
solution and $||[F'(y)]^{-1}||\leq m$, where $m>0$ is a constant.
