We present a theoretical study of Bose-Einstein condensation in highly
anisotropic harmonic traps. The bosons are considered to be moving in an
optical lattice in an overall anisotropic harmonic confining potential. We find
that two-step condensation occurs for lattice bosons at much reduced harmonic
potential anisotropy when compared to the case of an ideal bose gas in an
anisotropic harmonic confinement. We also show that when the bosons are in an
isotropic harmonic confinement but with highly anisotropic hopping in the
optical lattice, two-step condensation does not occur. We interpret some of our
results using single boson density of energy states corresponding to the
potentials faced by the bosons.
