We consider the random field Ising model and show rigorously that the spin
glass susceptibility at equilibrium is always bounded by the ferromagnetic
susceptibility, and therefore that no spin glass phase can be present at
equilibrium out of the ferromagnet critical line. When the magnetization is,
however, fixed to values smaller than the equilibrium one, a glassy phase can
exist, as we show explicitly on the Bethe lattice.
