We measured the temperature dependent infrared reflectivity spectra of MnF2
between 4 K and room temperature. We show that the phonon spectrum undergoes a
strong renormalization at TN. The ab-initio calculation we performed on this
compound accurately predict the magnitude and the direction of the phonon
parameters changes across the antiferromagnetic transition, showing that they
are mainly induced by the magnetic order. In this material, we found that the
dielectric constant is mostly from phonon origin. The large change in the
lattice parameters with temperature seen by X-ray diffraction as well as the
A2u phonon softening below TN indicate that magnetic order induced distortions
in MnF2 are compatible with the ferroelectric instabilities observed in TiO2,
FeF2 and other rutile-type fluorides. This study also shows the anomalous
temperature evolution of the lower energy Eu mode in the paramagnetic phase,
which can be compared to that of the B1g one seen by Raman spectroscopy in many
isostructural materials. This was interpreted as being a precursor of a phase
transition from rutile to CaCl2 structure which was observed under pressure in
ZnF2.
