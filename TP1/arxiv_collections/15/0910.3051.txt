Our goal is to provide a physical understanding of the elementary coupling
between photon and biexciton and to derive the physical characteristics of the
biexciton oscillator strength, following the procedure we used for trion.
Instead of the more standard two-photon absorption, this work concentrates on
molecular biexciton created by photon absorption in an exciton gas. We first
determine the appropriate set of coordinates in real and momentum spaces to
describe one biexciton as two interacting excitons. We then turn to second
quantization and introduce the "Fourier transform in the exciton sense" of the
biexciton wave function which is the relevant quantity for oscillator strength.
We find that, like for trion, the oscillator strength for the formation of one
biexciton out of one photon plus a \emph{single} exciton is extremely small: it
is one biexciton volume divided by one sample volume smaller than the exciton
oscillator strength. However, due to their quantum nature, trion and biexciton
have absorption lines which behave quite differently. Electrons and trions are
fermionic particles impossible to pile up all at the same energy. This would
make the weak trion line spread with electron density, the peak structure only
coming from singular many-body effects. By contrast, the bosonic nature of
exciton and biexciton makes the biexciton peak mainly rise with exciton
density, this rise being simply linear if we forget many-body effects between
the photocreated exciton and the excitons present in the sample.
