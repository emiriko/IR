We take advantage of good atmospheric transparency and the availability of
high quality instrumentation in the 1 um near-infrared atmospheric window to
present a grid of F, G, K, and M spectral standards observed at high spectral
resolution (R ~ 25,000). In addition to a spectral atlas, we present a catalog
of atomic line absorption features in the 0.95-1.11 um range. The catalog
includes a wide range of line excitation potentials, from 0-13 eV, arising from
neutral and singly ionized species, most frequently those of Fe I and Ti I at
low excitation, Cr I, Fe I, and Si I at moderate excitation, and C I, S I, and
Si I having relatively high excitation. The spectra also include several
prominent molecular bands from CN and FeH. For the atomic species, we analyze
trends in the excitation potential, line depth, and equivalent width across the
grid of spectroscopic standards to identify temperature and surface gravity
diagnostics near 1 um. We identify the line ratios that appear especially
useful for spectral typing as those involving Ti I and C I or S I, which are
temperature sensitive in opposite directions, and Sr II, which is gravity
sensitive at all spectral types. Ascii versions of all spectra are available to
download with the electronic version of the journal.
