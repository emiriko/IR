We have experimentally investigated the soliton interaction in a passively
mode-locked fiber ring laser and revealed the existence of three types of
strong soliton interaction: a global type of soliton interaction caused by the
existence of unstable CW components; a local type of soliton interaction
mediated through the radiative dispersive waves; and the direct soliton
interaction. We found that the appearance of the various soliton operation
modes observed in the passively mode locked fiber soliton lasers are the direct
consequences of these three types of soliton interaction. The soliton
interaction in the laser is further numerically simulated based on a pulse
tracing technique. The numerical simulations confirmed the existence of the
dispersive wave mediated soliton interaction and the direct soliton
interaction. Furthermore, it was shown that the resonant dispersive waves
mediated soliton interaction in the laser always has the consequence of causing
random irregular relative soliton movement, and the experimentally observed
states of bound solitons are caused by the direct soliton interaction. In
particular, as the solitons generated in the laser could have a profile with
long tails, the direct soliton interaction could extend to a soliton separation
that is larger than 5 times of the soliton pulse width.
