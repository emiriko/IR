The Lagrangian and Eulerian transversal velocity structure functions of fully
developed fluid turbulence are found basing on the Navier-Stokes equation. The
structure functions are shown to obey the scaling relations inside the inertial
range. The scaling exponents are calculated analytically without using
dimensional considerations. The obtained values are in a very good agreement
with recent numerical and experimental data.
