The abundant $\psi'$ events have been collected at the Beijing Electron
Positron Collider-II (BEPCII) that could undoubtedly provide us with a great
opportunity to study the more attractive charmonium decays. As has been noticed
before, in the process of $J/\psi$ decaying to the baryonic final states, $p
K^- \bar{\Lambda}$, the evident $\Lambda^*$ and $N^*$ bands have been observed.
Similarly, by using the product of $\chi_{cJ}$ from $\psi'$ radiative decay, we
may confirm it or find some extra new resonances. $\chi_{c0}$'s data samples
will be more than $\chi_{c1,2}$ taking into account the larger branching ratio
of $\psi'\to\gamma\chi_{c0}$. Here, we provide explicit partial wave analysis
formulae for the very interesting channel $\psi'\to\gamma\chi_{c0}\to \gamma p
K^- \bar{\Lambda}$.
