In this article the Ginzburg-Landau theory ideas are considered in their
application to the description of fluctuations influence on the superfluid
density in superconductor. The conclusion about the availability of two
incompatible mathematical definitions of the superfluid density is made. That
is why, it is suggested not to consider the fluctuating part of order
parameter, while calculating the superconductor thermodynamical characteristics
in the Mean Field Approximation.
