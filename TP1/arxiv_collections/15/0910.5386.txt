In this paper we propose a novel approach aimed at building a new class of
information system platforms which we call the "Knowledge-work Support Systems"
or KwSS. KwSS can play a significant role in enhancing the IS support for
knowledge management processes, including those customarily identified as less
amenable to IS support. In our approach we try to enhance basic functionalities
provided by the computer-based information systems, namely, that of improving
the efficiency of the knowledge workers in accessing, processing and creating
useful information. The improvement, along with proper focus on cultural,
social and other aspects of the knowledge management processes, can enhance the
workers' efficiency significantly in performing high quality knowledge works.
In order to build the proposed approach, we develop several new concepts. The
approach analyzes the information availability and usage from the knowledge
workers and their works' perspectives and consequently brings forth more
transparency in various aspects of information life-cycle with respect to
knowledge management. KsSSes are technology platforms, which can be implemented
independently as well as in conjunction with other knowledge management and
data management technology platforms, to provide significant boost in the
knowledge capabilities of organizations.
