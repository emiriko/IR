In this paper we study the computational complexity of computing the
noncommutative determinant. We first consider the arithmetic circuit complexity
of computing the noncommutative determinant polynomial. Then, more generally,
we also examine the complexity of computing the determinant (as a function)
over noncommutative domains. Our hardness results are summarized below:
  1. We show that if the noncommutative determinant polynomial has small
noncommutative arithmetic circuits then so does the noncommutative permanent.
Consequently, the commutative permanent polynomial has small commutative
arithmetic circuits. 2. For any field F we show that computing the n X n
permanent over F is polynomial-time reducible to computing the 2n X 2n
(noncommutative) determinant whose entries are O(n^2) X O(n^2) matrices over
the field F. 3. We also derive as a consequence that computing the n X n
permanent over nonnegative rationals is polynomial-time reducible to computing
the noncommutative determinant over Clifford algebras of n^{O(1)} dimension.
  Our techniques are elementary and use primarily the notion of the Hadamard
Product of noncommutative polynomials.
