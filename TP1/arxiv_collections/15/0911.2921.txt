We construct a classical dynamical system whose phase space is a certain
infinite-dimensional Grassmannian manifold, and propose that it is equivalent
to the large N limit of two-dimensional QCD with an O(2N+1) gauge group. In
this theory, we find that baryon number is a topological quantity that is
conserved only modulo 2. We also relate this theory to the master field
approach to matrix models.
