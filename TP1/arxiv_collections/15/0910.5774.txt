We present multi-band results for GRB071010B based on \Swift, \Suzaku, and
ground-based optical observations. This burst is an ideal target to evaluate
the robustness of the ${\rm E^{src}_{peak}-E_{iso}}$ and ${\rm
E^{src}_{peak}-E_{\gamma}}$ relations, whose studies have been in stagnation
due to the lack of the combined estimation of $\rm E^{src}_{peak}$ and long
term optical monitoring. The joint prompt spectral fitting using \Swift/Burst
Alert Telescope and \Suzaku/Wide-band All sky Monitor data yielded the spectral
peak energy as E$^{src}_{peak}$ of $86.5^{+6.4}_{-6.3}$ keV and E$_{iso}$ of
$2.25^{+0.19}_{-0.16}\times10^{52}$ erg with $z=0.947$. The optical afterglow
light curve is well fitted by a simple power law with temporal index
$\alpha=-0.60\pm0.02$. The lower limit of temporal break in the optical light
curve is 9.8 days. Our multi-wavelength analysis reveals that GRB071010B
follows ${\rm E^{src}_{peak}-E_{iso}}$ but violates the ${\rm
E^{src}_{peak}-E_{\gamma}}$ and ${\rm E_{iso}-E^{src}_{peak}-t^{src}_{jet}}$ at
more than the 3$\sigma$ level.
