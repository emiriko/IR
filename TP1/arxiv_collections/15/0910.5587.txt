We formulate and investigate the simplest version of time-optimal quantum
computation theory (t-QCT), where the computation time is defined by the
physical one and the Hamiltonian contains only one- and two-qubit interactions.
This version of t-QCT is also considered as optimality by sub-Riemannian
geodesic length. The work has two aims: one is to develop a t-QCT itself based
on physically natural concept of time, and the other is to pursue the
possibility of using t-QCT as a tool to estimate the complexity in conventional
gate-optimal quantum computation theory (g-QCT). In particular, we investigate
to what extent is true the statement: time complexity is polynomial in the
number of qubits if and only if so is gate complexity. In the analysis, we
relate t-QCT and optimal control theory (OCT) through fidelity-optimal
computation theory (f-QCT); f-QCT is equivalent to t-QCT in the limit of unit
optimal fidelity, while it is formally similar to OCT. We then develop an
efficient numerical scheme for f-QCT by modifying Krotov's method in OCT, which
has monotonic convergence property. We implemented the scheme and obtained
solutions of f-QCT and of t-QCT for the quantum Fourier transform and a unitary
operator that does not have an apparent symmetry. The former has a polynomial
gate complexity and the latter is expected to have exponential one because a
series of generic unitary operators has a exponential gate complexity. The time
complexity for the former is found to be linear in the number of qubits, which
is understood naturally by the existence of an upper bound. The time complexity
for the latter is exponential. Thus the both targets are examples satisfyng the
statement above. The typical characteristics of the optimal Hamiltonians are
symmetry under time-reversal and constancy of one-qubit operation, which are
mathematically shown to hold in fairly general situations.
