We show that for all but finitely many compact orientable surfaces, any
superinjective map from the complex of separating curves into the Torelli
complex is induced by an element of the extended mapping class group. As an
application, we prove that any injective homomorphism from a finite index
subgroup of the Johnson kernel into the Torelli group for such a surface is
induced by an element of the extended mapping class group.
