We make a review of the main nuclear effects that affect neutrino-nucleus
cross sections. We discuss how the different models in the literature try to
describe these different effects, and thus try to compare between them. We
focus on the quasi-elastic reaction in the neutrino energy region of around 1
GeV, where recent data from MiniBoone are available. Among the issues discussed
are the different treatment of medium corrections to initial and nal state
nucleon wave functions and the problem of the rescattering of ejected nucleons.
