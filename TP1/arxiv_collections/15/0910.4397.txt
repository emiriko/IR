This paper investigates the problem of determining a binary-valued function
through a sequence of strategically selected queries. The focus is an algorithm
called Generalized Binary Search (GBS). GBS is a well-known greedy algorithm
for determining a binary-valued function through a sequence of strategically
selected queries. At each step, a query is selected that most evenly splits the
hypotheses under consideration into two disjoint subsets, a natural
generalization of the idea underlying classic binary search. This paper
develops novel incoherence and geometric conditions under which GBS achieves
the information-theoretically optimal query complexity; i.e., given a
collection of N hypotheses, GBS terminates with the correct function after no
more than a constant times log N queries. Furthermore, a noise-tolerant version
of GBS is developed that also achieves the optimal query complexity. These
results are applied to learning halfspaces, a problem arising routinely in
image processing and machine learning.
