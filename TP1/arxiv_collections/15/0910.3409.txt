There have been numerous developments in hadron spectroscopy over the past
year. In this brief review I focus on two general areas. In the first I give an
update on hadrons with b-quarks. Their properties are in textbook agreement
with QCD motivated constituent quark models. The second topic is the
Charmonium-like $XYZ$ states above open charm threshold that continue to be
discovered. Many of these do not seem to be described as conventional c\bar{c}
states and may be hadronic molecules, Tetraquarks, or Charmonium Hybrids. The
first topic is an example of how well we seem to understand hadrons while the
second case reminds us of how much we still have to learn.
