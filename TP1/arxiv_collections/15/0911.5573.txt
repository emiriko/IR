We investigate strongly interacting dense matter and neutron stars using a
flavor-SU(3) approach based on a non-linear realization of chiral symmetry as
well as a hadronic flavor-SU(2) parity-doublet model. We study chiral symmetry
restoration and the equation of state of stellar matter and determine neutron
star properties using different sets of degrees of freedom. Finally, we include
quarks in the model approach. We show the resulting phase diagram as well as
hybrid star solutions for this model.
