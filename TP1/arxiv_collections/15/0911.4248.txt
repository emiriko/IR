We present solar photospheric abundances for 12 elements from optical and
near-infrared spectroscopy. The abundance analysis was conducted employing 3D
hydrodynamical (CO5BOLD) as well as standard 1D hydrostatic model atmospheres.
We compare our results to others with emphasis on discrepancies and still
lingering problems, in particular exemplified by the pivotal abundance of
oxygen. We argue that the thermal structure of the lower solar photosphere is
very well represented by our 3D model. We obtain an excellent match of the
observed center-to-limb variation of the line-blanketed continuum intensity,
also at wavelengths shortward of the Balmer jump.
