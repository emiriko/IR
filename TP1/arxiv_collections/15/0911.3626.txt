We discuss formulation of Wilson polygon - MHV amplitude duality at the
perturbative level in various regularizations. For four gluons it is shown that
at one loop one can formulate diagrammatic correspondence interpolating between
the dimensional regularization and the off-shell one. We suggest new
interpretation of all types of box diagrams in terms of the dual simplex in
dimensional regularization and describe its degeneration to the Wilson polygon.
The interesting nullification phenomena for the low-energy amplitudes in the
Higgsed phase has been found.
