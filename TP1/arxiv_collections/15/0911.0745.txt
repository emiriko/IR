We show that there is a tradeoff between the useful key distribution bit rate
and the total length of deployed fiber in tree-type passive optical networks
for BB84 quantum key distribution applications. A two stage splitting
architecture where one splitting is carried in the central office and a second
in the outside plant and figure of merit to account for the tradeoff are
proposed. We find that there is an optimum solution for the splitting ratios of
both stages in the case of Photon Number Splitting (PNS) attacks and Decoy
State transmission. We then analyze the effects of the different relevant
physical parameters of the PON on the optimum solution.
