During direct numerical simulation of the isotropic turbulence of surface
gravity waves in the framework of Hamiltonian equations formation of the long
wave background or condensate was observed. Exponents of the direct cascade
spectra at the different levels of an artificial condensate suppression show a
tendency to become closer to the prediction of the wave turbulence theory at
lower levels of condensate. A simple qualitative explanation of the mechanism
of this phenomenon is proposed.
