We consider the approximation scheme of the American call option via the
discrete Morse semiflow. It is the minimizing scheme of a time-semidiscretized
variational functional. In this paper we obtain a rate of convergence of
approximate solutions. In addition, the convergence of approximate free
boundaries is proved.
