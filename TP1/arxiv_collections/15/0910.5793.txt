We analyze the dynamics of the entanglement in two independent non-Markovian
channels. In particular, we focus on the entanglement dynamics as a function of
the initial states and the channel parameters like the temperature and the
ratio $r$ between $\omega_0$ the characteristic frequency of the quantum system
of interest, and $\omega_c$ the cut-off frequency of Ohmic reservoir. We give a
stationary analysis of the concurrence and find that the dynamic of
non-markovian entanglement concurrence $\mathcal{C}_{\rho}(t)$ at temperature
$k_BT=0$ is different from the $k_BT>0$ case. We find that "entanglement sudden
death" (ESD) depends on the initial state when $k_BT=0$, otherwise the
concurrence always disappear at finite time when $k_BT>0$, which means that ESD
must happen. The main result of this paper is that the non-Markovian
entanglement dynamic is fundamentally different from the Markovian one. In the
Markovian channel, entanglement decays exponentially and vanishes only
asymptotically, but in the non-Markovian channel the concurrence
$\mathcal{C}_{\rho}(t)$ oscillates, especially in the high temperature case.
Then an open-loop controller adjusted by the temperature is proposed to control
the entanglement and prolong the ESD time.
