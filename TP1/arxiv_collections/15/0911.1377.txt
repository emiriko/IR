The effects of the final state interaction in slow proton production in semi
inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes off nuclei, A(e,e'p)X, are
investigated in details within the spectator and target fragmentation
mechanisms; in the former mechanism, the hard interaction on a nucleon of a
correlated pair leads, by recoil, to the emission of the partner nucleon,
whereas in the latter mechanism proton is produced when the diquark, which is
formed right after the visrtual photon-quark interaction, captures a quark from
the vacuum. Unlike previous papers on the subject, particular attention is paid
on the effects of the final state interaction of the hadronizing quark with the
nuclear medium within an approach based upon an effective time-dependent cross
section which combines the soft and hard parts of hadronization dynamics in
terms of the string model and perturbative QCD, respectively. It is shown that
the final state interaction of the hadronizing quark with the medium plays a
relevant role both in deuteron and complex nuclei; nonetheless, kinematical
regions where final state interaction effects are minimized can experimentally
be selected, which would allow one to investigate the structure functions of
nucleons embedded in the nuclear medium; likewise, regions where the
interaction of the struck hadronizing quark with the nuclear medium is
maximized can be found, which would make it possible to study non perturbative
hadronization mechanisms.
