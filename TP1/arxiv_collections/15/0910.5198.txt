We report a comprehensive investigation of the suppression of the critical
temperature Tc of NdFeAs(OF) single crystal by alpha-particle irradiation. Our
data indicate that irradiation defects produce both nonmagnetic and magnetic
scattering, resulting in the Kondo-like excess resistance $\Delta\rho(T)\propto
ln T$ over 2 decades in temperatures above $T_c$. Despite high densities of
irradiation defects, the dose at which $T_c$ is suppressed to zero is
comparable to that for MgB2 but is well above the corresponding values for
cuprates.
