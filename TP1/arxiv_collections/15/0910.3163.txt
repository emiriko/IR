From a study of the X(3872) mass and width based on the world's largest
sample of $X(3872)\to J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ decays, we find that our X(3872) signal
is consistent with a single state, and leads to the most precise measurement of
the X(3872) mass. We also report the recent evidence for a new narrow
structure, Y(4140), decaying to the $J/\psi \phi$ final state, in exclusive
$B^+\to J/\psi\phi K^+$ decays in a data sample corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 2.7 \ifb collected at the CDF II detector. This narrow structure
with its mass well above open charm pairs is unlikely to be a candidate for a
conventional charmonium state.
