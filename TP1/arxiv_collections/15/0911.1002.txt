A self-consistent global fitting method based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
technique to study the dark matter (DM) property associated with the cosmic ray
electron/positron excesses was developed in our previous work. In this work we
further improve the previous study to include the hadronic branching ratio of
DM annihilation/decay. The PAMELA $\bar{p}/p$ data are employed to constrain
the hadronic branching ratio. We find that the 95% ($2\sigma$) upper limits of
the quark branching ratio allowed by the PAMELA $\bar{p}/p$ data is $\sim
0.032$ for DM annihilation and $\sim 0.044$ for DM decay respectively. This
result shows that the DM coupling to pure leptons is indeed favored by the
current data. Based on the global fitting results, we further study the
neutrino emission from DM in the Galactic center. Our predicted neutrino flux
is some smaller than previous works since the constraint from $\gamma$-rays is
involved. However, it is still capable to be detected by the forth-coming
neutrino detector such as IceCube. The improved points of the present study
compared with previous works include: 1) the DM parameters, both the particle
physical ones and astrophysical ones, are derived in a global fitting way, 2)
constraints from various species of data sets, including $\gamma$-rays and
antiprotons are included, and 3) the expectation of neutrino emission is fully
self-consistent.
