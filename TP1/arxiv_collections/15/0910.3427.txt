Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless transmission imposes huge
challenges on the design of efficient hardware architectures for iterative
receivers. A major challenge is soft-input soft-output (SISO) MIMO demapping,
often approached by sphere decoding (SD). In this paper, we introduce the - to
our best knowledge - first VLSI architecture for SISO SD applying a single
tree-search approach. Compared with a soft-output-only base architecture
similar to the one proposed by Studer et al. in IEEE J-SAC 2008, the
architectural modifications for soft input still allow a one-node-per-cycle
execution. For a 4x4 16-QAM system, the area increases by 57% and the operating
frequency degrades by 34% only.
