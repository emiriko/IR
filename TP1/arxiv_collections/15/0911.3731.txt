The Grassmann structure of the critical XXZ spin chain is studied in the
limit to conformal field theory. A new description of Virasoro Verma modules is
proposed in terms of Zamolodchikov's integrals of motion and two families of
fermionic creation operators. The exact relation to the usual Virasoro
description is found up to level 6.
