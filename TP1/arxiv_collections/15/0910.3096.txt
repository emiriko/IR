To develop an understanding of recent experiments on the turbulence-induced
melting of a periodic array of vortices in a thin fluid film, we perform a
direct numerical simulation of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations
forced such that, at low Reynolds numbers, the steady state of the film is a
square lattice of vortices. We find that, as we increase the Reynolds number,
this lattice undergoes a series of nonequilibrium phase transitions, first to a
crystal with a different reciprocal lattice and then to a sequence of crystals
that oscillate in time. Initially the temporal oscillations are periodic; this
periodic behaviour becomes more and more complicated, with increasing Reynolds
number, until the film enters a spatially disordered nonequilibrium statistical
steady that is turbulent. We study this sequence of transitions by using
fluid-dynamics measures, such as the Okubo-Weiss parameter that distinguishes
between vortical and extensional regions in the flow, ideas from nonlinear
dynamics, e.g., \Poincare maps, and theoretical methods that have been
developed to study the melting of an equilibrium crystal or the freezing of a
liquid and which lead to a natural set of order parameters for the crystalline
phases and spatial autocorrelation functions that characterise short- and
long-range order in the turbulent and crystalline phases, respectively.
