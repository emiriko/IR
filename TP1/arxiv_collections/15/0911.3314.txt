There are three possibly types of particle colliders schemes: familiar (well
known) ring-ring colliders, less familiar however sufficiently advanced linear
colliders and less familiar and less advanced linac-ring type colliders. The
aim of this paper is two-fold: to present possibly complete list of papers on
linac-ring type collider proposals and to emphasize the role of linac-ring type
machines for future HEP research.
