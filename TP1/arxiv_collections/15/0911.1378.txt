Quantum degenerate cold-atom gases provide a remarkable opportunity to study
strongly interacting systems. Recent experimental progress in producing
ultracold polar molecules with a net electric dipole moment opens up new
possibilities to realize novel quantum phases governed by the long-range and
anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions. In this work we predict the existence
of experimentally observable novel broken-symmetry states with spontaneous
interlayer coherence in cold polar molecules. These exotic states appear due to
strong repulsive interlayer interactions and exhibit properties of superfluids,
ferromagnets and excitonic condensates.
