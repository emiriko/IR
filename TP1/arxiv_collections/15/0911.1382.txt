The cross sections for a variety of diffractive processes in proton-nucleus
scattering, associated with large gaps in rapidity, are calculated within an
improved Glauber-Gribov theory, where the inelastic shadowing corrections are
summed to all orders by employing the dipole representation. The effects of
nucleon correlations, leading to a modification of the nuclear thickness
function, are also taken into account. Numerical calculations are performed for
the energies of the HERA-B experiment, and the RHIC and LHC colliders, and for
several nuclei. It is found that whereas the Gribov corrections generally make
nuclear matter more transparent, nucleon correlations act in the opposite
direction and have important effects in various diffractive processes.
