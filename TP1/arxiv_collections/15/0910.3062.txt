The Renyi statistics in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles is
examined in the general case and in particular for the ideal gas. In the
microcanonical ensemble the Renyi statistics is equivalent with the
Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics. By the exact analytical results for the ideal gas,
it is shown that in the canonical ensemble in the thermodynamic limit the Renyi
statistics is also equivalent with the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics. Furthermore
it satisfies the requirements of the equilibrium thermodynamics, i.e. the
thermodynamical potential of the statistical ensemble is a homogeneous function
of degree 1 of its extensive variables of state. We conclude that the Renyi
statistics duplicates the thermodynamical relations stemming from the
Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics in the thermodynamical limit.
