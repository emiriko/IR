Microwave zebra pattern structure is an intriguing fine structure on the
dynamic spectra of solar type IV radio burst. Up to now, there isn't a perfect
physical model for the origin of the solar microwave zebra pattern. Recently,
Ledenev, Yan and Fu (2006) put forward an interference mechanism to explain the
features of microwave zebra patterns in solar continuum events. This model
needs a structure with a multitude of discrete narrow-band sources of small
size. Based on the model of current-carrying plasma loop and the theory of
tearing mode instability, we proposed that the above structure does exist and
may provide the main conditions for the interference mechanism. With this
model, we may explain the frequency upper limit, the formation of the parallel
and equidistant stripes, the superfine structure and intermediate frequency
drift rate of the zebra stripes. If this explanation is valid, the zebra
pattern structures can reveal some information of the motion and the inner
structures of the coronal plasma loops.
