The chiral-odd transversity generalized parton distributions of the nucleon
can be accessed experimentally through the exclusive photoproduction process
gamma N -> pi rhoT N', with or without beam and target polarization, provided
the vector meson is produced in a transversely polarized state. The kinematical
domain of factorization is defined through a large invariant mass of the meson
pair and a small transverse momentum of the final nucleon. We calculate
perturbatively the scattering amplitude at leading order in alpha_s and build a
simple model for the dominant transversity GPD H_T(x, xi, t) based on the
concept of double distribution. Counting rate estimates are in progress.
