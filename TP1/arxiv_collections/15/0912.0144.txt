Since the IUE satellite produced a vast collection of high-resolution UV
spectra of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe), there has not been any
further systematic study of the stellar winds of these stars. The high spectral
resolution, sensitivity and large number of archival observations in the FUSE
archive allow the study of the stellar winds of CSPNe in the far UV domain
where lines of species spanning a wide excitation range can be observed. We
present here a preliminary analysis of the P Cygni profiles of a sample of 60
CSPNe observed by FUSE. P Cygni profiles evidencing fast stellar winds with
velocities between 200 and 4,300 km/s have been found in 40 CSPNe. In many
cases, this is the first time that fast stellar winds have been reported for
these PNe. A detailed study of these far-UV spectra is on-going.
