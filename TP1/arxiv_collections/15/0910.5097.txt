A natural explanation of confinement can be given in terms of symmetry. Since
color symmetry is exact, the candidate symmetry is dual and related to
homotopy,i.e., in (3+1)d, to magnetic charge conservation. A set of r abelian
'tHooft-like tensors (r = rank of the gauge group) can be defined and the dual
charge is a violation of the corresponding Bianchi identities. It is shown that
this is equivalently described by non-abelian Bianchi identities.
