We use a 1D thermochemical and photochemical kinetics model to predict the
disequilibrium stratospheric chemistries of warm and hot Jupiters (800 < T <
1200 K). Thermal chemistry and vertical mixing are generally more important
than photochemistry. At 1200 K, methane is oxidized to CO and CO2 by OH
radicals from thermal decomposition of water. At T < 1000 K, methane is
reactive but stable enough to reach the stratosphere, while water is stable
enough that OH levels are suppressed by reaction with H2. These trends raise
the effective C/O ratio in the reacting gases above unity. Reduced products
such as ethylene, acetylene, and hydrogen cyanide become abundant; further
polymerization should lead to formation of PAHs (Poly-Aromatic Hydrocarbons)
and soots. Parallel shifts are seen in the sulfur chemistry, with CS and CS2
displacing S2 and HS as the interesting disequilibrium products. Although lower
temperature is a leading factor favoring hydrocarbons, higher rates of vertical
mixing, lower metallicities, and lower incident UV radiation also favor organic
synthesis. Acetylene (the first step toward PAHs) formation is especially
favored by high eddy diffusion coefficients Kzz > 10^10 cm2/s. In most cases
planetary compositions inferred from transit observations will differ markedly
from those inferred from reflected or emitted light from the same planet. The
peculiar properties of HD 189733b compared to other hot Jupiters - a broadband
blue haze, little sign of Na or K, and hints of low metallicity - can be
explained by an organic haze if the planet is cool enough. Whether this
interpretation applies to HD 189733b itself, many organic-rich warm Jupiters
are sure to be discovered in the near future.
