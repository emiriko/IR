We discuss various ways in which the computation of conservative
Gravitational Self Force (GSF) effects on a point mass moving in a
Schwarzschild background can inform us about the basic building blocks of the
Effective One-Body (EOB) Hamiltonian. We display the information which can be
extracted from the recently published GSF calculation of the first-GSF-order
shift of the orbital frequency of the last stable circular orbit, and we
combine this information with the one recently obtained by comparing the EOB
formalism to high-accuracy numerical relativity (NR) data on coalescing binary
black holes. The information coming from GSF data helps to break the degeneracy
(among some EOB parameters) which was left after using comparable-mass NR data
to constrain the EOB formalism. We suggest various ways of obtaining more
information from GSF computations: either by studying eccentric orbits, or by
focussing on a special zero-binding zoom-whirl orbit. We show that logarithmic
terms start entering the post-Newtonian expansions of various (EOB and GSF)
functions at the fourth post-Newtonian (4PN) level, and we analytically compute
the first logarithm entering a certain, gauge-invariant "redshift" GSF function
(defined along the sequence of circular orbits).
