We present and analyze a gauge-invariant quantum theory of the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with dust. We construct the reduced phase
space spanned by gauge-invariant quantities by using the so-called relational
formalism at the classical level. The reduced phase space thereby obtained can
be quantized in the same manner as an ordinary mechanical system. We carry out
the quantization and obtain the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. This quantization
procedure realizes a possible resolution to the problem of time and observables
in canonical quantum gravity. We analyze the classical initial singularity of
the theory by evolving a wave packet backward in time and evaluating the
expectation value of the scale factor. It is shown that the initial singularity
of the Universe is avoided by the quantum gravitational effects.
