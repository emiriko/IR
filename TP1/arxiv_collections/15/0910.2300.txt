We report on our analytical study of two-color QCD with an even number of
flavors at high baryon density. Based on the pattern of chiral symmetry
breaking induced by BCS-type diquark pairing we construct the low-energy
effective Lagrangian for the Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We also identify a new
epsilon-regime at high baryon density and derive Leutwyler-Smilga-type spectral
sum rules for the complex eigenvalues of the Dirac operator in terms of the
fermion gap. Our results can in principle be tested in lattice QCD simulations.
