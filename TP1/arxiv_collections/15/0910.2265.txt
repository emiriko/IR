Using an effective theory approach, we calculate the neutron electric dipole
moment (nEDM) in the minimal left-right symmetric model with both explicit and
spontaneous CP violations. We integrate out heavy particles to obtain
flavor-neutral CP-violating effective Lagrangian. We run the Wilson
coefficients from the electroweak scale to the hadronic scale using one-loop
renormalization group equations. Using the state-of-the-art hadronic matrix
elements, we obtain the nEDM as a function of right-handed W-boson mass and
CP-violating parameters. We use the current limit on nEDM combined with the
kaon-decay parameter $\epsilon$ to provide the most stringent constraint yet on
the left-right symmetric scale $ M_{W_R} > (10 \pm 3) $ TeV.
