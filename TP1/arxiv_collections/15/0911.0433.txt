We introduce a framework of opto-mechanical systems that are driven with a
mildly amplitude modulated light field, but that are not subject to classical
feedback or squeezed input light. We find that in such a system one can achieve
large degrees of squeezing of a mechanical micromirror signifying quantum
properties of opto-mechanical systems - without the need of any feedback and
control, and within parameters reasonable in experimental settings.
Entanglement dynamics is shown of states following classical quasi-periodic
orbits in their first moments. We discuss the complex time dependence of the
modes of a cavity-light field and a mechanical mode in phase space. Such
settings give rise to certifiable quantum properties within experimental
conditions feasible with present technology.
