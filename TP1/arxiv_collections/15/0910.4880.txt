Chiral perturbation theory in the two--flavour sector allows one to analyse
Green functions in QCD in the limit where the strange quark mass is considered
to be large in comparison to the external momenta and to the light quark masses
m_u and m_d. In this framework, the low--energy constants of SU{2}_R \times
SU{2}_L depend on the value of the heavy quark masses. For the coupling
constants which occur at order p^2 and p^4 in the chiral expansion, we worked
out the dependence on the strange quark mass at two--loop accuracy, and
provided analogous relations for some of the couplings c_i which are relevant
at order p^6. This talk comments on the methods used, and illustrates
implications of the results obtained.
