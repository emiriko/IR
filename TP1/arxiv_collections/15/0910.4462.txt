An upgraded (second) version of the package GENXICC ({\bf A Generator for
Hadronic Production of the Double Heavy Baryons $\Xi_{cc}$, $\Xi_{bc}$ and
$\Xi_{bb}$ by C.H. Chang, J.X. Wang and X.G. Wu,} [its first version: in
Comput. Phys. Commun. {\bf 177} (2007) 467-478]) is presented. Users, with this
version being implemented in PYTHIA and a GNU C compiler, may simulate full
events of the production in various experimental environments conveniently. In
comparison with the previous version, in order to implement it in PYTHIA
properly, a subprogram for the fragmentation of the produced double heavy
diquark to the relevant baryon is complemented and the interphase of the
generator to PYTHIA is changed accordingly. In the subprogram, with
explanation, certain necessary assumptions (approximations) are made so as to
conserve the momenta and the QCD `color' flow for the fragmentation.
