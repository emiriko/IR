In his recent investigation of a super Teichm\"uller space, Sachse (2007),
based on work of Molotkov (1984), has proposed a theory of Banach
supermanifolds using the `functor of points' approach of Bernstein and Schwarz.
We prove that the the category of Berezin-Kostant-Leites supermanifolds is
equivalent to the category of finite-dimensional Molotkov-Sachse
supermanifolds. Simultaneously, using the differential calculus of
Bertram-Gl\"ockner-Neeb (2004), we extend Molotkov-Sachse's approach to
supermanifolds modeled on Hausdorff topological super-vector spaces over an
arbitrary non-discrete Hausdorff topological base field of characteristic zero.
We also extend to locally k-omega base fields the `DeWitt' supermanifolds
considered by Tuynman in his monograph (2004), and prove that this leads to a
category which is isomorphic to the full subcategory of Molokov-Sachse
supermanifolds modeled on locally k-omega spaces.
