We consider singly-quantized vortex states in a condensate of 52Cr atoms in a
pancake trap. We obtain the vortex solutions by numerically solving the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the rotating frame with no further approximations.
The behavior of the condensate is studied under three different situations
concerning the interactions: only s-wave, s-wave plus dipolar and only dipolar.
The energy barrier for the nucleation of a vortex is calculated as a function
of the vortex displacement from the rotation axis in the three cases. These
results are compared to those obtained for contact interaction condensates in
the Thomas-Fermi approximation, and to a pseudo-analytical model, showing this
latter a very good agreement with the numerical calculation.
