The cross section for the pd --> ^3He eta pi0 reaction has been measured at a
beam energy of 1450 MeV using the WASA detector at the CELSIUS storage ring and
detecting one ^3He and four photons from the decays of the two photons. The
data indicate that the production mechanism involves the formation of the
Delta(1232) isobar. Although the beam energy does not allow the full peak of
this resonance to be seen, the invariant masses of all three pairs of final
state particles are well reproduced by a phase space Monte Carlo simulation
weighted with the p-wave factor of the square of the pi^0 momentum in the
^3Hepi^0 system.
