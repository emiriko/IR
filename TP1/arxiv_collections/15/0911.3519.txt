We present a dilatonic description of the holographic dark energy by
connecting the holographic dark energy density with the dilaton scalar field
energy density in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. We show that this
model can describe the observed accelerated expansion of our universe with the
choice $c\geq1$ and reconstruct the kinetic term as well as the dynamics of the
dilaton scalar field.
