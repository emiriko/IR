We argue that features of hadron production in relativistic nuclear
collisions, mainly at CERN-SPS energies, may be explained by the existence of
three forms of matter: Hadronic Matter, Quarkyonic Matter, and a Quark-Gluon
Plasma. We suggest that these meet at a triple point in the QCD phase diagram.
Some of the features explained, both qualitatively and semi-quantitatively,
include the curve for the decoupling of chemical equilibrium, along with the
non-monotonic behavior of strange particle multiplicity ratios at center of
mass energies near 10 GeV. If the transition(s) between the three phases are
merely crossover(s), the triple point is only approximate.
