We present fully self consistent 3D simulations of compressible Hall MHD
plasma that describe spectral features relevant to the solar wind plasma. We
find that a $k^{-7/3}$ spectrum sets in for the fluctuations that are smaller
than ion gyro radius. We further investigate scale dependent anisotropy led by
nonlinear processes relevant to the solar wind plasma. Our work is important
particularly in understanding the role of wave and nonlinear cascades in the
evolution of the solar wind, structure formation at the largest scales.
