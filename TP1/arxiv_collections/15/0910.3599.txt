We report density functional studies of the Fe$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$Se alloy done
using supercell and coherent potential approximation methods. Magnetic behavior
was investigated using the disordered local moment approach. We find that Cu
occurs in a nominal $d^{10}$ configuration and is highly disruptive to the
electronic structure of the Fe sheets. This would be consistent with a metal
insulator transition due to Anderson localization. We further find a strong
cross over from a weak moment itinerant system to a local moment magnet at $x
\approx 0.12$. We associate this with the experimentally observed jump near
this concentration. Our results are consistent with the characterization of
this concentration dependent jump as a transition to a spin-glass.
