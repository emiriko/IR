In this work, we present a systematic derivation of the distribution of
eigenfrequencies for oscillations of the ground state of a repulsive
Bose-Einstein condensate in the semi-classical (Thomas-Fermi) limit. Our
calculations are performed in 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional settings. Connections
with the earlier work of Stringari, with numerical computations, and with
theoretical expectations for invariant frequencies based on symmetry principles
are also given.
