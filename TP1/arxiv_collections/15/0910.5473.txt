We study the frictional drag force in low-dimensional systems (2D-electron
and 2D-liquid systems) mediated by a fluctuating electromagnetic field which
originate from Brownian motion of ions in liquid. The analysis is focused on
the [2D-system-2D-system], [2D-system-semi-infinite liquid], and
[2D-system-infinite liquid] configurations. We show that for 2D-electron
systems the friction drag depends linearly on the relative velocity of the free
carries of charge in the different media, but for 2D-liquid systems the
frictional drag depends nonlinear on the relative velocity. For 2D-systems the
frictional drag force induced by liquid flow may be several orders of magnitude
larger than the frictional drag induced by an electronic current.
