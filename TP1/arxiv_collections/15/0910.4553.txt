Sample-to-sample free energy fluctuations in spin-glasses display a markedly
different behaviour in finite-dimensional and fully-connected models, namely
Gaussian vs. non-Gaussian. Spin-glass models defined on various types of random
graphs are in an intermediate situation between these two classes of models and
we investigate whether the nature of their free-energy fluctuations is Gaussian
or not. It has been argued that Gaussian behaviour is present whenever the
interactions are locally non-homogeneous, i.e. in most cases with the notable
exception of models with fixed connectivity and random couplings $J_{ij}=\pm
\tilde{J}$. We confirm these expectation by means of various analytical
results. In particular we unveil the connection between the spatial
fluctuations of the populations of populations of fields defined at different
sites of the lattice and the Gaussian nature of the free-energy fluctuations.
On the contrary on locally homogeneous lattices the populations do not
fluctuate over the sites and as a consequence the small-deviations of the free
energy are non-Gaussian and scales as in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model.
