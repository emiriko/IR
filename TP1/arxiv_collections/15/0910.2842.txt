The motion of a body endowed with dipolar as well as quadrupolar structure is
investigated in the Kerr background according to the Dixon's model, extending a
previous analysis done in the Schwarzschild background. The full set of
evolution equations is solved under the simplifying assumptions of constant
frame components for both the spin and the quadrupole tensors and that the
center of mass moves along an equatorial circular orbit, the total
four-momentum of the body being aligned with it. We find that the motion
deviates from the geodesic one due to the internal structure of the body,
leading to measurable effects. Corrections to the geodesic value of the orbital
period of a close binary system orbiting the Galactic Center are discussed
assuming that the Galactic Center is a Kerr supermassive black hole.
