The nuclear-mass dependence of azimuthal cross section asymmetries with
respect to charge and longitudinal polarization of the lepton beam is
studiedfor hard exclusive electroproduction of real photons. The observed
beam-charge and beam-helicity asymmetries are attributed to the interference
between the Bethe-Heitler and deeply virtual Compton scattering processes. For
various nuclei, the asymmetries are extracted for both coherent and
incoherent-enriched regions, which involve different (combinations of)
generalized parton distributions. For both regions, the asymmetries are
compared to those for a free proton, and no nuclear-mass dependence is found.
