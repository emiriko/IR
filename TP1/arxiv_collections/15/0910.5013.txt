A dedicated effort by both the experimental and theoretical communities is
crucial for achieving a precise determination of Standard Model parameters such
as the $W$ mass ($M_W$). $M_W$ is measured directly at the CERN LEP2 $e^+ e^-$
and the Fermilab Tevatron $p \bar p$ colliders, resulting in a precision of
$\delta M_W/M_W=0.03%$. A complementary $M_W$ measurement is provided by the
NuTeV collaboration, who extract $\sin^2 \theta_W$, and thus $M_W$, from the
ratio of deep-inelastic neutral and charged-current
neutrino(anti-neutrino)-Nucleon ($\nu N(\bar \nu N)$) scattering cross
sections. However, their result differs from direct measurements performed at
LEP2 and the Tevatron by about three standard deviations. Possible sources for
the origin of this discrepancy have been extensively studied in the literature,
among them the impact of electroweak radiative corrections. Here we provide
first (preliminary) results of a new calculation of electroweak ${\cal
O}(\alpha)$ corrections with emphasis on the effects of non-zero muon and charm
quark masses. We find non-negligible shifts in $\sin^2\theta_W$ due to these
mass effects but more detailed studies including detector resolution effects
are needed to determine their impact on $M_W$ as extracted by the NuTeV
collaboration.
