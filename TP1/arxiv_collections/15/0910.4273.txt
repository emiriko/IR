Soft and hard spectral states of X-ray transient sources reflect two modes of
accretion, accretion via a geometrically thin, optically thick disk or an
advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). The luminosity at transition between
these two states seems to vary from source to source, or even for the same
source during different outbursts, as observed for GX 339-4. We investigate how
the existence of an inner weak disk in the hard state affects the transition
luminosity. We evaluate the structure of the corona above an outer truncated
disk and the resulting disk evaporation rate for different irradiation. In some
cases, recent observations of X-ray transients indicate the presence of an
inner cool disk during the hard state. Such a disk can remain during quiescence
after the last outburst as long as the luminosity does not drop to very low
values (10^-4 to 10^-3 of the Eddington luminosity). Consequently, as part of
the matter accretes via the inner disk, the hard irradiation is reduced. The
hard irradiation is further reduced, occulted and partly reflected by the inner
disk. This leads to a hard-soft transition at a lower luminosity if an inner
disk exists below the ADAF. This seems to be supported by observations for GX
339-4.
