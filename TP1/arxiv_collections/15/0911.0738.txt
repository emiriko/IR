We present prospects of two experiments using the Tokyo Axion Helioscope. One
is a search for solar axions. In the past measurements, axion mass from 0 to
0.27 eV and from 0.84 to 1.00 eV have been scanned and no positive evidence was
seen. We are now actively preparing a new phase of the experiment aiming at
axion mass over 1 eV. The other is a search for hidden sector photons from the
Sun. We have been designing and testing some additional equipments, which have
to be installed on the helioscope to search for hidden photons with mass of
over $10^{-3}$ eV.
