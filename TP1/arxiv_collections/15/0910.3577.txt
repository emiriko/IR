We have calculated the Raman B$_{1g}$ and B$_{2g}$ spectra as a function of
temperature, as well as doping, for the underdoped cuprates, using a model
based on the resonating valence-bond spin-liquid. We discuss changes in
intensity and peak position brought about by the presence of a pseudogap and
the implied Fermi surface reconstruction, which are elements of this model.
Signatures of Fermi surface reconstruction are evident as a sharp rise in the
doping dependence of the antinodal to nodal peak ratio which occurs below the
quantum critical point. The temperature dependence of the B$_{1g}$ polarization
can be used to determine if the superconducting gap is limited to the Fermi
pocket, as seen in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy, or extends
beyond. We find that the slope of the linear low energy B$_{2g}$ spectrum
maintains its usual d-wave form, but with an effective gap which reflects the
gap amplitude projected on the Fermi pocket. Our calculations capture the main
qualitative features revealed in the extensive data set available on the
HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ (Hg-1201) cuprate.
