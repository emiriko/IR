A new phase of dense QCD proposed in the limit of large number of colors,
Quarkyonic Phase, is discussed in chiral approaches. The interplay between
chiral symmetry breaking and confinement together with the $N_c$ dependence of
the phase diagram are dealt with in the PNJL model. We also discuss a possible
phase at finite density where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken while its
center remains unbroken. The quark number susceptibility exhibits a strong
enhancement at the restoration point of the center symmetry rather than that of
the chiral symmetry. This is reminiscent of the quarkyonic transition.
