The classical internal structure of spinning black holes is vastly different
from that of static black holes. We consider spinning BTZ black holes, and
probe their interior from the gauge theory. Utilizing the simplicity of the
geometry and reverse engineering from the geodesics, we propose a thermal
correlator construction which can be interpreted as arising from two entangled
CFTs. By analytic continuation of these correlators, we can probe the Cauchy
horizon. Correlators that capture the Cauchy horizon in our work have a
structure closely related to those that capture the singularity in a
non-rotating BTZ. As expected, the regions beyond the Cauchy horizon are not
probed in this picture, protecting cosmic censorship.
