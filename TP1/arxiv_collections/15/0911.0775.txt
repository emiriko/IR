Gamma Doradus are F-type stars pulsating with high order g-modes. Their
instability strip (IS) overlaps the red edge of the delta Scuti one. This
observation has led to search for objects in this region of the HR diagram
showing p and g-modes simultaneously. The existence of such hybrid pulsators
has recently been confirmed (Handler 2009) and the number of candidates is
increasing (Matthews 2007). From a theoretical point of view, non-adiabatic
computations including a time-dependent treatment of convection (TDC) predict
the existence of gamma Dor/delta Sct hybrid pulsators (Dupret et al. 2004;
Grigahcene et al. 2006). Our aim is to confront the properties of the observed
hybrid candidates with the theoretical predictions from non-adiabatic
computations of non-radial pulsations including the convection-pulsation
interaction.
