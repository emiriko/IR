Many questions are still open regarding the structure and the dynamics of the
solar core. By constraining more this region in the solar evolution models, we
can reduce the incertitudes on some physical processes and on momentum
transport mechanisms. A first big step was made with the detection of the
signature of the dipole-gravity modes in the Sun, giving a hint of a faster
rotation rate inside the core. A deeper analysis of the GOLF/SoHO data unveils
the presence of a pattern of peaks that could be interpreted as dipole gravity
modes. In that case, those modes can be characterized, thus bringing better
constraints on the rotation of the core as well as some structural parameters
such as the density at these very deep layers of the Sun interior.
