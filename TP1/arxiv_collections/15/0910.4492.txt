We study the masses of the Higgs bosons in the most general two-Higgs-doublet
model in a basis-independent approach. We adapt the recently developed
Minkowski-space formalism to this problem and calculate traces of any power of
the mass-matrix in a compact and reparametrization-invariant form. Our results
can be used to gain insight into the dynamics of the scalar sector of the
general 2HDM.
