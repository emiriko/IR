We have designed three ASICs for possible applications in the optical links
of a new layer of pixel detector in the ATLAS experiment for the first phase of
the LHC luminosity upgrade. The ASICs include a high-speed driver for the
VCSEL, a receiver/decoder to decode the signal received at the PIN diode to
extract the data and clock, and a clock multiplier to produce a higher
frequency clock to serialize the data for transmission. These ASICs were
designed using a 130 nm CMOS process to enhance the radiation-hardness. We have
characterized the fabricated ASICs and the submission has been mostly
successful. We irradiated the ASICs with 24 GeV/c protons at CERN to a dosage
of 70 Mrad. We observed no significant degradation except the driver circuit in
the VCSEL driver fabricated using the thick oxide process in order to provide
sufficient voltage to drive a VCSEL. The degradation is due to a large
threshold shifts in the PMOS transistors used.
