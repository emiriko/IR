We consider the technique introduced in a recent work by Ashtekar, Campiglia
and Henderson, which generate a spinfoam-like sum from a Hamiltonian theory. We
study the possibility of using it for finding the generalized projector of a
constraint on physical states, without first deparametrising the system. We
illustrate this technique in the context of a very simple example. We discuss
the infinities that appear in the calculation, and argue that they can be
appropriately controlled. We apply these ideas to write a spinfoam expansion
for the "dipole cosmology".
