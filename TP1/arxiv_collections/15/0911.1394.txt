The gravity-driven flow along an annular topological defect (string) with
transversely corrugations is investigated by using the verified transition-rate
model and boundary perturbation method. We found that for certain activation
volume and energy there exists possible frictionless states which might be
associated with the missing momentum of inertia or dark matter.
