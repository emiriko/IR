Two methods of prediction of the Pole coordinates and TAI-UTC were tested --
extrapolation of the deterministic components and ARIMA. It was found that each
of these methods is most effective for certain length of prognosis. For
short-time prediction ARIMA algorithm yields more accurate prognosis, and for
long-time one extrapolation is preferable. So, the combined algorithm is being
used in practice of IAA EOP Service. The accuracy of prognosis is close to
accuracy of IERS algorithms. For prediction of nutation the program KSV-1996-1
by T. Herring is being used.
