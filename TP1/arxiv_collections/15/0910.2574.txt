General Relativity offers the possibility to model attributes of matter, like
mass, momentum, angular momentum, spin, chirality etc. from pure space, endowed
only with a single field that represents its Riemannian geometry. I review this
picture of `Geometrodynamics' and comment on various developments after
Einstein.
