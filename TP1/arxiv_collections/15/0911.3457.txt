The non-equilibrium dynamics of spin impurity atoms in a strongly interacting
one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas under the gravity field is studied. We show that
due to the non-equilibrium preparation of the initial state as well as the
interaction between the impurity atoms and other bosons, a counterintuitive
phenomenon may emerge: the impurity atoms could propagate upwards automatically
in the gravity field . The effects of the strength of interaction, the gradient
of the gravity field, as well as the different configurations of the initial
state are investigated by studying the time-dependent evolution of the 1D
strongly interacting bosonic system using time-evolving block decimation (TEBD)
method. A profound connection between this counterintuitive phenomenon and the
repulsive bound pair is also revealed.
