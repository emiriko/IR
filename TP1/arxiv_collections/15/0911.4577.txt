We have proposed a new minimal extension of the Standard Model with a heavy
Majorana fermion triplet($\Sigma$) and an extra scalar doublet($\eta$) so that
the seesaw mechanism is radiative and can be accessible at upcoming
accelerators. The origin of neutrino mass via the famous seesaw mechanism
through the heavy Majorana fermion triplet has been discussed. We have proposed
a mechanism of leptogenesis by the decay of the lightest neutral component of
the fermion triplet into a Standard Model lepton doublet and an extra Higgs
doublet. The important thing is that the leptogenesis scenario discussed in
this letter can be of TeV scale and hence can be testable at Large Hadron
Collider(LHC). We have also discussed a possible dark matter scenario in our
model and the possible phenomenology of the fermion field $\Sigma$.
