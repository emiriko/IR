We reveal a novel source of giant Nernst response exhibiting strong
non-linear temperature and magnetic field dependence including the mysterious
tilted-hill temperature profile observed in a pleiad of materials. The
phenomenon results directly from the formation of a chiral ground state, e.g. a
chiral d-density wave, which is compatible with the eventual observation of
diamagnetism and is distinctly different from the usual quasiparticle and
vortex Nernst mechanisms. Our picture provides a unified understanding of the
anomalous thermoelectricity observed in materials as diverse as hole doped
cuprates and heavy-fermion compounds like URu2Si2.
