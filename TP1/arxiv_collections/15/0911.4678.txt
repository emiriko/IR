The Josephson effect is a manifestation of the macroscopic phase coherence of
superconductors and superfluids. We propose that with ultracold Fermi gases one
can realise a spin-asymmetric Josephson effect in which the two spin components
of a Cooper pair are driven asymmetrically - corresponding to driving a
Josephson junction of two superconductors with different voltages V_\uparrow
and V_\downarrow for spin up and down electrons, respectively. We predict that
the spin up and down components oscillate at the same frequency but with
different amplitudes. Our results reveal that the standard description of the
Josephson effect in terms of bosonic pair tunnelling is insufficient. We
provide an intuitive interpretation of the Josephson effect as interference in
Rabi oscillations of pairs and single particles, the latter causing the
asymmetry.
