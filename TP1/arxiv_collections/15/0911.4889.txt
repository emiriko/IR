The CMS High-Level Trigger (HLT) is responsible for ensuring that data
samples with potentially interesting events are recorded with high efficiency
and good quality. This paper gives an overview of the HLT and focuses on its
commissioning using cosmic rays. The selection of triggers that were deployed
is presented and the online grouping of triggered events into streams and
primary datasets is discussed. Tools for online and offline data quality
monitoring for the HLT are described, and the operational performance of the
muon HLT algorithms is reviewed. The average time taken for the HLT selection
and its dependence on detector and operating conditions are presented. The HLT
performed reliably and helped provide a large dataset. This dataset has proven
to be invaluable for understanding the performance of the trigger and the CMS
experiment as a whole.
