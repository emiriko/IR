Recent testing and validation have found that the GOES microburst products
are effective in the assessment and short-term forecasting of downburst
potential and associated wind gust magnitude. Two products, the GOES sounder
Microburst Windspeed Potential Index and the multispectral GOES imager product
have demonstrated capability in downburst potential assessment. Each microburst
product consists of a set of predictor variables that generates output of
expected microburst risk. This paper compares and contrasts the sounder and
imager microburst products and outlines the advantages of each product in the
nowcasting process. An updated assessment of the sounder MWPI and imager
microburst products, case studies demonstrating effective operational use of
the microburst products, and validation results for the 2009 convective season
over United States Great Plains is presented.
