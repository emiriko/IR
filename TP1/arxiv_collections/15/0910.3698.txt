It has been suggested that dark matter particles which scatter inelastically
from detector target nuclei could explain the apparent incompatibility of the
DAMA modulation signal (interpreted as evidence for particle dark matter) with
the null results from CDMS-II and XENON10. Among the predictions of
inelastically interacting dark matter are a suppression of low-energy events,
and a population of nuclear recoil events at higher nuclear recoil equivalent
energies. This is in stark contrast to the well-known expectation of a falling
exponential spectrum for the case of elastic interactions. We present a new
analysis of XENON10 dark matter search data extending to E$_{nr}=75$ keV
nuclear recoil equivalent energy. Our results exclude a significant region of
previously allowed parameter space in the model of inelastically interacting
dark matter. In particular, it is found that dark matter particle masses
$m_{\chi}\gtrsim150$ GeV are disfavored.
