In this article we consider the cycle structure of compositions of pairs of
involutions in the symmetric group S_n chosen uniformly at random. These can be
modeled as modified 2-regular graphs, giving rise to exponential generating
functions. A composition of two random involutions in S_n typically has about
n^(1/2) cycles, and the cycles are characteristically of length n^(1/2).
Compositions of two random fixed-point-free involutions, on the other hand,
typically have about log n cycles and are closely related to permutations with
all cycle lengths even. The number of factorizations of a random permutation
into two involutions appears to be asymptotically lognormally distributed,
which we prove for a closely related probabilistic model. This study is
motivated by the observation that the number of involutions in [n] is
(n!)^(1/2) times a subexponential factor; more generally the number of
permutations with all cycle lengths in a finite set S is n!^(1-1/m) times a
subexponential factor, and the typical number of k-cycles is nearly n^(k/m)/k.
Connections to pattern avoidance in involutions are also considered.
