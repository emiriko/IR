We present a comparative analysis of a set of GaAs-based THz quantum cascade
lasers, based on longitudinal-optical phonon scattering depopulation, by using
an ensemble Monte Carlo simulation, including both carrier-carrier and
carrier-phonon scattering. The simulation shows that the parasitic injection
into the states below the upper laser level limits the injection efficiency and
thus the device performance at the lasing threshold. Additional detrimental
effects playing an important role are identified. The simulation results are in
reasonable agreement with the experimental findings.
