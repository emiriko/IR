We analyze the structure of the algebra N of symmetric polynomials in
non-commuting variables in so far as it relates to its commutative counterpart.
Using the "place-action" of the symmetric group, we are able to realize the
latter as the invariant polynomials inside the former. We discover a tensor
product decomposition of N analogous to the classical theorems of Chevalley,
Shephard-Todd on finite reflection groups.
