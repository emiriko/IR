The strong decays of the $N^{*}(1535)$ resonance are investigated in an
extended chiral quark model by including the low-lying $qqqq\bar{q}$ components
in addition to the $qqq$ component. The results show that these five-quark
components in $N^{*}(1535)$ contribute significantly to the $N^{*}(1535)\to
N\pi$ and $N^{*}(1535)\to N\eta$ decays. The contributions to the $N\eta$ decay
come from both the lowest energy and the next-to-lowest energy five-quarks
components, while the contributions to the $N\pi$ decay come from only the
latter one. Taking these contributions into account, the description for the
strong decays of $N^{*}(1535)$ is improved, especially, for the puzzling large
ratio of the decays to $N\eta$ and $N\pi$.
