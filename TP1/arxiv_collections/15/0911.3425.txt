In this introduction the editors showcase the papers by way of a structured
project and seek to clarify the two key concepts cited in the title. We
consider the history of the idea that knowledge is an economic factor, and
discuss the question of whether regions provide the relevant system of
reference for knowledge-based economic development. Current transformations in
university-industry-government relations at various levels can be considered as
a metamorphosis in industry organization. The concept of constructed advantage
will be elaborated. The various papers arising from a conference on this
subject hosted by Memorial University, Newfoundland, Canada are approached from
this perspective.
