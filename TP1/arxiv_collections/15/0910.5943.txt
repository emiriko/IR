We study the possibility of performing quantum state tomography via
equidistant states. This class of states allows us to propose a non-symmetric
informationally complete POVM based tomographic scheme. The scheme is defined
for odd dimensions and involves an inversion which can be analytically carried
out by Fourier transform.
