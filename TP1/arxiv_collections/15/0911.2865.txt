This paper reviews the overview of the dynamic shortest path routing problem
and the various neural networks to solve it. Different shortest path
optimization problems can be solved by using various neural networks
algorithms. The routing in packet switched multi-hop networks can be described
as a classical combinatorial optimization problem i.e. a shortest path routing
problem in graphs. The survey shows that the neural networks are the best
candidates for the optimization of dynamic shortest path routing problems due
to their fastness in computation comparing to other softcomputing and
metaheuristics algorithms
