Previously, we have derived a generalization of the canonical fluctuation
relation between heat capacity and energy fluctuations $C=\beta^{2}<\delta
U^{2}>$, which is able to describe the existence of macrostates with negative
heat capacities $C<0$. In this work, we extend our previous results for an
equilibrium situation with several control parameters to account for the
existence of states with anomalous values in other response functions. Our
analysis leads to the derivation of three different equilibrium fluctuation
theorems: the \textit{fundamental and the complementary fluctuation theorems},
which represent the generalization of two fluctuation identities already
obtained in previous works, and the \textit{associated fluctuation theorem}, a
result that has no counterpart in the framework of Boltzmann-Gibbs
distributions. These results are applied to study the anomalous susceptibility
of a ferromagnetic system, in particular, the case of 2D Ising model.
