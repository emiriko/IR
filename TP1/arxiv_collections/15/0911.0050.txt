We present a method to analyse the scientific contributions between research
groups. Given multiple research groups, we construct their journal/proceeding
graphs and then compute the similarity/gap between them using network analysis.
This analysis can be used for measuring similarity/gap of the topics/qualities
between research groups' scientific contributions. We demonstrate the
practicality of our method by comparing the scientific contributions by Korean
researchers with those by the global researchers for information security in
2006 - 2008. The empirical analysis shows that the current security research in
South Korea has been isolated from the global research trend.
