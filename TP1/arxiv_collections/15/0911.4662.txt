We present next-to-next-to-leading order corrections to the inclusive
production of the Higgs bosons at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
including finite top quark mass effects. Expanding our analytic results for the
partonic cross section around the soft limit we find agreement with a very
recent publication by Harlander and Ozeren \cite{Harlander:2009mq}.
