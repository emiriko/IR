In this work, we investigate the discovery potential for Y(3940) by the
photoproduction process $\gamma p\to Y(3940)p$. The numerical result shows that
the upper (lower) limit of the total cross section for $\gamma p\to Y(3940)p$
is up to the order of 1 $nb$ (0.1 $\mu b$). Additionally, the background
analysis and the Dalitz plot relevant to the production of Y(3940) are studied.
The Dalitz plot analysis of Y(3940) production indicates that Y(3940) signal
can be distinguished from the background clearly. The lower limit of the number
of events of Y(3940) reaches up to 10/0.02GeV$^2$ for one billion collisions of
$\gamma p$ by studying the invariant mass spectrum of $J/\psi\omega$.
Experimental search for Y(3940) by the meson photoproduction is suggested.
