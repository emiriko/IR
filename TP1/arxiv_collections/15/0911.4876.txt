Neutrino oscillations from a wide band beam of 1-6 GeV at CERN to LENA, a 50
kton liquid scintillator, at Pyhasalmi mine 2288 km apart are simulated. The
performance is very promising and this can be considered as a realistic
alternative for the next long baseline experiment. Different performance
factors and baselines are compared and the studied setup is found to be
sufficiently close to a realistic optimum.
