We report on the charge carrier dynamics in single lateral quantum dot
molecules and the effect of an applied electric field on the molecular states.
Controllable electron tunneling manifests itself in a deviation from the
typical excitonic decay behavior which is strongly influenced by the tuning
electric field and inter-molecular Coulomb energies. A rate equation model is
developed to gain more insight into the charge transfer and tunneling
mechanisms. Non-resonant (phonon-mediated) electron tunneling which changes the
molecular exciton character from direct to indirect, and vice versa, is found
to be the dominant tunable decay mechanism of excitons besides radiative
recombination.
