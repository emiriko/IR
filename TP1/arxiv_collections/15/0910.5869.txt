We describe nonlinear quantum atom-light interfaces and nonlinear quantum
metrology in the collective continuous variable formalism. We develop a
nonlinear effective Hamiltonian in terms of spin and polarization collective
variables and show that model Hamiltonians of interest for nonlinear quantum
metrology can be produced in $^{87}$Rb ensembles. With these Hamiltonians,
metrologically relevant atomic properties, e.g. the collective spin, can be
measured better than the "Heisenberg limit" $\propto 1/N$. In contrast to other
proposed nonlinear metrology systems, the atom-light interface allows both
linear and non-linear estimation of the same atomic quantities.
