Since 2003 several states in the charmonium mass region were discovered.
While in the conventional c c-bar spectrum some states are missing, the number
of states observed up to now is larger than empty spaces in the c c-bar
spectrum. This, together with other difficulties to explain observed states as
a c c-bar mesons triggered discussions on a possible exotic interpretations. In
this proceedings we present current experimental status from B-factories of the
so called X, Y and Z states.
