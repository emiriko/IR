One of the most popular algorithms for clustering in Euclidean space is the
$k$-means algorithm; $k$-means is difficult to analyze mathematically, and few
theoretical guarantees are known about it, particularly when the data is {\em
well-clustered}. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature
by analyzing the behavior of $k$-means on well-clustered data. In particular,
we study the case when each cluster is distributed as a different Gaussian --
or, in other words, when the input comes from a mixture of Gaussians.
  We analyze three aspects of the $k$-means algorithm under this assumption.
First, we show that when the input comes from a mixture of two spherical
Gaussians, a variant of the 2-means algorithm successfully isolates the
subspace containing the means of the mixture components. Second, we show an
exact expression for the convergence of our variant of the 2-means algorithm,
when the input is a very large number of samples from a mixture of spherical
Gaussians. Our analysis does not require any lower bound on the separation
between the mixture components.
  Finally, we study the sample requirement of $k$-means; for a mixture of 2
spherical Gaussians, we show an upper bound on the number of samples required
by a variant of 2-means to get close to the true solution. The sample
requirement grows with increasing dimensionality of the data, and decreasing
separation between the means of the Gaussians. To match our upper bound, we
show an information-theoretic lower bound on any algorithm that learns mixtures
of two spherical Gaussians; our lower bound indicates that in the case when the
overlap between the probability masses of the two distributions is small, the
sample requirement of $k$-means is {\em near-optimal}.
