We provide a brief summary of the observed sum rule anomalies in the
high-T$_c$ cuprate materials. A recent issue has been the impact of a
non-infinite frequency cutoff in the experiment. In the normal state, the
observed anomalously high temperature dependence can be explained as a `cutoff
effect'. The anomalous rise in the optical spectral weight below the
superconducting transition, however, remains as a solid experimental
observation, even with the use of a cutoff frequency.
