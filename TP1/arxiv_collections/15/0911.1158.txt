We present near-IR images, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and
the WFC3/IR camera, of six passive and massive galaxies at redshift 1.3<z<2.4
(SSFR<10^{-2} Gyr^{-1}; stellar mass M~10^{11} M_{sun}), selected from the
Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS). These images, which have a
spatial resolution of ~1.5 kpc, provide the deepest view of the optical
rest-frame morphology of such systems to date. We find that the light profile
of these galaxies is regular and well described by a Sersic model with index
typical of today's spheroids. Their size, however, is generally much smaller
than today's early types of similar stellar mass, with four out of six galaxies
having r_e ~ 1 kpc or less, in quantitative agreement with previous similar
measures made at rest-frame UV wavelengths. The images reach limiting surface
brightness mu~26.5 mag arcsec^{-2} in the F160W bandpass; yet, there is no
evidence of a faint halo in the galaxies of our sample, even in their stacked
image. We also find that these galaxies have very weak "morphological
k-correction" between the rest-frame UV (from the ACS z-band), and the
rest--frame optical (WFC3 H-band): the Sersic index, physical size and overall
morphology are independent or only mildly dependent on the wavelength, within
the errors.
