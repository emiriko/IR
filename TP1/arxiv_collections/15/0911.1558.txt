We define a local Riemannian metric tensor in the manifold of Gaussian
channels and the distance that it induces. We adopt an information-geometric
approach and define a metric derived from the Bures-Fisher metric for quantum
states. The resulting metric inherits several desirable properties from the
Bures-Fisher metric and is operationally motivated from distinguishability
considerations: It serves as an upper bound to the attainable quantum Fisher
information for the channel parameters using Gaussian states, under generic
constraints on the physically available resources. Our approach naturally
includes the use of entangled Gaussian probe states. We prove that the metric
enjoys some desirable properties like stability and covariance. As a byproduct,
we also obtain some general results in Gaussian channel estimation that are the
continuous-variable analogs of previously known results in finite dimensions.
We prove that optimal probe states are always pure and bounded in the number of
ancillary modes, even in the presence of constraints on the reduced state input
in the channel. This has experimental and computational implications: It limits
the complexity of optimal experimental setups for channel estimation and
reduces the computational requirements for the evaluation of the metric:
Indeed, we construct a converging algorithm for its computation. We provide
explicit formulae for computing the multiparametric quantum Fisher information
for dissipative channels probed with arbitrary Gaussian states, and provide the
optimal observables for the estimation of the channel parameters (e.g. bath
couplings, squeezing, and temperature).
