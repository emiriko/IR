We introduce arrangements of rational sections over curves. They generalize
line arrangements on P^2. Each arrangement of d sections defines a single curve
in P^{d-2} through the Kapranov's construction of \bar{M}_{0,d+1}. We show a
one-to-one correspondence between arrangements of d sections and irreducible
curves in M_{0,d+1}, giving also correspondences for two distinguished
subclasses: transversal and simple crossing. Then, we associate to each
arrangement A (and so to each irreducible curve in M_{0,d+1}) several families
of nonsingular projective surfaces X of general type with Chern numbers
asymptotically proportional to various log Chern numbers defined by A. For
example, for extended families over the complex numbers, one has that any such
X is of positive index and \pi_1(X) = \pi_1(\bar{A}), where \bar{A} is the
normalization of A. In this way, any rational curve in M_{0,d+1} produces
simply connected surfaces with 2< c_1^2(X)/c_2(X) <3. Inequalities like these
come from log Chern inequalities, which are in general connected to geometric
height inequalities (see Appendix). Along the way, we show examples of \'etale
simply connected surfaces of general type in any characteristic violating any
sort of Miyaoka-Yau inequality.
