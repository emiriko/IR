This paper first reviews some basic properties of cryptographic hash
function, secret sharing scheme, and Latin square. Then we discuss why Latin
square or its critical set is a good choice for secret representation and its
relationship with secret sharing scheme. Further we enumerate the limitations
of Latin square in a secret sharing scheme. Finally we propose how to apply
cryptographic hash functions, herding attack technique to a Latin square based
secret sharing scheme to overcome these limitations.
