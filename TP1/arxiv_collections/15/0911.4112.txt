The recent theoretical developments in the field of neutrino-nucleus
interactions in the few-GeV region are reviewed based on the presentations made
at the NuInt09 Workshop. The topics of electron scattering and its connections
with neutrino interactions, neutrino induced quasielastic scattering and pion
production (coherent and incoherent) are covered, with special emphasis on the
challenges that arise in the comparison with new experimental data.
