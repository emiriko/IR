We constrain the amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity in the CMB data
taking into account the presence of foreground residuals in the maps. We
generalise the needlet bispectrum estimator marginalizing over the amplitudes
of thermal dust, free-free and synchrotron templates. We apply our procedure to
WMAP 5 year data, finding fNL= 38\pm 47 (1 \sigma), while the analysis without
marginalization provides fNL= 35\pm 42. Splitting the marginalization over each
foreground separately, we found that the estimates of fNL are positively cross
correlated of 17%, 12% with the dust and synchrotron respectively, while a
negative cross correlation of about -10% is found for the free-free component.
