We derive a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii density-functional equation
appropriate to study the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of dimers formed of
singlet spin-half Fermi pairs in the BEC-unitarity crossover while the
dimer-dimer scattering length $a$ changes from 0 to $\infty$. Using an
effective one-dimensional form of this equation, we study the phenomenon of
dynamical self-trapping of a cigar-shaped Fermi super-fluid in the entire
BEC-unitarity crossover in a double-well potential. A simple two-mode model is
constructed to provide analytical insights. We also discuss the consequence of
our study on the self-trapping of an atomic BEC in a double-well potential.
