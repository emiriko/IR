A channel is degradable if there exists a second channel that maps the output
state of the channel to the environment state. These channels satisfy the
property that the output state contains more information about the input than
the environment does. A complementary class of channels is the antidegradable
channels, which admit channels that map the environment state to the output
state of the channel. In this paper we show that the computational problem of
distinguishing two channels remains PSPACE-complete when restricted to these
classes of channels. This is shown using a construction of Cubitt, Ruskai, and
Smith that embeds any channel into a degradable channel, and a related
construction for the case of antidegradable channels.
