We consider continuum minimal ${\cal M}_{3,4} $ with central charge $c=1/2$.
The eigenvalues of the known local involutive charges are known to be related
to spectral zeta functions of suitable one dimensional shroedinger
hamiltonians. We investigate this connection. We Propose analytic formulae for
the eigenvalues of Nonlocal Involutive Charges. We also propose an exact
formula for the eigenvalues of the $\Psi$ function of BLZ at central charge
$c=1/2$ which reduces to the local non local and dual non local involutive
charges for special values on the imaginary axis.
