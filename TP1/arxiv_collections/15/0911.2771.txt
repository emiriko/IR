We analysed the orientation of galaxy groups in the Local Supercluster (LSC).
It is strongly correlated with the distribution of neighbouring groups in the
scale till about 20 Mpc. The group major axis is in alignment with both the
line joining the two brightest galaxies and the direction toward the centre of
the LSC, i.e. Virgo cluster. These correlations suggest that two brightest
galaxies were formed in filaments of matter directed towards the
protosupercluster centre. Afterwards, the hierarchical clustering leads to
aggregation of galaxies around these two galaxies. The groups are formed on the
same or similarly oriented filaments. This picture is in agreement with the
predictions of numerical simulations.
