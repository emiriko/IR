New results on the B[e] star HD87643 are presented here. They were obtained
with a wide range of different instruments, from wide-field imaging with the
WFI camera, high resolution spectroscopy with the FEROS instrument, high
angular resolution imaging with the adaptive optics camera NACO, to the highest
angular resolution available with AMBER on the VLTI. We report the detection of
a companion to HD87643 with AMBER, subsequently confirmed in the NACO data.
Implications of that discovery to some of the previously
difficult-to-understand data-sets are then presented.
