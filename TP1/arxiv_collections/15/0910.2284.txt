The Serpens SMM 1 region was observed in the 6.9 mm continuum with an angular
resolution of about 0.6 arcsec. Two sources were found to have steep positive
spectra suggesting emission from dust. The stronger one, SMM 1a, is the driving
source of the bipolar jet known previously, and the mass of the dense molecular
gas traced by the millimeter continuum is about 8 solar mass. The newly found
source, SMM 1b, positionally coincides with the brightest mid-IR source in this
region, which implies that SMM 1b is yet another young stellar object. SMM 1b
seems to be less deeply embedded than SMM 1a. SMM 1 is probably a protobinary
system with a projected separation of 500 AU.
