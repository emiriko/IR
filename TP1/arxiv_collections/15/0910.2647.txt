A detailed spectroscopic and structural characterization of ultrathin cobalt
oxide films grown by O-assisted molecular beam epitaxy on a-Al2O3(0001) single
crystals is reported. The experimental results show that the cobalt oxide films
become progressively more disordered with increasing thickness, starting from
the early stages of deposition. Low energy electron diffraction patterns
suggest that the unit cell remains similar to that of a-Al2O3(0001) up to a
thickness of 17 A, while at larger thicknesses a pattern identified with that
of Co3O4(111) becomes visible. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals sudden
changes in the shape of the Co 2p lines from 3.4 to 17 A cobalt oxide
thickness, indicating the transition from an interfacial cobalt oxide layer
towards [111]-oriented Co3O4. In particular, the absence of characteristic
satellite peaks in the Co 2p lines indicates the formation of a trivalent,
octahedrally coordinated, interfacial cobalt oxide layer during the early
stages of growth, identified as the Co2O3 corundum phase.
