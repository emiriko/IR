We propose a method for the generation of a large variety of entangled
states, encoded in the polarization degrees of freedom of N photons, within the
same experimental setup. Starting with uncorrelated photons, emitted from N
arbitrary single photon sources, and using linear optical tools only, we
demonstrate the creation of all symmetric states, e.g., GHZ- and W-states, as
well as all symmetric and non-symmetric total angular momentum eigenstates of
the N qubit compound.
