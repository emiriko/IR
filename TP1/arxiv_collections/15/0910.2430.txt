We carried out an unbiased, spectroscopic survey using the low-resolution
module of the infrared spectrograph (IRS) on board Spitzer targeting two 2.6
square arcminute regions in the GOODS-North field. IRS was used in spectral
mapping mode with 5 hours of effective integration time per pixel. One region
was covered between 14 and 21 microns and the other between 20 and 35 microns.
We extracted spectra for 45 sources. About 84% of the sources have reported
detections by GOODS at 24 microns, with a median F_nu(24um) ~ 100 uJy. All but
one source are detected in all four IRAC bands, 3.6 to 8 microns. We use a new
cross-correlation technique to measure redshifts and estimate IRS spectral
types; this was successful for ~60% of the spectra. Fourteen sources show
significant PAH emission, four mostly SiO absorption, eight present mixed
spectral signatures (low PAH and/or SiO) and two show a single line in
emission. For the remaining 17, no spectral features were detected. Redshifts
range from z ~ 0.2 to z ~ 2.2, with a median of 1. IR Luminosities are roughly
estimated from 24 microns flux densities, and have median values of 2.2 x
10^{11} L_{\odot} and 7.5 x 10^{11} L_{\odot} at z ~ 1 and z ~ 2 respectively.
This sample has fewer AGN than previous faint samples observed with IRS, which
we attribute to the fainter luminosities reached here.
