Wang [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 219801 (2009)] makes the following points about
our Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 067801 (2009), arXiv:0805.0679]: (1) He
infers that, "contrary to its title, shear banding emerged from monotonic
curves only if there was a stress gradient", and he points out that
nonquiescent relaxation was found (experimentally) after step strain in
geometries without a stress gradient. (2) He disagrees with the values of the
parameters we used. (3) In some recent experiments the flow was homogeneous
after cessation of step strain, and only subsequently developed nonquiescent
macroscopic motion. We only showed step strains that developed an inhomogeneity
before cessation of flow. In this reply we address these points.
