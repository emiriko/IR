We study the excitation energy for slow changes of the hopping parameter in
the Falicov-Kimball model with nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory. The
excitation energy vanishes algebraically for long ramp times with an exponent
that depends on whether the ramp takes place within the metallic phase, within
the insulating phase, or across the Mott transition line. For ramps within
metallic or insulating phase the exponents are in agreement with a perturbative
analysis for small ramps. The perturbative expression quite generally shows
that the exponent depends explicitly on the spectrum of the system in the
initial state and on the smoothness of the ramp protocol. This explains the
qualitatively different behavior of gapless (e.g., metallic) and gapped (e.g.,
Mott insulating) systems. For gapped systems the asymptotic behavior of the
excitation energy depends only on the ramp protocol and its decay becomes
faster for smoother ramps. For gapless systems and sufficiently smooth ramps
the asymptotics are ramp-independent and depend only on the intrinsic spectrum
of the system. However, the intrinsic behavior is unobservable if the ramp is
not smooth enough. This is relevant for ramps to small interaction in the
fermionic Hubbard model, where the intrinsic cubic fall-off of the excitation
energy cannot be observed for a linear ramp due to its kinks at the beginning
and the end.
