We study the role played by electron-magnon scattering in the anomalous Hall
effect. We find that it has important contributions distinct from other
scattering processes like impurities scattering and phonon scattering. As a
demonstration, we calculate the Hall conductivity for a two dimensional Dirac
model. The result indicates that as system control parameter varies, the
competition between magnon scattering and other types of scattering changes the
Hall conductivity drastically. In particular, the side jump contribution could
acquire a strong temperature dependence.
