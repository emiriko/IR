Physical Research Laboratory's (PRL) Optical Polarimeter has been used on
various telescopes in India since its development in-house in the mid 1980s. To
make the instrument more efficient and effective we have designed the
acquisition and control system and written the software to run on the GNU/Linux
Operating System. CCD cameras have been used, in place of eyepieces, which
allow to observe fainter sources with smaller apertures. The use of smaller
apertures provides dramatic gains in the signal-to-noise ratio. The polarimeter
is now fully automated resulting in increased efficiency. With the advantage of
networking being built-in at the operating system level in GNU/Linux, this
instrument can now be controlled from anywhere on the PRL local area network
which means that the observer can be stationed in Ahmedabad / Thaltej as well
or via ssh anywhere on the internet. The current report provides an overview of
the system as implemented.
