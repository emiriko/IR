We present measurements of differential cross sections in inclusive Z/gamma*
plus jet production in a data sample of 1 fb^{-1} collected with the D0
detector in proton antiproton collisions at sqrt{s} = 1.96 TeV. Measured
variables include the Z/gamma* transverse momentum and rapidity, the leading
jet transverse momentum and rapidity, as well as various angles of the Z+jet
system. We compare the results to different Monte Carlo event generators and
next-to-leading order perturbative QCD predictions, with non-perturbative
corrections applied.
