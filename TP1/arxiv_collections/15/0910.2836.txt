We introduce the concept of solenoid as an abstract laminated space. We do a
thorough study of solenoids, leading to the notion of ergodic and uniquely
ergodic solenoids. We define generalized currents associated with immersions of
oriented solenoids with a transversal measure into smooth manifolds,
generalizing Ruelle-Sullivan currents.
