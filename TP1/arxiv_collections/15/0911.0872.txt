An interesting new high-energy pulsar sub-population is emerging following
early discoveries of gamma-ray millisecond pulsars (MSPs) by the Fermi Large
Area Telescope (LAT). We present results from 3D emission modeling, including
the Special Relativistic effects of aberration and time-of-flight delays and
also rotational sweepback of B-field lines, in the geometric context of polar
cap (PC), outer gap (OG), and two-pole caustic (TPC) pulsar models. In contrast
to the general belief that these very old, rapidly-rotating neutron stars (NSs)
should have largely pair-starved magnetospheres due to the absence of
significant pair production, we find that most of the light curves are best fit
by TPC and OG models, which indicates the presence of narrow accelerating gaps
limited by robust pair production -- even in these pulsars with very low
spin-down luminosities. The gamma-ray pulse shapes and relative phase lags with
respect to the radio pulses point to high-altitude emission being dominant for
all geometries. We also find exclusive differentiation of the current gamma-ray
MSP population into two MSP sub-classes: light curve shapes and lags across
wavebands impose either pair-starved PC (PSPC) or TPC / OG-type geometries. In
the first case, the radio pulse has a small lag with respect to the single
gamma-ray pulse, while the (first) gamma-ray peak usually trails the radio by a
large phase offset in the latter case. Finally, we find that the flux
correction factor as a function of magnetic inclination and observer angles is
typically of order unity for all models. Our calculation of light curves and
flux correction factor for the case of MSPs is therefore complementary to the
"ATLAS paper" of Watters et al. for younger pulsars.
