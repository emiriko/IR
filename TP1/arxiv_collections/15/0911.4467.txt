The local motion of a null curve in Minkowski 3-space induces an evolution
equation for its Lorentz invariant curvature. Special motions are constructed
whose induced evolution equations are the members of the KdV hierarchy. The
null curves which move under the KdV flow without changing shape are proven to
be the trajectories of a certain particle model on null curves described by a
Lagrangian linear in the curvature. In addition, it is shown that the curvature
of a null curve which evolves by similarities can be computed in terms of the
solutions of the second Painlev\'e equation.
