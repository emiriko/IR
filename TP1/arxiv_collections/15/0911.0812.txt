We demonstrate highly efficient generation of coherent 420nm light via
up-conversion of near-infrared lasers in a hot rubidium vapor cell. By
optimizing pump polarizations and frequencies we achieve a single-pass
conversion efficiency of 260% per Watt, significantly higher than in previous
experiments. A full exploration of the coherent light generation and
fluorescence as a function of both pump frequencies reveals that coherent blue
light is generated close to 85Rb two-photon resonances, as predicted by theory,
but at high vapor pressure is suppressed in spectral regions that do not
support phase matching or exhibit single-photon Kerr refraction. Favorable
scaling of our current 1mW blue beam power with additional pump power is
predicted.
