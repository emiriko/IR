We explore aspects of the community structures generated by a simple
predator-prey model of biological coevolution, using large-scale kinetic Monte
Carlo simulations. The model accounts for interspecies and intraspecies
competition for resources, as well as adaptive foraging behavior. It produces a
metastable low-diversity phase and a stable high-diversity phase. The
structures and joint indegree-outdegree distributions of the food webs
generated in the latter phase are discussed.
