We report on the Camera Materials Test Chamber, a multi-vessel apparatus
which analyzes the outgassing consequences of candidate materials for use in
the vacuum cryostat of a new telescope camera. The system measures the
outgassing products and rates of samples of materials at different
temperatures, and collects films of outgassing products to measure the effects
on light transmission in six optical bands. The design of the apparatus
minimizes potential measurement errors introduced by background contamination.
