Although Luhmann formulated with modesty and precaution, for example in Die
Wissenschaft der Gesellschaft (1990a, at pp. 412f.), that his theory claims to
be a universal one because it is self-referential, the "operational closure"
that follows from this assumption easily generates a problem for empirical
research. Can a theory which considers society--and science as one of its
subsystems--operationally closed, nevertheless contribute to the project of
Enlightenment which Popper (1945) so vigorously identified as the driver of an
open society? How can a theory which proclaims itself to be circular and
universal nevertheless claim to celebrate "the triumph of the Enlightenment"
Luhmann, (1990a, at p. 548)? Is the lack of an empirical program of research
building on Luhmann's theory fortuitous or does it indicate that this theory
should be considered as a philosophy rather than a heuristic for the
explanation of operations in social systems?
