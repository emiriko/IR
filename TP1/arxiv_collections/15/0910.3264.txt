The eigenvalue density of a Wilson loop matrix W associated with a simple
loop in two-dimensional Euclidean SU(N) Yang-Mills theory undergoes a phase
transition at a critical size in the infinite-N limit. The averages of
1/det(z-W) and det(1+uW)/(1-vW) at finite N lead to two different smoothed out
expressions. It is shown by a saddle-point analysis that both functions tend to
the known singular result at infinite N.
