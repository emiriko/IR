We develop a theory of indirect measurements where a probe is able to read,
in short interaction times, the quantum state of a remote system through an
incoherent wall. The probe and the system can interact with an ancilla in an
incoherent state but not directly among themselves and, nevertheless, the fast
transfer of quantum information can be achieved with robustness. We exemplify
our measurement scheme with a paradigmatic example of this tripartite problem:
qubit-oscillator-qubit, and discuss different physical scenarios pointing out
the associated advantages and limitations.
