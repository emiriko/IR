The evolutionary stage of the delta Scuti star 44 Tau has been unclear.
Recent asteroseismic studies have claimed models on the main sequence, as well
as in the expansion phase of the post-main sequence evolution. However, these
models could not reproduce all of the observed frequencies, the mode
instability range, and the fundamental stellar parameters simultaneously. A
recent photometric study has increased the number of detected independent modes
in 44 Tau to 15, and a newly found gravity mode at 5.30 c/d extends the
observed frequency range.
  Aims. One of the possible evolutionary stages of 44 Tau has not yet been
considered: the overall contraction phase after the main sequence. We computed
asteroseismic models to examine whether models in this evolutionary stage
provide a better fit of the observed frequency spectrum.
  Methods. We used Dziembowski's pulsation code to compute nonadiabatic
frequencies of radial and nonradial modes. Observation of two radial modes and
an avoided crossing of dipole modes put strong constraints on the models. A
two-parametric overshooting routine is utilized to determine the efficiency of
element mixing in the overshoot layer above the convective core.
  Results. We find that pulsation models in the post-MS contraction phase
successfully reproduce the observed frequency range, as well as the frequency
values of all individual radial and nonradial modes. The theoretical
frequencies of the mixed modes at 7.79 c/d and 9.58 c/d are in better agreement
with the observations if efficient element mixing in a small overshoot layer is
assumed.
