A new model of physics, with a hidden conformal sector which manifests itself
as an unparticle coupling to Standard Model particles effectively through
higher dimensional operators, predicts strong collider signals due to
unparticle self-interactions. We perform a complete analysis of the most
spectacular of these signals at the hadron collider, pp -> 4photon and pp
->2photon,2gluon. These processes can go through the three-point unparticle
self interactions as well as through some s and t channel diagrams with one
and/or two unparticle exchanges. We study the contributions of individual
diagrams classified with respect to the number of unparticle exchanges and
discuss their effect on the cross sections at the Tevatron and the LHC. We also
restrict the Tevatron bound on the unknown coefficient of the three-point
unparticle correlator. With the availability of data from Tevatron, and the
advent of the data emerging from the LHC, these interactions can provide a
clear and strong indication of unparticle physics and distinguish this model
from other beyond the standard model scenarios.
