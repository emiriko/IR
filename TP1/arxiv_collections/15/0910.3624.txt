In the context of a warped extra-dimension with Standard Model fields in the
bulk, we obtain the general flavor structure of the couplings to fermions of
both the Higgs scalar and the radion graviscalar. In the Flavor Anarchy
paradigm, these couplings are generically misaligned with respect to the
fermion mass matrix and moreover the off-diagonal couplings can be estimated
parametrically as a function of fermion masses and the observed mixing angles.
One can then study the flavor constraints and predictions arising from these
couplings.
