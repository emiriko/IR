An impurity solver for the dynamical mean field (DMFT) study of the Mott
insulators is proposed, which is based on the second order perturbation of the
hybridization function. After carefully benchmarking it with Quantum Monte
Carlo results on the anti-ferromagnetic phase of the Hubbard model, we conclude
that this impurity solver can capture the main physical features in the strong
coupling regime and can be a very useful tool for the LDA+DMFT studies of the
Mott insulators with long range order.
