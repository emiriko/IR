$^{75}$As and $^{139}$La field-swept NMR spectra were obtained for the novel
weakly itinerant ferromagnet LaCoAsO with 2D layered structure above the Curie
temperature of 55 K. By analyzing NMR spectra, temperature dependences of
Knight shift $K$ and nuclear quadrupole resonance frequency $\nu_Q$ were
obtained successfully for each nucleus. We confirmed from the so-called
$K$-$\chi$ plots that the macroscopic magnetization of our {LaCoAsO} powder
sample is intrinsic and does not contain the contribution from impurity phases.
We estimated hyperfine coupling constants from the slope of $K$-$\chi$ plots
and compared to that of iron-arsenide superconductor.
