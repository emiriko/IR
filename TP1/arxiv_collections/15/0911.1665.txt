The pressure dependence of a large number of phonon modes in CaFe2As2 with
energies covering the full range of the phonon spectrum has been studied using
inelastic x-ray and neutron scattering. The observed phonon frequency changes
are in general rather small despite the sizable changes of the lattice
parameters at the phase transition. This indicates that the bonding properties
are not profoundly altered by the phase transition. The transverse acoustic
phonons propagating along the c-direction are an exception because they stiffen
very significantly in response to the large contraction of the c-axis. The
lattice parameters are found to change significantly as a function of pressure
before, during and after the first-order phase transition. However, the
frequencies change nearly uniformly with the change in the lattice parameters
due to pressure, with no regard specifically to the first-order phase
transition. Density functional theory describes the frequencies in both the
zero pressure and in the collapsed phase in a satisfactory way if based on the
respective crystal structures.
