We study the nonclassicality of photon-added squeezed vacuum (PASV) and its
decoherence in thermal environment in terms of the sub-Poissonian statistics
and the negativity of Wigner function (WF). By converting the PASV to a
squeezed Hermite polynomial excitation state, we derive a compact expression
for the normalization factor of m-PASV, which is an m-order Legendre polynomial
of squeezing parameter r. We also derive the explicit expression of WF of
m-PASV and find the negative region of WF in phase space. We show that there is
an upper bound value of r for this state to exhibit sub-Poissonian statistics
increasing as m increases. Then we derive the explicit analytical expression of
time evolution of WF of m-PASV in the thermal channel and discuss the loss of
nonclassicality using the negativity of WF. The threshold value of decay time
is presented for the single PASV.
