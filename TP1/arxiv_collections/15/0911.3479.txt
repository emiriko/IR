The evidence of a large CP phase has been shown by CDF and D{\O}
collaborations in the time-dependent CP asymmetry (CPA) of $B_s\to J/\Psi \phi$
decay, where the nonvanished CPA clearly implies the existence of a
non-Kobayashi-Maskawa phase in $b\to s$ transition. We study the new phases
originated by the extra family dependent $U(1)'$ model and examine their impact
on $\hat{T}$ or CP violating observables in $\bar B_q\to V_q \ell^{+} \ell^{-}$
decays with $V_q=K^* (\phi)$. Adopting the constraints from the current data of
$\Delta m_s$ and the branching ratios for $\bar B_s\to \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $\bar
B_q\to V_q\ell^+ \ell^-$, we find that $\phi^{J/\Psi\phi}_s=-(0.26\pm 0.22)$
and the T-odd observables of above 10% in the decay chain $\bar B_q\to V_q(\to
K\pi [KK]) \ell^+ \ell^-$ can be achieved. In addition, we demonstrate that the
longitudinal and transverse polarizations of $K^*$ and the up-down asymmetry of
$K$ in the same decay chain are also sensitive to the $Z'$-mediated effects.
