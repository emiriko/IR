We discuss lepton flavor violation (LFV) in the context of SUSY breaking when
the first-two generation sleptons are heavy. When the first-two generation
sleptons are $\mathcal{O}(5 {\rm TeV})$ and have small mass-splittings, we find
that a light third generation slepton is allowed even with the large mixing
implied by neutrino oscillation experiments. As an application, we consider a
gravity dual to single-sector SUSY breaking and show that it is compatible with
both LFV constraints and oscillation measurements.
