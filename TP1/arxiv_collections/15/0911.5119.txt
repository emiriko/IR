Low-luminosity galaxies are known to outnumber the bright galaxy population
in poor groups and clusters of galaxies. Yet, the investigation of
low-luminosity galaxy populations outside the Local Group remains rare and the
dependence on different group environments is still poorly understood. Previous
investigations revealed photometric scaling relations for early-type dwarfs and
a strong dependence of morphology with environment.
  The present study aims to analyse the photometric and spectroscopic
properties of the low-luminosity galaxy population in the nearby, well-evolved
and early-type dominated NGC 5846 group of galaxies. It is the third most
massive aggregate of early-type galaxies after the Virgo and Fornax clusters in
the local universe. Photometric scaling relations and the distribution of
morphological types as well as the characteristics of emission-line galaxies
are investigated.
  Spectroscopically selected low-luminosity group members from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey with cz<3000 km/s within a radius of 2 deg=0.91 Mpc around
NGC 5846 are analysed. Surface brightness profiles of early-type galaxies are
fit by a Sersic model r^(1/n). Star formation rates, oxygen abundances and
emission characteristics are determined for emission-line galaxies. [abridged]
