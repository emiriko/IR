Radio, infrared, and optical observations of the 2006 eruption of the
symbiotic recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph) showed that the explosion
produced non-spherical ejecta. Some of this ejected material was in the form of
bipolar jets to the east and west of the central source. Here we describe Xray
observations taken with the Chandra X-ray Observatory one and a half years
after the beginning of the outburst that reveal narrow, extended structure with
a position angle of approximately 300 degrees (east of north). Although the
orientation of the extended feature in the X-ray image is consistent with the
readout direction of the CCD detector, extensive testing suggests that the
feature is not an artifact. Assuming it is not an instrumental effect, the
extended X-ray structure shows hot plasma stretching more than 1,900 AU from
the central binary (taking a distance of 1.6 kpc). The X-ray emission is
elongated in the northwest direction - in line with the extended infrared
emission and some minor features in the published radio image. It is less
consistent with the orientation of the radio jets and the main bipolar optical
structure. Most of the photons in the extended X-ray structure have energies of
less than 0.8 keV. If the extended X-ray feature was produced when the nova
explosion occurred, then its 1".2 length as of 2007 August implies that it
expanded at an average rate of more than 2 mas/d, which corresponds to a flow
speed of greater than 6,000 km/s (d/1.6 kpc) in the plane of the sky. This
expansion rate is similar to the earliest measured expansion rates for the
radio jets.
