Neutrino-induced pion production on nuclear targets is the major inelastic
channel in all present-day neutrino-oscillation experiments. It has to be
understood quantitatively in order to be able to reconstruct the
neutrino-energy at experiments such as MiniBooNE or K2K and T2K. We report here
results of cross section calculations for both this channel and for
quasielastic scattering within the semiclassical GiBUU method. This methods
contains scattering, both elastic and inelastic, absorption and side-feeding of
channels all in a unitary, common theoretical framework and code. We find that
charged current quasielastic scattering (CCQE) and $1 \pi$ production are
closely entangled in actual experiments, due to final state interactions of the
scattered nucleons on one hand and of the $\Delta$ resonances and pions, on the
other hand. We discuss the uncertainties in the elementary pion production
cross sections from ANL and BNL. We find the surprising result that the recent
$1 \pi$ production cross section data from MiniBooNE are well described by
calculations without any FSI. For higher energies we study the validity of the
Bloom-Gilman quark-hadron duality for both electron- and neutrino-induced
reactions. While this duality holds quite well for nucleon targets, for nuclear
targets the average resonance contributions to the structure function $F_2$ are
always lower than the DIS values. This result indicates a significant impact of
nuclear effects on observables, reducing the cross section and structure
functions by at least 30-40% and changing the form of various distributions.
