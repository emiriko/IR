In an intense laser field, an electron may decay by emitting a pair of
photons. The two photons emitted during the process, which can be interpreted
as a laser-dressed double Compton scattering, remain entangled in a
quantifiable way: namely, the so-called concurrence of the photon polarizations
gives a gauge-invariant measure of the correlation of the hard gamma rays. We
calculate the differential rate and concurrence for a backscattering setup of
the electron and photon beam, employing Volkov states and propagators for the
electron lines, thus accounting nonperturbatively for the electron-laser
interaction. The nonperturbative results are shown to differ significantly
compared to those obtained from the usual double Compton scattering.
