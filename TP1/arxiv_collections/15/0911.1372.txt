We propose large low-loss cross-phase modulation between two coupled surface
polaritons propagating through a double electromagnetically-induced
transparency medium situated close to a negative-index metamaterial. In
particular a mutual $\pi$ phase shift is attainable between the two pulses at
the single photon level.
