Recently, we have presented some simple arguments supporting the existence of
certain complementarity between thermodynamic quantities of temperature and
energy, an idea suggested by Bohr and Heinsenberg in the early days of Quantum
Mechanics. Such a complementarity is expressed as the impossibility of perform
an exact simultaneous determination of the system energy and temperature by
using an experimental procedure based on the thermal equilibrium with other
system regarded as a measure apparatus (thermometer). In this work, we provide
a simple generalization of this latter approach with the consideration of a
thermodynamic situation with several control parameters.
