In this paper, we study decoherence in continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs)
on one-dimension regular networks. For this purpose, we assume that every node
is represented by a quantum dot continuously monitored by an individual point
contact(Gurvitz's model). This measuring process induces decoherence. We focus
on small rates of decoherence and then obtain the mixing time bound of the
CTQWs on one-dimension regular network which its distance parameter is $l\geq
2$. Our results show that the mixing time is inversely proportional to rate of
decoherence which is in agreement with the mentioned results for cycles in
\cite{FST,VKR}. Also, the same result is provided in \cite{SSRR} for long-range
interacting cycles. Moreover, we find that this quantity is independent of
distance parameter $l(l\geq 2)$ and that the small values of decoherence make
short the mixing time on these networks.
