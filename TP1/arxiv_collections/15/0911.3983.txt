The tip multifractal spectrum of a two-dimensional curve is one way to
describe the behavior of the uniformizing conformal map of the complement near
the tip. We give the tip multifractal spectrum for a Schramm-Loewner evolution
(SLE) curve, we prove that the spectrum is valid with probability one, and we
give applications to the scaling of harmonic measure at the tip.
