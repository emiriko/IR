Dilepton-jet final states are used to study physical phenomena not predicted
by the standard model. The ATLAS discovery potential for leptoquarks and
Majorana Neutrinos is presented using a full simulation of the ATLAS detector
at the Large Hadron Collider. The study is motivated by the role of the
leptoquark in the Grand Unification of fundamental forces and the see-saw
mechanism that could explain the masses of the observed neutrinos. The analysis
algorithms are presented, background sources are discussed and estimates of
sensitivity and the discovery potential for these processes are reported.
