Relatively small amounts (typically between 2-200 parts per million) of
presolar grains have been preserved in the matrices of chondritic meteorites.
The measured abundances of the different types of grains are highly variable
from one chondrite to another, but are higher in unequilibrated chondrites that
have experienced little or no aqueous alteration and/or metamorphic heating
than in processed meteorites. A general overview of the abundances measured in
presolar grains (particularly the recently identified presolar silicates)
contained in primitive chondrites is presented. Here we will focus on the most
primitive chondrite groups, as typically the highest measured abundances of
presolar grains occur in primitive chondrites that have experienced little
thermal metamorphism. Looking at the most aqueously altered chondrite groups,
we find a clear pattern of decreasing abundance of presolar silicate grains
with increasing level of aqueous alteration. We conclude that the measured
abundances of presolar grains in altered chondrites are strongly biased by
their peculiar histories. Scales quantifying the intensity of aqueous
alteration and shock metamorphism in chondrites could correlate with the
content in presolar silicates. To do this it would be required to infer the
degree of destruction or homogenization of presolar grains in the matrices of
primitive meteorites. To get an unbiased picture of the relative abundance of
presolar grains in the different regions of the protoplanetary disk where first
meteorites consolidated, future dedicated studies of primitive meteorites,
IDPs, and collected materials from sample-return missions (like e.g. the
planned Marco Polo) are urgently required.
