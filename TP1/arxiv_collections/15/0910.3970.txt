Many Lattice QCD observables of phenomenological interest include so-called
all-to-all propagators. The computation of these requires prohibitively large
computational resources, unless they are estimated stochastically. This is
usually done. However, the computational demand can often be further reduced by
one order of magnitude by implementing sophisticated unbiased noise reduction
techniques. We combine both well known and novel methods that can be applied to
a wide range of problems. We concentrate on calculating disconnected
contributions to nucleon structure functions, as one realistic benchmark
example. In particular we determine the strangeness contributions to the
nucleon, <N|ss|N>, and to the spin of the nucleon, Delta s.
