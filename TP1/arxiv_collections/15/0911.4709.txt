We study the Lifshitz type extension of the standard model (SM) at UV, with
dynamical critical exponent z=3. One loop radiative corrections to the Higgs
mass in such a model is calculated. Our result shows that, the Hierarchy
problem, which has initiated many excellent extension of the minimal SM, can be
weakened in the z=3 Lifshitz type quantum field theory.
