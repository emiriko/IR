We revisit Fermat's factorization method for a positive integer $n$ that is a
product of two primes $p$ and $q$. Such an integer is used as the modulus for
both encryption and decryption operations of an RSA cryptosystem. The security
of RSA relies on the hardness of factoring this modulus. As a consequence of
our analysis, two variants of Fermat's approach emerge. We also present a
comparison between the two methods' effective regions. Though our study does
not yield a new state-of-the-art algorithm for integer factorization, we
believe that it reveals some interesting observations that are open for further
analysis.
