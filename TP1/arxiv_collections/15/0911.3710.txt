A linear external perturbation is introduced in the action of the partition
function of the random matrix model of RNA [G. Vernizzi, H. Orland and A. Zee,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 168103 (2005)]. It is seen that (i). the perturbation
distinguishes between paired and unpaired bases in that there are structural
changes, from unpaired and paired base structures ($0 \leq \alpha < 1$) to
completely paired base structures ($\alpha=1$), as the perturbation parameter
$\alpha$ approaches 1 ($\alpha$ is the ratio of interaction strengths of
original and perturbed terms in the action of the partition function), (ii).
the genus distributions exhibit small differences for small even and odd
lengths $L$, (iii). the partition function of the linear interacting matrix
model is related via a scaling formula to the re-scaled partition function of
the random matrix model of RNA, (iv). the free energy and specific heat are
plotted as functions of $L$, $\alpha$ and temperature $T$ and their first
derivative with respect to $\alpha$ is plotted as a function of $\alpha$. The
free energy shows a phase transition at $\alpha=1$ for odd (both small and
large) lengths and for even lengths the transition at $\alpha=1$ gets sharper
and sharper as more pseudoknots are included (that is for large lengths).
