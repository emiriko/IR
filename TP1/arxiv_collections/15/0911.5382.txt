Ungravity by tensor unparticles is realized in AdS(4+N) space through
deconstruction. It is shown that ungravity is equivalent to the gravity in
extra dimensions. There is a close relation between the scaling dimension of
the unparticle operator and the number of extra dimensions. Consequently it is
possible to discover the fractional extra dimentions, which would be a
stringent signal for unparticles.
