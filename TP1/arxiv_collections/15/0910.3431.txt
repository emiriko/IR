Due to the large $t\bar{t}$ production cross-section at the LHC energies, the
ATLAS experiment is expected to have enough statistics to measure $t\bar{t}$
cross-section even at initial luminosities. Recent studies performed in ATLAS
on the development of $t\bar{t}$ cross-section measurements in the lepton+jets
channel at $\sqrt{s}$=10 TeV using the likelihood method will be discussed. The
expected statistical and systematic uncertainties for the cross-section
measurement using the likelihood method are evaluated for an integrated
luminosity of 50 pb$^{-1}$ of Monte Carlo (MC) simulated data. Measurements
with data that will be collected in the first year of the LHC operation are
emphasized.
