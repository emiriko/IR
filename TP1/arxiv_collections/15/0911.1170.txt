This paper gives a summary of the author's works concerning the emergent
general relativity in a particular class of tensor models, which possess
Gaussian classical solutions. In general, a classical solution in a tensor
model may be physically regarded as a background space, and small fluctuations
about the solution as emergent fields on the space. The numerical analyses of
the tensor models possessing Gaussian classical background solutions have shown
that the low-lying long-wavelength fluctuations around the backgrounds are in
one-to-one correspondence with the geometric fluctuations on flat spaces in the
general relativity. It has also been shown that part of the orthogonal symmetry
of the tensor model spontaneously broken by the backgrounds can be identified
with the local translation symmetry of the general relativity. Thus the tensor
model provides an interesting model of simultaneous emergence of space, the
general relativity, and its local gauge symmetry of translation.
