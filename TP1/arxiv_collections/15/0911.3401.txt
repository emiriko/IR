Previous solar system constraints of the Brans-Dicke (BD) parameter $\omega$
have either ignored the effects of the scalar field potential (mass terms) or
assumed a highly massive scalar field. Here, we interpolate between the above
two assumptions and derive the solar system constraints on the BD parameter
$\omega$ for {\it any} field mass. We show that for $\omega=O(1)$ the solar
system constraints relax for a field mass $m \gsim 20 \times m_{AU}= 20\times
10^{-27}GeV$.
