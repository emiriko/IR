A new fangled method for ship wake detection in synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) images is explored here. Most of the detection procedure applies the
Radon transform as its properties outfit more than any other transformation for
the detection purpose. But still it holds problems when the transform is
applied to an image with a high level of noise. Here this paper articulates the
combination between the radon transformation and the shrinkage methods which
increase the mode of wake detection process. The latter shrinkage method with
RT maximize the signal to noise ratio hence it leads to most optimal detection
of lines in the SAR images. The originality mainly works on the denoising
segment of the proposed algorithm. Experimental work outs are carried over both
in simulated and real SAR images. The detection process is more adequate with
the proposed method and improves better than the conventional methods.
