We describe a quasi-optical multifrequency ESR spectrometer operating in the
75-225 GHz range and optimized at 210 GHz for general use in condensed matter
physics, chemistry and biology. The quasi-optical bridge detects the change of
mm wave polarization at the ESR. A controllable reference arm maintains a mm
wave bias at the detector. The attained sensitivity of 2x10^10 spin/G/(Hz)1/2,
measured on a dilute Mn:MgO sample in a non-resonant probe head at 222.4 GHz
and 300 K, is comparable to commercial high sensitive X band spectrometers. The
spectrometer has a Fabry-Perot resonator based probe head to measure aqueous
solutions, and a probe head to measure magnetic field angular dependence of
single crystals. The spectrometer is robust and easy to use and may be operated
by undergraduate students. Its performance is demonstrated by examples from
various fields of condensed matter physics.
