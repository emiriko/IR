The deformed z=2 Horava-Lifshitz gravity with coupling constant w leads to a
nonrelativistic "mixmaster" cosmological model. The potential of theory is
given by the sum of IR and UV potentials in the ADM Hamiltonian formalism. It
turns out that adding the UV-potential cannot suppress chaotic behaviors
existing in the IR-potential.
