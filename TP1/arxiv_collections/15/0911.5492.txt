We show that ac magnetoresistance at room temperature in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 is
extremely high (= 47% in H = 100 mT, f = 3-5 MHz), and magnetic field
dependence of reactance exhibits a double peak behavior. However, magnitudes of
the ac magnetoresistance and magnetoreactance for a fixed length of the sample
(li) decrease with decreasing separation (lv) between voltage probes unlike the
dc magnetoresistance. On the contrary, change in li has a negligible influence
on magnetoimpedance when lv is fixed. Our results indicate that high frequency
electrical transport is sensitive to local variations in the magnetic
permeability.
