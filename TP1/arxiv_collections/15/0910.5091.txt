Whether caused by AGN jets, shocks, or mergers, the most definitive evidence
for heating in cluster cores comes from X-ray spectroscopy. Unfortunately such
spectra are essentially limited to studying the emission spectrum from the
cluster as a whole. However since the same underlying emission measure
distribution produces both the observed CCD and RGS spectra, X-ray imaging can
still provide spatial information on the heating process. Using Chandra
archival data for a sample of 9 clusters, we demonstrate how imaging data can
be used to constrain departures from a canonical, isobaric cooling flow model
as a function of position in a given cluster. The results of this analysis are
also shown for the deep archival exposure of the Perseus cluster. Such heating
maps can provide constraints on both the location and magnitude of the heating
in the cores of clusters. When combined with detections and spectral index maps
from low-frequency radio observations, these maps can be used to distinguish
between different models for heating in these objects.
