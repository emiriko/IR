We present the geometry of pure states of an ensemble of N spin-J systems
using a generalisation of the Majorana representation. The approach is based on
Schur-Weyl duality that allows for simple interpretation of the state
transformation under the action of general linear and permutation groups. We
show an exemplary application in theory of decoherence free subspaces and
noiseless subsystems.
