In this letter we study the coherent electronic transport through a metallic
nanowire with magnetic impurities. The spins of these impurities are considered
as frozen to mimic a low temperature spin glass phase. The transport properties
of the wire are derived from a numerical Landauer technique which provides the
conductance of the wire as a function of the disorder configuration. We show
that the correlation of conductance between two spin configurations provides a
measure of the correlation between these spin configurations. This correlation
corresponds to the mean field overlap in the absence of any spatial order
between the spin configurations. Moreover, we find that these conductance
correlations are sensitive to the spatial order between the two spin
configurations, i.e whether the spin ?ips between them occur in a compact
region or not.
