We present a Markov chain (Dikin walk) for sampling from a convex body
equipped with a self-concordant barrier, whose mixing time from a "central
point" is strongly polynomial in the description of the convex set. The mixing
time of this chain is invariant under affine transformations of the convex set,
thus eliminating the need for first placing the body in an isotropic position.
This recovers and extends previous results of from polytopes to more general
convex sets. On every convex set of dimension $n$, there exists a
self-concordant barrier whose "complexity" is polynomially bounded.
Consequently, a rapidly mixing Markov chain of the kind we describe can be
defined on any convex set. We use these results to design an algorithm
consisting of a single random walk for optimizing a linear function on a convex
set. We show that this random walk reaches an approximately optimal point in
polynomial time with high probability and that the corresponding objective
values converge with probability 1 to the optimal objective value as the number
of steps tends to infinity. One technical contribution is a family of lower
bounds for the isoperimetric constants of (weighted) Riemannian manifolds on
which, interior point methods perform a kind of steepest descent. Using results
of Barthe \cite{barthe} and Bobkov and Houdr\'e, on the isoperimetry of
products of (weighted) Riemannian manifolds, we obtain sharper upper bounds on
the mixing time of Dikin walk on products of convex sets than the bounds
obtained from a direct application of the Localization Lemma, on which, since
(Lov\'asz and Simonovits), the analyses of all random walks on convex sets have
relied.
