The study of the inelastic scattering of hadrons has progressed in the last
decade. With the availability of high-statistics data sets from HERA and the
Tevatron, our understanding of high energy and high jet multiplicity events has
become rather precise. In this Proceedings, I present an overview of recent
jet-only results, as well as measurements of events which combine both jets and
a W or Z boson.
