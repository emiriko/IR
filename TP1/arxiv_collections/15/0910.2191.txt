Three particles with large scattering length display a universal spectrum of
three-body bound states called "Efimov trimers''. We calculate the modification
of the Efimov trimers of three identical bosons in a finite cubic box and
compute the dependence of their energies on the box size using effective field
theory. Previous calculations for positive scattering length that were
perturbative in the finite volume energy shift are extended to arbitrarily
large shifts and negative scattering lengths. The renormalization of the
effective field theory in the finite volume is explicitly verified. Moreover,
we investigate the effects of partial wave mixing and study the behavior of
shallow trimers near the dimer energy. Finally, we provide numerical evidence
for universal scaling of the finite volume corrections.
