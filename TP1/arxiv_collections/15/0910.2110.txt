A constrained superfield formalism has been proposed recently to analyze the
low energy physics related to Goldstinos. We prove that this formalism can be
reformulated in the language of standard realization of nonlinear
supersymmetry. New relations have been uncovered in the standard realization of
nonlinear supersymmetry.
