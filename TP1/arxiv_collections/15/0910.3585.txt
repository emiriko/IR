In the first part of the talk we discuss the role of the two-body
nucleon-nucleon correlations on signatures of the heavy-ion collisions which
are a priori expected to be sensitive to these effects. We find that while the
fluctuations of the number of produced particles are indeed affected, other
quantities (v_2 fluctuations, size fluctuations) are insensitive to the
presence of the NN correlations in the nucleon distributions. In the second
part we show that the fluctuations of the transverse size of the initial source
cause, after a suitable hydrodynamic evolution, fluctuations of the transverse
flow velocity at hadronic freeze-out. This in turn yields the event-by-event
fluctuations of the transverse momentum of the produced particles, p_T. Our
results demonstrate that practically all of the observed event-by-event p_T
fluctuations may be explained this way.
