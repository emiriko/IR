We study the effects of intrinsic sequence-dependent curvature for a two
dimensional semiflexible biopolymer with short-range correlation in intrinsic
curvatures. We show exactly that when not subjected to any external force, such
a system is equivalent to a system with a well-defined intrinsic curvature and
a proper renormalized persistence length. We find the exact expression for the
distribution function of the equivalent system. However, we show that such an
equivalent system does not always exist for the polymer subjected to an
external force. We find that under an external force, the effect of
sequence-disorder depends upon the averaging order, the degree of disorder, and
the experimental conditions, such as the boundary conditions. Furthermore, a
short to moderate length biopolymer may be much softer or has a smaller
apparent persistent length than what would be expected from the "equivalent
system". Moreover, under a strong stretching force and for a long biopolymer,
the sequence-disorder is immaterial for elasticity. Finally, the effect of
sequence-disorder may depend upon the quantity considered.
