We study the Kondo resonance in a spin-1/2 single impurity Anderson model
with a gapless conduction band using the equation of motion approach in order
to obtain the impurity spectral function. We study two different scenarios for
gapless systems: a purely power-law energy dependence of the density of states
or a constant density of states with a gapless behavior near the Fermi level.
We demonstrate that strong electron-electron correlations lead to a sharp peak
in the impurity spectral function in the case of a large exchange coupling
($J>J_{c}$) or equivalently, a strong hybridization ($V>V_{c}$). This
Kondo-like peak emerges much below the Fermi level in the case of a strongly
depleted density of states. These results are compared with the ones from
renormalization group approaches.
