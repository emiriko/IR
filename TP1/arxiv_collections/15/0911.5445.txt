Wegner describes coordination as constrained interaction. We take this
approach literally and define a coordination model based on interaction
constraints and partial, iterative and interactive constraint satisfaction. Our
model captures behaviour described in terms of synchronisation and data flow
constraints, plus various modes of interaction with the outside world provided
by external constraint symbols, on-the-fly constraint generation, and
coordination variables. Underlying our approach is an engine performing
(partial) constraint satisfaction of the sets of constraints. Our model extends
previous work on three counts: firstly, a more advanced notion of external
interaction is offered; secondly, our approach enables local satisfaction of
constraints with appropriate partial solutions, avoiding global synchronisation
over the entire constraints set; and, as a consequence, constraint satisfaction
can finally occur concurrently, and multiple parts of a set of constraints can
be solved and interact with the outside world in an asynchronous manner, unless
synchronisation is required by the constraints. This paper describes the
underlying logic, which enables a notion of local solution, and relates this
logic to the more global approach of our previous work based on classical
logic.
