In recent lattice QCD studies, the Feynman-Hellmann theorem is often used to
estimate separate contributions of the connected and disconnected diagrams to
the nucleon sigma term. We demonstrate through a simple analysis within an
effective model of QCD why this could be dangerous although the theorem is
naturally expected to hold for the sum of the two contributions, i.e. the net
nucleon sigma term.
