This paper reports a blind search for magnetospheric emissions from planets
around nearby stars. Young stars are likely to have much stronger stellar winds
than the Sun, and because planetary magnetospheric emissions are powered by
stellar winds, stronger stellar winds may enhance the radio luminosity of any
orbiting planets. Using various stellar catalogs, we selected nearby stars (<~
30 pc) with relatively young age estimates (< 3 Gyr). We constructed different
samples from the stellar catalogs, finding between 100 and several hundred
stars. We stacked images from the 74-MHz (4-m wavelength) VLA Low-frequency Sky
Survey (VLSS), obtaining 3\sigma limits on planetary emission in the stacked
images of between 10 and 33 mJy. These flux density limits correspond to
average planetary luminosities less than 5--10 x 10^{23} erg/s. Using recent
models for the scaling of stellar wind velocity, density, and magnetic field
with stellar age, we estimate scaling factors for the strength of stellar
winds, relative to the Sun, in our samples. The typical kinetic energy carried
by the stellar winds in our samples is 15--50 times larger than that of the
Sun, and the typical magnetic energy is 5--10 times larger. If we assume that
every star is orbited by a Jupiter-like planet with a luminosity larger than
that of the Jovian decametric radiation by the above factors, our limits on
planetary luminosities from the stacking analysis are likely to be a factor of
10--100 above what would be required to detect the planets in a statistical
sense. Similar statistical analyses with observations by future instruments,
such as the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Long Wavelength Array (LWA),
offer the promise of improvements by factors of 10--100.
