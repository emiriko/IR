Local dielectric spectroscopy is performed to study how relaxation dynamics
of a poly-vinyl-acetate ultra-thin film is influenced by inorganic
nano-inclusions of a layered silicate (montmorillonite). Dielectric loss
spectra are measured by electrostatic force microscopy in the
frequency-modulation mode in ambient air. Spectral changes in both shape and
relaxation time are evidenced across the boundary between pure polymer and
montmorillonite sheets. Dielectric loss imaging is also performed, evidencing
spatial variations of dielectric properties near to nanostructures with
nanometer scale resolution.
