An expansion for the free energy functional of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
(SK) model, around the Replica Symmetric SK solution $Q^{({\rm RS})}_{ab} =
\delta_{ab} + q(1-\delta_{ab})$ is investigated. In particular, when the
expansion is truncated to fourth order in. $Q_{ab} - Q^{({\rm RS})}_{ab}$. The
Full Replica Symmetry Broken (FRSB) solution is explicitly found but it turns
out to exist only in the range of temperature $0.549...\leq T\leq T_c=1$, not
including T=0. On the other hand an expansion around the paramagnetic solution
$Q^{({\rm PM})}_{ab} = \delta_{ab}$ up to fourth order yields a FRSB solution
that exists in a limited temperature range $0.915...\leq T \leq T_c=1$.
