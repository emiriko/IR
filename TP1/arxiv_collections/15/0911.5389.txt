As is well known, the type 1 Lie superalgebra sl(r+1|s+1) admits a one
parameter family of finite dimensional irreducible representations. We have
carried out an analytic Bethe ansatz related to this family of representations.
We present formulae, which are deformations of previously proposed determinant
formulae labeled by a Young superdiagram. These formulae will provide transfer
matrix eigenvalues in dressed vacuum form related to the solutions of a graded
Yang-Baxter equation, which depend not only on the spectral parameter but also
on a non-additive continuous parameter. A class of transfer matrix functional
relations among these formulae is briefly mentioned.
