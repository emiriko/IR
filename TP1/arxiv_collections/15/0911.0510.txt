In this paper we examine the wave properties of hot plasma living in
Schwarzschild magnetosphere. The 3+1 GRMHD perturbation equations are
formulated for this scenario. These equations are Fourier analyzed and then
solved numerically to obtain the dispersion relations for non-rotating,
rotating non-magnetized and rotating magnetized plasma. The wave vector is
evaluated which is used to calculate refractive index. These quantities are
shown in graphs which are helpful to discuss the dispersive properties of the
medium near the event horizon.
