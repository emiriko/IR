We analyze the one-loop vacuum stability and perturbativity bounds on a
singlet extension of the Standard Model (SM) scalar sector containing a scalar
dark matter candidate. We show that the presence of the singlet-doublet quartic
interaction relaxes the vacuum stability lower bound on the SM Higgs mass as a
function of the cutoff and lowers the corresponding upper bound based on
perturbativity considerations. We also find that vacuum stability requirements
may place a lower bound on the singlet dark matter mass for given singlet
quartic self coupling, leading to restrictions on the parameter space
consistent with the observed relic density. We argue that discovery of a light
singlet scalar dark matter particle could provide indirect information on the
singlet quartic self-coupling.
