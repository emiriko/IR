Correlation functions of the simplest multi-particle state will be presented
using distilled quark propagators. The I=2 pi-pi state can be simulated without
computing disconnected diagrams and thus is the simplest two-particle state
that can be studied with quark sources placed on a single time-slice. We study
the quality of the signals of this pi-pi correlation function using the
quark-smearing guided distillation method. Results will be presented for pi-pi
correlation functions computed on dynamical, anisotropic lattices.
