We propose a rotationally-invariant quantum key distribution scheme that uses
a pair of orthogonal qubit trines, realized as mixed states of three physical
qubits. The measurement outcomes do not depend on how Alice and Bob choose
their individual reference frames. The efficient key generation by two-way
communication produces two independent raw keys, a bit key and a trit key. For
a noiseless channel, Alice and Bob get a total of 0.573 key bits per trine
state sent (98% of the Shannon limit). This exceeds by a considerable amount
the yield of standard trine schemes, which ideally attain half a key bit per
trine state. Eavesdropping introduces an $\epsilon$-fraction of unbiased noise,
ensured by twirling if necessary. The security analysis reveals an asymmetry in
Eve's conditioned ancillas for Alice and Bob resulting from their inequivalent
roles in the key generation. Upon simplifying the analysis by a plausible
symmetry assumption, we find that a secret key can be generated if the noise is
below the threshold set by $\epsilon = 0.197$.
