There are many factors that can influence the outcome of an election. We here
identify two dominant effects that can affect the votes obtained by a
candidate, namely, the Majority Effect and the Media Effect. We mimic these two
effects in a simple growth model. We put the model on a two-dimensional square
lattice and test it against the available data from elections in various
countries. By adjusting the two parameters in the model, we are able to fit the
vote distributions in all the countries studied.
