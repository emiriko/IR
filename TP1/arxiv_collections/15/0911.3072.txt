In view of the approaching LHC operation the feasibility and accuracy of QCD
measurements with the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
involving hadrons and jets are discussed. This summary is based on analyses
performed at CMS for center-of-mass energies of 10 as well as 14 TeV assuming
event numbers ranging from some days of data taking up to 100/pb of integrated
luminosity with proton-proton collisions.
