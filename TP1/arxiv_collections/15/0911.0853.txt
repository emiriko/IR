We describe three fundamentally different methods we have applied to
calibrate the test mass displacement actuators to search for systematic errors
in the calibration of the LIGO gravitational-wave detectors. The actuation
frequencies tested range from 90 Hz to 1 kHz and the actuation amplitudes range
from 1e-6 m to 1e-18 m. For each of the four test mass actuators measured, the
weighted mean coefficient over all frequencies for each technique deviates from
the average actuation coefficient for all three techniques by less than 4%.
This result indicates that systematic errors in the calibration of the
responses of the LIGO detectors to differential length variations are within
the stated uncertainties.
