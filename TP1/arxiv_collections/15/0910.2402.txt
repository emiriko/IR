By analyzing the X-ray spectrum of MCG-6-30-15 obtained with the HETG
spectrometer on board the Chandra Observatory, we identify three kinematically
distinct absorption systems; two outflow components intrinsic to MCG-6-30-15,
and one local at z = 0. The slow outflow at -100 +/- 50 km s^-1 has a large
range of ionization manifested by absorption from 24 different charge states of
Fe, which enables a detailed reconstruction of the absorption measure
distribution (AMD). This AMD spans five orders of magnitude in ionization
parameter: -1.5 < log xi < 3.5 (cgs units), with a total column density of N_H
= (5.3 +/- 0.7) x 10^21 cm^-2. The fast outflow at -1900 +/- 150 km s^-1 has a
well defined ionization parameter with log xi = 3.82 +/- 0.03 (cgs units) and
column density N_H = 8.1 +/- 0.7 x 10^22 cm^-2. Assuming this component is a
thin, uniform, spherical shell, it can be estimated to lie within 11 light days
of the \agn center. The third component, most clearly detected in the lower
oxygen charge states O^+1 - O^+6, has been confused in the past with the fast
outflow, but is identified here with local gas z = 0 and a total column density
N_H of a few 10^20 cm^-2. Finally, we exploit the excellent spectral resolution
of the HETGS and use the present spectrum to determine the rest-frame
wavelengths of oxygen inner-shell lines that were previously uncertain.
