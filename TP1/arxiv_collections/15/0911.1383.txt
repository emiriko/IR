The Shahshahani geometry of evolutionary game theory is realized as the
information geometry of the simplex, deriving from the Fisher information
metric of the manifold of categorical probability distributions. Some essential
concepts in evolutionary game theory are realized information-theoretically.
Results are extended to the Lotka-Volterra equation and to multiple population
systems.
