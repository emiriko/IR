Concepts of wounded nucleon and quark participants have been used for years
to parametrize and/or to explain many features of high energy nuclear
collisions. Some results illustrating successes and failures of these two
approaches are presented, including the latest developments. In particular,
results on identified particle production from nuclear collisions measured by
the NA49 experiment at the CERN-SPS are shown. The study has been done for both
the nucleon and the constituent quark frameworks using the nuclear overlap
model. In addition, some preliminary observations concerning the behavior of pT
spectra at forward rapidities, expressed in terms of the nuclear modification
factor, for hadron-nucleus collisions at the SPS energy are also presented.
These results are in relevance to RHIC results for deuteron-gold collisions
often interpreted as a manifestation of saturation and/or color glass
condensate.
