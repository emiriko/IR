The negative Wilson mass parameter is an input parameter to the overlap Dirac
operator. We examine the extent to which the topological charge density,
revealed by the overlap definition, depends on the value of the negative Wilson
mass. A strong dependence is observed, which can be correlated with the
topological charge density obtained from the gluonic definition, with a
variable number of stout-link smearing sweeps. The results indicate that the
freedom typically associated with fat-link fermion actions, through the number
of smearing sweeps, is also present in the overlap formalism, through the
freedom in the Wilson mass parameter.
