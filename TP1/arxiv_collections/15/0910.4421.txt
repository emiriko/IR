The study of the strangeness production from pp collisions plays important
roles in two aspects: exploring the properties of baryon resonances involved
and understanding the strangeness production from heavy ion collisions to
explore the properties of high energy and high density nuclear matter. Here we
review our recent studies on several most important channels for the
strangeness production from pp collisions. The previously ignored contributions
from Delta*(1620) and N*(1535) resonances are found to play dominant role for
the pp --> n K+ Sigma+, pp --> pK+ Lambda and pp --> pp phi reactions
near-thresholds. These contributions should be included for further studies on
the strangeness production from both pp collisions and heavy ion collisions.
