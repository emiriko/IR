The process gamma gamma \to mu tau b bbar is studied in the minimal
supersymmetric standard model within a large tan_beta scenario imposing on the
parameter space present direct and indirect constraints from B physics and rare
LFV tau-decays. At a photon collider based on an e+e- linear collider with a
center of mass energy of 800 GeV with the parameters of the TESLA proposal
(expected integrated gamma-gamma luminosity L=200-500 inverse fb) the LFV
signal can be probed for masses of the heavy neutral Higgs bosons A,H from 300
GeV up to the kinematical limit ~ 600 GeV for tan_beta in the range 30,60.
