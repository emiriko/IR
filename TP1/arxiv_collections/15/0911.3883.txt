By creating and analyzing the two dimensional gas temperature and abundance
maps of the RGH 80 compact galaxy group with the high-quality Chandra data, we
detect a high-abundance ($\simeq 0.7$ $Z_\odot$) arc, where the metal abundance
is significantly higher than the surrounding regions by $\simeq 0.3$ Z_\odot$.
This structure shows tight spatial correlations with the member galaxy PGC
046529, as well as with the arm-like feature identified on the X-ray image in
the previous work of Randall et al. (2009). Since no apparent signature of AGN
activity is found associated with PGC 046529 in multi-band observations, and
the gas temperature, metallicity, and mass of the high-abundance arc resemble
those of the ISM of typical early-type galaxies, we conclude that this
high-abundance structure is the remnant of the ISM of PGC 046529, which was
stripped out of the galaxy by ram pressure stripping due to the motion of PGC
046529 in RGH 80. This novel case shows that ram pressure stripping can work
efficiently in the metal enrichment process in galaxy groups, as it can in
galaxy clusters.
