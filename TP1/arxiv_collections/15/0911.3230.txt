The axisymmetric static solution of Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics
with ring singularity is investigated. This solution is considered as a static
part of massive charged particle with spin and magnetic moment. The method for
obtaining the appropriate approximate solution is proposed. An approximate
solution is found. The values of spin, mass, and magnetic moment is obtained
for this approximate solution.
