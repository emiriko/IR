We expand the superpotential of $\nu$MSSM to 6th order. This is the order at
which all flat directions can be lifted. All 5179 couplings are independent ie.
the superpotential cannot be zero for all fields, without all couplings being
zero. Likewise, any gauge invariant potential to the 6th order can be made by
fixing the constants. A specific and welldefined choice of normalisation has
been adopted. The case for investigating this potential, rather than looking at
one or several generalised flat directions is made.
