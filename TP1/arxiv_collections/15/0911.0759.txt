The use of GEM foils for the amplification stage of a TPC instead of a con-
ventional MWPC allows one to bypass the necessity of gating, as the backdrift
is suppressed thanks to the asymmetric field configuration. This way, a novel
continuously running TPC, which represents one option for the PANDA central
tracker, can be realized. A medium sized prototype with a diameter of 300 mm
and a length of 600 mm will be tested inside the FOPI spectrometer at GSI using
a carbon or lithium beam at intermediate energies (E = 1-3AGeV). This detector
test under realistic experimental conditions should allow us to verify the
spatial resolution for single tracks and the reconstruction capability for
displaced vertexes. A series of physics measurement implying pion beams is
scheduled with the FOPI spectrometer together with the GEM-TPC as well.
