In the case of the energy-momentum tensor related to "ordinary" matter
(perfect fluid representing spin 1/2 and 1 fields), the equations of general
relativity result in cosmological and gravitational collapse singularities--due
to the fulfilment of both the strong and weak energy conditions. According to
great unified theories, in superdense matter (both hot and cold), phase
transitions take place, symmetry between the strong and electroweak
interactions is restored/broken, and a scalar field is created/annihilated. In
the scalar field regime, the strong energy condition is broken, but the weak
one holds. However, the continuity condition for the pressure on the surface of
a contracting star results in the occurrence of a compensating pseudomatter
field, for which both energy conditions are broken. On this basis, for a
massive star predisposed to a gravitational collapse, a pulsation dynamics with
no singularity is constructed.
