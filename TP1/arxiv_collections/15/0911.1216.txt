We study the impact of the diagonal frustrating couplings on the quantum
phase diagram of a two-leg ladder composed of alternating spin-1 and spin-1/2
rungs. As the coupling strength is increased the system successively exhibits
two gapped paramagnetic phases (a rung-singlet and a Haldane-like
non-degenerate states) and two ferrimagnetic phases with different
ferromagnetic moments per rung. The first two states are similar to the phases
studied in the frustrated spin-1/2 ladder, whereas the magnetic phases appear
as a result of the mixed-spin structure of the model. A detailed
characterization of these phases is presented using density-matrix
renormalization-group calculations, exact diagonalizations of periodic
clusters, and an effective Hamiltonian approach inspired by the analysis of
numerical data. The present theoretical study was motivated by the recent
synthesis of the quasi-one-dimensional ferrimagnetic material
Fe$^{II}$Fe$^{III}$ (trans-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate) exhibiting a similar
ladder structure.
