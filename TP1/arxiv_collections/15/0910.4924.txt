Microcanonical Monte Carlo simulations of a polydisperse soft-spheres model
for liquids and colloids have been performed for very large polydispersity, in
the region where a phase-separation is known to occur when the system (or part
of it) solidifies. By studying samples of different sizes, from N=256 to N=864,
we focus on the nature of the two distinct coexisting phases. Measurements of
crystalline order in particles of different size reveal that the solid phase
segregates between a crystalline solid with cubic symmetry and a disordered
phase. This phenomenon is termed fractionation.
