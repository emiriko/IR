The Spallation Neutron Source in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, is designed to produce
intense pulsed neutrons for various science and engineering applications.
Copious neutrinos are a free by-product. When it reaches full power, the SNS
will be the world's brightest source of neutrinos in the few tens of MeV range.
The proposed CLEAR (Coherent Low Energy A (Nuclear) Recoils) experiment will
measure coherent elastic neutral current neutrino-nucleus scattering at the
SNS. The physics reach includes tests of the Standard Model.
