We analyze the effects of hyperfine mixing in $b \to c$ semileptonic decays
of doubly heavy baryons. We qualitatively confirm the results by W. Roberts and
M. Pervin in Int. J. Mod. Phys. A, 2009, {\bf 24}: 2401-2413, finding that
mixing has a great impact on those transitions. However, predictions without
mixing differ by a factor of 2 and this discrepancy translates to the mixed
case where large differences in decay widths are observed between the two
calculations.
