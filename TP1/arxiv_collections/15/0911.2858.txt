The Kondo problem is studied using the unitary Lie algebra of spin-singlet
fermion bilinears. In the limit when the number of values of the spin $N$ goes
to infinity the theory approaches a classical limit, which still requires a
renormalization. We determine the ground state of this renormalized theory.
Then we construct a quantum theory around this classical limit, which amounts
to recovering the case of finite $N$.
