Phased array feeds (PAFs) for reflector antennas offer the potential for
increased reflector field of view and faster survey speeds. To address some of
the development challenges that remain for scientifically useful PAFs,
including calibration and beamforming algorithms, sensitivity optimization, and
demonstration of wide field of view imaging, we report experimental results
from a 19 element room temperature L-band PAF mounted on the Green Bank
20-Meter Telescope. Formed beams achieved an aperture efficiency of 69% and
system noise temperature of 66 K. Radio camera images of several sky regions
are presented. We investigate the noise performance and sensitivity of the
system as a function of elevation angle with statistically optimal beamforming
and demonstrate cancelation of radio frequency interference sources with
adaptive spatial filtering.
