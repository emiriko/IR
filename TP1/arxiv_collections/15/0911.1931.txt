In this proceeding contribution we report on the ongoing effort to simulate
Wilson-type fermions in the so called epsilon regime of chiral perturbation
theory. We present results for the chiral condensate and the pseudoscalar decay
constant obtained with Wilson twisted mass fermions employing two lattice
spacings, two different physical volumes and several quark masses. With this
set of simulations we make a first attempt to estimate the systematic
uncertainties.
