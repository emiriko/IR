Since the first reports of oscillations in prominences in 1930s there have
been major theoretical and observational advances to understand the nature of
these oscillatory phenomena leading to a whole new field of so called
"prominence seismology". There are two types of oscillatory phenomena observed
in prominences; "small amplitude oscillations" (~2-3 km s$^{-1}$) which are
quite common and "large amplitude oscillations" ($>$20 km s$^{-1}$) for which
observations are scarce. Large amplitude oscillations have been found as
"winking filament" in H$\alpha$ as well as motion in the sky plane in
H$\alpha$, EUV, micro-wave and He 10830 observations. Historically, it was
suggested that the large amplitude oscillations in prominences were triggered
by disturbances such as fast-mode MHD waves (Moreton wave) produced by remote
flares. Recent observations show, in addition, that near-by flares or jets can
also create such large amplitude oscillations in prominences. Large amplitude
oscillations, which are observed both in transverse as well as longitudinal
direction, have a range of periods varying from tens of minutes to a couple of
hours. Using the observed period of oscillation and simple theoretical models,
the obtained magnetic field in prominences has shown quite a good agreement
with directly measured one and therefore, justifies prominences seismology as a
powerful diagnostic tool. On rare occasions, when the large amplitude
oscillations have been observed before or during the eruption, the oscillations
may be applied to diagnose the stability and the eruption mechanism. Here we
review the recent developments and understanding in the observational
properties of large amplitude oscillations and their trigger mechanisms and
stability in the context of prominence seismology.
