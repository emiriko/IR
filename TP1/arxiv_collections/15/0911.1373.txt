We investigate the electronic structure of the frustrated magnet Na4Ir3O8
using density functional theory. Due to strong spin-orbit coupling, the
hyperkagome lattice is characterized by a half-filled complex of states, making
it a cubic iridium analogue of the high temperature superconducting cuprates.
The implications of our results for this unique material are discussed.
