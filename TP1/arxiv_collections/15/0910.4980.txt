We update the single-coupling bounds on R-parity violating supersymmetry
using the most up to date data as of October 2009. In addition to the data
listed in the 2009 Review of Particle Properties, we utilize a new
determination of the weak charge of cesium-133, and preliminary tau-decay
branching fractions from Babar. Analysis of semileptonic D-decay is improved by
the inclusion of experimentally measured form-factors into the calculation of
the Standard Model predictions.
