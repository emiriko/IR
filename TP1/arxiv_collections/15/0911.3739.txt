For two commuting Tonelli Hamiltonians, we recover the commutation of the
Lax-Oleinik semi-groups, a result of Barles and Tourin ([BT01]), using a direct
geometrical method (Stoke's theorem). We also obtain a "generalization" of a
theorem of Maderna ([Mad02]). More precisely, we prove that if the phase space
is the cotangent of a compact manifold then the weak KAM solutions (or
viscosity solutions of the critical stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation) for G
and for H are the same. As a corrolary we obtain the equality of the Aubry
sets, of the Peierls barrier and of flat parts of Mather's $\alpha$ functions.
This is also related to works of Sorrentino ([Sor09]) and Bernard ([Ber07b]).
