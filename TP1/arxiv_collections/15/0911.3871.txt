We present a comprehensive study of semiclassical phase-space propagation in
the Wigner representation, emphasizing numerical applications, in particular as
an initial-value representation. Two semiclassical approximation schemes are
discussed: The propagator of the Wigner function based on van Vleck's
approximation replaces the Liouville propagator by a quantum spot with an
oscillatory pattern reflecting the interference between pairs of classical
trajectories. Employing phase-space path integration instead, caustics in the
quantum spot are resolved in terms of Airy functions. We apply both to two
benchmark models of nonlinear molecular potentials, the Morse oscillator and
the quartic double well, to test them in standard tasks such as computing
autocorrelation functions and propagating coherent states. The performance of
semiclassical Wigner propagation is very good even in the presence of marked
quantum effects, e.g., in coherent tunneling and in propagating Schr\"odinger
cat states, and of classical chaos in four-dimensional phase space. We suggest
options for an effective numerical implementation of our method and for
integrating it in Monte-Carlo--Metropolis algorithms suitable for
high-dimensional systems.
