We simulate the formation and evolution of galaxies with a self-consistent 3D
hydrodynamical model including star formation, supernova feedback, and chemical
enrichment. Hypernova feedback plays an essential role not only in solving the
[Zn/Fe] problem, but also reproducing the cosmic star formation rate history
and the mass-metallicity relations. In a Milky-Way type galaxy, kinematics and
chemical abundances are different in bulge, disk, and thick disk because of
different star formation histories and the contribution of Type Ia Supernovae.
