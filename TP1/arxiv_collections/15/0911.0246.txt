We use the extended statistical thermal model to describe various hadron
rapidity spectra at the highest RHIC energy (200 GeV/A). The model assumes the
formation of hot and dense regions moving along the beam axis with increasing
rapidities, yFB. It has been earlier shown that this model can explain the net
proton flow i.e. p minus pbar, ratio pbar/p and the pion rapidity spectra. In
this paper we have attempted to show that in addition to these quantities, this
model can also successfully describe the individual rapidity spectra of
protons, antiprotons, Kaons, antiKaons, pions, the ratios lambdabar/lambda and
cascadebar/cascade. The experimental data set on p, pbar, K, Kbar and Pion
provided by BRAHMS collaboration at the highest energy of Relativistic Heavy
Ion Collider, sqrt(SNN) = 200 GeV are used. The theoretical results fit quite
well with mid-rapidity data (for y < 1) of the lambdabar/lambda and the
cascadebar/cascade ratios available (from STAR). We have used single set of
model parameters including single value of the temperature parameter T for all
the regions of the hot and dense matter formed. The chemical potentials are
however assumed to be dependent on the fireball rapidity yFB. We have analyzed
the contribution of the decay of the heavier resonances to the proton
(antiproton) rapidity spectra. It is found that the rapidity spectrum of the
product hadron is nearly same as that of the parent hadron. We have also
imposed the criteria of exact strangeness conservation in every (local) region
of the dense matter separately, which is necessary. We also discuss what can be
learned about the nuclear transparency effect at the highest RHIC energy from
the net proton rapidity distribution.
