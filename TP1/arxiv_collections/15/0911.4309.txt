We show a uniqueness theorem for charged dipole rotating black rings in the
bosonic sector of five-dimensional minimal supergravity, generalizing our
previous work [arXiv:0901.4724] on the uniqueness of charged rotating black
holes with topologically spherical horizon in the same theory. More precisely,
assuming the existence of two commuting axial Killing vector fields, we prove
that an asymptotically flat, stationary charged rotating black hole with
non-degenerate connected event horizon of cross-section topology S^1XS^2 in the
five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory-if exists-is
characterized by the mass, charge, two independent angular momenta, dipole
charge, and the rod structure. As anticipated, the necessity of specifying
dipole charge-which is not a conserved charge-is the new, distinguished
ingredient that highlights difference between the present theorem and the
corresponding theorem for vacuum case, as well as difference from the case of
topologically spherical horizon within the same minimal supergravity. We also
consider a similar boundary value problem for other topologically non-trivial
black holes within the same theory, and find that generalizing the present
uniqueness results to include black lenses-provided there exists such a
solution in the theory-would not appear to be straightforward.
