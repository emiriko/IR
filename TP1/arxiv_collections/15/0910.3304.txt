The Sun is a powerful neutrino source that can be used to study the physical
properties of neutrinos and, at the same time, neutrinos are a unique tool to
probe the interior of the Sun. For these reasons, solar neutrino physics is
both fundamental neutrino and solar physics. In this paper we summarize shortly
the main results of the last three decades and then focus on the new results
produced by running experiments. We also give a short look at already funded or
proposed new projects and at their scientific perspectives.
