Josephson vortices in naturally stacked Bi-2212 tunneling junctions display
rich dynamic behavior that derives from the coexistence of three basic states:
static Josephson vortex lattice, coherently moving lattice, and incoherent
quasiparticle tunneling state. Rich structure of hysteretic branches observed
in the current-voltage characteristics can be understood as combinatorial
combinations of these three states which are realized in different junctions
and evolve separately with magnetic field and bias current. In particular, the
multiple Josephson-vortex-flow branches at low bias currents arise from the
individual depinning of Josephson vortex rows in each junction.
