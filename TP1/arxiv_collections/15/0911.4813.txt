In this paper we propose the time-dependent Hamiltonian form of human
biomechanics, as a sequel to our previous work in time-dependent Lagrangian
biomechanics [1]. Starting with the Covariant Force Law, we first develop
autonomous Hamiltonian biomechanics. Then we extend it using a powerful
geometrical machinery consisting of fibre bundles and jet manifolds associated
to the biomechanical configuration manifold. We derive time-dependent,
dissipative, Hamiltonian equations and the fitness evolution equation for the
general time-dependent human biomechanical system.
