The possibility of detecting double flavor violating top quark transitions at
future colliders is explored in a model-independent manner using the effective
Lagrangian approach through the $t \to u_i\tau \mu$ ($u_i=u,c$) decays. A
Yukawa sector that contemplates $SU_L(2)\times U_Y(1)$ invariants of up to
dimension six is proposed and used to derive the most general flavor violating
and CP violating $q_iq_jH$ and $l_il_jH$ vertices of renormalizable type.
Low-energy data, on high precision measurements, and experimental limits are
used to constraint the $tu_iH$ and $H\tau \mu$ vertices and then used to
predict the branching ratios for the $t \to u_i\tau \mu$ decays. It is found
that this branching ratios may be of the order of $ 10^{-4}-10^{-5}$, for a
relative light Higgs boson with mass lower than $2m_W$, which could be more
important than those typical values found in theories beyond the standard model
for the rare top quark decays $t\to u_iV_iV_j$ ($V_i=W,Z,\gamma, g$) or $t\to
u_il^+l^-$. %% LHC experiments, by using a total integrated luminosity of $\rm
3000 fb^{-1}$ of data, will be able to rule out, at 95% C.L., DFV top quark
decays up to a Higgs mass of 155 GeV/$c^2$ or discover such a process up to a
Higgs mass of 147 GeV/$c^2$.
