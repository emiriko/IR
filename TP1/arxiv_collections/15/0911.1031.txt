Different approaches to define transverse-momentum dependent parton
distribution functions are considered from the point of view of their
renormalization-group properties. The associated one-loop anomalous dimensions
of these quantities are presented and compared to each other. We give arguments
in favor of the "pure light-like" definition, and the use of the light-cone
gauge.
