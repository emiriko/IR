We review the electromagnetic form factor of heavy quarks with emphasis on
the QCD radiative corrections at two-loop order in the perturbative expansion.
We discuss important properties of the heavy-quark form factor such as its
exponentiation in the high-energy limit and its role in QCD factorization
theorems for massive n-parton amplitudes.
