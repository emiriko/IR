Using first-principles density functional calculations we demonstrate that
ferromagnetism can be induced and modulated on an otherwise paramagnetic Pd
metal thin-film surface through application of an external electric field. As
free charges are either accumulated or depleted at the Pd surface to screen the
applied electric field there is a corresponding change in the surface density
of states. This change can be made sufficient for the Fermi-level density of
states to satisfy the Stoner criterion, driving a transition locally at the
surface from a paramagnetic state to an itinerant ferromagnetic state above a
critical applied electric field, Ec. Furthermore, due to the second-order
nature of this transition, the surface magnetization of the ferromagnetic state
just above the transition exhibits a substantial dependence on electric field,
as the result of an enhanced magnetoelectric susceptibility. Using a linearized
Stoner model we explain the occurrence of the itinerant ferromagnetism and
demonstrate that the magnetic moment on the Pd surface follows a square-root
variation with electric field consistent with our first-principles
calculations.
