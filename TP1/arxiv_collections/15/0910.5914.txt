Axions in the micro eV mass range are a plausible cold dark matter candidate
and may be detected by their conversion into microwave photons in a resonant
cavity immersed in a static magnetic field. The first result from such an axion
search using a superconducting first-stage amplifier (SQUID) is reported. The
SQUID amplifier, replacing a conventional GaAs field-effect transistor
amplifier, successfully reached axion-photon coupling sensitivity in the band
set by present axion models and sets the stage for a definitive axion search
utilizing near quantum-limited SQUID amplifiers.
