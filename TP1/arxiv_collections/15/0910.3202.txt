The multicritical behavior of the Blume-Capel model with infinite-range
interactions is investigated by introducing quenched disorder in the crystal
field $\Delta_{i}$, which is represented by a superposition of two Gaussian
distributions with the same width $\sigma$, centered at $\Delta_{i} = \Delta$
and $\Delta_{i} = 0$, with probabilities $p$ and $(1-p)$, respectively. A rich
variety of phase diagrams is presented, and their distinct topologies are shown
for different values of $\sigma$ and $p$. The tricritical behavior is analyzed
through the existence of fourth-order critical points as well as how the
complexity of the phase diagrams is reduced by the strength of the disorder.
