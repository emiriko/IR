A method is proposed to design the time dependence of the trap frequency and
achieve in a short time an adiabatic-like (frictionless) evolution of
Bose-Einstein condensates governed by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Different
cases depending on the effective dimension of the trap and the interaction
regimes are considered. 2D traps are particularly suitable as the method can be
applied without the need to impose any additional time-dependent change in the
strength of the interatomic interaction or a Thomas-Fermi regime as it occurs
for 1D and 3D traps.
