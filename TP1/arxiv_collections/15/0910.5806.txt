Experimental study on the soliton dynamics of a passively mode locked fiber
ring laser firstly revealed a state of bound soliton operation in the laser,
where two solitons bind together tightly with fixed pulse separation. We
further report on the properties of the bound-soliton emission of the laser. In
particular, we demonstrate both experimentally and numerically that, like the
single pulse soliton operation of the laser, the bound soliton emission is
another intrinsic feature of the laser.
