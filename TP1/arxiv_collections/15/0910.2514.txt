The new particles predicted by the topcolor-assisted technicolor ($TC2$)
model and the littlest Higgs model with T-parity (called $LHT$ model) can
induce the lepton flavor violation ($LFV$) couplings at tree level or one loop
level, which might generate large contributions to some $LFV$ processes. Taking
into account the constraints of the experimental data on the relevant free
parameters, we calculate the branching ratios of the $LFV$ decay processes
$\tau^-\to\mu^- P_1 P_2 $ with $P_1 P_2$ = $\pi^+\pi^-$, $K^+K^-$ and
$K^0\bar{K^0}$ in the context of these two kinds of new physics models. We find
that the $TC2$ model and the $LHT$ model can indeed produce significant
contributions to some of these $LFV$ decay processes.
