We study the process \gamma\gamma->h->bb_bar at ILC as a probe of different
little Higgs models, including the simplest little Higgs model (SLH), the
littlest Higgs model (LH), and two types of littlest Higgs models with T-parity
(LHT-I, LHT-II). Compared with the Standard Model (SM) prediction, the
production rate is found to be sizably altered in these little Higgs models
and, more interestingly, different models give different predictions. We find
that the production rate can be possibly enhanced only in the LHT-II for some
part of the parameter space, while in all other cases the rate is suppressed.
The suppression can be 10% in the LH and as much as 60% in both the SLH and the
LHT-I/LHT-II. The severe suppression in the SLH happens for a large \tan\beta
and a small m_h, in which the new decay mode h->\eta\eta (\eta is a light
pseudo-scalar) is dominant; while for the LHT-I/LHT-II the large suppression
occurs when f and m_h are both small so that the new decay mode h->A_H A_H is
dominant. Therefore, the precision measurement of such a production process at
the ILC will allow for a test of these models and even distinguish between
different scenarios.
