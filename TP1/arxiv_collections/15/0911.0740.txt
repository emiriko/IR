The recent detection by the Fermi gamma-ray space telescope of high-energy
gamma-rays from the radio galaxy NGC 1275 makes the observation of the very
high energy (VHE: E > 100 GeV) part of its broadband spectrum particularly
interesting, especially for the understanding of active galactic nuclei (AGN)
with misaligned multi-structured jets. The radio galaxy NGC 1275 was recently
observed by VERITAS at energies above 100 GeV for about 8 hours. No VHE
gamma-ray emission was detected by VERITAS from NGC 1275. A 99% confidence
level upper limit of 2.1% of the Crab Nebula flux level is obtained at the
decorrelation energy of approximately 340 GeV, corresponding to 19% of the
power-law extrapolation of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) result.
