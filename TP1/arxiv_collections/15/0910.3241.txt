We present a general form of the iteration and interpolation process used in
implicit particle filters. Implicit filters are based on a pseudo-Gaussian
representation of posterior densities, and are designed to focus the particle
paths so as to reduce the number of particles needed in nonlinear data
assimilation. Examples are given.
