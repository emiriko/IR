We evaluate the rate of energy loss of a plasmon in a disorder-free carbon
nanotube. The plasmon decays into neutral bosonic excitations of the electron
liquid. The process is mediated either by phonon-assisted backscattering of a
single electron, or Umklapp backscattering of two electrons. To lowest order in
the backscattering interactions the partial decay rates are additive. At zero
doping the corresponding decay rates scale as power-laws of the temperature
with positive and negative exponents for the two mechanisms, respectively. The
precise values of the exponents depend on the Luttinger liquid parameter. At
finite doping the decay rates are described by universal crossover functions of
frequency and chemical potential measured in units of temperature. In the
evaluation of the plasmon decay, we concentrate on a finite-length geometry
allowing excitation of plasma resonances.
