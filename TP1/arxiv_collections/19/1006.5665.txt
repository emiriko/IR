We address the problem of the information-disturbance trade-off associated to
the estimation of a quantum transformation, and show how the extraction of
information about the a black box causes a perturbation of the corresponding
input-output evolution. In the case of a black box performing a unitary
transformation, randomly distributed according to the invariant measure, we
give a complete solution of the problem, deriving the optimal trade-off curve
and presenting an explicit construction of the optimal quantum network.
