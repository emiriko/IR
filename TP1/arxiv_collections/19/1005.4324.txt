The deconfinement phase transition which happens in the interior of neutron
stars are investigated. Coupled with the spin evolution of the stars, the
effect of entropy production and deconfinement heat generation during the
deconfinement phase transition in the mixed phase of the neutron stars are
discussed. The entropy production of deconfinement phase transition can be act
as a signature of phase transition, but less important and does not
significantly change the thermal evolution of neutron stars. The deconfinement
heat can change the thermal evolution of neutron star distinctly.
