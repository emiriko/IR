In 1985, Levy used a theorem of Berstein to prove that all hyperbolic
topological polynomials are equivalent to complex polynomials. We prove a
partial converse to the Berstein-Levy Theorem: given post-critical dynamics
that are in a sense strongly non-hyperbolic, we prove the existence of
topological polynomials which are not equivalent to any complex polynomial that
realize these post-critical dynamics. This proof employs the theory of
self-similar groups to demonstrate that a topological polynomial admits an
obstruction and produces a wealth of examples of obstructed topological
polynomials.
