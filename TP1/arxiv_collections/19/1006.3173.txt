An effective description of a general class of stochastic phase oscillators
is presented. For this, the effective phase velocity is defined either by
invariant probability density or via first passage times. While the first
approach exhibits correct frequency and distribution density, the second one
yields proper phase resetting curves. Their discrepancy is most pronounced for
noise-induced oscillations and is related to non-monotonicity of the phase
fluctuations.
