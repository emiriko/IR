We present the results of hydrodynamic simulations of the growth and orbital
evolution of giant planets embedded in a protoplanetary disk with a dead-zone.
The aim is to examine to what extent the presence of a dead-zone affects the
rates of mass accretion and migration for giant planets. We performed 3D
numerical simulations using a grid-based hydrodynamics code. In these
simulations of non-magnetised disks, the dead-zone is treated as a region where
the vertical profile of the viscosity depends on the distance from the
equatorial plane. We consider dead-zones with vertical sizes, H_dz, ranging
from 0 to H_dz=2.3H, where H is the disk scale-height. For all models, the
vertically integrated viscous stress, and the related mass flux through the
disk, have the same value, such that the simulations test the dependence of
planetary mass accretion and migration on the vertical distribution of the
viscous stress. For each model, an embedded 30 earth-masses planet on a fixed
circular orbit is allowed to accrete gas from the disk. Once the planet mass
becomes equal to that of Saturn or Jupiter, we allow the planet orbit to evolve
due to gravitational interaction with the disk. We find that the time scale
over which a protoplanet grows to become a giant planet is essentially
independent of the dead-zone size, and depends only on the total rate at which
the disk viscously supplies material to the planet. For Saturn-mass planets,
the migration rate depends only weakly on the size of the dead-zone for H_dz<
1.5H, but becomes slower when H_dz=2.3H. This effect is due to the desaturation
of corotation torques which originate from residual material in the partial-gap
region. For Jupiter-mass planets, there is a clear tendency for the migration
to proceed more slowly as the size of the dead-zone increases.
