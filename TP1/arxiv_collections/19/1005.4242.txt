A time-resolved spectral analysis for a sample of 22 intense, broad GRB
pulses from the BATSE GRB sample is presented. We fit the spectra with the Band
function and investigate the correlation between the observed flux (F) and the
peak energy (E_p) of the $\nu f_\nu$ spectrum in the rising and decaying phases
of these pulses. Two kinds of E_p evolution trends, i.e., hard-to-soft (the
two-third pulses in our sample) and $E_{\rm p}$-tracing-$F$ (the one-third
pulses in our sample) are observed in pulses from different GRBs and even from
different pulses of the same burst. No dependence of spectral evolution feature
on the pulse shape is found. A tight $F-E_{\rm p}$ positive correlation is
observed in the decaying phases, with a power-law index $\sim 2.2$, which is
much shallower than that expectation of the curvature effect. In the rising
phase, the observed $F$ is either correlated or anti-correlated with $E_{\rm
p}$, depending on the spectral evolution feature, and the power-law index of
the correlation is dramatically different among pulses. More than $80%$ of the
low energy photon indices in the time-resolved spectra whose $E_{\rm p}$ is
anti-correlated with $F$ during the rising phase violate the death line of the
synchrotron radiation, disfavoring the synchrotron radiation model for these
gamma-rays. The $F-E_{\rm p}$ correlation, especially for those GRBs with
$E_{\rm p}$-tracking-$F$ spectral evolution, may be due to the viewing angle
and jet structure effects. In this cenario, the observed $F-E_{\rm p}$
correlation in the rising phase may be due to the line of sight from off-beam
to on-beam toward a structured jet (or jitter), and the decaying phase is
contributed by both the on-beam emission and the decayed photons from high
latitude of the GRB fireball,resulting in a shallower slope of the observed
$F-E_{\rm p}$ correlation than that predicted by the pure curvature effect.
