Is "Gravity" a deformation of "Electromagnetism"? Deformation theory suggests
quantizing Special Relativity: formulate Quantum Information Dynamics
$SL(2,C)_h$-gauge theory of dynamical lattices, with unifying gauge ``group''
the quantum bundle obtained from the Hopf monopole bundle underlying the
quaternionic algebra and Dirac-Weyl spinors. The deformation parameter is the
inverse of light speed 1/c, in duality with Planck's constant h. Then mass and
electric charge form a complex coupling constant (m,q), for which the quantum
determinant of the quantum group $SL(2,C)_h$ expresses the interaction strength
as a linking number 2-form. There is room for both Coulomb constant $k_C$ and
Newton's gravitational constant $G_N$, exponentially weaker then the reciprocal
of the fine structure constant $\alpha$. Thus "Gravity" emerges already
"quantum", in the discrete framework of QID, based on the quantized complex
harmonic oscillator: the quantized qubit. All looks promising, but will the
details backup this "grand design scheme"?
