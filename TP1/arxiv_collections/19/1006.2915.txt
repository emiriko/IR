The tunnel photocurrent between a gold surface and a free-standing
semiconducting thin film excited from the rear by above bandgap light has been
measured as a function of applied bias, tunnel distance and excitation light
power. The results are compared with the predictions of a model which includes
the bias dependence of the tunnel barrier height and the bias-induced decrease
of surface recombination velocity. It is found that i) the tunnel photocurrent
from the conduction band dominates that from surface states. ii) At large
tunnel distance the exponential bias dependence of the current is explained by
that of the tunnel barrier height, while at small distance the change of
surface recombination velocity is dominant.
