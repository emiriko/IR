We investigate possible quantum gravity (QG) effects on the gravitational
deflection of light. Two forms of deformation of the Schwarzschild spacetime
are proposed. The first ansatz is a given Finslerian line element, it could be
regarded as a weak QG effect on the Schwarzschild spacetime. Starting from this
ansatz, we deduce the deflection angle of the light ray which passes a weak
gravitational source. The second ansatz could be regarded as a strong QG effect
on the Schwarzschild spacetime. The deflection angle of the light ray which
passes a weak gravitational source is deduced in this Riemannian spacetime.
This QG effect may distinguish the mixed light rays in the absence of
gravitational source by a "spectroscope" (the gravitational source). The
solutions of gravitational field equation in this Riemannian spacetime indicate
that the QG effect could be regarded as the vacuum energy and the energy
density of vacuum is related to the spacetime deformation parameter.
