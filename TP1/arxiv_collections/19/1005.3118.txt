The Herschel OB young stellar objects survey (HOBYS) has observed the Rosette
molecular cloud, providing an unprecedented view of its star formation
activity. These new far-infrared data reveal a population of compact young
stellar objects whose physical properties we aim to characterise. We compiled a
sample of protostars and their spectral energy distributions that covers the
near-infrared to submillimetre wavelength range. These were used to constrain
key properties in the protostellar evolution, bolometric luminosity, and
envelope mass and to build an evolutionary diagram. Several clusters are
distinguished including the cloud centre, the embedded clusters in the vicinity
of luminous infrared sources, and the interaction region. The analysed
protostellar population in Rosette ranges from 0.1 to about 15 Msun with
luminosities between 1 and 150 Lsun, which extends the evolutionary diagram
from low-mass protostars into the high-mass regime. Some sources lack
counterparts at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths, indicating extreme youth.
The central cluster and the Phelps & Lada 7 cluster appear less evolved than
the remainder of the analysed protostellar population. For the central cluster,
we find indications that about 25% of the protostars classified as Class I from
near- to mid-infrared data are actually candidate Class 0 objects. As a
showcase for protostellar evolution, we analysed four protostars of low- to
intermediate-mass in a single dense core, and they represent different
evolutionary stages from Class 0 to Class I. Their mid- to far-infrared
spectral slopes flatten towards the Class I stage, and the 160 to 70um flux
ratio is greatest for the presumed Class 0 source. This shows that the Herschel
observations characterise the earliest stages of protostellar evolution in
detail.
