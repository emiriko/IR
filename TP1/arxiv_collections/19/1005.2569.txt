We present the first results from the MEG experiment for the search of the
Lepton Flavour Violating decay $\mu^+ \to e^+ \gamma$ . LFV decays are
forbidden in the SM and highly suppressed in any minimal SM extension with tiny
neutrino masses. On the other hand, several SUSY, GUT and ED models beyond the
SM predict the $\mu^+ \to e^+ \gamma$ rate at a level experimentally
accessible. Hence, the MEG experiment will be able either to provide an
incontrovertible evidence of physics beyond the SM or to significantly
constrain the parameter space of SM extensions.
