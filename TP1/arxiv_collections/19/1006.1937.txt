DCM 2010 provides a forum for ideas about new computing means and models,
with a particular emphasis in 2010 on computational and causal models related
to physics and biology. We believe that bringing together different approaches
- in a community with the strong foundational background characteristic of FLoC
- results in inspirational cross-boundary exchanges, and innovative further
research. Day two of this pre-FLoC 2010 workshop is given over to physics and
quantum related computation. The content of day one is more typical of previous
DCM workshops - covering a full spectrum of topics related to the development
of new computational models or new features for traditional computational
models. DCM 2010 was designed to foster interactions, and provide a forum for
presenting new ideas and work in progress. It is also intended to enable
newcomers to learn about current research in this area.
