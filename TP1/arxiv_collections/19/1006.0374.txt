High-statistics measurements of differential cross sections and recoil
polarizations for the reaction $\gamma p \rightarrow K^+ \Sigma^0$ have been
obtained using the CLAS detector at Jefferson Lab. We cover center-of-mass
energies ($\sqrt{s}$) from 1.69 to 2.84 GeV, with an extensive coverage in the
$K^+$ production angle. Independent measurements were made using the
$K^{+}p\pi^{-}$($\gamma$) and $K^{+}p$($\pi^-, \gamma$) final-state topologies,
and were found to exhibit good agreement. Our differential cross sections show
good agreement with earlier CLAS, SAPHIR and LEPS results, while offering
better statistical precision and a 300-MeV increase in $\sqrt{s}$ coverage.
Above $\sqrt{s} \approx 2.5$ GeV, $t$- and $u$-channel Regge scaling behavior
can be seen at forward- and backward-angles, respectively. Our recoil
polarization ($P_\Sigma$) measurements represent a substantial increase in
kinematic coverage and enhanced precision over previous world data. At forward
angles we find that $P_\Sigma$ is of the same magnitude but opposite sign as
$P_\Lambda$, in agreement with the static SU(6) quark model prediction of
$P_\Sigma \approx -P_\Lambda$. This expectation is violated in some mid- and
backward-angle kinematic regimes, where $P_\Sigma$ and $P_\Lambda$ are of
similar magnitudes but also have the same signs. In conjunction with several
other meson photoproduction results recently published by CLAS, the present
data will help constrain the partial wave analyses being performed to search
for missing baryon resonances.
