We use tropical geometry to compute the multidegree and Newton polytope of
the hypersurface of a statistical model with two hidden and four observed
binary random variables, solving an open question stated by Drton, Sturmfels
and Sullivant in "Lectures on Algebraic Statistics" (Problem 7.7). The model is
obtained from the undirected graphical model of the complete bipartite graph
$K_{2,4}$ by marginalizing two of the six binary random variables. We present
algorithms for computing the Newton polytope of its defining equation by
parallel walks along the polytope and its normal fan. In this way we compute
vertices of the polytope. Finally, we also compute and certify its facets by
studying tangent cones of the polytope at the symmetry classes vertices. The
Newton polytope has 17214912 vertices in 44938 symmetry classes and 70646
facets in 246 symmetry classes.
