The entropy of the charged BTZ black hole horizon is described by the
Cardy-Verlinde formula. We then compute the self-gravitational corrections to
the Cardy-Verlinde formula of the charged BTZ black hole in the context of
Keski-Vakkuri, Kraus and Wilczek (KKW) analysis. The self-gravitational
corrections to the entropy as given by the Cardy-Verlinde formula are found to
be positive. This result provides evidence in support of the claim that the
holographic bound is not universal in the framework of two-dimensional gravity
models.
