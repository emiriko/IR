The study of multiple extrasolar planetary systems has the opportunity to
obtain constraints for the planetary masses and orbital inclinations via the
detection of mutual perturbations. The analysis of precise radial velocity
measurements might reveal these planet-planet interactions and yields a more
accurate view of such planetary systems. Like in the generic data modelling
problems, a fit to radial velocity data series has a set of unknown parameters
of which parametric derivatives have to be known by both the regression methods
and the estimations for the uncertainties. In this paper an algorithm is
described that aids the computation of such derivatives in case of when
planetary perturbations are not neglected. The application of the algorithm is
demonstrated on the planetary systems of HD 73526, HD 128311 and HD 155358. In
addition to the functions related to radial velocity analysis, the actual
implementation of the algorithm contains functions that computes spatial
coordinates, velocities and barycentric coordinates for each planet. These
functions aid the joint analysis of multiple transiting planetary systems,
transit timing and/or duration variations or systems where the proper motion of
the host star is also measured involving high precision astrometry. The
practical implementation related to the above mentioned problems features
functions that makethese kind of investigations rather simple and effective.
