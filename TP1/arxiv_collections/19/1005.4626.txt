In the general MSSM, first and second generation squarks and gluinos may be
sufficiently light to be produced and studied at $e^+e^-$ colliders operating
in the 0.5-1 TeV energy range. After a reminder that the MSSM is {\it not} the
same as mSUGRA, we provide a brief overview of these possibilities within this
more general framework
