The quasi-degeneracy of heavier sterile neutrino masses in the Neutrino
Minimal Standard Model ($\nu$MSM) facilitates the production of lepton
asymmetry below the electroweak scale. The first order loop corrections to this
mass-difference has been computed in this work along with a numerical estimate
of the contribution.
