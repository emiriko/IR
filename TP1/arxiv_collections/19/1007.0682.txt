Accretion is a fundamental process in star formation. Although the time
evolution of accretion remains a matter of debate, observations and modelling
studies suggest that episodic outbursts of strong accretion may dominate the
formation of the protostar. Observing young stellar objects during these
elevated accretion states is crucial to understanding the origin of unsteady
accretion. ZCMa is a pre-main-sequence binary system composed of an embedded
Herbig Be star, undergoing photometric outbursts, and a FU Orionis star. The
Herbig Be component recently underwent its largest optical photometric outburst
detected so far. We aim to constrain the origin of this outburst by studying
the emission region of the HI Brackett gamma line, a powerful tracer of
accretion/ejection processes on the AU-scale in young stars. Using the
AMBER/VLTI instrument at spectral resolutions of 1500 and 12 000, we performed
spatially and spectrally resolved interferometric observations of the hot gas
emitting across the Brackett gamma emission line, during and after the
outburst. From the visibilities and differential phases, we derive
characteristic sizes for the Brackett gamma emission and spectro-astrometric
measurements across the line, with respect to the continuum. We find that the
line profile, the astrometric signal, and the visibilities are inconsistent
with the signature of either a Keplerian disk or infall of matter. They are,
instead, evidence of a bipolar wind, maybe partly seen through a disk hole
inside the dust sublimation radius. The disappearance of the Brackett gamma
emission line after the outburst suggests that the outburst is related to a
period of strong mass loss rather than a change of the extinction along the
line of sight. Based on these conclusions, we speculate that the origin of the
outburst is an event of enhanced mass accretion, similar to those occuring in
EX Ors and FU Ors.
