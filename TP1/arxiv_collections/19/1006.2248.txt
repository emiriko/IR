The spherically symmetric Einstein-Vlasov system is considered in
Schwarzschild coordinates and in maximal-isotropic coordinates. An open problem
is the issue of global existence for initial data without size restrictions.
The main purpose of the present work is to propose a method of approach for
general initial data, which improves the regularity of the terms that need to
be estimated compared to previous methods. We prove that global existence holds
outside the centre in both these coordinate systems. In the Schwarzschild case
we improve the bound on the momentum support obtained in \cite{RRS} for compact
initial data. The improvement implies that we can admit non-compact data with
both ingoing and outgoing matter. This extends one of the results in
\cite{AR1}. In particular our method avoids the difficult task of treating the
pointwise matter terms. Furthermore, we show that singularities never form in
Schwarzschild time for ingoing matter as long as $3m\leq r.$ This removes an
additional assumption made in \cite{A1}. Our result in maximal-isotropic
coordinates is analogous to the result in \cite{R1}, but our method is
different and it improves the regularity of the terms that need to be estimated
for proving global existence in general.
