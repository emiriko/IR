Pulsar systems are very good experimental laboratories for the fundamental
physics in extreme environments which cannot be achieved on ground. For
example, the systems are under conditions of high magnetic field strength,
large gravitational potential, and fast rotation, containing highly-ionized hot
plasmas with particle acceleration etc. We can test phenomena related to these
extreme condition in the X-ray to sub-MeV bands. In future, we will get
fantastic capabilities of higher sensitivities, larger effective area, higher
energy resolutions, and X-ray imaging capabilities with wider energy band than
current missions, in addition to opening new eyes of polarization measurements,
and deep all sky monitoring capabilities, with future X-ray missions including
ASTRO-H, eRossita, NuSTAR, GEMS, International X-ray Observatory (IXO) and so
on. In this paper, we summarize current hot topics on pulsars and discuss
expected developments by these future missions, especially by ASTRO-H and IXO,
based on their current design parameters.
