We investigate a multilayer stack of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates in
terms of a simple Gaussian variational ansatz and demonstrate that this
arrangement is characterized by the existence several stationary states. Using
a Hamiltonian picture we show that in an excited stack there is a coupled
motion of the individual condensates by which they exchange energy. We find
that for high excitations the interaction between the single condensates can
induce the collapse of one of them. We furthermore demonstrate that one
collapse in the stack can force other collapses, too. We discuss the
possibility of experimentally observing the coupled motion and the relevance of
the variational results found to full numerical investigations.
