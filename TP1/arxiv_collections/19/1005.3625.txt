This article presents a discussion of the notion of quantum ontological
excess baggage, first proposed by Hardy. It is argued here that this idea does
not have the significance as suggested in his paper. It is shown here that if
this concept is properly analyzed, it fails to pose any threat to the ontic
approaches of quantum theory in general.
