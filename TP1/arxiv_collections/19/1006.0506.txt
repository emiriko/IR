Dynamics of quantized vortex lines in a superfluid feature symmetries
associated with the geometric character of the complex-valued field,
$w(z)=x(z)+iy(z)$, describing the instant shape of the line. Along with a
natural set of Noether's constants of motion, which---apart from their rather
specific expressions in terms of $w(z)$---are nothing but components of the
total linear and angular momenta of the fluid, the geometric symmetry brings
about crucial consequences for kinetics of distortion waves on the vortex
lines---the Kelvin waves. It is the geometric symmetry that renders Kelvin-wave
cascade local in the wavenumber space. Similar considerations apply to other
systems with purely geometric degrees of freedom.
