We construct motivic invariants of a subvariety of an algebraic torus from
its tropicalization and initial degenerations. More specifically, we introduce
an invariant of a compactification of such a variety called the "tropical
motivic nearby fiber." This invariant specializes in the schon case to the
Hodge-Deligne polynomial of the limit mixed Hodge structure of a corresponding
degeneration. We give purely combinatorial expressions for this Hodge-Deligne
polynomial in the cases of schon hypersurfaces and smooth tropical varieties.
We also deduce a formula for the Euler characteristic of a general fiber of the
degeneration.
