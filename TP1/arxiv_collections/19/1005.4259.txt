We first propose a generalization of the notion of Mathieu subspaces of
associative algebras $\mathcal A$, which was introduced recently in [Z4] and
[Z6], to $\mathcal A$-modules $\mathcal M$. The newly introduced notion in a
certain sense also generalizes the notion of submodules. Related with this new
notion, we also introduce the sets $\sigma(N)$ and $\tau(N)$ of stable elements
and quasi-stable elements, respectively, for all $R$-subspaces $N$ of $\mathcal
A$-modules $\mathcal M$, where $R$ is the base ring of $\mathcal A$. We then
prove some general properties of the sets $\sigma(N)$ and $\tau(N)$.
Furthermore, examples from certain modules of the quasi-stable algebras [Z6],
matrix algebras over fields and polynomial algebras are also studied.
