Infalling motions were detected and modeled toward this source. A mean infall
velocity of 0.5 km/s with an infall mass rate of 5x10^-3 Solar masses per year
was obtained. Also, a previously estimated value for the magnetic field
strength in the plane of the sky was refined to be 855 micro Gauss which we
used to calculate a mass-to-magnetic flux ratio of 1.9, or super-critical. The
virial mass from turbulent motions was also calculated finding Mvir=563 solar
masses, which gives a ratio of Msubmm/Mvir=5.9. Both values strongly suggest
that this clump must be in a state of gravitational collapse.
