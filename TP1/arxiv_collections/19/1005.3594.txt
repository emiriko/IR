A phenomenological relationship between oscillations in a sunspot and
quasi-periodic pulsations in flaring energy releases at an active region above
the sunspot, is established. The analysis of the microwave emission recorded by
the Nobeyama Radioheliograph at 17 GHz shows a gradual increase in the power of
the 3-min oscillation train in the sunspot associated with AR 10756 before
flares in this active region. The flaring light curves are found to be bursty
with a period of 3 min. Our analysis of the spatial distribution of the 3-min
oscillation power implies that the oscillations follow from sunspots along
coronal loops towards the flaring site. It is proposed that quasi-periodic
pulsations in the flaring energy releases can be triggered by 3-min slow
magnetoacoustic waves leaking from sunspots.
