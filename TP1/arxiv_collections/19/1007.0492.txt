Elastomers are artificial polymeric materials created for industrial and
commercial applications. Depending on their purpose, they are performing in
different species and structure modifications. Our studies focus on the systems
of elastomers randomly standing-distributed in a smectic $A$ (Sm$A$) liquid
crystal. Basing on the suggestion following from the experiment, that at a
phase transition from Sm$A$ to nematic phase caused by an increase of a
crosslink concentration, such a system survives a percolation transition at low
crossilink concentrations, we propose a modeling explaining this phenomena. We
approve the three-dimensional Villain spin glass model and apply lattice Monte
Carlo (MC) techniques on differential forms on a dual lattice, that is an
alternative of a replica trick, developed for nematic elastomers in the 3D XY
universality. In the results of that we have confirmed a concentration phase
transition of percolation nature at a small crosslink concentration ($\sim$ 10
weight %).
