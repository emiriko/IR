An experimental Environmental Watch System, the so-called Observatorio
Andino-OA (Observatorio Andino), has been implemented in Venezuela, Colombia,
Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Chile over the past two years. The OA is a
collaborative and regional network that aims to monitor several environmental
variables and develop accurate forecasts based on different scientific tools.
Its overall goal is to improve risk assessments, set up Early Warning Systems,
support decision-making processes, and provide easily- and
intuitively-understandable spatial maps to end-users. The initiative works
under the scientific and logistic coordination of the Centro de Modelado
Cient\'ifico (CMC) at Zulia University, Venezuela, and the Centro Internacional
para la Investigaci\'on del Fen\'omeno 'El Ni\~no' (CIIFEN), and is operated at
a local level by the National Weather Services (NWSs) of the aforementioned six
Andean nations. The OA provides several freely-available model outputs
including meteorological and hydrological forecasts, droughts, fire and flood
indices, ecosystems dynamics, climate and health applications, and five-day
high-resolution oceanographic predictions for the Eastern Pacific. This article
briefly describes the current products, methodologies and dynamical and
statistical modeling outputs provided by the OA. Also, a discussion on how
these sets of tools have been put together as a coordinated, scientific watch
and forecast system for each country and for the entire region is presented.
Our experiences over the past two years suggest that this initiative would
significantly improve the current decision-making processes in Andean
countries.
