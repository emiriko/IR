If it is to be true that the history of the universe should be adjusted to
minimize the "imaginary part of action" [arXiv:0802.2991, arXiv:0711.3080,
arXiv:0707.1919, arXiv:hep-ph/0612032, arXiv:hep-th/0509205,
arXiv:hep-th/0701018], it would be "easiest" to have this "imaginary part of
the action" to be rather independent of whether the neutrons are converted to
electrons and protons (and neutrinos), and therefore of whether the
contribution to the imaginary part of the Lagrangian were conserved under this
conversion. Under the further assumption - which is reasonable - that the by
far dominant term in the imaginary part of the Lagrangian density is the one
corresponding to the Higgs mass square term in the Standard Model Lagrangian
density mH**2 |phi(x)|**2 we derive a relation: (down mass square minus up mass
square) = constituent quark mass times electron mass/"ln", where "ln" is
defined by <1/gamma >= "ln"/ < gamma > and is of the order of 1 to 4, where
gamma stands for relativity gamma of a valence quark inside a nucleon. This
relation is very well satisfied with the phenomeno- logically estimated current
algebra quark masses mu, md, and the constituent mass mconstituent for the
light quarks, taken say to be one third of the nucleon mass. Our model has been
criticised on the ground that it should have prevented cosmic rays with
energies capable of producing Higgs particles, when hitting say the atmosphere.
Indeed there is, however, a well known "knee" in the density curve as function
of energy at an order of magnitude for the cosmic ray particle energy close to
the effective threshold for Higgs production. A parameter giving the order of
magnitude of number of Higgsses to be produced in order to get a significant
effect is estimated to be about 300000.
