Motivated by the success of A_4 in explaining neutrino tribimaximal mixing,
and its approximate residual Z_3 symmetry in the quark and charged-lepton
sectors, the notion of "flavor triality" is proposed. Under this hypothesis,
certain processes such as tau+ to mu+mu+e- and tau+ to e+e+mu- are favored, but
tau+ to mu+e+e- and mu+ to e+e+e- are disfavored. Similarly, B0 to tau+e- is
favored, but B0 to tau-e+ is disfavored.
