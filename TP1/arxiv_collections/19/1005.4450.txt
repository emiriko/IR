We propose a non-universal U(1)'_F symmetry combined with the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model. All anomaly cancellation conditions are
satisfied without exotic fields other than three right-handed neutrinos.
Because our model allows all three generations of chiral superfields to have
different U(1)'_F charges, upon the breaking of the U(1)'_F symmetry at a low
scale, realistic masses and mixing angles in both the quark and lepton sectors
are obtained. In our model, neutrinos are predicted to be Dirac fermions and
their mass ordering is of the inverted hierarchy type. The U(1)'_F charges of
the chiral super-fields also naturally suppress the mu term and automatically
forbid baryon number and lepton number violating operators. While all
flavor-changing neutral current constraints in the down quark and charged
lepton sectors can be satisfied, we find that constraint from D0-D0bar turns
out to be much more stringent than the constraints from the precision
electroweak data.
