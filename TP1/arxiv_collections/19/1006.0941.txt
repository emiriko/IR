We prove that the bijective correspondence between the space of bounded
measured laminations $ML_b(\mathbb{H})$ and the universal Teichm\"uller space
$T(\mathbb{H})$ given by $\lambda\mapsto E^{\lambda}|_{S^1}$ is a homeomorphism
for the Fr\'echet topology on $ML_b(\mathbb{H})$ and the Teichm\"uller topology
on $T(\mathbb{H})$, where $E^{\lambda}$ is an earthquake with earthquake
measure $\lambda$. A corollary is that earthquakes with discrete earthquake
measures are dense in $T(\mathbb{H})$. We also establish infinitesimal versions
of the above results.
