In this paper, we compute the natural density of the set of k x n integer
matrices that can be extended to an invertible n x n matrix over the integers.
As a corollary, we find the density of rectangular matrices with Hermite normal
form [O Id]. Connections with Cesaro's Theorem on the density of coprime
integers and Quillen-Suslin's Theorem are also presented.
