In this article we look at the class of positive-energy density wormholes
introduced by Eiroa and Simeone, and ask the question "How close can we come to
building this wormhole with normal, electrically charged matter?" Using a
series expansion, we determine that the stress-energy tensor of the metric can
be made arbitrarily close to that of a charged line-source by taking the
exponent of the radial coordinate to be sufficiently small. We also find terms
in the expansion which resemble QED radiative corrections to the Coulomb field
of an electron.
