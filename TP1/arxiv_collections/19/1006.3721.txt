We discuss how semidefinite programming can be used to determine the
second-order density matrix directly through a variational optimization. We
show how the problem of characterizing a physical or N -representable density
matrix leads to matrix-positivity constraints on the density matrix. We then
formulate this in a standard semidefinite programming form, after which two
interior point methods are discussed to solve the SDP. As an example we show
the results of an application of the method on the isoelectronic series of
Beryllium.
