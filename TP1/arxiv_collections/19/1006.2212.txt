For vibrating systems, a delay in the application of a feedback control can
destroy the stabilizing effect of the control. In this paper we consider a
vibrating string that is fixed at one end and stabilized with a boundary
feedback with delay at the other end. We show that for certain feedback
parameters the system is exponentially stable with constant delays of the form
4L/c, 8L/c, 12L/c ... Moreover, we show that the system is exponentially stable
with piecewise constant delays that attain the values 4L/c and 8L/c.
