In a remarkable paper, T. Koslowski introduced kinematical representations
for loop quantum gravity in which there is a non-degenerate spatial background
metric present. He also considered their properties, and showed that Gauss and
diffeomorphism constraints can be implemented. With the present article, we
streamline and extend his treatment. In particular, we show that the standard
regularization of the geometric operators leads to well defined operators in
the new representations, and we work out their properties fully. We also give
details on the implementation of the constraints. All of this is done in such a
way as to show that the standard representation is a particular (and in some
ways exceptional) case of the more general constructions. This does not mean
that these new representations are as fundamental as the standard one. Rather,
we believe they might be useful to find some form of effective theory of loop
quantum gravity on large scales.
