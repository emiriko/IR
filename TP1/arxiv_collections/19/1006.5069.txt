A mathematical model for the quantitative analysis of cancer immune
interaction, considering the role of antibodies has been proposed in this
paper. The model is based on the clinical evidence, which states that
antibodies can directly kill cancerous cells [1]. The existence of
transcritical and saddle-node bifurcation, which has been proved using
Sotomayor theorem, provides strong biological implications. Through numerical
simulations, it has been illustrated that under certain therapy (like
monoclonal antibody therapy), which is capable of altering the parameters of
the system, cancer-free state can be obtained.
