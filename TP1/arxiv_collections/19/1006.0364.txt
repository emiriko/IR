We report the first quantum frequency downconversion experiment. Using the
difference frequency generation process in a periodically poled lithium niobate
waveguide, we successfully observed the phase-preserved frequency
downconversion of a coherent pulse train with an average photon number per
pulse of $<$1, from the 0.7-$\mu$m visible wavelength band to the 1.3-$\mu$m
telecom band. We expect this technology to become an important tool for
flexible photonic quantum networking, including the realization of quantum
repeater systems over optical fiber using atom-photon entanglement sources for
the visible wavelength bands.
