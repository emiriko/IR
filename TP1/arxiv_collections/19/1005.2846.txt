We discuss the relation between Liouville theory and the Hitchin integrable
system, which can be seen in two ways as a two step process involving
quantization and hyperkaehler rotation. The modular duality of Liouville theory
and the relation between Liouville theory and the SL(2)-WZNW-model give a new
perspective on the geometric Langlands correspondence and on its relation to
conformal field theory.
