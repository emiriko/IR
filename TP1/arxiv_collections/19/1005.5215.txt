In this paper, we investigate the validity of the generalized second law of
thermodynamics of the universe bounded by the event horizon. Here we consider
homogeneous and isotropic model of the universe filled with perfect fluid in
one case and in another case holographic model of the universe has been
considered. In the third case the matter in the universe is taken in the form
of non-interacting two fluid system as holographic dark energy and dust. Here
we study the above cases in the Modified gravity, f(R) gravity.
