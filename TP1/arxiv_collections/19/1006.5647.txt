We propose a practical realization of a field-effect transistor for phonons.
Our device is based on a single ionic polymeric molecule and it gives
modulations as large as -25% in the thermal conductance for feasible
temperatures and electric field magnitudes. Such effect can be achieved by
reversibly switching the acoustic torsion mode into an optical mode through the
coupling of an applied electric field to the dipole moments of the monomers.
This device can pave the way to the future development of phononics at the
nanoscale or molecular scale.
