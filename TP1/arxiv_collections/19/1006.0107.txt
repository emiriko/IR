We report on the effects of quantum interference induced by transmission of
an arbitrary number of optical quantum states through a multiple scattering
medium. We identify the role of quantum interference on the photon correlations
and the degree of continuous variable entanglement between two output modes. It
is shown that the effect of quantum interference survives averaging over all
ensembles of disorder and manifests itself as increased photon correlations
giving rise to photon anti-bunching. Finally, the existence of continuous
variable entanglement correlations in a volume speckle pattern is predicted.
Our results suggest that multiple scattering provides a promising way of
coherently interfering many independent quantum states of light of potential
use in quantum information processing.
