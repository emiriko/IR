We construct a family of McKay quiver representations on the Danilov
resolution of the 1/r(1,a,r - a) singularity. It follows that the resolution is
the normalization of the coherent component of the moduli space of stable McKay
quiver representations for a suitable stability condition. We describe
explicitly the corresponding chamber of stability conditions for any coprime
numbers r, a.
