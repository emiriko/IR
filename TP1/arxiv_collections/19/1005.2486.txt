The X(3872) is studied as an axial-vector charmonium state in the
multichannel framework of the Resonance-Spectrum-Expansion quark-meson model,
previously applied to a variety of other puzzling mesonic resonances. Included
are the open-charm pseudoscalar-vector and vector-vector channels, the most
important of which is the S-wave $\bar{D}^{*0}D^{0}$ + $D^{*0}\bar{D}^{0}$
channel, which practically coincides with the X(3872) structure. The two free
parameters of the model are tuned so as to roughly reproduce the
$\chi_{c1}(3511)$ mass as well as the enhancement just above the
$\bar{D}^{*0}D^{0}$ / $D^{*0}\bar{D}^{0}$ threshold. The present model is able
to describe the shape of the latter data quite well. However, as no dynamical
resonance pole is found, the X(3872) and X(3940) cannot be reproduced
simultaneously, at this stage. A possible further improvement is discussed.
