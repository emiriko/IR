We refine the physical parameters of the transiting hot Jupiter planet XO-1b
and its stellar host XO-1 using HST NICMOS observations. XO-1b has a radius
Rp=1.21+/-0.03 RJup, and XO-1 has a radius Rs=0.94+/-0.02 RSun, where the
uncertainty in the mass of XO-1 dominates the uncertainty of Rp and Rs. There
are no significant differences in the XO-1 system properties between these
broad-band NIR observations and previous determinations based upon ground-based
optical observations. We measure two transit timings from these observations
with 9 s and 15 s precision. As a residual to a linear ephemeris model, there
is a 2.0 sigma timing difference between the two HST visits that are separated
by 3 transit events (11.8 days). These two transit timings and additional
timings from the literature are sufficient to rule out the presence of an Earth
mass planet orbiting in 2:1 mean motion resonance coplanar with XO-1b. We
identify and correct for poorly understood gain-like variations present in
NICMOS time series data. This correction reduces the effective noise in time
series photometry by a factor of two, for the case of XO-1.
