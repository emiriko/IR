We calculate the probability distribution function (PDF) of the expected
annihilation luminosities of dark matter subhalos as a function of subhalo mass
and distance from the Galactic center using a semi-analytical model of halo
evolution. We find that the PDF of luminosities is relatively broad, exhibiting
a spread of as much as an order of magnitude at fixed subhalo mass and
halo-centric distance. The luminosity PDF allows for simple construction of
mock samples of gamma-ray luminous subhalos and assessment of the variance in
among predicted gamma-ray signals from dark matter annihilation. Other
applications include quantifying the variance among the expected luminosities
of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, assessing the level at which dark matter
annihilation can be a contaminant in the expected gamma-ray signal from other
astrophysical sources, as well as estimating the level at which nearby subhalos
can contribute to the antimatter flux.
