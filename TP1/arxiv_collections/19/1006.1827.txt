Attosecond streaking, as a measurement technique, was originally conceived as
a means to characterize attosecond light pulses, which is a good approximation
if the relevant transition matrix elements are approximately constant within
the bandwidth of the light pulse. Our analysis of attosecond streaking
measurements on systems with complex response to the photoionizing pulse
establishes a relation between the momentum-space wave function of the outgoing
electron and the result of conventional retrieval algorithms. This finding
enables the measurement of the quantum phase associated with bound-continuum
transition matrix elements.
