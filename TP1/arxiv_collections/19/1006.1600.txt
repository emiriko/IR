We report a detailed investigation of resistance noise in single layer
graphene films on Si/SiO$_2$ substrates obtained by chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) on copper foils. We find that noise in these systems to be rather large,
and when expressed in the form of phenomenological Hooge equation, it
corresponds to Hooge parameter as large as $0.1 - 0.5$. We also find the
variation in the noise magnitude with the gate voltage (or carrier density) and
temperature to be surprisingly weak, which is also unlike the behavior of noise
in other forms of graphene, in particular those from exfoliation.
