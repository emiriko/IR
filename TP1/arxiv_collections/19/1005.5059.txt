We construct a Madelung fluid model with specific time variable parameters as
dissipative quantum fluid and linearize it in terms of Schrodinger equation
with time dependent parameters. It allows us to find exact solutions of the
nonlinear Madelung system in terms of solutions of the Schrodinger equation and
the corresponding classical linear ODE with variable frequency and damping. For
the complex velocity field the Madelung system takes the form of a nonlinear
complex Schrodinger-Burgers equation, for which we obtain exact solutions using
complex Cole-Hopf transformation. In particular, we discuss and give exact
results for nonlinear Madelung systems related with Caldirola-Kanai type
dissipative harmonic oscillator.
