Non-thermal hard X-ray and high-energy (HE; 1 MeV < E < 100 GeV) gamma-ray
emission in the direction of Eta Carina has been recently detected using the
INTEGRAL, AGILE and Fermi satellites. So far this emission has been interpreted
in the framework of particle acceleration in the colliding wind region between
the two massive stars. However, the existence of a very fast moving blast wave
which originates in the historical 1843 "Great Eruption" provides an
alternative particle acceleration site in this system. Here we explore an
alternate scenario and find that inverse Compton emission from electrons
accelerated in the blast wave can naturally explain both the flux and spectral
shape of the measured hard X-ray and HE gamma-ray emission. This scenario is
further supported by the lack of significant variability in the INTEGRAL and
Fermi measured fluxes.
