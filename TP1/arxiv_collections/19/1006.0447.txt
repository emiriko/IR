We study multigap superconductivity, with strong angular variations of one of
the gaps, as appropriate for certain iron-based high-temperature
superconductors. We solve the gap equations of this model and find that the
nodes or zeroes in the gap function present at Tc - although purely accidental
-- typically survive down to T=0. Based on this result, we investigate the line
of quantum transitions at which gap zeroes first appear. The peculiar
"zero-point" critical scaling emanating from this line dominates quasiparticle
thermodynamics and transport properties over much of the phase diagram, and
supplants more familiar forms of scaling associated with accidental nodes.
