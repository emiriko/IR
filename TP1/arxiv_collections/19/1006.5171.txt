In their calculations based on the Landauer transport equation, Akguc and
Gong [Phys. Rev. B 80, 195408 (2009)] obtained an expression for the heat
conductance of a quantum wire valid in the ballistic regime and in the limit of
vanishing temperature difference between reservoirs. Their result appears to be
different from the one reported in the previous paper of Rego and Kirczenow
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 232 (1998)], which led them to argue that their new
result was the correct one. We show here that, in fact, both results are
correct since different definitions for the dilogarithm function were used in
those papers. Hence, comparisons between these two results should be done with
care.
