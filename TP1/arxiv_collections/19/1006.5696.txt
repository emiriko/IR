We present an extension of the multi-purpose Monte-Carlo event generator
Sherpa for processes in deeply inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering. Hadronic
final states in this kinematical setting are characterised by the presence of
multiple kinematical scales, which were up to now accounted for only by
specific resummations in individual kinematical regions. An extension of a
known method for merging truncated parton showers with higher-order tree-level
matrix elements allows to obtain predictions which are reliable in all
kinematical limits.
