We study theoretically the appearance of quantum correlations in two- and
three-electron scattering in single and double dots. The key role played by
transport resonances into entanglement formation between the single-particle
states is shown. Both reflected and transmitted components of the scattered
particle wavefunction are used to evaluate the quantum correlations between the
incident carrier and the bound particle(s) in the dots. Our investigation
provides a guideline for the analysis of decoherence effects due to the Coulomb
scattering in semiconductor quantum dots structures.
