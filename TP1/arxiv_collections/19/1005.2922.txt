Current spectral simulations of Einstein's equations require writing the
equations in first-order form, potentially introducing instabilities and
inefficiencies. We present a new penalty method for pseudo-spectral evolutions
of second order in space wave equations. The penalties are constructed as
functions of Legendre polynomials and are added to the equations of motion
everywhere, not only on the boundaries. Using energy methods, we prove
semi-discrete stability of the new method for the scalar wave equation in flat
space and show how it can be applied to the scalar wave on a curved background.
Numerical results demonstrating stability and convergence for multi-domain
second-order scalar wave evolutions are also presented. This work provides a
foundation for treating Einstein's equations directly in second-order form by
spectral methods.
