Thermal gravitational waves can be generated in various sources such as, in
the cores of stars, white dwarfs and neutron stars due to the fermion
collisions in the dense degenerate Fermi gas. Such high frequency thermal
gravitational waves can also be produced during the collisions in a gamma ray
burst or during the final stages of the evaporation of primordial black holes.
Here we estimate the thermal gravitational waves from primordial black holes
and estimate the integrated energy of the gravitational wave emission over the
entire volume of the universe and over Hubble time. We also estimate the
gravitational wave flux from gamma ray bursts and jets.
