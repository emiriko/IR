The Bel-Robinson tensor $B_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$ gives a positive definite
gravitational energy in the quasilocal small sphere limit approximation.
However, there is an alternative tensor $V_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$ that was
proposed recently that offers the same positivity as $B_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$
does. We have found that $V_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$ is the unique alternative
tensor with $B_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$ which implies that these two tensors are a
basis for expressions that have the desirable non-negative gravitational energy
in the small sphere limit. In other words, the `energy-momentum' density
according to $B_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$ and $V_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$ are on equal
footing at the same limit.
