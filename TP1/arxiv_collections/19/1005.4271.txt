The continuing process of software systems enlargement in size and complexity
becomes system design extremely important for software production. In this way,
the role of software architecture is significantly important in software
development. It serves as an evaluation and implementation plan for software
development and software evaluation. Consequently, choosing the correct
architecture is a critical issue in software engineering domain.
Moreover,software architecture selection is a multicriteria decision-making
problem in which different goals and objectives must be taken into
consideration. In this paper, more precise and suitable decisions in selection
of architecture styles have been presented by using ANP inference to support
decisions of software architects in order to exploit properties of styles in
the best way to optimize the design of software architecture.
