We study large fluctuations in evolutionary games belonging to the
coordination and anti-coordination classes. The dynamics of these games,
modeling cooperation dilemmas, is characterized by a coexistence fixed point
separating two absorbing states. We are particularly interested in the problem
of fixation that refers to the possibility that a few mutants take over the
entire population. Here, the fixation phenomenon is induced by large
fluctuations and is investigated by a semi-classical WKB
(Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) theory generalized to treat stochastic systems
possessing multiple absorbing states. Importantly, this method allows us to
analyze the combined influence of selection and random fluctuations on the
evolutionary dynamics \textit{beyond} the weak selection limit often considered
in previous works. We accurately compute, including pre-exponential factors,
the probability distribution function in the long-lived coexistence state and
the mean fixation time necessary for a few mutants to take over the entire
population in anti-coordination games, and also the fixation probability in the
coordination class. Our analytical results compare excellently with extensive
numerical simulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our treatment is
superior to the Fokker-Planck approximation when the selection intensity is
finite.
