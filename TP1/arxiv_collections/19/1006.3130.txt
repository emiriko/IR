In this paper we deal with accretion of dark energy in the holographic dark
energy model for a general non-rotating static spherically symmetric black
hole. The mass of the black hole increases or decreases depending on the nature
of the holographic dark energy (quintessence or phantom) as well as on some
integration parameters. It is to be illustrated that the enhancement or
reduction of mass of a black hole is independent of the mass or size of the
black hole itself. Rather it depends only upon the radius of the event horizon
of the universe. Finally, the generalized second law of thermodynamics has been
studied on the event horizon to be assured that the law holds even if when the
black hole mass is decreasing though it is engrossing some mass.
