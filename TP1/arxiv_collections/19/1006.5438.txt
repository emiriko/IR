We show how the perturbation theory results recently obtained by F.Fiamberti,
A.Santambrogio, C.Sieg and D.Zanon for operator anomalous dimensions of
beta-deformed Super-Yang-Mills theory can be reproduced from the AdS5/CFT4
Y-system proposed by N.G., V.Kazakov and P.Vieira. To do this, we obtain the
general twisted asymptotic solution of this Y-system of functional equations.
We show that existence of an additional parameter beta in the deformed theory
allows to extract rich information about the perturbation theory integrals
directly from Y-system. Using this method we found a simple generating function
for a broad class of such integrals.
