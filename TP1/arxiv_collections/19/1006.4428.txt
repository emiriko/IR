We numerically study the phase diagram of a three-state host-parasite model
on the square lattice motivated by population biology. The model is an
extension of the contact process, and the three states correspond to an empty
site, a host, and a parasite. We determine the phase diagram of the model by
scaling analysis. In agreement with previous results, three phases are
identified: the phase in which both hosts and parasites are extinct (S_{0}),
the phase in which hosts survive but parasites are extinct (S_{01}), and the
phase in which both hosts and parasites survive (S_{012}). We argue that both
the S_{0}-S_{01} and S_{01}-S_{012} boundaries belong to the directed
percolation class. In this model, it has been suggested that an excessively
large reproduction rate of parasites paradoxically extinguishes hosts and
parasites and results in S_{0}. We show that this paradoxical extinction is a
finite size effect; the corresponding parameter region is likely to disappear
in the limit of infinite system size.
