In this Letter we report the LDA+DMFT (method combining Local Density
Approximation with Dynamical Mean-Field Theory) results for magnetic properties
of parent superconductor LaFeAsO in paramagnetic phase. Calculated uniform
magnetic susceptibility shows linear dependence at intermediate temperatures in
agreement with experimental data. For high temperatures ($>$1000 K)
calculations show saturation and then susceptibility decreases with
temperature. Contributions to temperature dependence of the uniform
susceptibility are strongly orbitally dependent. It is related to the form of
the orbitally-resolved spectral functions near the Fermi energy with strong
temperature dependent narrow peaks for some of the orbitals. Our results
demonstrate that linear-temperature dependence of static magnetic
susceptibility in pnictide superconductors can be reproduced without invoking
antiferromagnetic fluctuations.
