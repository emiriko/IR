Supernova remnant (SNR) RX J0852.0-4622 is one of the youngest and is most
likely the closest among known galactic supernova remnants (SNRs). It was
detected in X-rays, the 44Ti gamma-line, and radio. We obtain and analyze
medium-resolution spectra of 14 stars in the direction towards the SNR RX
J0852.0-4622 in an attempt to detect broad absorption lines of unshocked ejecta
against background stars. Spectral synthesis is performed for all the stars in
the wavelength range of 3740-4020AA to extract the broad absorption lines of Ca
II related to the SNR RX J0852.0-4622. We do not detect any broad absorption
line and place a 3-sigma upper limit on the relative depths of <0.04 for the
broad Ca II absorption produced by the SNR. We detect narrow low and high
velocity absorption components of Ca II. High velocity |V(LSR)|=100-140 km/s
components are attributed to radiative shocks in clouds engulfed by the old
Vela SNR. The upper limit to the absorption line strength combined with the
width and flux of the 44Ti gamma-ray line 1.16 MeV lead us to conclude that SNR
RX J0852.0-4622 was probably produced by an energetic SN Ic explosion.
