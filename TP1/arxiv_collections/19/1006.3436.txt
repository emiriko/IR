In the present paper we study properties of roots of characteristic
polynomials for the linear recurrent formulae (LRF) that govern time series. We
also investigate how the values of these roots affect Singular Spectrum
Analysis implications, in what concerns separation of components, SSA
forecasting and related signal parameter estimation methods. The roots of the
characteristic polynomial for an LRF comprise the signal roots, which determine
the structure of the time series, and extraneous roots. We show how the
separability of two time series can be characterized in terms of their signal
roots. All possible cases of exact separability are enumerated. We also examine
properties of extraneous roots of the LRF used in SSA forecasting algorithms,
which is equivalent to the Min-Norm vector in subspace-based estimation
methods. We apply recent theoretical results for orthogonal polynomials on the
unit circle, which enable us to precisely describe the asymptotic distribution
of extraneous roots relative to the position of the signal roots.
