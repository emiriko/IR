We investigate some of the experimental, observational and theoretical
consequences of hypothetical stable black holes in the mass range between the
electro-weak scale and the Planck mass, 2.4$\times 10^{15}$ TeV. For the
purpose of calculations we use Lovelock black holes in odd dimensions. If such
black holes exist they contribute to dark matter. We show that the passage of
the black holes through matter and the collision of black holes have a well
defined experimental signature. Depending on their cross section and energy
they also accumulate in stars and influence their development.
