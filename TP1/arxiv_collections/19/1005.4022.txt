This research paper is proposing the idea of pseudo code representation to
molecular programming used in designing molecular electronics devices. Already
the schematic representation of logical gates like AND, OR, NOT etc.from
molecular diodes or resonant tunneling diode are available. This paper is
setting a generic pseudo code model so that various logic gates can be
formulated. These molecular diodes have designed from organic molecules or
Bio-molecules. Our focus is on to give a scenario of molecular computation
through molecular programming. We have restricted our study to molecular
rectifying diode and logic device as AND gate from organic molecules only.
