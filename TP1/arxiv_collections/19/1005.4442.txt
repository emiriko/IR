We investigate isometric immersions of disks with constant negative curvature
into $\mathbb{R}^3$, and the minimizers for the bending energy, i.e. the $L^2$
norm of the principal curvatures over the class of $W^{2,2}$ isometric
immersions. We show the existence of smooth immersions of arbitrarily large
geodesic balls in $\mathbb{H}^2$ into $\mathbb{R}^3$. In elucidating the
connection between these immersions and the non-existence/singularity results
of Hilbert and Amsler, we obtain a lower bound for the $L^\infty$ norm of the
principal curvatures for such smooth isometric immersions. We also construct
piecewise smooth isometric immersions that have a periodic profile, are
globally $W^{2,2}$, and have a lower bending energy than their smooth
counterparts. The number of periods in these configurations is set by the
condition that the principal curvatures of the surface remain finite and grows
approximately exponentially with the radius of the disc. We discuss the
implications of our results on recent experiments on the mechanics of
non-Euclidean plates.
