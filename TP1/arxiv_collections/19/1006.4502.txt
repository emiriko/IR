A probability measure preserving action of \Gamma on (X,\mu) is called rigid
if the inclusion of L^\infty(X) into the crossed product L^\infty(X) \rtimes
\Gamma has the relative property (T) in the sense of Popa. We give examples of
rigid, free, probability measure preserving actions that are ergodic but not
strongly ergodic. The same examples show that rigid actions may admit non-rigid
quotients.
