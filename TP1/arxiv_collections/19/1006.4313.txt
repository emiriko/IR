This paper presents mechanical R&D for the CALICE Silicon-tungsten
electromagnetic calorimeter. After the physics ECAL prototype, tested in 2006
(DESY-CERN), 2007 (CERN), 2008 (FNAL) and before the design of different
"modules 0" (barrel and endcap) for a final detector, a technological ECAL
prototype, called the EUDET module, is under design in order to have a close to
full scale technological solution which could be used for the final detector,
taking into account future industrialisation of production.
