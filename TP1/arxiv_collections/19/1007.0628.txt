In this paper we present a technique for fusion of optical and thermal face
images based on image pixel fusion approach. Out of several factors, which
affect face recognition performance in case of visual images, illumination
changes are a significant factor that needs to be addressed. Thermal images are
better in handling illumination conditions but not very consistent in capturing
texture details of the faces. Other factors like sunglasses, beard, moustache
etc also play active role in adding complicacies to the recognition process.
Fusion of thermal and visual images is a solution to overcome the drawbacks
present in the individual thermal and visual face images. Here fused images are
projected into an eigenspace and the projected images are classified using a
radial basis function (RBF) neural network and also by a multi-layer perceptron
(MLP). In the experiments Object Tracking and Classification Beyond Visible
Spectrum (OTCBVS) database benchmark for thermal and visual face images have
been used. Comparison of experimental results show that the proposed approach
performs significantly well in recognizing face images with a success rate of
96% and 95.07% for RBF Neural Network and MLP respectively.
