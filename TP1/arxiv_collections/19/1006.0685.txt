We analyze the time-series data for the onset of A(H1N1)v influenza pandemic
in India during the period June 1- September 30, 2009. Using a variety of
statistical fitting procedures, we obtain a robust estimate of the exponential
growth rate $\langle \lambda \rangle \simeq 0.15$. This corresponds to a basic
reproductive number $R_0 \simeq 1.45$ for influenza A(H1N1)v in India, a value
which lies towards the lower end of the range of values reported for different
countries affected by the pandemic.
