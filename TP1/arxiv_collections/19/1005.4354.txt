Graphene is a truly two-dimensional atomic crystal with exceptional
electronic and mechanical properties. Whereas conventional bulk and thin-film
materials have been studied extensively, the key mechanical properties of
graphene, such as tearing and cracking, remain unknown, partly due to its
two-dimensional nature and ultimate single-atom-layer thickness, which result
in the breakdown of conventional material models. By combining first-principles
ReaxFF molecular dynamics and experimental studies, a bottom-up investigation
of the tearing of graphene sheets from adhesive substrates is reported,
including the observation of the formation of tapered graphene nanoribbons.
Through a careful analysis of the underlying molecular rupture mechanisms, it
is shown that the resulting nanoribbon geometry is controlled by both the
graphene-substrate adhesion energy and by the number of torn graphene layers.
By considering graphene as a model material for a broader class of
two-dimensional atomic crystals, these results provide fundamental insights
into the tearing and cracking mechanisms of highly confined nanomaterials.
