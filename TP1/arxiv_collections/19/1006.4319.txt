The adjoint Fourier restriction inequality of Tomas and Stein states that the
mapping $f\mapsto \widehat{f\sigma}$ is bounded from $\lt(S^2)$ to
$L^4(\reals^3)$. We prove that there exist functions which extremize this
inequality, and that any extremizing sequence of nonnegative functions has a
subsequence which converges to an extremizer.
