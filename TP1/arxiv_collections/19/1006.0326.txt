We consider the quantum dynamics of a single particle in the plane under the
influence of a constant perpendicular magnetic and a crossed electric potential
field. For a class of smooth and small potentials we construct a non-trivial
invariant of motion. Do to so we proof that the Hamiltonian is unitarily
equivalent to an effective Hamiltonian which commutes with the observable of
kinetic energy.
