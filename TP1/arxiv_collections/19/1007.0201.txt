In this paper we present two new procedures for automatic detection and
picking of P-wave arrivals. The first involves the application of kurtosis and
skewness on the vector magnitude of three component seismograms. Customarily,
P-wave arrival detection techniques use vertical component seismogram which is
appropriate only for teleseismic events. The inherent weakness of those methods
stems from the fact that the energy from P-wave is distributed among horizontal
and vertical recording channels. Our procedure, however, uses the vector
magnitude which accommodates all components. The results show that this
procedure would be useful for detecting/picking of P-arrivals from local and
regional earthquakes and man-made explosions. The second procedure introduces a
new method called "Ratios in Higher Order Statistics (RHOS)." Unlike commonly
used techniques that involve derivatives, this technique employs ratios of
adjacent kurtosis and skewness values to improve the accuracy of the detection
of the P onset. RHOS can be applied independently on vertical component
seismogram as well as the vector magnitude for improved detection of P-wave
arrivals.
