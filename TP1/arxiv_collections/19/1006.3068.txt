We present results of X-ray observations of a sample of 15 clusters selected
via their imprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. These clusters are a subset of the first
SZ-selected cluster catalog, obtained from observations of 178 deg^2 of sky
surveyed by the South Pole Telescope. Using X-ray observations with Chandra and
XMM-Newton, we estimate the temperature, T_X, and mass, M_g, of the
intracluster medium (ICM) within r_500 for each cluster. From these, we
calculate Y_X=M_g T_X and estimate the total cluster mass using a M_500-Y_X
scaling relation measured from previous X-ray studies. The integrated
Comptonization, Y_SZ, is derived from the SZ measurements, using additional
information from the X-ray measured gas density profiles and a universal
temperature profile. We calculate scaling relations between the X-ray and SZ
observables, and find results generally consistent with other measurements and
the expectations from simple self-similar behavior. Specifically, we fit a
Y_SZ-Y_X relation and find a normalization of 0.82 +- 0.07, marginally
consistent with the predicted ratio of Y_SZ/Y_X=0.91+-0.01 that would be
expected from the density and temperature models used in this work. Using the
Y_X derived mass estimates, we fit a Y_SZ-M_500 relation and find a slope
consistent with the self-similar expectation of Y_SZ ~ M^5/3 with a
normalization consistent with predictions from other X-ray studies. We compare
the X-ray mass estimates to previously published SZ mass estimates derived from
cosmological simulations of the SPT survey. We find that the SZ mass estimates
are lower by a factor of 0.89+-0.06, which is within the ~15% systematic
uncertainty quoted for the simulation-based SZ masses.
