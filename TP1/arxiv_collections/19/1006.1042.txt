An efficient and economical scheme is proposed for the perfect quantum
teleportation of n-qubit non-maximally entangled state of generalized
Bell-type. A Bell state is used as the quantum channel in the proposed scheme.
It is also shown that the controlled teleportation of this n-qubit state can be
achieved by using a GHZ state or a GHZ-like state as quantum channel. The
proposed schemes are economical because for the perfect and controlled
teleportation of n-qubit non-maximally entangled state of generalized Bell-type
we only need a Bell state and a tripartite entangled state respectively. It is
also established that there exists a family of 12 orthogonal tripartite
GHZ-like states which can be used as quantum channel for controlled
teleportation. The proposed protocols are critically compared with the existing
protocols.
