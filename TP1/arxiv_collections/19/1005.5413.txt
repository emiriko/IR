We prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether two points in a polygonal
domain with holes can be connected by a wire. This implies that finding any
approximation to the shortest path for a long snake amidst polygonal obstacles
is NP-hard. On the positive side, we show that snake's problem is
"length-tractable": if the snake is "fat", i.e., its length/width ratio is
small, the shortest path can be computed in polynomial time.
