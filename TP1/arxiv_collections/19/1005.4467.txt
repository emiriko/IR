We investigate dynamical tunneling in many dimensional systems using a
quasi-periodically modulated kicked rotor, and find that the tunneling rate
from the torus to the chaotic region is drastically enhanced when the chaotic
states become delocalized as a result of the Anderson transition. This result
strongly suggests that amphibious states, which were discovered for a
one-dimensional kicked rotor with transporting islands [L. Hufnagel et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 154101 (2002)], quite commonly appear in many dimensional
systems.
