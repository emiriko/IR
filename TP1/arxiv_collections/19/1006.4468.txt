We study the spectrum of tensor perturbations on extremal BTZ black holes in
topologically massive gravity for arbitrary values of the coefficient of the
Chern-Simons term, $\mu$. Imposing proper boundary conditions at the boundary
of the space and at the horizon, we find that the spectrum contains
quasi-normal modes.
