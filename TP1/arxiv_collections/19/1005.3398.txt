We present multi-wavelength observations of the helium-dominated accreting
binary KL Dra which has an orbital period of 25 mins. Our ground-based optical
monitoring programme using the Liverpool Telescope has revealed KL Dra to show
frequent outbursts. Although our coverage is not uniform, our observations are
consistent with the outbursts recurring on a timescale of ~60 days.
Observations made using Swift show that the outbursts occur with a similar
amplitude at both UV and optical energies and a duration of 2 weeks. Although
KL Dra is a weak X-ray source we find no significant evidence that the X-ray
flux varies over the course of an outburst cycle. We can reproduce the main
features of the 60 day outburst cycle using the Disc Instability Model and a
helium-dominated accretion flow. Although the outbursts of KL Dra are very
similar to those of the hydrogen accreting dwarf novae, we cannot exclude that
they are the AM CVn equivalent of WZ Sge type outbursts. With outbursts
occurring every ~2 months, KL Dra is an excellent target to study
helium-dominated accretion flows in general.
