The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has detected the gamma-ray glow emanating
from the giant radio lobes of the radio galaxy Centaurus A. The resolved
gamma-ray image shows the lobes clearly separated from the central active
source. In contrast to all other active galaxies detected so far in high-energy
gamma-rays, the lobe flux constitutes a considerable portion (>1/2) of the
total source emission. The gamma-ray emission from the lobes is interpreted as
inverse Compton scattered relic radiation from the cosmic microwave background
(CMB), with additional contribution at higher energies from the
infrared-to-optical extragalactic background light (EBL). These measurements
provide gamma-ray constraints on the magnetic field and particle energy content
in radio galaxy lobes, and a promising method to probe the cosmic relic photon
fields.
