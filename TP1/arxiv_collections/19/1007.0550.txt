We consider a network of N noisy bistable elements with global time-delayed
couplings. In a two-state description, where elements are represented by Ising
spins, the collective dynamics is described by an infinite hierarchy of coupled
master equations which was solved at the mean-field level in the thermodynamic
limit. For a finite number of elements, an analytical description was deemed so
far intractable and numerical studies seemed to be necessary. In this paper we
consider the case of two interacting elements and show that a partial
analytical description of the stationary state is possible if the stochastic
process is time-symmetric. This requires some relationship between the
transition rates to be satisfied.
