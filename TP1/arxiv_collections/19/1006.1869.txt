Under favourable conditions, many proteins can assemble into macroscopically
large aggregate's, Parkinson's and other neurological and systemic diseases.
The overall process of protein aggregation is characterized by initial lag time
during which no detectable aggregation occurs in the solution and by maximal
aggregation rate at which the dissolved protein converts into aggregates. In
this study, the correlation between the lag time and the maximal rate of
protein aggregation is analyzed. It is found that the product of these two
quantities depends on a single numerical parameter, the kinetic index of the
curve quantifying the time evolution of the fraction of protein aggregated. As
this index depends relatively little on the conditions and/or system studied,
our finding provides insight into why for many experiments the values of the
product of the lag time and the maximal aggregation rate are often equal or
quite close to each other. It is shown how the kinetic index is related to a
basic kinetic parameter of a recently proposed theory of protein aggregation.
