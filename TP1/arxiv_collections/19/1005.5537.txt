It is shown that two classes of racetrack inflation models, saddle point and
inflection point ones, can be constructed in a fully supersymmetric framework
with the matter field F-term as a source of supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking and
uplifting. Two models of F-term SUSY breaking are considered: the Polonyi model
and the quantum corrected O'Raifeartaigh model. In the former case, both
classes of racetrack inflation models differ significantly from the
corresponding models with non-SUSY uplifting. The main difference is a quite
strong dominance of the inflaton by the matter field. In addition, fine-tuning
of the parameters is relaxed as compared to the original racetrack models. In
the case of the racetrack inflation models coupled to the O'Raifeartaigh model,
the matter field is approximately decoupled from the inflationary dynamics.
