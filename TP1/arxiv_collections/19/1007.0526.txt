We consider a particular type of matrices which belong at the same time to
the class of Hessenberg and Toeplitz matrices, and whose determinants are equal
to the number of a type of compositions of natural numbers.
  We prove a formula in which the number of weak compositions with a fixed
number of zeroes is expressed in terms of the number of compositions without
zeroes. Then we find a relationship between weak compositions and coefficients
of characteristic polynomials of appropriate matrices.
  Finally, we prove three explicit formulas for weak compositions of a special
kind.
