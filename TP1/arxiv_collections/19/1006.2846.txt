We investigate the transport properties of
La$_{1.8-x}$Eu$_{0.2}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ ($x=0.04$, 0.08, 0.125, 0.15, 0.2) with a
special focus on the Nernst effect in the normal state. Various anomalous
features are present in the data. For $x=0.125$ and 0.15 a kink-like anomaly is
present in the vicinity of the onset of charge stripe order in the LTT phase,
suggestive of enhanced positive quasiparticle Nernst response in the stripe
ordered phase. At higher temperature, all doping levels except $x=0.2$ exhibit
a further kink anomaly in the LTO phase which cannot unambiguously be related
to stripe order. Moreover, a direct comparison between the Nernst coefficients
of stripe ordering La$_{1.8-x}$Eu$_{0.2}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and superconducting
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ at the doping levels $x=0.125$ and $x=0.15$ reveals
only weak differences. Our findings make high demands on any scenario
interpreting the Nernst response in hole-doped cuprates.
