The magnetically induced Richtmyer-Meshkov instability in a two-component
Bose-Einstein condensate is investigated. We construct and study analytical
models describing the development of the instability at both the linear and
nonlinear stages. The models indicate new features of the instability: the
influence of quantum capillary waves and the separation of droplets, which are
qualitatively different from the classical case. We perform numerical
simulations of the instability in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate using the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation and compare the simulation results to the model
predictions.
