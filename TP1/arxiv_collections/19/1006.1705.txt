We investigate effects of aspherical energy deposition in core-collapse
supernovae on the light curve of the supernova shock breakout. We performed
two-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations of an aspherical supernova
explosion to obtain the time when a shock wave generated in the stellar
interior reaches the stellar surface in each radial direction. Using results of
the calculations, light curves during the shock breakout are derived in an
approximate way. We show that the light curve during the shock breakout can be
a strong indicator of aspherical properties of core-collapse supernovae.
