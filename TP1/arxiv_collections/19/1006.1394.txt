We analyze the entanglement degradation provoked by the Hawking effect in a
bipartite system Alice-Rob when Rob is in the proximities of a Schwarzschild
black hole while Alice is free falling into it. We will obtain the limit in
which the tools imported from the Unruh entanglement degradation phenomenon can
be used properly, keeping control on the approximation. As a result, we will be
able to determine the degree of entanglement as a function of the distance of
Rob to the event horizon, the mass of the black hole, and the frequency of
Rob's entangled modes. By means of this analysis we will show that all the
interesting phenomena occur in the vicinity of the event horizon and that the
presence of event horizons do not effectively degrade the entanglement when Rob
is far off the black hole. The universality of the phenomenon is presented:
There are not fundamental differences for different masses when working in the
natural unit system adapted to each black hole. We also discuss some aspects of
the localization of Alice and Rob states. All this study is done without using
the single mode approximation.
