We introduce an all-electrical measurement technique, which makes it possible
to prepare and detect the ground and excited many-particle states in
self-assembled InAs QDs at 4K. This way, the pure-electron spectra of
QD-hydrogen, -helium and -lithium are resolved. Comparison with detailed
many-body calculations enables us to identify the different charge
configurations and in particular detect the singlet and triplet spin states of
QD helium. Furthermore, the time-resolved evolution of the density of states
from non-equilibrium to equilibrium charge occupation is shown.
