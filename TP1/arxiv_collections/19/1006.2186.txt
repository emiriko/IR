The Woods-Saxon-Strutinsky method (the microscopic-macroscopic method)
combined with Kruppa's prescription for positive energy levels, which is
necessary to treat neutron rich nuclei, is studied to clarify the reason for
its success and to propose improvements for its shortcomings. The reason why
the plateau condition is met for the Nilsson model but not for the Woods-Saxon
model is understood in a new interpretation of the Strutinsky smoothing
procedure as a low-pass filter. Essential features of Kruppa's level density is
extracted in terms of the Thomas-Fermi approximation modified to describe
spectra obtained from diagonalization in truncated oscillator bases. A method
is proposed which weakens the dependence on the smoothing width by applying the
Strutinsky smoothing only to the deviations from a reference level density. The
BCS equations are modified for the Kruppa's spectrum, which is necessary to
treat the pairing correlation properly in the presence of continuum. The
potential depth is adjusted for the consistency between the microscopic and
macroscopic Fermi energies. It is shown, with these improvements, that the
microscopic-macroscopic method is now capable to reliably calculate binding
energies of nuclei far from stability.
