Max-stable random sketches can be computed efficiently on fast streaming
positive data sets by using only sequential access to the data. They can be
used to answer point and Lp-norm queries for the signal. There is an intriguing
connection between the so-called p-stable (or sum-stable) and the max-stable
sketches. Rigorous performance guarantees through error-probability estimates
are derived and the algorithmic implementation is discussed.
