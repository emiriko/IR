The onset of antiferromagnetic order in URu2Si2 has been studied via neutron
diffraction in a helium pressure medium, which most closely approximates
hydrostatic conditions. The antiferromagnetic critical pressure is 0.80 GPa,
considerably higher than values previously reported. Complementary electrical
resistivity measurements imply that the hidden order-antiferromagnetic
bicritical point far exceeds 1.02 GPa. Moreover, the redefined
pressure-temperature phase diagram suggests that the superconducting and
antiferromagnetic phase boundaries actually meet at a common critical pressure
at zero temperature.
