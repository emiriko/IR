We present long-slit spectroscopy, continuum and [OIII]5007 imaging data
obtained with the Very Large Telescope and the Gran Telescopio Canarias of the
type 2 quasar SDSS J0123+00 at z=0.399. The quasar lies in a complex, gas-rich
environment. It appears to be physically connected by a tidal bridge to another
galaxy at a projected distance of ~100 kpc, which suggests this is an
interacting system. Ionized gas is detected to a distance of at least ~133 kpc
from the nucleus. The nebula has a total extension of ~180 kpc. This is one of
the largest ionized nebulae ever detected associated with an active galaxy.
Based on the environmental properties, we propose that the origin of the nebula
is tidal debris from a galactic encounter, which could as well be the
triggering mechanism of the nuclear activity. SDSS J0123+00 demonstrates that
giant, luminous ionized nebulae can exist associated with type 2 quasars of low
radio luminosities, contrary to expectations based on type 1 quasar studies.
