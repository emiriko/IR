In an effort to simultaneously study the gas and dust components of the disc
surrounding the young Herbig Ae star HD 169142, we present far-IR observations
obtained with the PACS instrument onboard the Herschel Space Observatory. This
work is part of the Open Time Key Project GASPS, which is aimed at studying the
evolution of protoplanetary discs. To constrain the gas properties in the outer
disc, we observed the star at several key gas-lines, including [OI] 63.2 and
145.5 micron, [CII] 157.7 micron, CO 72.8 and 90.2 micron, and o-H2O 78.7 and
179.5 micron. We only detect the [OI] 63.2 micron line in our spectra, and
derive upper limits for the other lines. We complement our data set with PACS
photometry and 12/13CO data obtained with the Submillimeter Array. Furthermore,
we derive accurate stellar parameters from optical spectra and UV to mm
photometry. We model the dust continuum with the 3D radiative transfer code
MCFOST and use this model as an input to analyse the gas lines with the
thermo-chemical code ProDiMo. Our dataset is consistent with a simple model in
which the gas and dust are well-mixed in a disc with a continuous structure
between 20 and 200 AU, but this is not a unique solution. Our modelling effort
allows us to constrain the gas-to-dust mass ratio as well as the relative
abundance of the PAHs in the disc by simultaneously fitting the lines of
several species that originate in different regions. Our results are
inconsistent with a gas-poor disc with a large UV excess; a gas mass of 5.0 +/-
2.0 times 10^(-3) Msun is still present in this disc, in agreement with earlier
CO observations.
