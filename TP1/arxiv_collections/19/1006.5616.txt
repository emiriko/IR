Critical properties of lattice gases with nearest-neighbor exclusion are
investigated via the adaptive-window Wang-Landau algorithm on the square and
simple cubic lattices, for which the model is known to exhibit an Ising-like
phase transition. We study the particle density, order parameter,
compressibility, Binder cumulant and susceptibility. Our results show that it
is possible to estimate critical exponents using Wang-Landau sampling with
adaptive windows. Finite-size-scaling analysis leads to results in fair
agreement with exact values (in two dimensions) and numerical estimates (in
three dimensions).
