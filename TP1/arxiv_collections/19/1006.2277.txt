All the current r-process scenarios relevant to core-collapse supernovae are
facing severe difficulties. In particular, recent core-collapse simulations
with neutrino transport show no sign of a neutron-rich wind from the
proto-neutron star. In this paper, we discuss nucleosynthesis of the r-process
in an alternative astrophysical site, "black hole winds", which are the
neutrino-driven outflow from the accretion torus around a black hole. This
condition is assumed to be realized in double neutron star mergers, neutron
star - black hole mergers, or hypernovae.
