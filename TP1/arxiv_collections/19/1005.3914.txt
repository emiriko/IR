We construct a non-equilibrium steady state and calculate the corresponding
current for a mesoscopic Fermi system in the partition-free setting. To this
end we study a small sample coupled to a finite number of semi-infinite leads.
Initially, the whole system of quasi-free fermions is in a grand canonical
equilibrium state. At t = 0 we turn on a potential bias on the leads and let
the system evolve. We study how the charge current behaves in time and how it
stabilizes itself around a steady state value, which is given by a
Landauer-type formula.
