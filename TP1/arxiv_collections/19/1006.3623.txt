The scintillator-strip electromagnetic calorimeter (ScECAL) is one of the
calorimeter technic for the ILC. To achieve the fine granularity from the
strip-segmented layers the strips in odd layers are orthogonal with respect to
those in the even layers. In order to extract the best performance from such
detector concept, a special reconstruction method and simulation tools are
being developed in ILD collaboration. This manuscript repots the status of
developing of those tools.
