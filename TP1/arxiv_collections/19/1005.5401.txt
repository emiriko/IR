We construct an example of a spherically symmetric black hole interior in
which there is NO (spherically symmetric) marginally trapped tube asymptotic to
the event horizon. The construction uses a self-gravitating massive scalar
field matter model, and the key condition we impose is that the scalar field
$\phi$ be bounded below by a positive constant along the event horizon.
