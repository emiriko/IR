We present an experimental observation of non-linear up- and down-converted
optical luminescence of graphene and thin graphite subject to picosecond
infrared laser pulses. We show that the excitation yields to a high density
electron-hole plasma in graphene. It is further shown that the excited charge
carries can efficiently exchange energy due to scattering in momentum space.
The recombination of the resulting non-equilibrium electron-hole pairs yields
to the observed white light luminescence. Due to the scattering mechanism the
power dependence of the luminescence is quadratic until it saturates for higher
laser power. Studying the luminescence intensity as a function of layer
thickness gives further insight into its nature and provides a new tool for
substrate independent thickness determination of multilayer flakes.
