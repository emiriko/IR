We investigate theoretically the interaction of dark solitons in materials
with a spatially nonlocal nonlinearity. In particular we do this analytically
and for arbitrary degree of nonlocality. We employ the variational technique to
show that nonlocality induces an attractive force in the otherwise repulsive
soliton interaction.
