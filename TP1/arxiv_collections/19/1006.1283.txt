Quantum walks, both discrete (coined) and continuous time, form the basis of
several quantum algorithms and have been used to model processes such as
transport in spin chains and quantum chemistry. The enhanced spreading and
mixing properties of quantum walks compared with their classical counterparts
have been well-studied on regular structures and also shown to be sensitive to
defects and imperfections in the lattice. As a simple example of a disordered
system, we consider percolation lattices, in which edges or sites are randomly
missing, interrupting the progress of the quantum walk. We use numerical
simulation to study the properties of coined quantum walks on these percolation
lattices in one and two dimensions. In one dimension (the line) we introduce a
simple notion of quantum tunneling and determine how this affects the
properties of the quantum walk as it spreads. On two-dimensional percolation
lattices, we show how the spreading rate varies from linear in the number of
steps down to zero, as the percolation probability decreases to the critical
point. This provides an example of fractional scaling in quantum walk dynamics.
