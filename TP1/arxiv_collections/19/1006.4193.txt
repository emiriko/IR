We discuss results of the most accurate to-date test of the low-energy
electroweak sector of the standard model of elementary particles. Combining
previous measurements with our high-precision calculations we extracted the
weak charge of the 133Cs nucleus, Q_W = -73.16(29)_exp (20)_th [S.G. Porsev, K.
Beloy, and A. Derevianko, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 102}, 181601 (2009)]. The
result is in perfect agreement with Q_W^{SM} predicted by the standard model,
Q_W^{SM} =-73.16(3), and confirms energy-dependence (or running) of the
electroweak interaction and places constraints on a variety of new physics
scenarios beyond the standard model. In particular, we increase the lower limit
on the masses of extra Z-bosons predicted by models of grand unification and
string theories. This paper provides additional details to the Letter. We
discuss large-scale calculations in the framework of the coupled-cluster
method, including full treatment of single, double, and valence triple
excitations. To determine the accuracy of the calculations we computed
energies, electric-dipole amplitudes, and hyperfine-structure constants. An
extensive comparison with high-accuracy experimental data was carried out.
