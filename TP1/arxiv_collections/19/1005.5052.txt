The redshifts and luminosities of Type 1A supernovae are conventionally
fitted with the current paradigm, which holds that the galaxies are locally
stationary in an expanding metric. The fit fails unless the expansion is
accelerating; driven perhaps by "dark energy". Is the recession of the galaxies
slowed down by gravity or speeded up by some repulsive force? To shed light on
this question the redshifts and apparent magnitudes of type 1A supernovae are
re-analysed in a cartesian frame of reference omitting gravitational effects.
The redshift is ascribed to the relativistic Doppler effect which gives the
recession velocity when the light was emitted; if this has not changed, the
distance reached and the luminosity follow immediately. This simple concept
fits the observations surprisingly well. It appears that the galaxies recede at
unchanging velocities, so on the largest scale there is no significant
intergalactic force. Reasons for the apparent absence of an intergalactic force
are discussed. There is no gravity out there and no dark energy.
