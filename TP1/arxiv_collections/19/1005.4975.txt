Behavior Driven Development (NORTH, 2006) is a specification technique that
is growing in acceptance in the Agile methods communities. BDD allows to
securely verify that all functional requirements were treated properly by
source code, by connecting the textual description of these requirements to
tests.
  On the other side, the Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) researchers and
practitioners defends the use of Business Process Modeling (BPM) to, before
defining any part of the system, perform the modeling of the system's
underlying business process. Therefore, it can be stated that, in the case of
EIS, functional requirements are obtained by identifying Use Cases from the
business process models.
  The aim of this paper is, in a narrower perspective, to propose the use of
Finite State Machines (FSM) to model business process and then connect them to
the BDD machinery, thus driving better quality for EIS. In a broader
perspective, this article aims to provoke a discussion on the mapping of the
various BPM notations, since there isn't a real standard for business process
modeling (Moller et al., 2007), to BDD.
  Firstly a historical perspective of the evolution of previous proposals from
which this one emerged will be presented, and then the reasons to change from
Model Driven Development (MDD) to BDD will be presented also in a historical
perspective. Finally the proposal of using FSM, specifically by using UML
Statechart diagrams, will be presented, followed by some conclusions.
