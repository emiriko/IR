We apply the Schr\"odinger factorization to construct the ladder operators
for hydrogen atom, Mie-type potential, harmonic oscillator and pseudo-harmonic
oscillator in arbitrary dimensions. By generalizing these operators we show
that the dynamical algebra for these problems is the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra.
