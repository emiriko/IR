The problem of electron resonant and non-resonant scatterings on two
magnetized barriers is studied in the one-dimension. The transfer-matrix is
built up to exactly calculate the coefficient of the electron transmittance
through the system of two magnetic barriers with non-collinear magnetizations.
The polarization of the transmitted electron wave for resonance and
non-resonance transmittances is calculated. The transmittance coefficient and
spin polarization can be drastically enhanced and controlled by the angle
between the barrier magnetizations
