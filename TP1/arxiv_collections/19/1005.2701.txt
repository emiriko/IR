Dendronized polymers consist of an elastic backbone with a set of iterated
branch structures (dendrimers)attached at every base point of the backbone. The
conformations of such molecules depend on the elastic deformation of the
backbone and the branches, as well as on nonlocal (e.g., electrostatic, or
Lennard-Jones) interactions between the elementary molecular units comprising
the dendrimers and/or backbone. We develop a geometrically exact theory for the
dynamics of such polymers, taking into account both local (elastic) and
nonlocal interactions. The theory is based on applying symmetry reduction of
Hamilton's principle for a Lagrangian defined on the tangent bundle of iterated
semidirect products of the rotation groups that represent the relative
orientations of the dendritic branches of the polymer. The resulting
symmetry-reduced equations of motion are written in conservative form.
