We theoretically study the dynamic screening properties of bilayer graphene
within the random phase approximation assuming quadratic band dispersion and
zero gap for the single-particle spectrum. We calculate the frequency dependent
dielectric function of the system and obtain the low energy plasmon dispersion
and broadening of the plasmon modes from the dielectric function. We also
calculate the optical spectral weight (i.e. the dynamical structure factor) for
the system. We find that the leading order long wavelength limit of the plasmon
dispersion matches with the classical result for 2D electron gas. However,
contrary to electron gas systems, the non-local plasmon dispersion corrections
decrease the plasmon frequency. The non-local corrections are also different
from the single layer graphene. Finally, we also compare our results with the
double layer graphene system (i.e. a system of two independent graphene
monolayers).
