We present the broad-band 0.6-150 keV Suzaku and Swift BAT spectra of the low
luminosity Seyfert galaxy, NGC 7213. The time-averaged continuum emission is
well fitted by a single powerlaw of photon index Gamma = 1.75 and from
consideration of the Fermi flux limit we constrain the high energy cutoff to be
350 keV < E < 25 MeV. Line emission from both near-neutral iron K_alpha at 6.39
keV and highly ionised iron, from Fe_(xxv) and Fe_(xxvi), is strongly detected
in the Suzaku spectrum, further confirming the results of previous observations
with Chandra and XMM-Newton. We find the centroid energies for the Fe_(xxv) and
Fe_(xxvi) emission to be 6.60 keV and 6.95 keV respectively, with the latter
appearing to be resolved in the Suzaku spectrum. We show that the Fe_(xxv) and
Fe_(xxvi) emission can result from a highly photo-ionised plasma of column
density N_(H) ~ 3 x 10^(23) cm^(-2). A Compton reflection component, e.g.,
originating from an optically-thick accretion disc or a Compton-thick torus,
appears either very weak or absent in this AGN, subtending < 1 sr to the X-ray
source, consistent with previous findings. Indeed the absence of either neutral
or ionised Compton reflection coupled with the lack of any relativistic Fe K
signatures in the spectrum suggests that an inner, optically-thick accretion
disc is absent in this source. Instead, the accretion disc could be truncated
with the inner regions perhaps replaced by a Compton-thin Radiatively
Inefficient Accretion Flow. Thus, the Fe_(xxv) and Fe_(xxvi) emission could
both originate in ionised material perhaps at the transition region between the
hot, inner flow and the cold, truncated accretion disc on the order of 10^(3) -
10^(4) gravitational radii from the black hole. The origin for the unresolved
neutral Fe K_alpha emission is then likely to be further out, perhaps
originating in the optical BLR or a Compton-thin pc-scale torus.
