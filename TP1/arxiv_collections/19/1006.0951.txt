Along with compacting baryon (neutron) spacing in a neutron star (NS), two
very important factors come into play side by side: the lack of the NS
gravitational self-stabilization against shutting to black hole (BH) and the
phase transition - color deconfinement and QCD-vacuum reconstruction - within
the nuclear matter the NS is composed of. That is why both phenomena should be
taken into account at once, as the gravitational collapse is considered. Since,
under the above transition, the hadronic-phase (HPh) vacuum (filled up with
gluon- and chiral $q\bar q$-condensates) turns into the "empty" (perturbation)
subhadronic-phase (SHPh) one and, thus, the formerly (very high) pressure falls
down rather abruptly, the formerly cold nuclear medium starts imploding almost
freely into the new vacuum. If the star mass is sufficiently large, then this
implosion is shown to result in an enormous heating - up to the temperature
about 100 MeV or, may be, even higher - and growth of the inner pressure due to
degeneracy breaking and multiple $q\bar q$-pair production which withstands the
gravitational compression (remind that the highest temperatures of supernovae
bursts, as well as of the "normal" NS, are, at least, of one order lower). As a
consequence, a "flaming wall" is, most probably, emerged on the way of further
collapsing which prevents the NS to evolve towards the BH horizon appearance.
At the same time, it could give rise to the most powerful GRBs produced by some
very distant (young) stars.
