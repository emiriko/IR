We derive a quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) on the error of estimating a
time-changing signal. The QCRB provides a fundamental limit to the performance
of general quantum sensors, such as gravitational-wave detectors, force
sensors, and atomic magnetometers. We apply the QCRB to the problem of force
estimation via continuous monitoring of the position of a harmonic oscillator,
in which case the QCRB takes the form of a spectral uncertainty principle. The
bound on the force-estimation error can be achieved by implementing quantum
noise cancellation in the experimental setup and applying smoothing to the
observations.
