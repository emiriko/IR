Measurements of the differential conductance spectra of YBa2Cu3O7-SrRuO3 and
YBa2Cu3O7-La0.67Ca_0.33MnO3 ramp-type junctions along the node and anti-node
directions are reported. The results are consistent with a crossed Andreev
reflection effect only in YBa2Cu3O7-SrRuO3 junctions where the domain wall
width of SrRuO3 is comparable with the coherence length of YBa2Cu3O7. No such
effect was observed in the YBa2Cu3O7-La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 junctions, which is in
line with the much larger (x10) domain wall width of La0.67Ca0.33MnO3. We also
show that crossed Andreev exists only in the anti-node direction. Furthermore,
we find evidence that crossed Andreev in YBa2Cu3O7 junctions is not sensitive
to nm-scale interface defects, suggesting that the length scale of the crossed
Andreev effect is larger than the coherence length, but still smaller than the
La0.67Ca0.33MnO3's domain wall width.
