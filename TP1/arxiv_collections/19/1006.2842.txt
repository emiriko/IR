A four index notation (e.g. (10-11) is often used to denote reciprocal
lattice vectors or crystal faces of hexagonal crystals. The purposes of this
notation have never been fully explained. This note clarifies the underlying
mathematics of a symmetric overcomplete basis. This simplifies and improves the
usefulness of the notation.
