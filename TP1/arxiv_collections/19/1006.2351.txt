Structural features of newly found perovskite-based iron pnictide oxide
system have been systematically studied. Compared to REFePnO system,
perovskite-based system tend to have lower Pn-Fe-Pn angle and higher pnictogen
height owing to low electronegativity of alkaline earth metal and small
repulsive force between pnictogen and oxygen atoms. As-Fe-As angles of
(Fe2As2)(Sr4Cr2O6), (Fe2As2)(Sr4V2O6) and (Fe2Pn2)(Sr4MgTiO6) are close to
ideal tetrahedron and those pnictogen heights of about 1.40 A are close to
NdFeAsO with optimized carrier concentration. These structural features of this
system may leads to realization of high Tc superconductivity.
