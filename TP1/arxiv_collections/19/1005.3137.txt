About two dozen exo-solar debris systems have been spatially resolved. These
debris discs commonly display a variety of structural features such as clumps,
rings, belts, eccentric distributions and spiral patterns. In most cases, these
features are believed to be formed, shaped and maintained by the dynamical
influence of planets orbiting the host stars. In very few cases has the
presence of the dynamically important planet(s) been inferred from direct
observation. The solar-type star q1 Eri is known to be surrounded by debris,
extended on scales of < 30''. The star is known to host at least one planet,
albeit on an orbit far too small to make it responsible for structures at
distances of tens to hundreds of AU. The aim of the present investigation is
twofold: to determine the optical and material properties of the debris and to
infer the spatial distribution of the dust, which may hint at the presence of
additional planets. The photodetector array camera and spectrometer (PACS)
aboard the Herschel Space Observatory allows imaging observations in the far
infrared at unprecedented resolution, i.e. at better than 6'' to 12'' over the
wavelength range of 60 {\mu}m to 210 {\mu}m. Together with the results from
ground-based observations, these spatially resolved data can be modelled to
determine the nature of the debris and its evolution more reliably than would
be possible from unresolved data alone. For the first time has the q1 Eri disc
been resolved at far infrared wavelengths. The PACS observations at 70, 100 and
160 {\mu}m reveal an oval image showing a disc-like structure in all bands, the
size of which increases with wavelength. Assuming a circular shape yields the
inclination of its equatorial plane with respect to that of the sky, i > 53deg.
The results of image de-convolution indicate that i likely is larger than
63deg, where 90deg corresponds to an edge-on disc. {abridged}
