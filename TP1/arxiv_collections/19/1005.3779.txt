Inspired by F. Wilczek's QCD Lite, quantum Yang-Mills-Weyl Dynamics (YMWD)
describes quantum interaction between gauge bosons (associated with a simple
compact gauge Lie group $\mathbb{G}$) and larks (massless chiral fields colored
by an irreducible unitary representation of $\mathbb{G}$). Schroedinger
representation of this quantum Yang-Mills-Weyl theory is based on a
sesqui-holomorphic operator calculus of infinite-dimensional operators with
variational derivatives.
  The spectrum of the quantum YMWD, with initial data in the central euclidean
ball of a radius $0<R<+\infty$, is self-similar in the inverse proportion to
$R$. The spectrum is a sequence of eigenvalues convergent to $+\infty$. The
eigenvalues have finite multiplicities with respect to a von Neumann algebra
with a regular trace.
  The same holds for the quantum self-interaction of vector Yang-Mills bosons
(Theorem 4.1). Furthermore, the fundamental vacuum eigenvalue is a simple zero
(Appendix A). Presumably, this is a solution of the existence problem for a
quantum Yang-Mills theory that implies a positive spectral mass gap.
  The rigorous mathematical theory is non-perturbative with a running coupling
constant as the only ad hoc parameter. The application of the first
mathematical principles depends essentially on the properties of the compact
simple Lie group $\mathbb{G}$.
