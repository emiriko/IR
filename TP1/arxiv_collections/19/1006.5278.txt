Recommender systems apply data mining techniques and prediction algorithms to
predict users' interest on information, products and services among the
tremendous amount of available items. The vast growth of information on the
Internet as well as number of visitors to websites add some key challenges to
recommender systems. These are: producing accurate recommendation, handling
many recommendations efficiently and coping with the vast growth of number of
participants in the system. Therefore, new recommender system technologies are
needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations even for huge data
sets.
  To address these issues we have explored several collaborative filtering
techniques such as the item based approach, which identify relationship between
items and indirectly compute recommendations for users based on these
relationships. The user based approach was also studied, it identifies
relationships between users of similar tastes and computes recommendations
based on these relationships.
  In this paper, we introduce the topic of recommender system. It provides ways
to evaluate efficiency, scalability and accuracy of recommender system. The
paper also analyzes different algorithms of user based and item based
techniques for recommendation generation. Moreover, a simple experiment was
conducted using a data mining application -Weka- to apply data mining
algorithms to recommender system. We conclude by proposing our approach that
might enhance the quality of recommender systems.
