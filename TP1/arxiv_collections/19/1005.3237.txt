In this paper we will argue that the superposition of waves can be calculated
and taught in a simple way. We show, using the Gauss's method to sum an
arithmetic sequence, how we can construct the superposition of waves - with
different frequencies - in a simple conceptual way that it is easy to teach. By
this method we arrive to the usual result where we can express the
superposition of waves as the product of factors, one of them with a cosine
funtion where the argument is the average frequency. Most important, we will
show that the superposition of waves with sligthly different frequencies
produces a \emph{phase modulation} thogether with an amplitude moldulation. It
is important to emphasize this result because, to the best of our knowledge,
almost all textbooks only mention that there is an amplitude modulation.
