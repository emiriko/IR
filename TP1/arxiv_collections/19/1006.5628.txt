The infrared behaviour of a non-mean field spin-glass system is analysed, and
the critical exponent related to the divergence of the correlation length is
computed at two loops within the epsilon-expansion technique with two
independent methods. Both methods yield the same result confirming that the
infrared behaviour of the theory if well-defined and the underlying ideas of
the Renormalization Group hold also in such non-mean field disordered model. By
pushing such calculation to high orders in epsilon, a consistent and predictive
non-mean field theory for such disordered system could be established.
