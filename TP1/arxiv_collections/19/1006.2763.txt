We present and discuss five candidate exoplanetary systems identified with
the Kepler spacecraft. These five systems show transits from multiple exoplanet
candidates. Should these objects prove to be planetary in nature, then these
five systems open new opportunities for the field of exoplanets and provide new
insights into the formation and dynamical evolution of planetary systems. We
discuss the methods used to identify multiple transiting objects from the
Kepler photometry as well as the false-positive rejection methods that have
been applied to these data. One system shows transits from three distinct
objects while the remaining four systems show transits from two objects. Three
systems have planet candidates that are near mean motion
commensurabilities---two near 2:1 and one just outside 5:2. We discuss the
implications that multitransiting systems have on the distribution of orbital
inclinations in planetary systems, and hence their dynamical histories; as well
as their likely masses and chemical compositions. A Monte Carlo study indicates
that, with additional data, most of these systems should exhibit detectable
transit timing variations (TTV) due to gravitational interactions---though none
are apparent in these data. We also discuss new challenges that arise in TTV
analyses due to the presence of more than two planets in a system.
