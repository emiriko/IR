I present results for the resummation of soft and collinear gluon
contributions to QCD hard-scattering cross sections at two loops. This requires
the calculation of UV and IR divergences through two loops and the construction
of soft anomalous dimensions that control resummation at NNLL. Explicit results
are provided for processes that involve massless and/or massive quarks,
including single top and top pair production.
