The analysis of the data on measurements of the neutron lifetime is
presented. A new most accurate result of the measurement of neutron lifetime
[Phys. Lett. B 605 (2005) 72] 878.5 +/- 0.8 s differs from the world average
value [Phys. Lett. B 667 (2008) 1] 885.7 +/- 0.8 s by 6.5 standard deviations.
In this connection the analysis and Monte Carlo simulation of experiments
[Phys. Lett. B 483 (2000) 15] and [Phys. Rev. Lett. 63 (1989) 593] is carried
out. Systematic errors of about -6 s are found in each of the experiments. The
summary table for the neutron lifetime measurements after corrections and
additions is given. A new world average value for the neutron lifetime 879.9
+/- 0.9 s is presented.
