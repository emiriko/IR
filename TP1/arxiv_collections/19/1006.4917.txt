The main goal of this paper is to give an alternative interpretation of
space-like and time-like extra dimensions as a primary factor for inflation in
the early universe. We introduce the 5-dimensional perfect fluid and compare
the energy-momentum tensor for the bulk scalar field with space-like and
time-like extra dimensions. It is shown, that additional dimensions can imply
to negative pressure in the slow roll regime in the early higher-dimensional
world.
