We report strong heavy hole-light mixing in GaAs quantum dots grown by
droplet epitaxy. Using the neutral and charged exciton emission as a monitor we
observe the direct consequence of quantum dot symmetry reduction in this strain
free system. By fitting the polar diagram of the emission with simple
analytical expressions obtained from k$\cdot$p theory we are able to extract
the mixing that arises from the heavy-light hole coupling due to the
geometrical asymmetry of the quantum dot.
