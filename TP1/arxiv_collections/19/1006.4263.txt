Let H be a closed subgroup of a locally compact group G and let X=G/H be the
quotient space of left cosets. Let C*X be the corresponding G-C*-algebra of
continuous functions on X, vanishing at infinity. Suppose that L is a closed
abelian subgroup of H and let f be a 2-cocycle on the dual group of L. Let G(f)
be the Rieffel deformation of G. Using these data we may construct
G(f)-C*-algebra C*X(f) - the Rieffel deformation of C*X. On the other hand we
may perform the Rieffel deformation of the subgroup H obtaining the closed
quantum subgroup H(f) of G(f) which in turn, by the results of Vaes, leads to
the G(f)-C*-algebra G(f)/H(f). In this paper we show that G(f)/H(f) and C*X(f)
are isomorphic G(f)-C*-algebras. We also consider the case where L is a
subgroup of G but not of H, for which we cannot construct the subgroup H(f).
Then C*X(f) cannot be identified with a quantum quotient. What may be shown is
that it is a G(f)-simple object in the category of G(f)-C*-algebras.
