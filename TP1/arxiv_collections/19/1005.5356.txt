Aims. We determine the physical properties (spin state and shape) of asteroid
(21) Lutetia, target of the ESA Rosetta mission, to help in preparing for
observations during the flyby on 2010 July 10 by predicting the orientation of
Lutetia as seen from Rosetta.
  Methods. We use our novel KOALA inversion algorithm to determine the physical
properties of asteroids from a combination of optical lightcurves,
disk-resolved images, and stellar occultations, although the latter are not
available for (21) Lutetia.
  Results. We find the spin axis of (21) Lutetia to lie within 5 degrees of
({\lambda} = 52 deg., {\beta} = -6 deg.) in Ecliptic J2000 reference frame
(equatorial {\alpha} = 52 deg., {\delta} = +12 deg.), and determine an improved
sidereal period of 8.168 270 \pm 0.000 001 h. This pole solution implies the
southern hemisphere of Lutetia will be in "seasonal" shadow at the time of the
flyby. The apparent cross-section of Lutetia is triangular as seen "pole-on"
and more rectangular as seen "equator-on". The best-fit model suggests the
presence of several concavities. The largest of these is close to the north
pole and may be associated with large impacts.
