Preliminary test results on microscope investigation and BESIII-type RPC
aging performance have revealed interesting aging phenomena that had not been
seen before in Linseed oil coated Italian-type RPC. We report here on the aging
performance of BESIII-type and its variant RPC, and on microscopic surface
characterization of BESIII-type Bakelite electrodes.
