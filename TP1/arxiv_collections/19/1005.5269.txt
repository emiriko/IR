Let $A$ and $A'$ be two circular annuli and let $\rho$ be a radial metric
defined in the annulus $A'$. Consider the class $\mathcal H_\rho$ of
$\rho-$harmonic mappings between $A$ and $A'$. It is proved recently by
Iwaniec, Kovalev and Onninen that, if $\rho=1$ (i.e. if $\rho$ is Euclidean
metric) then $\mathcal H_\rho$ is not empty if and only if there holds the
Nitsche condition (and thus is proved the J. C. C. Nitsche conjecture). In this
paper we formulate an condition (which we call $\rho-$Nitsche conjecture) with
corresponds to $\mathcal H_\rho$ and define $\rho-$Nitsche harmonic maps. We
determine the extremal mappings with smallest mean distortion for mappings of
annuli w.r. to the metric $\rho$. As a corollary, we find that $\rho-$Nitsche
harmonic maps are Dirichlet minimizers among all homeomorphisms $h:A\to A'$.
However, outside the $\rho$-Nitsche condition of the modulus of the annuli,
within the class of homeomorphisms, no such energy minimizers exist. % However,
%outside the $\rho-$Nitsche range of the modulus of the annuli, %within the
class of homeomorphisms, no such energy minimizers exist. This extends some
recent results of Astala, Iwaniec and Martin (ARMA, 2010) where it is
considered the case $\rho=1$ and $\rho=1/|z|$.
