The analysis and simulation of transmit and receive pulse shaping filter is
an important aspect of digital wireless communication since it has a direct
effect on error probabilities. Pulse shaping for wireless communication over
time as well as frequency selective channels is the need of hour for 3G and 4G
systems. The pulse shaping filter is a useful means to shape the signal
spectrum and avoid interferences. Basically digital filters are used to modify
the characteristics of signal in time and frequency domain and have been
recognized as primary digital signal processing operations.
