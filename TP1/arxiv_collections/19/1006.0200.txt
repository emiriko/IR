In order to appreciate how well off we mathematicians and scientists are
today, with extremely fast hardware and lots and lots of memory, as well as
with powerful software, both for numeric and symbolic computation, it may be a
good idea to go back to the early days of electronic computers and compare how
things went then. We have chosen, as a case study, a problem that was
considered a huge challenge at the time. Namely, we looked at C.L. Pekeris's
seminal 1958 work on the ground state energies of two-electron atoms. We went
through all the computations ab initio with today's software and hardware, with
a special emphasis on the symbolic computations which in 1958 had to be made by
hand, and which nowadays can be automated and generalized.
