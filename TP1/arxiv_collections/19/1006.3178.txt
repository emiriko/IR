The existence of an l=1 avoided crossing in the spectrum of the solar-like
pulsator CoRoT-target HD 49385 was established by Deheuvels & Michel (2009). It
is the first confirmed detection of such a phenomenon. The authors showed in a
preliminary modeling of the star that it was in a post main sequence status.
Being a 1.3 Msun-star, HD 49385 has had a convective core during its main
sequence phase. The mu-gradient left by the withdrawal of this core bears
information about the processes of transport at the boundary of the core. We
here investigate the constraints that the observed avoided crossing brings on
the mu-gradient in the core of the star.
