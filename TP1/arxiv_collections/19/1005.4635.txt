We have studied the measurement accuracy of the forward-backward asymmetry of
the $e^+e^- \rightarrow t\bar{t}$ process in the 6-jet mode at $\sqrt{s} = 500$
GeV with the ILD detector. In the analysis the vertex charges of b-jets were
used to distinguish t from $\bar{t}$ in each event. The distribution of the
cosine of the reconstructed polar angle of so identified t or $\bar{t}$ showed
a clear forward-backward asymmetry. After the correction for charge
misidentification the forward-backward asymmetry was determined to be $A^t_{FB}
= 0.334 \pm 0.0079$ for 500 fb$^{-1}$ with the beam polarization combination of
$P(e^+, e^-) = (+30\%, -80\%)$, demonstrating a very good statistical accuracy
($\sim 2\%$) even in the 6-jet mode.
