This is a write-up of a lecture at the level of a physics colloquium. There
exists an idealized mathematical formulation of strong interactions which has
no free parameters but is known to describe the real world quite accurately.
Over the last three decades the problem has been managed with increasing
success. An overview of some facts and a little fiction will be presented, but
the question whether the problem can now be considered "easy" will be left
unanswered.
