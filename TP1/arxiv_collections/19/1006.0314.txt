We report an update to our previous measurement of the CKM element $|V_{ub}|$
using exclusive $B \rightarrow \pi \ell \nu$ decays. In the charm sector we
have performed a measurement of $f_{Ds}$ using $D_s\rightarrow\tau^+\nu_{\tau}$
decays, we have measured the mixing parameter $y_{CP}$ using the lifetime ratio
$\frac{\langle\tau_{K\pi}\rangle}{\langle\tau_{hh}\rangle}$ in $D^0$ decays,
and we have also searched for CP violation using T-odd correlations in $D^0$
decays to $K^+K^-\pi^+\pi^-$. Finally, in the tau sector we have performed a
search for the lepton flavor violating decays $\tau^\pm \rightarrow e^\pm
\gamma$ and $\tau^\pm \rightarrow \mu^\pm \gamma$.
