We report the detection of a time variable OVII line emission in a deep 100
ks Suzaku X-ray Imaging Spectrometer spectrum of the Galactic Ridge X-ray
emission. The observed line intensity is too strong (11+/-2 line unit or photon
cm^-2 s^-1 str^-1) to be emitted inside the heavily obscured Galactic disk. It
showed a factor of two time variation which shows a significant (~4 sigma)
correlation with the solar wind O^7+ ion flux. The high line intensity and the
good time correlation with the solar wind strongly suggests that it originated
from geocoronal solar wind charge exchange emission. We discuss the X-ray line
intensity considering a line of sight direction and also theoretical
distribution models of the neutral hydrogen and solar wind around the Earth.
Our results indicate that X-ray observationsof geocoronal solar wind charge
exchange emission can be used to constrain these models.
