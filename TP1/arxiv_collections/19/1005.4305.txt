In light cone gauge, a gauge link at light cone infinity is necessary for
transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution to restore the gauge
invariance in some specific boundary conditions. We derive such transverse
gauge link in a more regular and general method. We find the gauge link at
light cone infinity naturally arises from the contribution of the pinched
poles: one is from the quark propagator and the other is hidden in the gauge
vector field in light cone gauge. Actually, in the amplitude level, we have
obtained a more general gauge link over the hypersurface at light cone infinity
which is beyond the transverse direction. The difference of such gauge link
between semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan processes can
also be obtained directly and clearly in our derivation.
