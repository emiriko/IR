Directed transport in ratchets is determined by symmetry-breaking in a system
out of equilibrium. A hallmark of rocking ratchets is current reversals: an
increase in the rocking force changes the direction of the current. In this
work for a bi-harmonically driven spatially symmetric rocking ratchet we show
that a class of current reversal is precisely determined by symmetry-breaking,
thus creating a link between dynamical and symmetry-breaking mechanisms.
