Aims. Our aim is to confirm the interstellar detection of cyanic acid, HOCN,
in the Galactic center clouds. It has previously been tentatively detected only
in Sgr B2(OH).
  Methods. We used a complete line survey of the hot cores Sgr B2(N) and (M) in
the 3 mm range, complemented by additional observations carried out with the
IRAM 30 m telescope at selected frequencies in the 2 mm band and towards four
additional positions in the Sgr B2 cloud complex in the 2 and 3 mm bands. The
spectral survey was analysed in the local thermodynamical equilibrium
approximation (LTE) by modeling the emission of all identified molecules
simultaneously. This allowed us to distinguish weak features of HOCN from the
rich line spectrum observed in Sgr B2(N) and (M). Lines of the more stable (by
1.1 eV) isomer isocyanic acid, HNCO, in these sources, as well as those of HOCN
and HNCO towards the other positions, were analysed in the LTE approximation as
well.
  Results. Four transitions of HOCN were detected in a quiescent molecular
cloud in the Galactic center at a position offset in (R.A., decl.) by
(20'',100'') from the hot core source Sgr B2(M), confirming its previous
tentative interstellar detection. Up to four transitions were detected toward
five other positions in the Sgr B2 complex, including the hot cores Sgr B2(M),
(S), and (N). A fairly constant abundance ratio of ~ 0.3 - 0.8 % for HOCN
relative to HNCO was derived for the extended gas components, suggesting a
common formation process of these isomers.
