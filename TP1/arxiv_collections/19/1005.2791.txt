We survey a few concentration inequalities for submodular and fractionally
subadditive functions of independent random variables, implied by the entropy
method for self-bounding functions. The power of these concentration bounds is
that they are dimension-free, in particular implying standard deviation
O(\sqrt{\E[f]}) rather than O(\sqrt{n}) which can be obtained for any
1-Lipschitz function of n variables.
