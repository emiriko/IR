We use high spatial and spectral resolution observations obtained with the
CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope to analyze
the velocity profile of granular light bridges in a sunspot. We find upflows
associated with the central dark lanes of the light bridges. From bisectors in
the Fe I 630.15 nm line we find that the magnitude of the upflows varies with
height with the strongest upflows being deeper in the atmosphere. Typical
upflow velocities measured from the 70% bisector are around 500 m/s with peaks
above 1 km/s. The upflows in the central dark lane are surrounded by downflows
of weaker magnitude, sometimes concentrated in patches with enhanced velocities
reaching up to 1.1 km/s. A small spatial offset between the upflows and the
continuum dark lane is interpreted as a line-of-sight effect due to the
elevated nature of the dark lane and the light bridge above the umbral
surroundings. Our observations show that the central dark lane in granular
light bridges is not equivalent to the intergranular lanes of normal
photospheric granulation that host convective downflows. These results support
recent MHD simulations of magneto-convection in sunspot atmospheres.
