Observations from the Kepler satellite were recently published for three
bright G-type stars, which were monitored during the first 33.5d of science
operations. One of these stars, KIC 11026764, exhibits a characteristic pattern
of oscillation frequencies suggesting that the star has evolved significantly.
We have derived initial estimates of the properties of KIC 11026764 from the
oscillation frequencies observed by Kepler, combined with ground-based
spectroscopic data. We present preliminary results from detailed modeling of
this star, employing a variety of independent codes and analyses that attempt
to match the asteroseismic and spectroscopic constraints simultaneously.
