We use a recent sample of 49 galaxies to show that there is a proportionality
relation between the black hole mass M_BH and the quantity \mu =M_G*\sigma /c,
where M_G is mass of the spheroidal stellar component and \sigma is the stellar
velocity dispersion. \mu is called the momentum parameter and the ratio is
M_BH/\mu ~3.3. This result is applied to the penetrating-jet feedback model
which argues that the correlation that holds is with a momentum-like parameter,
although this feedback mechanism is based on energy balance.
