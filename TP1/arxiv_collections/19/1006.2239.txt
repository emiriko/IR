We propose a three terminal spin polarized stm setup for probing the helical
nature of the Luttinger liquid edge state that appears in the quantum spin Hall
system. We show that the three-terminal tunneling conductance strongly depends
on the angle ($\theta$) between the magnetization direction of the tip and the
local orientation of the electron spin on the edge while the two terminal
conductance is independent of this angle. We demonstrate that chiral injection
of an electron into the helical Luttinger liquid (which occurs when $\theta$ is
zero or $\pi$) is associated with fractionalization of the spin of the injected
electron in addition to the fractionalization of its charge. We also point out
a spin current amplification effect induced by the spin fractionalization.
