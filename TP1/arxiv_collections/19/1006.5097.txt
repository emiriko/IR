We consider two-player games played on finite colored graphs where the goal
is the construction of an infinite path with one of the following
frequency-related properties: (i) all colors occur with the same asymptotic
frequency, (ii) there is a constant that bounds the difference between the
occurrences of any two colors for all prefixes of the path, or (iii) all colors
occur with a fixed asymptotic frequency.
  These properties can be viewed as quantitative refinements of the classical
notion of fair path in a concurrent system, whose simplest form checks whether
all colors occur infinitely often. In particular, the first two properties
enforce equal treatment of all the jobs involved in the system, while the third
one represents a way to assign a given priority to each job. For all the above
goals, we show that the problem of checking whether there exists a winning
strategy is CoNP-complete.
