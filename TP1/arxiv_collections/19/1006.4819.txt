In a recent paper [arXiv:0910.1109], a wormhole range in the Jordan frame,
-3/2<{\omega}<-4/3 for the vacuum Brans-Dicke Class I solution was derived. On
general grounds and under certain conditions, it is shown in a theorem that
static wormhole solutions in the scalar-tensor theory are not possible. We
agree with the conclusion within its framework but report that a
singularity-free wormhole can be obtained from Class I solution by performing
certain operations on it, a fact possibly not yet widely known. The transformed
solution is regular everywhere, produces a wormhole with two asymtotically flat
regions for a revised new range -2<{\omega}<-3/2, together with a wormhole
analogue (of Horowitz-Ross naked black hole) that we discovered earlier. This
new range lies in the ghost regime in the Einstein frame consistent with the
theorem. We further conclude that there is a fixed point at {\omega}=-3/2, the
values {\omega}>-3/2 correspond to singular wormholes, while values
{\omega}<-3/2 correspond to singularity-free wormholes.
