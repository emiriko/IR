In this note we provide examples of families of Calabi-Yau 3-manifolds over
Shimura varieties, whose mirror families contain subfamilies over Shimura
varieties. Therefore these original families and subfamilies on the mirror side
contain dense sets of complex multiplication fibers. In view of the work of S.
Gukov and C. Vafa this is of special interest in theoretical physics.
