The CoRoT (Convection, Rotation and planetary Transits) space mission
provides a valuable opportunity to monitor stars with uninterrupted time
sampling for up to 150 days at a time. The study of RR Lyrae stars, performed
in the framework of the Additional Programmes belonging to the exoplanetary
field, will particularly benefit from such dense, long-duration monitoring. The
Blazhko effect in RR Lyrae stars is a long-standing, unsolved problem of
stellar astrophysics. We used the CoRoT data of the new RR Lyrae variable CoRoT
101128793 (f0=2.119 c/d, P=0.4719296 d) to provide us with more detailed
observational facts to understand the physical process behind the phenomenon.
The CoRoT data were corrected for one jump and the long-term drift. We applied
different period-finding techniques to the corrected timeseries to investigate
amplitude and phase modulation. We detected 79 frequencies in the light curve
of CoRoT 101128793. They have been identified as the main frequency f0, and its
harmonics, two independent terms, the terms related to the Blazhko frequency,
and several combination terms. A Blazhko frequency fB=0.056 c/d and a triplet
structure around the fundamental radial mode and harmonics were detected, as
well as a long-term variability of the Blazhko modulation. Indeed, the
amplitude of the main oscillation is decreasing along the CoRoT survey. The
Blazhko modulation is one of the smallest observed in RR Lyrae stars. Moreover,
the additional modes f1=3.630 and f2=3.159 c/d are detected. Taking its ratio
with the fundamental radial mode into account, the term f1 could be the
identified as the second radial overtone. Detecting of these modes in
horizontal branch stars is a new result obtained by CoRoT.
