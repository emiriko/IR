This paper describes a set of tools for automating and controlling the
development and maintenance of software systems. The mental model is a software
assembly line. Program design and construction take place at individual
programmer workstations. Integration of individual software components takes
place at subsequent stations on the assembly line. Software is moved
automatically along the assembly line toward final packaging. Software under
construction or maintenance is divided into packages. Each package of software
is composed of a recipe and ingredients. Some new terms are introduced to
describe the ingredients. The recipe specifies how ingredients are transformed
into products. The benefits of the Software Assembly Line for development,
maintenance, and management of large-scale computer systems are explained.
