We study operator spaces determined uniquely by a completely positive map and
find a complete invariance upto cocycle conjugacy for an extremal element in
the convex set of unital trace preserving completely positive map on matrix
algebra over the field of complex numbers. We prove a Hann-Banach-Arveson's
type of theorem on operator spaces which made it possible to use dynamical
systems approach to arrive at our main result via P. Jordan's theorem on order
isomorphisms on $C^*$ algebras.
