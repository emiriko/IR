We present new HST ultraviolet color-magnitude diagrams of 5 massive Galactic
globular clusters: NGC 2419, NGC 6273, NGC 6715, NGC 6388, and NGC 6441. These
observations were obtained to investigate the "blue hook" phenomenon previously
observed in UV images of the globular clusters omega Cen and NGC 2808. Blue
hook stars are a class of hot (approximately 35,000 K) subluminous horizontal
branch stars that occupy a region of the HR diagram that is unexplained by
canonical stellar evolution theory. By coupling new stellar evolution models to
appropriate non-LTE synthetic spectra, we investigate various theoretical
explanations for these stars. Specifically, we compare our photometry to
canonical models at standard cluster abundances, canonical models with enhanced
helium (consistent with cluster self-enrichment at early times), and
flash-mixed models formed via a late helium-core flash on the white dwarf
cooling curve. We find that flash-mixed models are required to explain the
faint luminosity of the blue hook stars, although neither the canonical models
nor the flash-mixed models can explain the range of color observed in such
stars, especially those in the most metal-rich clusters. Aside from the
variation in the color range, no clear trends emerge in the morphology of the
blue hook population with respect to metallicity.
