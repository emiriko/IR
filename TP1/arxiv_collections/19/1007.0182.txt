Superconductivity-induced changes of phonon lineshapes in niobium have been
re-investigated by high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering. We show that
the changes go beyond a simple change in lifetime and frequency when the phonon
frequency is close to the superconducting energy gap $2\Delta$. The observed
lineshapes in elemental niobium are qualitatively similar to those found
previously in borocarbide superconductors and agree very well with those
predicted by the theory of Allen et al. [PRB 56, 5552 (1997)]. Our results
indicate that the peculiar phonon lineshapes in the superconducting state
predicted by the theory of Allen et al. are a general phenomenon and not
restricted to a particular class of compounds.
