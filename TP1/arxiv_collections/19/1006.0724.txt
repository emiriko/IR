We study the energy spectrum of symmetric double quantum dots in narrow-gap
carbon nanotubes with one and two electrostatically confined electrons in the
presence of spin-orbit and Coulomb interactions. Compared to GaAs quantum dots,
the spectrum exhibits a much richer structure because of the spin-orbit
interaction that couples the electron's isospin to its real spin through two
independent coupling constants. In a single dot, both constants combine to
split the spectrum into two Kramers doublets, while the antisymmetric constant
solely controls the difference in the tunneling rates of the Kramers doublets
between the dots. For the two-electron regime, the detailed structure of the
spin-orbit split energy spectrum is investigated as a function of detuning
between the quantum dots in a 22-dimensional Hilbert space within the framework
of a single-longitudinal-mode model. We find a competing effect of the
tunneling and Coulomb interaction. The former favors a left-right symmetric
two-particle ground state, while in the regime where the Coulomb interaction
dominates over tunneling, a left-right antisymmetric ground state is found. As
a result, ground states on both sides of the $(11)$-$(02)$ degeneracy point may
possess opposite left-right symmetry, and the electron dynamics when tuning the
system from one side of the $(11)$-$(02)$ degeneracy point to the other is
controlled by three selection rules (in spin, isospin, and left-right
symmetry). We discuss implications for the spin-dephasing and Pauli blockade
experiments.
