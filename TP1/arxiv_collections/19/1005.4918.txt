We investigate the electronic properties of multi-domain configurations in
models for undoped manganites by means of variational and Monte Carlo
techniques. These materials display simultaneous Jahn-Teller distortions and
magnetic ordering. We find that a band of electronic states appears associated
with Jahn-Teller domain walls, and this band is localized in the direction
perpendicular to the walls. The energy and width of this band depends on the
conformational properties of the domain walls. At finite temperatures, the
conductance along the domain walls, induced by the localized domain wall bands,
is orders magnitude larger than in the bulk.
