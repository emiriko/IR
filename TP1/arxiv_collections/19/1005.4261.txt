3D corporate tourism in the marine sciences is a solution-based approach to
innovation in science, engineering and design. Corporate international
scientists, engineers and designers work with local experts in Malaysian marine
and coastal environments: they jointly discover, develop and design complex
materials and designs inspired by nature directly on site (e.g. at the UKM
Marine Ecosystem Research Centre EKOMAR and Malaysian Marine Parks) and
construct initial biomimetic prototypes and novel designs. Thereby, new links,
networks and collaborations are established between communities of thinkers in
different countries. 3D tourism aims at mapping new frontiers in emerging
engineering and design fields. This provides a novel way to foster and promote
innovative thinking in the sciences, and considers the need for synergy and
collaboration between marine sciences, engineering and design rather than
segmentation and isolation. With the concept of 3D corporate tourism the
potential of Malaysian marine ecosystems is used in a sustainable way and the
management of marine resources for human and environmental wellbeing is
fostered, without exploiting the natural resources or removing anything else
from the ecosystem apart from ideas. Subsequent deeper and more detailed
investigations at the respective international home institution foster
collaborations and result in synergistic effects across borders.
