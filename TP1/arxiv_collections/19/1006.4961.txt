Graphene has attracted great attentions since its first discovery in 2004.
Various approaches have been proposed to control its physical and electronic
properties. Here, we report that graphene based intercalation compounds is an
efficient method to modify the electronic properties of few layer graphene
(FLG). FeCl3 intercalated FLG were successfully prepared by two-zone vapor
transport method. This is the first report on full intercalation for graphene
samples. The features of the Raman G peak of such few-layer graphene
intercalation compounds (FLGIC) are in good agreement with their full
intercalation structures. The FLGIC presents single Lorentzian 2D peak, similar
to that of single layer graphene, indicating the loss of electronic coupling
between adjacent graphene layers. First principle calculations further reveal
that the band structure of FLGIC is similar to single layer graphene but with
strong doping effect due to the charge transfer from graphene to FeCl3. The
successful fabrication of FLGIC opens a new way to modify properties of FLG for
fundamental studies and future applications.
