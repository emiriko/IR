We consider several applications in black-box quantum computation in which
untrusted physical quantum devices are connected together to produce an
experiment. By examining the outcome statistics of such an experiment, and
comparing them against the desired experiment, we may hope to certify that the
physical experiment is implementing the desired experiment. This is useful in
order to verify that a calculation has been performed correctly, that
measurement outcomes are secure, or that the devices are producing the desired
state.
