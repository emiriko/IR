We report the discovery of CoRoT 102980178 (R.A.= 06:50:12.10, Dec.=
-02:41:21.8, J2000) an Algol-type eclipsing binary system with a pulsating
component (oEA). It was identified using a publicly available 55 day long
monochromatic lightcurve from the CoRoT initial run dataset (exoplanet field).
Eleven consecutive 1.26m deep total primary and the equal number of 0.25m deep
secondary eclipses (at phase 0.50) were observed. The following light elements
for the primary eclipse were derived: HJD_MinI= 2454139.0680 + 5.0548d x E. The
lightcurve modeling leads to a semidetached configuration with the photometric
mass ratio q=0.2 and orbital inclination i=85 deg. The out-of-eclipse
lightcurve shows ellipsoidal variability and positive O'Connell effect as well
as clear 0.01m pulsations with the dominating frequency of 2.75 c/d. The
pulsations disappear during the primary eclipses, which indicates the primary
(more massive) component to be the pulsating star. Careful frequency analysis
reveals the second independent pulsation frequency of 0.21 c/d and numerous
combinations of these frequencies with the binary orbital frequency and its
harmonics. On the basis of the CoRoT lightcurve and ground based multicolor
photometry, we favor classification of the pulsating component as a gamma
Doradus type variable, however, classification as an SPB star cannot be
excluded.
