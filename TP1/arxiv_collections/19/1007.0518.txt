The importance of center vortices for the understanding of the confining
properties of SU(N) Yang-Mills theories is well established in the lattice.
However, in the continuum, there is a problem concerning the relevance of
center vortex backgrounds. They display the so called Savvidy-Nielsen-Olesen
instability, associated with a gyromagnetic ratio $g^{(b)}_m=2$ for the
off-diagonal gluons.
  In this work, we initially consider the usual definition of a {\it thin}
center vortex and rewrite it in terms of a local color frame in SU(N)
Yang-Mills theories. Then, we define a thick center vortex as a diagonal
deformation of the thin object. Besides the usual thick background profile,
this deformation also contains a frame defect coupled with gyromagnetic ratio
$g^{(d)}_m=1$, originated from the charged sector. As a consequence, the
analysis of stability is modified. In particular, we point out that the defect
should stabilize a vortex configuration formed by a pair of straight components
separated by an appropriate finite distance.
