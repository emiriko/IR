The dispersing equation was derived from system of the hydrodynamic equations
that take into account the gravity, and from boundary conditions of shock
front. The dispersing equation made it possible to study unstable stability of
front not only relative to sound vibrations, but also to explore the
gravitational branch of acousto-gravitational waves. Within the framework of
the model under study there appeared a possibility to examine the interval of
frequencies in which wave disturbances of the aerosphere induced by shock waves
from land-based sources are energized.
