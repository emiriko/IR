We study a ferromagnetic Ising model on random graphs with a power-law degree
distribution and compute the thermodynamic limit of the pressure when the mean
degree is finite (degree exponent $\tau>2$), for which the random graph has a
tree-like structure. For this, we adapt and simplify an analysis by Dembo and
Montanari, which assumes finite variance degrees ($\tau>3$). We further
identify the thermodynamic limits of various physical quantities, such as the
magnetization and the internal energy.
