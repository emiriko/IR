We study a model of "elastic" lattice polymer in which a fixed number of
monomers $m$ is hosted by a self-avoiding walk with fluctuating length $l$. We
show that the stored length density $\rho_m = 1 - <l>/m$ scales asymptotically
for large $m$ as $\rho_m=\rho_\infty(1-\theta/m + ...)$, where $\theta$ is the
polymer entropic exponent, so that $\theta$ can be determined from the analysis
of $\rho_m$. We perform simulations for elastic lattice polymer loops with
various sizes and knots, in which we measure $\rho_m$. The resulting estimates
support the hypothesis that the exponent $\theta$ is determined only by the
number of prime knots and not by their type. However, if knots are present, we
observe strong corrections to scaling, which help to understand how an entropic
competition between knots is affected by the finite length of the chain.
