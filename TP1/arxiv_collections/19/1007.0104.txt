We have searched for stimulated photon scattering in vacuum at a center of
mass photon energy of 0.8 eV. The QED contribution to this process is
equivalent to four wave mixing in vacuum. No evidence for gamma-gamma
scattering was observed. The corresponding upper limit of the cross section is
sigma_Lim=1.5 10^{-48}cm2.
