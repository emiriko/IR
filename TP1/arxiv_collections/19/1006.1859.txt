An electroweak model with running coupling constants described by an energy
dependent entire function is utraviolet complete and avoids unitarity
violations for energies above 1 TeV. The action contains no physical scalar
fields and no Higgs particle and the physical electroweak model fields are
local and satisfy microcausality. The $W$ and $Z$ masses are compatible with a
symmetry breaking $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y \rightarrow U(1)_{\rm em}$, which
retains a massless photon. The vertex couplings possess an energy scale
$\Lambda_W > 1$ TeV predicting scattering amplitudes that can be tested at the
LHC.
