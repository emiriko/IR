We revisit the question of quantum dynamics of electrons on the off-diagonal
Fibonacci tight-binding model. We find that typical dynamical quantities, such
as the probability of an electron to remain in its original position as a
function of time, display log-periodic oscillations on top of the leading-order
power-law decay. These periodic oscillations with the logarithm of time are
similar to the oscillations that are known to exist with the logarithm of
temperature in the specific heat of Fibonacci electrons, yet they offer new
possibilities for the experimental observation of this unique phenomenon.
