For the first time the kinetic description of Landau diamagnetism for
degenerate collisional plasma is given. The correct expression for transverse
electric conductivity of the quantum plasma, found by authors (see
arXiv:1002.1017 [math-ph] 4 Feb 2010) is used. In work S. Dattagupta, A.M.
Jayannavar and N. Kumar [Current science, V. 80, No. 7, 10 April, 2001] was
discussed the important problem of dissipation (collisions) influence on Landau
diamagnetism. The analysis of this problem is given with the use of exact
expression for transverse conductivity of quantum plasma.
