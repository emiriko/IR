The XY-pyrochlore antiferromagnet \ETO\ is studied by heat capacity
measurements and electron spin resonance spectroscopy performed on single
crystal samples. The magnetic phase diagrams are established for two directions
of applied field, $H\parallel [100]$ and $H\parallel [111]$. In the
magnetically ordered phase observed below $T_N=1.2$ K, the magnetic excitation
spectrum consists of a Goldstone mode acquiring an isotropic gap in an applied
field, and another mode with a gap softening in the vicinity of a field-induced
phase transition. This second-order transition takes place at a critical field
$H_c$ above which the magnetization process is accompanied by a canting of the
magnetic moments off their local "easy-planes". The specific heat curves for
$H\parallel [100]$ ($H\gg H_c$) are well described by a model presuming a
single dispersionless excitation mode with the energy gap obtained from the
spectroscopic measurements.
