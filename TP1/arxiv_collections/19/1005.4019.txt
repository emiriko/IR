Current analyses of the Lyman-alpha forest assume that the primordial power
spectrum of density perturbations obeys a simple power law, a strong
theoretical assumption which should be tested. Employing a large suite of
numerical simulations which drop this assumption, we reconstruct the shape of
the primordial power spectrum using Lyman-alpha data from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS). Our method combines a minimally parametric framework with
cross-validation, a technique used to avoid over-fitting the data. Future work
will involve predictions for the upcoming Baryon Oscillation Sky Survey (BOSS),
which will provide new Lyman-alpha data with vastly decreased statistical
errors.
