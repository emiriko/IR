We calculate the contribution of the two photon production process into
$e^+e^-$ spectra, and compare the results with experimental data from the
PHENIX detector at RHIC. We study the contribution given by ``semi-coherent"
kinematics, in which one photon is relatively hard and is incoherently emitted
by participating protons, while another can be soft enough to be in a coherent
domain.
