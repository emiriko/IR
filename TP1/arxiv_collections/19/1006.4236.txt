The unusual dispersion of electron states in antinodal direction for
$n_{h}\simeq\frac{1}{8}$ holes/copper is explained. In photoelectron
excitations, transformations of the $\mathbf{k}$ space as a consequence of
symmetry breaking proves to be an exceptional phenomenon distinctly reflected
by the experiments. Paired photoelectron emissions are predicted that enable a
new energetic upward shift termed as \emph{pair shake-up effect} which explains
the experimentally observed sharp transition between non-dispersive and
dispersive behaviour. The disappearance of antinodal states for
$\mathbf{k}_{||}\epsilon[0,\pm \pi/2]$ is explained.
