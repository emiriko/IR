In this paper, we propose an efficient client-to-client streaming approach to
cooperatively stream the video using chaining technique with unicast
communication among the clients. This approach considers two major issues of
VoD 1) Prefix caching scheme to accommodate more number of videos closer to
client, so that the request-service delay for the user can be minimized. 2)
Cooperative proxy and client chaining scheme for streaming the videos using
unicasting. This approach minimizes the client rejection rate and bandwidth
requirement on server to proxy and proxy to client path. Our simulation results
show that the proposed approach achieves reduced client waiting time and
optimal prefix caching of videos minimizing server to proxy path bandwidth
usage by utilizing the client to client bandwidth, which is occasionally used
when compared to busy server to proxy path bandwidth.
