We use a sample of newly-discovered globular clusters from the Pan-Andromeda
Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) in combination with previously-catalogued
objects to map the spatial distribution of globular clusters in the M31 halo.
At projected radii beyond ~30 kpc, where large coherent stellar streams are
readily distinguished in the field, there is a striking correlation between
these features and the positions of the globular clusters. Adopting a simple
Monte Carlo approach, we test the significance of this association by computing
the probability that it could be due to the chance alignment of globular
clusters smoothly distributed in the M31 halo. We find the likelihood of this
possibility is low, below 1%, and conclude that the observed spatial
coincidence between globular clusters and multiple tidal debris streams in the
outer halo of M31 reflects a genuine physical association. Our results imply
that the majority of the remote globular cluster system of M31 has been
assembled as a consequence of the accretion of cluster-bearing satellite
galaxies. This constitutes the most direct evidence to date that the outer halo
globular cluster populations in some galaxies are largely accreted.
