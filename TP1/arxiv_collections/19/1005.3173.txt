We discuss the status of the pion distribution amplitude (DA) in connection
with QCD sum rules and experimental data on the $\gamma^*\gamma^\to \pi^0$
transition form factor. Contents: (a) Pion DA in generalized QCD Sum Rules
(SRs); (b) Light Cone Sum Rules (LCSR) analysis of the CLEO data for the
$\gamma^*\gamma\to\pi^{0}$ transition form factor; (c) Recent lattice QCD data
for the pion DA; (d) BaBar data---a challenge for QCD?
