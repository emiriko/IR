The detection of diffuse radio emission associated with clusters of galaxies
indicates populations of relativistic leptons infusing the intracluster medium.
Those electrons and positrons are either injected into and accelerated directly
in the intracluster medium, or produced as secondary pairs by cosmic-ray ions
scattering on ambient protons. Radiation mechanisms involving the energetic
leptons together with decay of neutral pions produced by hadronic interactions
have the potential to produce abundant GeV photons. Here, we report on the
search for GeV emission from clusters of galaxies using data collected by the
Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) from
August 2008 to February 2010. Thirty-three galaxy clusters have been selected
according to their proximity and high mass, X-ray flux and temperature, and
indications of non-thermal activity for this study. We report upper limits on
the photon flux in the range 0.2-100 GeV towards a sample of observed clusters
(typical values 1-5 x 10^-9 ph cm^-2 s^-1) considering both point-like and
spatially resolved models for the high-energy emission, and discuss how these
results constrain the characteristics of energetic leptons and hadrons, and
magnetic fields in the intracluster medium. The volume-averaged
relativistic-hadron-to-thermal energy density ratio is found to be < 5-10% in
several clusters.
