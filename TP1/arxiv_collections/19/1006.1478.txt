Gamow-Teller strength distributions, beta-decay half-lives, and beta-delayed
neutron emission are investigated in neutron-rich Zr and Mo isotopes within a
deformed quasiparticle random-phase approximation. The approach is based on a
self-consistent Skyrme Hartree-Fock mean field with pairing correlations and
residual separable particle-hole and particle-particle forces. Comparison with
recent measurements of half-lives stresses the important role that nuclear
deformation plays in the description of beta-decay properties in this mass
region.
