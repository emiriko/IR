Orbital degrees of freedom shape many of the properties of a wide class of
Mott insulating, transition metal oxides with partially filled 3d-shells. Here
we study orbital ordering transitions in systems where a single electron
occupies the e_g orbital doublet and the spatially highly anisotropic orbital
interactions can be captured by an orbital-only model, often called the 120
degree model. Our analysis of both the classical and quantum limits of this
model in an extended parameter space shows that the 120 degree model is in
close proximity to several T=0 phase transitions and various competing ordered
phases. We characterize the orbital order of these nearby phases and their
associated thermal phase transitions by extensive numerical simulations and
perturbative arguments.
