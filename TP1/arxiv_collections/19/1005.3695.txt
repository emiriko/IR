We consider here the non-adiabatic energy transfer dynamics for a model
bi-chromophore system consisting of a perylenediimide unit linked to a
ladder-type poly-(para-phenylene) oligomer. Starting from a semi-empirical
parameterization of a model electron/phonon Hamiltonian, we compute the
golden-rule rate for energy transfer from the LPPP5 donor to the PDI acceptor.
Our results indicate that the non-adiabatic transfer is promoted by the
out-of-plane wagging modes of the C-H bonds even though theses modes give
little or no contribution to the Franck Condon factors in this system. We also
predict a kinetic isotope effect of $k^{(H)}/k^{(D)} = 1.7 - 2.5$ depending
upon the temperature.
