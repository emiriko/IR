The Tokai to Kamioka neutrino oscillation experiment aims to determine the
third and final lepton mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, through a measurement of the
sub-dominant oscillation $\nu_{\mu}\rightarrow\nu_{e}$. The oscillation is a
maximum as $\nu_{\mu}$ travel 295~km from the near detectors to the far
Super-Kamiokande detector. Single $\pi^{0}$ production from neutral current
(NC1$\pi^{0}$) neutrino interactions are a significant background to $\nu_{e}$
events in water Cherenkov detectors such as Super-Kamiokande. To reduce this
background, the off-axis ND280 near detector contains water target regions to
determine the cross-section of such NC1$\pi^{0}$ events. Here, I discuss the
status of the detectors and tools in preparation for physics data taking.
