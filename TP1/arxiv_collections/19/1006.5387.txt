We present results from a WIYN 3.5m telescope imaging study of the globular
cluster (GC) systems of the edge-on spiral galaxies NGC891 and NGC4013. We used
the 10' x 10' Minimosaic Imager to observe the galaxies in BVR filters to
projected radii of ~20 kpc from the galaxy centers. We combined the WIYN data
with archival and published data from WFPC2 and ACS on the Hubble Space
Telescope to assess the contamination level of the WIYN GC candidate sample and
to follow the GC systems further in toward the galaxies' centers. We
constructed radial distributions for the GC systems using both the WIYN and HST
data. The GC systems of NGC891 and NGC4013 extend to 9+/-3 kpc and 14+/-5 kpc,
respectively, before falling off to undetectable levels in our images. We use
the radial distributions to calculate global values for the total number (N_GC)
and specific frequencies (S_N and T) of GCs. NGC4013 has N_GC = 140+/-20, S_N =
1.0+/-0.2 and T = 1.9+/-0.5; our N_GC value is ~40% smaller than a previous
determination from the literature. The HST data were especially useful for
NGC891, because the GC system is concentrated toward the plane of the galaxy
and was only weakly detected in our WIYN images. Although NGC891 is thought to
resemble the Milky Way in its overall properties, it has only half as many GCs,
with N_GC = 70+/-20, S_N = 0.3+/-0.1 and T = 0.6+/-0.3. We also calculate the
galaxy-mass-normalized number of blue (metal-poor) GCs in NGC891 and NGC4013
and find that they fall along a general trend of increasing specific frequency
of blue GCs with increasing galaxy mass. Given currently available resources,
the optimal method for studying the global properties of extragalactic GC
systems is to combine HST data with wide-field, ground-based imaging with good
resolution. The results here demonstrate the advantage gained by using both
methods when possible.
