The dark energy models with variable equation of state parameter $\omega$ is
investigated by using law of variation of Hubble's parameter that yields the
constant value of deceleration parameter. The equation of state parameter
$\omega$ is found to be time dependent and its existing range for this model is
consistent with the recent observations of SN Ia data, SN Ia data (with CMBR
anisotropy) and galaxy clustering statistics. The physical significance of the
dark energy models has also been discussed.
