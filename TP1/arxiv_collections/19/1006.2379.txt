We consider finite-size effects on the radiative energy loss of a fast parton
moving in a finite temperature strongly interacting medium, using the light
cone path integral formalism put forward by Zakharov. We present a convenient
reformulation of the problem which makes possible its exact numerical analysis.
This is done by introducing the concept of a radiation rate in the presence of
finite-size effects. This effectively extends the finite-temperature approach
of AMY (Arnold, Moore, and Yaffe) to include interference between vacuum and
medium radiation. We compare results with those obtained in the regime
considered by AMY, with those obtained at leading order in an opacity
expansion, and with those obtained deep in the LPM (Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal)
regime.
