The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a computationally intensive digital
signal processing (DSP) function widely used in applications such as imaging,
software-defined radio, wireless communication, instrumentation. In this paper,
a reconfigurable FFT design using Vedic multiplier with high speed and small
area is presented. Urdhava Triyakbhyam algorithm of ancient Indian Vedic
Mathematics is utilized to improve its efficiency. In the proposed
architecture, the 4x4 bit multiplication operation is fragmented reconfigurable
FFT modules. The 4x4 multiplication modules are implemented using small 2x2bit
multipliers. Reconfigurability at run time is provided for attaining power
saving. The reconfigurable FFT has been designed, optimized and implemented on
an FPGA based system. This reconfigurable FFT is having the high speed and
small area as compared to the conventional FFT.
