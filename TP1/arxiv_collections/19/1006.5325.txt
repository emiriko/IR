The Large Magellanic Cloud, at only 50 kpc away from us and known to be dark
matter dominated, is clearly an interesting place where to search for dark
matter annihilation signals. In this paper, we estimate the synchrotron
emission due to WIMP annihilation in the halo of the LMC at two radio
frequencies, 1.4 and 4.8 GHz, and compare it to the observed emission, in order
to impose constraints in the WIMP mass vs. annihilation cross section plane. We
use available Faraday rotation data from background sources to estimate the
magnitude of the magnetic field in different regions of the LMC's disc, where
we calculate the radio signal due to dark matter annihilation. We account for
the e+ e- energy losses due to synchrotron, Inverse Compton Scattering and
bremsstrahlung, using the observed hydrogen and dust temperature distribution
on the LMC to estimate their efficiency. The extensive use of observations,
allied with conservative choices adopted in all the steps of the calculation,
allow us to obtain very realistic constraints.
