Analytic QCD models are those where the QCD running coupling has the
physically correct analytic behavior, i.e., no Landau singularities in the
Euclidean regime. We present a simple analytic QCD model in which the
discontinuity function of the running coupling at high momentum scales is the
same as in perturbative QCD (just like in the analytic QCD model of Shirkov and
Solovtsov), but at low scales it is replaced by a delta function which
parametrizes the unknown behavior there. We require that the running coupling
agree to a high degree with the perturbative coupling at high energies, which
reduces the number of free parameters of the model from four to one. The
remaining parameter is fixed by requiring the reproduction of the correct value
of the semihadronic tau decay ratio.
