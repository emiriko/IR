We present the results of our detailed pseudospectral direct numerical
simulation (DNS) studies, with up to $1024^3$ collocation points, of
incompressible, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in three dimensions,
without a mean magnetic field. Our study concentrates on the dependence of
various statistical properties of both decaying and statistically steady MHD
turbulence on the magnetic Prandtl number ${\rm Pr_M}$ over a large range,
namely, $0.01 \leq {\rm Pr_M} \leq 10$. We obtain data for a wide variety of
statistical measures such as probability distribution functions (PDFs) of
moduli of the vorticity and current density, the energy dissipation rates, and
velocity and magnetic-field increments, energy and other spectra, velocity and
magnetic-field structure functions, which we use to characterise intermittency,
isosurfaces of quantities such as the moduli of the vorticity and current, and
joint PDFs such as those of fluid and magnetic dissipation rates. Our
systematic study uncovers interesting results that have not been noted
hitherto. In particular, we find a crossover from larger intermittency in the
magnetic field than in the velocity field, at large ${\rm Pr_M}$, to smaller
intermittency in the magnetic field than in the velocity field, at low ${\rm
Pr_M}$. Furthermore, a comparison of our results for decaying MHD turbulence
and its forced, statistically steady analogue suggests that we have strong
universality in the sense that, for a fixed value of ${\rm Pr_M}$, multiscaling
exponent ratios agree, at least within our errorbars, for both decaying and
statistically steady homogeneous, isotropic MHD turbulence.
