For any odd $k$, a connection is established between the dihedral and
supersymmetric extensions of the Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz Hamiltonians
$H_k$ on a plane. For this purpose, the elements of the dihedral group $D_{2k}$
are realized in terms of two independent pairs of fermionic creation and
annihilation operators and some interesting trigonometric identities are
demonstrated.
