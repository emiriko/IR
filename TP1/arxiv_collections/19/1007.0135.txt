Expansion for the free energy functionals of the Potts spin glass models with
3, 4 and 5 states up to the fourth order in $\delta q_{\alpha \beta }$ around
the replica symmetric solution (RS) is investigated using a special
quadrupole-like representation. The temperature dependence of the 1RSB order
parameters is obtained in the vicinity of the point $T=T_c$ where the RS
solution becomes unstable. The crossover from continuous to jumpwise behavior
with increasing of number of states is derived analytically. The comparison is
made of the free energy expansion for the Potts spin glass with that for other
models.
