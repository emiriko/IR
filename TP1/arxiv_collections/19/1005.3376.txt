The determination of Li and proton-capture element abundances in globular
cluster (GC) giants allows us to constrain several key questions on the
multiple population scenarios in GCs, from formation and early evolution, to
pollution and dilution mechanisms. In this Letter, we present our results on Li
abundances for a large sample of giants in the intermediate-metallicity GC NGC
6121 (M4), for which Na and O have been already determined by Marino et al. The
stars analyzed are both below and above the red giant branch bump luminosity.
We found that the first and second generation stars share the same Li content,
suggesting that a Li production must have occurred. This is a strong
observational evidence providing support for the scenario in which asymptotic
giant branch stars are GC polluters.
