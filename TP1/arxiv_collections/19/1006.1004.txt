Deep Keck/NIRC2 HK'L' observations of the Arches cluster near the Galactic
center reveal a significant population of near-infrared excess sources. We
combine the L'-band excess observations with K'-band proper motions, to confirm
cluster membership of excess sources in a starburst cluster for the first time.
The robust removal of field contamination provides a reliable disk fraction
down to our completeness limit of H=19 mag, or about 5 Msun at the distance of
the Arches. Of the 24 identified sources with K'-L' > 2.0 mag, 21 have reliable
proper motion measurements, all of which are proper motion members of the
Arches cluster. VLT/SINFONI K'-band spectroscopy of three excess sources
reveals strong CO bandhead emission, which we interpret as the signature of
dense circumstellar disks. The detection of strong disk emission from the
Arches stars is surprising in view of the high mass of the B-type main sequence
host stars of the disks and the intense starburst environment. We find a disk
fraction of 6 +/- 2% among B-type stars in the Arches cluster. A radial
increase in the disk fraction from 3 to 10% suggests rapid disk destruction in
the immediate vicinity of numerous O-type stars in the cluster core. A
comparison between the Arches and other high- and low-mass star-forming regions
provides strong indication that disk depletion is significantly more rapid in
compact starburst clusters than in moderate star-forming environments.
