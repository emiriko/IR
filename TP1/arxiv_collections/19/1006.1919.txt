We introduce a new simulation platform called Insight, created to design and
simulate cyber-attacks against large arbitrary target scenarios. Insight has
surprisingly low hardware and configuration requirements, while making the
simulation a realistic experience from the attacker's standpoint. The scenarios
include a crowd of simulated actors: network devices, hardware devices,
software applications, protocols, users, etc. A novel characteristic of this
tool is to simulate vulnerabilities (including 0-days) and exploits, allowing
an attacker to compromise machines and use them as pivoting stones to continue
the attack. A user can test and modify complex scenarios, with several
interconnected networks, where the attacker has no initial connectivity with
the objective of the attack. We give a concise description of this new
technology, and its possible uses in the security research field, such as
pentesting training, study of the impact of 0-days vulnerabilities, evaluation
of security countermeasures, and risk assessment tool.
