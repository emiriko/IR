We report magnetization ($M$) measurements close to the ferromagnetic quantum
phase transition of the d-metal alloy Ni$_{1-x}$V$_x$ at a vanadium
concentration of $x_c \approx 11.4 %$. In the diluted regime ($x>x_c$), the
temperature ($T$) and magnetic field ($H$) dependencies of the magnetization
are characterized by nonuniversal power laws and display $H/T$ scaling in a
wide temperature and field range. The exponents vary strongly with $x$ and
follow the predictions of a quantum Griffiths phase. We also discuss the
deviations and limits of the quantum Griffiths phase as well as the phase
boundaries due to bulk and cluster physics.
