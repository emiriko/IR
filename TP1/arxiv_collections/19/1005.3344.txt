We have investigated plasma-surface interactions with molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. It, however, is high cost computation and is limited to
simulations for materials of nanometer order. In order to overcome the
limitation, a complementary model based on binary collision approximation (BCA)
can be established. We employed a BCA-based simulation code ACAT and extended
to handle any structure involving crystalline and amorphous. The extended code,
named "ACaT", stores all positions of projectile and target atoms and
velocities of recoil atoms, so it can be combined with the MD code. It also
holds the potential to reproduce channeling phenomena. Thus it is expected to
be useful for evaluation of channeling effects.
