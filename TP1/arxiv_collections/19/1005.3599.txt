The exact period determination of a multi-periodic variable star based on its
luminosity time series data is believed a task requiring skill and experience.
Thus the majority of available time series analysis techniques require human
intervention to some extent. The present work is dedicated to establish an
automated method of period (or frequency) determination from the time series
database of variable stars. Relying on the SigSpec method (Reegen 2007), the
technique established here employs a statistically unbiased treatment of
frequency-domain noise and avoids spurious (i. e. noise induced) and alias
peaks to the highest possible extent. Several add-on's were incorporated to
tailor SigSpec to our requirements. We present tests on 386 stars taken from
ASAS2 project database. From the output file produced by SigSpec, the frequency
with maximum spectral significance is chosen as the genuine frequency. Out of
386 variable stars available in the ASAS2 database, our results contain 243
periods recovered exactly and also 88 half periods, 42 different periods etc.
SigSpec has the potential to be effectively used for fully automated period
detection from variable stars' time series database. The exact detection of
periods helps us to identify the type of variability and classify the variable
stars, which provides a crucial information on the physical processes effective
in stellar atmospheres.
