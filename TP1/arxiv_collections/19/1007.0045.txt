We investigate scenarios in which dark matter is stabilized by an abelian Z_N
discrete gauge symmetry. Models are surveyed according to symmetries and matter
content. Multi-component dark matter arises when N is not prime and Z_N
contains one or more subgroups. The dark sector interacts with the visible
sector through the renormalizable kinetic mixing and Higgs portal operators,
and we highlight the basic phenomenology in these scenarios. In particular,
multiple species of dark matter can lead to an unconventional nuclear recoil
spectrum in direct detection experiments, while the presence of new light
states in the dark sector can dramatically affect the decays of the Higgs at
the Tevatron and LHC, thus providing a window into the gauge origin of the
stability of dark matter.
