We have carried out 870 micron observations in the J1040.7-1155 field, known
to host an overdensity of Lyman break galaxies at z=5.16 +/- 0.05. We do not
detect any individual source at the S(870)=3.0 mJy/beam (2 sigma) level. A
stack of nine spectroscopically confirmed z>5 galaxies also yields a
non-detection, constraining the submillimeter flux from a typical galaxy at
this redshift to S(870)<0.85 mJy, which corresponds to a mass limit
M(dust)<1.2x10^8 M_sun (2 sigma). This constrains the mass of thermal dust in
distant Lyman break galaxies to less than one tenth of their typical stellar
mass. We see no evidence for strong submillimeter galaxies associated with the
ultraviolet-selected galaxy overdensity, but cannot rule out the presence of
fainter, less massive sources.
