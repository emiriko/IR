This document consists of lecture notes for a graduate course, which focuses
on the relations between Information Theory and Statistical Physics. The course
is aimed at EE graduate students in the area of Communications and Information
Theory, as well as to graduate students in Physics who have basic background in
Information Theory. Strong emphasis is given to the analogy and parallelism
between Information Theory and Statistical Physics, as well as to the insights,
the analysis tools and techniques that can be borrowed from Statistical Physics
and `imported' to certain problem areas in Information Theory. This is a
research trend that has been very active in the last few decades, and the hope
is that by exposing the student to the meeting points between these two
disciplines, we will enhance his/her background and perspective to carry out
research in the field.
  A short outline of the course is as follows: Introduction; Elementary
Statistical Physics and its Relation to Information Theory; Analysis Tools in
Statistical Physics; Systems of Interacting Particles and Phase Transitions;
The Random Energy Model (REM) and Random Channel Coding; Additional Topics
(optional).
