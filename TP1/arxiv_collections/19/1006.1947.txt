Neutrino-electron scatterings are purely leptonic processes with robust
Standard Model (SM) predictions. Their measurements can therefore provide
constraints to physics beyond SM. The $\nuebar$-e data taken at the Kuo-Sheng
Reactor Neutrino Laboratory were used to probe two scenarios: Non-Standard
Neutrino Interactions (NSI) and Unparticle Physics. New constraints were placed
to the NSI parameters ($\el$,$\er$) and ($\etl$,$\etr$) for the Non-Universal
and Flavor-Changing channels, respectively, as well as to the coupling
constants for scalar ($\lambda_0$) and vector ($\lambda_1$) unparticles to the
neutrinos and electrons.
