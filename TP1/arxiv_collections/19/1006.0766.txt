Forward models for the Mueller Matrix (MM) components of materials with
relative magnetic permeability tensor {\mu} \neq 1 are studied. 4x4 matrix
formalism is employed to produce general solutions for the complex reflection
coefficients and MMs of dielectric-magnetic materials having arbitrary crystal
symmetry and arbitrary laboratory orientation. For certain orientations of
materials with simultaneously diagonalizable {\epsilon} and {\mu} tensors (with
coincident principal axes), analytic solutions to the Berreman equation are
available. For the single layer thin film configuration of these materials,
analytic formulas for the complex reflection and transmission coefficients are
derived for orthorhombic or higher crystal symmetry. The separation of the
magnetic and dielectric contributions to the optical properties of a material
are demonstrated using measurements of the MM at varying angles of incidence.
