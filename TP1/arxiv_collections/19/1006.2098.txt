One of the defining characteristics of BL Lacertae objects is their strong
variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. PKS 0537-441 is one such
object and is one of the most luminous blazars from radio to gamma-ray
wavelengths. It was detected as a strong and highly variable source by EGRET
and has been reported several times to be in an active state by Fermi . It is
one of the brightest gamma-ray blazars detected in the southern sky so far. The
TANAMI (Tracking Active Galactic Nuclei with Austral Milliarcsecond
Interferometry) program is monitoring PKS 0537-441 at VLBI resolutions. We
present 8.4 GHz and 22 GHz images of the milliarcsecond scale structure. We
also present our ongoing analysis of the spectral and temporal changes in this
object.
