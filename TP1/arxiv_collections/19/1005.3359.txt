The new BABAR data on the pion-photon transition form factor arouses people's
new interests on the determination of pion distribution amplitude. To explain
the data, we take both the leading valence quark state's and the non-valence
quark states' contributions into consideration, where the valence quark part up
to next-to-leading order is presented and the non-valence quark part is
estimated by a phenomenological model based on its limiting behavior at both
$Q^2\to 0$ and $Q^2\to\infty$. Our results show that to be consistent with the
new BABAR data at large $Q^2$ region, a broader other than the asymptotic-like
pion distribution amplitude should be adopted. The broadness of the pion
distribution amplitude is controlled by a parameter $B$. It has been found that
the new BABAR data at low and high energy regions can be explained
simultaneously by setting $B$ to be around 0.60, in which the pion distribution
amplitude is closed to the Chernyak-Zhitnitsky form.
