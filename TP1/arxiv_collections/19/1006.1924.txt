From a survey of 729 cores based on JCMT/SCUBA data, we present an analysis
of 17 candidate starless cores with masses that exceed their stable Jeans
masses. We re-examine the classification of these super-Jeans cores using
Spitzer maps and find that 3 are re-classified as protostellar, 11 have
ambiguous emission near the core positions, and 3 appear to be genuinely
starless. We suggest the 3 starless and 11 undetermined super-Jeans cores
represent excellent targets for future observational and computational study to
understand the evolution of dense cores and the process of star formation.
