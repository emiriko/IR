New type of parametrization for parton distribution functions, based on an
exact their Q^2-evolution at large and small x values, is constructed for
valence quarks. It preserves exactly the low x and large x asymptotics of the
solution of the DGLAP equation and obeys the Gross-Llewellyn-Smith sum rule.
