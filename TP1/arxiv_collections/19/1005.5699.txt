Context: The standard cooling models of neutron stars predict temperatures
$T<10^{4}$ K for ages $t>10^{7}$ yr. However, the likely thermal emission
detected from the millisecond pulsar J0437-4715, of spin-down age $t_s \sim
7\times10^9$ yr, implies a temperature $T\sim 10^5$ K. Thus, a heating
mechanism needs to be added to the cooling models in order to obtain agreement
between theory and observation. Aims: Several internal heating mechanisms could
be operating in neutron stars, such as magnetic field decay, dark matter
accretion, crust cracking, superfluid vortex creep, and non-equilibrium
reactions ("rotochemical heating"). We study these mechanisms in order to
establish which could be the dominant source of thermal emission from old
pulsars. Methods: We show by simple estimates that magnetic field decay, dark
matter accretion, and crust cracking mechanism are unlikely to have a
significant effect on old neutron stars. The thermal evolution for the other
mechanisms is computed using the code of Fern\'andez and Reisenegger. Given the
dependence of the heating mechanisms on the spin-down parameters, we study the
thermal evolution for two types of pulsars: young, slowly rotating "classical"
pulsars and old, fast rotating millisecond pulsars. Results: We find that
magnetic field decay, dark matter accretion, and crust cracking do not produce
detectable heating of old pulsars. Rotochemical heating and vortex creep can be
important both for classical pulsars and millisecond pulsars. More restrictive
upper limits on the surface temperatures of classical pulsars could rule out
vortex creep as the main source of thermal emission. Rotochemical heating in
classical pulsars is driven by the chemical imbalance built up during their
early spin-down, and therefore strongly sensitive to their initial rotation
period.
