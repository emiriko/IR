In this talk we present the recent calculation of the NLO QCD corrections to
the production of four b-quarks induced by initial state quarks at the CERN
LHC. We describe the details of the calculation using the GOLEM approach for
the virtual corrections and MadEvent/MadDipole for the real emission part and
present some results.
