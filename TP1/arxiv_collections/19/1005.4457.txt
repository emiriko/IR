In this paper we propose a new provenance model which is tailored to a class
of workflow-based applications. We motivate the approach with use cases from
the astronomy community. We generalize the class of applications the approach
is relevant to and propose a pipeline-centric provenance model. Finally, we
evaluate the benefits in terms of storage needed by the approach when applied
to an astronomy application.
