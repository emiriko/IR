The asymptotic behavior of the molecular continuum wave function has been
analyzed within a model of non-overlapping atomic potentials. It has been shown
that the representation of the wave function far from a molecule as a plane
wave and single spherical wave emitted by the molecular center cannot be
corrected. Because of the multicenter character of the problem, the asymptotic
form of the wave function according to the Huygens-Fresnel principle must
contain N spherical waves with centers at the nuclei of the N atoms that form
the molecule. A method of partial waves for a spherically non-symmetrical
target is considered for the simplest multicenter target formed by two
non-overlapping potentials. The results are compared with those obtained within
the single spherical wave approximation. It has been shown that the use of this
approximation is intrinsically conflicting, which is a direct consequence of
refusal from the Huygens-Fresnel picture of the wave scattering process.
