This paper is the second in a series devoted to the hard X-ray (17-60 keV)
whole sky survey performed by the INTEGRAL observatory over seven years. Here
we present a catalog of detected sources which includes 521 objects, 449 of
which exceed a 5 sigma detection threshold on the time-averaged map of the sky,
and 53 were detected in various subsamples of exposures. Among the identified
sources with known and suspected nature, 262 are Galactic (101 low-mass X-ray
binaries, 95 high-mass X-ray binaries, 36 cataclysmic variables, and 30 of
other types) and 219 are extragalactic, including 214 active galactic nuclei
(AGNs), 4 galaxy clusters, and galaxy ESO 389-G 002. The extragalactic (|b|>5
deg) and Galactic (|b|<5 deg) persistently detected source samples are of high
identification completeness (respectively ~96% and ~94%) and valuable for
population studies.
