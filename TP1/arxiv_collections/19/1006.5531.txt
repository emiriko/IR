We calculate the magnetostatic energy of synthetic ferrimagnet (SyF)
elements, consisting of two thin ferromagnetic layers coupled
antiferromagnetically through RKKY coupling. We calculate exact formulas as
well as approximate yet accurate ones, which can be used to easily derive
energy barriers and anisotropy fields of SyF. These can be used to evaluate
coercivity, thermal stability and other useful quantities.
