We present numerical computations of the equilibrium configurations of
tidally-locked homogeneous binaries, rotating in circular orbits. Unlike the
classical Roche approximations, we self-consistently account for the tidal and
rotational deformations of both components, and relax the assumptions of
ellipsoidal configurations and Keplerian rotation. We find numerical solutions
for mass ratios q between 1e-3 and 1, starting at a small angular velocity for
which tidal and rotational deformations are small, and following a sequence of
increasing angular velocities. Each series terminates at an appropriate ``Roche
limit'', above which no equilibrium solution can be found. Even though the
Roche limit is crossed before the ``Roche lobe'' is filled, any further
increase in the angular velocity will result in mass-loss. For close,
comparable-mass binaries, we find that local deviations from ellipsoidal forms
may be as large as 10-20%, and departures from Keplerian rotation are
significant. We compute the light curves that arise from our equilibrium
configurations, assuming their distance is >>1 AU (e.g. in the Kuiper Belt). We
consider both backscatter (proportional to the projected area) and diffuse
(Lambert) reflections. Backscatter reflection always yields two minima of equal
depths. Diffuse reflection, which is sensitive to the surface curvature,
generally gives rise to unequal minima. We find detectable intensity
differences of up to 10% between our light curves and those arising from the
Roche approximations. Finally, we apply our models to Kuiper Belt binary 2001
QG298, and find a nearly edge-on binary with a mass ratio q = 0.93
^{+0.07}_{-0.03}, angular velocity Omega^2/G rho = 0.333+/-0.001 (statistical
errors only), and pure diffuse reflection. For the observed period of 2001
QG298, these parameters imply a bulk density, rho = 0.72 +/- 0.04 g cm^-3.
