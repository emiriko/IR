In this paper, we propose new Global and Local (GL) electromagnetic (EM)
cloaks with distinctive class material a_{\alpha \beta}\log ^\alpha (b_{\alpha
\beta}/h) h^\beta (GLLH Cloak) without exceed light speed violation. The
refractive index of the GLLH cloak material, $n(r)$, is large than one or equal
to one. Our GLLH cloak is created by GL EM modeling and GL EM cloak inversion
with searching class \it a_{\alpha \beta}\log ^\alpha (b_{\alpha \beta}/h)
h^\beta. The GLLH cloaks in this paper have finite speed and have no exceed
light speed? physical violations and have more advantages. The GLLH EM cloaks
can be practicable by using normal materials and are available for all broad
frequency band. The GL EM cloak inversion and electromagnetic integral equation
for cloak are presented in this paper. The novel EM wave propagation and front
branching in the GLLH cloak by GL EM modeling are presented in this paper. The
EM wave front propagation in GLLH cloak is behind of the front in free space.
At time steps $118 dt$, in the GLLH cloak, the wave front is curved as a
crescent like and propagates slower than the light in free space. At the time
step $119dt$, the EM wave inside of the GLLH cloak propagates slower than light
speed, moreover, its two crescent front peaks intersect at a front branching
point. At the front branching point, the front is split to two fronts. The
novel front branching and crescent like wave propagation are displayed in the
following figure 1, figure 2 and figures 5 -20 in this paper. All copyright and
patent of the GLLH EM cloaks and GL modeling and inversion methods are reserved
