The Spectral Airglow Temperature Imager is an instrument, specially designed
for investigation of the wave processes in the Mesosphere-Lower Thermosphere.
In order to determine the kinematic parameters of a wave, the values of a
physical quantity in different space points and their changes in the time
should be known. As a result of the possibilities of the SATI instrument for
space scanning, different parts of the images (sectors of spectrograms)
correspond to the respective mesopause areas (where the radiation is
generated). Algorithms for sector spectra calculation are proposed. In contrast
to the original algorithms where twelve sectors with angles of 30 degrees are
only determined now sectors with arbitrary orientation and angles are
calculated. An algorithm is presented for sector calculation based on pixel
division into sub pixels. A comparative results are shown.
