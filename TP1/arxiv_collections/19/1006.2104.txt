Is it possible for an Information Technology [IT] product to be both mature
and state-of-theart at the same time? In the case of the UNIX system, the
answer is an unqualified "Yes." The UNIX system has continued to develop over
the past twenty-five years. In millions of installations running on nearly
every hardware platform made, the UNIX system has earned its reputation for
stability and scalability. Over the years, UNIX system suppliers have steadily
assimilated new technologies so that UNIX systems today provide more
functionality as any other operating system.
