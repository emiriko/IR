We find exact solution of the Einstein equations in the context of the brane
world scenario. We have supposed a {generalized chaplygin gas} equation of
state for bulk. This study display a constant energy density and pressure for
bulk in late time. It is shown that our assumptions impose a specific equation
of state on brane. {In this work, we have obtained a decelerate universe in
early time and late time.} In the end, it is shown that under some assumption
we have equation of state of cosmological constant for bulk.
