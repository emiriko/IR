The nonlinear normal state diamagnetism reported by Lu Li et al. [Phys. Rev.
B 81, 054510 (2010)] is shown to be incompatible with an acclaimed Cooper
pairing and vortex liquid above the resistive critical temperature. Instead it
is perfectly compatible with the normal state Landau diamagnetism of real-space
composed bosons, which describes the nonlinear magnetization curves in less
anisotropic cuprates La-Sr-Cu-O (LSCO) and Y-Ba-Cu-O (YBCO) as well as in
strongly anisotropic bismuth-based cuprates in the whole range of available
magnetic fields.
