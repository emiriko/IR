The work establishes fundamental limits with respect to rate, reliability and
computational complexity, for a general setting of outage-limited MIMO
communications. In the high-SNR regime, the limits are optimized over all
encoders, all decoders, and all complexity regulating policies. The work then
proceeds to explicitly identify encoder-decoder designs and policies, that meet
this optimal tradeoff. In practice, the limits aim to meaningfully quantify
different pertinent measures, such as the optimal rate-reliability capabilities
per unit complexity and power, the optimal diversity gains per complexity
costs, or the optimal number of numerical operations (i.e., flops) per bit.
Finally the tradeoff's simple nature, renders it useful for insightful
comparison of the rate-reliability-complexity capabilities for different
encoders-decoders.
