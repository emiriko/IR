We study inert charged Higgs boson $H^\pm$ production and decays at LHC
experiments in the context of constrained scalar dark matter model (CSDMM). In
the CSDMM the inert doublet and singlet scalar's mass spectrum is predicted
from the GUT scale initial conditions via RGE evolution. We compute the cross
sections of processes $pp\to H^+H^-,\, H^\pm S_i^0$ at the LHC and show that
for light $H^\pm$ the first one is dominated by top quark mediated 1-loop
diagram with Higgs boson in s-channel. In a significant fraction of the
parameter space $H^\pm$ are long-lived because their decays to predominantly
singlet scalar dark matter (DM) and next-to-lightest (NL) scalar, $H^\pm\to
S_{\text{DM, NL}} ff',$ are suppressed by the small singlet-doublet mixing
angle and by the moderate mass difference $ \Delta M=M_{H^+}-M_{\text{DM}} .$
The experimentally measurable displaced vertex in $H^\pm$ decays to leptons
and/or jets and missing energy allows one to discover the $H^+H^-$ signal over
the huge $W^+W^-$ background. We propose benchmark points for studies of this
scenario at the LHC. If, however, $H^\pm$ are short-lived, the subsequent
decays $S_{\text{NL}}\to S_{\text{DM}} f\bar f$ necessarily produce additional
displaced vertices that allow to reconstruct the full $H^\pm$ decay chain.
