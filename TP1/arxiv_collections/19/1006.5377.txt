The dynamical behaviors of interacting dark energy in loop quantum cosmology
are discussed in this paper. Based on defining three dimensionless variables,
we simplify the equations of the fixed points. The fixed points for interacting
dark energy can be determined by the Friedmann equation coupled with the
dynamical equations {in Einstein cosmology}. But in loop quantum cosmology,
besides the Friedmann equation, the conversation equation also give a constrain
on the fixed points. The difference of stability properties for the fixed
points in loop quantum cosmology and the ones in Einstein cosmology also have
been discussed.
