Superheated drop detector (SDD) consisting of drops of superheated liquid of
halocarbon is irradiated to neutrons and gamma-rays from 252Cf fission neutron
source and 137Cs gamma source separately. The analysis of pulse height of the
signals in the neutron and gamma-ray sensitive temperature provides strong
information on the identification of neutron and gamma-ray induced events.
