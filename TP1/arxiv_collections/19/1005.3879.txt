The two-dimensional electron system (2DES) is a unique laboratory for the
physics of interacting particles. Application of a large magnetic field
produces massively degenerate quantum levels known as Landau levels. Within a
Landau level the kinetic energy of the electrons is suppressed, and
electron-electron interactions set the only energy scale. Coulomb interactions
break the degeneracy of the Landau levels and can cause the electrons to order
into complex ground states. In the high energy single particle spectrum of this
system, we observe salient and unexpected structure that extends across a wide
range of Landau level filling fractions. The structure appears only when the
2DES is cooled to very low temperature, indicating that it arises from delicate
ground state correlations. We characterize this structure by its evolution with
changing electron density and applied magnetic field. We present two possible
models for understanding these observations. Some of the energies of the
features agree qualitatively with what might be expected for composite
Fermions, which have proven effective for interpreting other experiments in
this regime. At the same time, a simple model with electrons localized on
ordered lattice sites also generates structure similar to those observed in the
experiment. Neither of these models alone is sufficient to explain the
observations across the entire range of densities measured. The discovery of
this unexpected prominent structure in the single particle spectrum of an
otherwise thoroughly studied system suggests that there exist core features of
the 2DES that have yet to be understood.
