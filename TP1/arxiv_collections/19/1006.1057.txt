The public key cryptosystem based on rank error correcting codes (the GPT
cryptosystem) was proposed in 1991. Use of rank codes in cryptographic
applications is advantageous since it is practically impossible to utilize
combinatoric decoding. This enabled using public keys of a smaller size.
Several attacks against this system were published, including Gibson's attacks
and more recently Overbeck's attacks. A few modifications were proposed
withstanding Gibson's attack but at least one of them was broken by the
stronger attacks by Overbeck. A tool to prevent Overbeck's attack is presented
in [12]. In this paper, we apply this approach to other variants of the GPT
cryptosystem.
