We study Bianchi type $I$ cosmological model in the presence of magnetized
anisotropic dark energy. The energy-momentum tensor consists of anisotropic
fluid with anisotropic EoS $p=\omega{\rho}$ and a uniform magnetic field of
energy density $\rho_B$. We obtain exact solutions to the field equations using
the condition that expansion is proportional to the shear scalar. The physical
behavior of the model is discussed with and without magnetic field. We conclude
that universe model as well as anisotropic fluid do not approach isotropy
through the evolution of the universe.
