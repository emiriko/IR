If collider experiments demonstrate that the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (MSSM) is a good description of nature at the weak scale, the
experimental priority will be the precise determination of superpartner masses.
These masses are governed by the weak scale values of the soft supersymmetry
(SUSY)-breaking parameters, which are in turn highly dependent on the
SUSY-breaking scheme present at high scales. It is therefore of great interest
to find patterns in the soft parameters that can distinguish different high
scale SUSY-breaking structures, identify the scale at which the breaking is
communicated to the visible sector, and determine the soft breaking parameters
at that scale. In this work, we demonstrate that 1-loop Renormalization
Group~(RG) invariant quantities present in the MSSM may be used to answer each
of these questions. We apply our method first to generic flavor-blind models of
SUSY-breaking, and then examine in detail the subset of these models described
by General Gauge Mediation and the constrained MSSM with non-universal Higgs
masses. As RG invariance generally does not hold beyond leading-log order, we
investigate the magnitude and direction of the 2-loop corrections. We find that
with superpartners at the TeV scale, these 2-loop effects are either
negligible, or they are of the order of optimistic experimental uncertainties
and have definite signs, which allows them to be easily accounted for in the
overall uncertainty.
