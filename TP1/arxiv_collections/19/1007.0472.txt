Georg de Buquoy, Lord de Vaux, lived in Nove Hrady, Prague and Cerveny Hradek
for most of his productive life. From his extensive scientific contributions,
both theoretical and experimental, we expand here the discussion of his
contributions to mathematical economy. He is mainly celebrated as the first
persons to define correctly net yield and describe method for its optimization,
which was considered "strikingly modern" still in 1950. Buquoy's program was
"systematic overview of all theorems which affect maintenance and increase of
national wealth" for which he correctly defined and mathematically expressed
many economic terms. The most striking feature of Buquoy's writing is that he
was also a very influential economic practitioner. He governed one of the
wealthiest possessions in Bohemia, and perhaps in Austria, of his time. Thus
his economical thinking expands from the "political part", which is economy in
modern sense, to "...sources of national wealth, or the technical part of
national economy ...". The complexity of Buquoy's view has little match in
modern literature namely because the extent of data sources is hardly available
in modern times. The article puts Buquoy's mathematical economy contributions
in context to his mathematical physics thoughts and approaches. The last direct
citation of Buquoy's work comes from the year 2008.
