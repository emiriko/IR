We consider both experimentally and analytically the transient oscillatory
process that arises when a rapid change in voltage is applied to a
$Ba_xSr_{1-x}TiO_3$ ferroelectric thin film deposited on an $Mg0$ substrate.
High frequency ($\approx 10^{8} rad/s$) polarization oscillations are observed
in the ferroelectric sample. These can be understood using a simple
field-polarization model. In particular we obtain analytic expressions for the
oscillation frequency and the decay time of the polarization fluctuation in
terms of the material parameters. These estimations agree well with the
experimental results.
