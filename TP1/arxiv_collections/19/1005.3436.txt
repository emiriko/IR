The future development of quantum information using superconducting circuits
requires Josephson qubits [1] with long coherence times combined to a
high-fidelity readout. Major progress in the control of coherence has recently
been achieved using circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architectures [2,
3], where the qubit is embedded in a coplanar waveguide resonator (CPWR) which
both provides a well controlled electromagnetic environment and serves as qubit
readout. In particular a new qubit design, the transmon, yields reproducibly
long coherence times [4, 5]. However, a high-fidelity single-shot readout of
the transmon, highly desirable for running simple quantum algorithms or measur-
ing quantum correlations in multi-qubit experiments, is still lacking. In this
work, we demonstrate a new transmon circuit where the CPWR is turned into a
sample-and-hold detector, namely a Josephson Bifurcation Amplifer (JBA) [6, 7],
which allows both fast measurement and single-shot discrimination of the qubit
states. We report Rabi oscillations with a high visibility of 94% together with
dephasing and relaxation times longer than 0:5 \mu\s. By performing two
subsequent measurements, we also demonstrate that this new readout does not
induce extra qubit relaxation.
