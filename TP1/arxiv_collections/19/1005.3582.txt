Biofilms are matrix-enclosed microbial communities that grow at interfaces.
They exhibit significant phenotypic changes that render them resistant to many
antibacterial agents that can kill their free-swimming counterparts. Biofilms
in the environment can consist of either a single or multiple microbial
species. Previous investigations in this group demonstrated that Bdellovibrio
bacteriovorus, a gram-negative predatory bacterium that consumes other
gram-negative bacteria, could eradicate a single-species E.coli biofilm in some
conditions1. These results suggest the potential value of B. bacteriovorus in
biofilm eradication in industrial, medical and environmental contexts.
  Here we carried out investigation of the potential of Bdellovibrio
bacteriovorus to interact with and remove multi-species biofilms, specifically
dual-species biofilms of E. coli (gram-negative prey) and M. luteus
(gram-positive decoy) at interfaces between liquid and air. We examined whether
this kind of dual-species biofilms is more, less, or equally susceptible to B.
bacteriovorus attack compared to their single-species counterparts. Different
research methods including bacterial culture, cell counting, crystal violet
staining, gram staining, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and
atomic force microscopy were exploited to gain an insight into Bdellovibrio's
interaction with biofilms. Our experiments showed that B. bacteriovorus not
only consumes E. coli but also weakens the attachment of M. luteus to the solid
surface, rendering the biofilms susceptible to removal. B. bacteriovorus keeps
in check not only prey but also decoy bacterial populations in the surrounding
media, the latter probably via competition for nutrients. These experiments
encourage us to consider how B. bacteriovorus might be used to control biofilms
in the environment.
