The magnetic properties of Co3V2O8 have been studied by single-crystal
neutron-diffraction. In zero magnetic field, the observed broadening of the
magnetic Bragg peaks suggests the presence of disorder both in the
low-temperature ferromagnetic and in the higher-temperature antiferromagnetic
state. The field dependence of the intensity and position of the magnetic
reflections in Co3V2O8 reveals a complex sequence of phase transitions in this
Kagome staircase compound. For H//a, a commensurate-incommensurate-commensurate
transition is found in a field of 0.072 T in the antiferromagnetic phase at 7.5
K. For H//c at low-temperature, an applied field induces an unusual
transformation from a ferromagnetic to an antiferromagnetic state at about 1 T
accompanied by a sharp increase in magnetisation.
