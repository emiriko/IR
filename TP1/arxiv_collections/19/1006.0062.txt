We consider a model where right-handed neutrinos and sneutrinos are
introduced to the minimal supersymmetric standard model. In the scalar
potential of this model, there exist trilinear and quartic terms in scalar
potential that are proportional to Yukawa couplings of neutrinos. Due to these
trilinear and quartic terms, Color and/or Charge Breaking (CCB) and
Unbounded-From-Below (UFB) directions appear along which sneutrinos have a
vacuum expectation value, making the vacuum of the electroweak symmetry
breaking unstable. We analyze scalar potential of this model and derive
necessary conditions for CCB and UFB directions to vanish.
