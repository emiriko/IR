The bulk viscosity in spin-one color-superconducting strange quark matter is
calculated by taking into account the interplay between the nonleptonic and
semi-leptonic week processes. In agreement with previous studies, it is found
that the inclusion of the semi-leptonic processes may result in non-negligible
corrections to the bulk viscosity in a narrow window of temperatures. The
effect is generally more pronounced for pulsars with longer periods. Compared
to the normal phase, however, this effect due to the semi-leptonic processes is
less pronounced in spin-one color superconductors. Assuming that the critical
temperature of the phase transition is much larger than 40 keV, the main effect
of spin-one color superconductivity in a wide range of temperatures is an
overall increase of the bulk viscosity with respect to the normal phase. The
corresponding enhancement factor reaches up to about 9 in the polar and
A-phases, about 25 in the planar phase and about 29 in the CSL phase. This
factor is determined by the suppression of the nonleptonic rate in
color-superconducting matter and, therefore, may be even larger if all quark
quasiparticles happen to be gapped.
