We present a catalog of cross-correlated radio, infrared and X-ray sources
using a very restrictive selection criteria with an IDL-based code developed by
us. The significance of the observed coincidences was evaluated through Monte
Carlo simulations of synthetic sources following a well-tested protocol. We
found 3320 coincident radio/X-ray sources with a high statistical significance
characterized by the sum of error-weighted coordinate differences. For 997 of
them, 2MASS counterparts were found. The percentage of chance coincidences is
less than 1%. X-ray hardness ratios of well-known populations of objects were
used to provide a crude representation of their X-ray spectrum and to make a
preliminary diagnosis of the possible nature of unidentified X-ray sources. The
results support the fact that the X-ray sky is largely dominated by Active
Galactic Nuclei at high galactic latitudes (|b| >= 10^\circ). At low galactic
latitudes (|b| <= 10^\circ) most of unidentified X-ray sources (~94%) lie at
|b| <= 2^\circ. This result suggests that most of the unidentified sources
found toward the Milky Way plane are galactic objects. Well-known and
unidentified sources were classified in different tables with their
corresponding radio/infrared and X-ray properties. These tables are intended as
a useful tool for researchers interested in particular identifications.
