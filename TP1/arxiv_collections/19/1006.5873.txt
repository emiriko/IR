We present the first detailed spatio-kinematical analysis and modelling of
the planetary nebula Abell 41, which is known to contain the well-studied
close-binary system MT Ser. This object represents an important test case in
the study of the evolution of planetary nebulae with binary central stars as
current evolutionary theories predict that the binary plane should be aligned
perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the nebula.
  Deep narrowband imaging in the light of [NII], [OIII] and [SII], obtained
using ACAM on the William Herschel Telescope, has been used to investigate the
ionisation structure of Abell 41. Longslit observations of the H-alpha and
[NII] emission were obtained using the Manchester Echelle Spectrometer on the
2.1-m San Pedro M\'artir Telescope. These spectra, combined with the narrowband
imagery, were used to develop a spatio-kinematical model of [NII] emission from
Abell 41. The best fitting model reveals Abell 41 to have a waisted, bipolar
structure with an expansion velocity of ~40km\s at the waist. The symmetry axis
of the model nebula is within 5$\degr$ of perpendicular to the orbital plane of
the central binary system. This provides strong evidence that the close-binary
system, MT Ser, has directly affected the shaping of its nebula, Abell 41.
  Although the theoretical link between bipolar planetary nebulae and binary
central stars is long established, this nebula is only the second to have this
link, between nebular symmetry axis and binary plane, proved observationally.
