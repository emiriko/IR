Parameters of a high frequency capacitive discharge in argon in axially
symmetric chambers of different geometries are studied in experiments and by
means of two-dimensional kinetic modeling by the Particle-in-Cell method. It is
demonstrated that a change in the ratio of the areas of the driven and grounded
electrodes can substantially increase the ion energy on the electrode
practically without disturbing the plasma parameters. Particular attention is
paid to studying the self-bias voltage and the ion distribution function on the
electrode for gas pressures ranging from 15 to 70 mTorr. The results of
self-consistent calculations are in good agreement with experimental data.
