We present transport, Hall effect, electronic tunnelling and penetration
depth studies in 3D homogeneously disordered epitaxial NbN thin films with
disorder ranging from the moderately clean limit (k_Fl~10.12) to the very dirty
limit (k_Fl~1.24). The superconducting transition temperature (T_c) decreases
from ~17K to less than 350mK with increasing disorder. The T_c and conductivity
at the lowest temperature both asymptotically approach zero as k_Fl tends to 1,
indicating a coincidence of the metal-insulator transition (MIT) and the
superconductor-insulator transition. Close to critical disorder there is
spatial inhomogeneity in the superconducting density of states (DOS) and the
superconducting state is governed by quantum phase fluctuations. This results
in suppression of the superfluid density (n_s) and a pseudogap state where the
resistance is no longer zero but the energy gap remains finite
