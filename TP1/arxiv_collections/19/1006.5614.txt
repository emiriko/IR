We present a new Monte Carlo tool that computes full tree-level matrix
elements in high-energy physics. The program accepts user-defined models and
has no restrictions on the process multiplicity. To achieve acceptable
performance, CAMORRA evaluates the matrix elements in a recursive way by
combining off-shell currents. Furthermore, CAMORRA can be used to compute
amplitudes involving continuous color and helicity final states.
