We give an explicit, rigorous framework for calculating quantum probabilities
in a model theory of quantum gravity. Specifically, we construct the
decoherence functional for the Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of a flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology with a free, massless, minimally coupled
scalar field, thus providing a complete decoherent histories formulation for
this quantum cosmological model. The decoherence functional is applied to study
predictions concerning the model's Dirac (relational) observables; the behavior
of semiclassical states and superpositions of such states; and to study the
singular behavior of quantum Wheeler-DeWitt universes. Within this framework,
rigorous formulae are given for calculating the corresponding probabilities
from the wave function when those probabilities may be consistently defined,
thus replacing earlier heuristics for interpreting the wave function of the
universe with explicit constructions. It is shown according to a rigorously
formulated standard, and in a quantum-mechanically consistent way, that in this
quantization these models are generically singular. Independent of the choice
of state we show that the probability for these Wheeler-DeWitt quantum
universes to ever encounter a singularity is unity. In addition, the relation
between histories formulations of quantum theory and relational Dirac
observables is clarified.
