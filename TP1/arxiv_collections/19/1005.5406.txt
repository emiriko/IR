Advances in stellar interior modeling are being driven by new data from
large-scale surveys and high-precision photometric and spectroscopic
observations. Here we focus on single stars in normal evolutionary phases; we
will not discuss the many advances in modeling star formation, interacting
binaries, supernovae, or neutron stars. We review briefly: 1) updates to input
physics of stellar models; 2) progress in two and three-dimensional evolution
and hydrodynamic models; 3) insights from oscillation data used to infer
stellar interior structure and validate model predictions (asteroseismology).
We close by highlighting a few outstanding problems, e.g., the driving
mechanisms for hybrid gamma Dor/delta Sct star pulsations, the cause of giant
eruptions seen in luminous blue variables such as eta Car and P Cyg, and the
solar abundance problem.
