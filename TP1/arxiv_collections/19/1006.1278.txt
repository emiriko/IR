Heavy flavor hadrons, i.e. those containing charm and bottom quarks, will be
abundantly produced at the LHC and are important probes of the Quark-Gluon
Plasma (QGP). Of particular interest is the investigation of parton energy loss
in the medium. Using heavy flavor jets we will have a pure sample of quark jets
with which to study the color-charge effects on energy loss. In addition,
studies of bottom production in p+p collision at LHC energies will be utilized
to further constrain the current parameters used by NLO and FONLL calculations.
The talk will focus on the very high-pt electron particle identification using
the EMCal detector. We present the electron reconstruction and measurements
which can be achieved with 1 nominal year of Pb-Pb running at 5.5 TeV. We then
estimate the rate of non-photonic electrons and present systematic and
statistical error bars. Finally, we show preliminary results on B-jet tagging
techniques in p+p which utilize jet-finding algorithms (FASTJET) in conjunction
with displaced secondary vertices containing high-pt electrons.
