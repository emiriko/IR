We present an analytical derivation of the coupling parameter relating the
angle between two interfering beams in a heterodyne interferometer to the
differential phase-signals detected by a quadrant photo-diode. This technique,
also referred to as Differential Wavefront Sensing (DWS), is commonly used in
space-based gravitational wave detectors to determine the attitude of a
test-mass in one of the interferometer arms from the quadrant diode signals.
Successive approximations to the analytical expression are made to simplify the
investigation of parameter dependencies. Motivated by our findings, we propose
a new measurement method to accurately determine the absolute wave-front
curvature of a single measurement beam. We also investigate the change in
coupling parameter when the interferometer "test-mirror" is moved from its
nominal position, an effect which mediates the coupling of mirror displacement
noise into differential phase-measurements.
