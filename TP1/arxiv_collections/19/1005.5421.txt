The XENON100 and CRESST experiments will directly test the inelastic dark
matter explanation for DAMA's 8.9? sigma anomaly. This article discusses how
predictions for direct detection experiments depend on uncertainties in
quenching factor measurements, the dark matter interaction with the Standard
Model and the halo velocity distribution. When these uncertainties are
accounted for, an order of magnitude variation is found in the number of
expected events at CRESST and XENON100.
