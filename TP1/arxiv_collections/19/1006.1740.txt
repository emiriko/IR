In this theoretical study, we show that a simple endlessly single-mode
photonic crystal fiber can be designed to yield, not just two, but three
zero-dispersion wavelengths. The presence of a third dispersion zero creates a
rich phase-matching topology, enabling enhanced control over the spectral
locations of the four-wave-mixing and resonant-radiation bands emitted by
solitons and short pulses. The greatly enhanced flexibility in the positioning
of these bands has applications in wavelength conversion, supercontinuum
generation and pair-photon sources for quantum optics.
