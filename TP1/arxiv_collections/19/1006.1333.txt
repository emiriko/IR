We performed model calculations of Raman responses for multiband 2D
superconductors. The multiband effects of screening in the A_{1g} symmetry
channel were investigated analytically and numerically for a band structure
model mimicing ARPES data on iron-pnictide materials. An acceptable agreement
between our model calculations and recent experimental data is demonstrated by
modification of the band structure parameters.
