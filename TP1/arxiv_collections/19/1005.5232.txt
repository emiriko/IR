MKM has been defined as the quest for technologies to manage mathematical
knowledge. MKM "in the small" is well-studied, so the real problem is to scale
up to large, highly interconnected corpora: "MKM in the large". We contend that
advances in two areas are needed to reach this goal. We need representation
languages that support incremental processing of all primitive MKM operations,
and we need software architectures and implementations that implement these
operations scalably on large knowledge bases.
  We present instances of both in this paper: the MMT framework for modular
theory-graphs that integrates meta-logical foundations, which forms the base of
the next OMDoc version; and TNTBase, a versioned storage system for XML-based
document formats. TNTBase becomes an MMT database by instantiating it with
special MKM operations for MMT.
