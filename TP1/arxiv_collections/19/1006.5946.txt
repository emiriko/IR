The structural misfit compound (PbSe)1.16(TiSe2)2 is reported. It is a
superconductor with a Tc of 2.3 K. (PbSe)1.16(TiSe2)2 derives from a parent
compound, TiSe2, which shows a charge density wave transition and no
superconductivity. The crystal structure, characterized by high resolution
electron microscopy and powder x-ray diffraction, consists of two layers of
1T-TiSe2 alternating with a double layer of (100) PbSe. Transport measurements
suggest that the superconductivity is induced by charge transfer from the PbSe
layers to the TiSe2 layers.
