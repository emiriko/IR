We apply multiple testing procedures to the validation of estimated default
probabilities in credit rating systems. The goal is to identify rating classes
for which the probability of default is estimated inaccurately, while still
maintaining a predefined level of committing type I errors as measured by the
familywise error rate (FWER) and the false discovery rate (FDR). For FWER, we
also consider procedures that take possible discreteness of the data resp. test
statistics into account. The performance of these methods is illustrated in a
simulation setting and for empirical default data.
