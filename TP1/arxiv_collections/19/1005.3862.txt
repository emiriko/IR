Evolutionary branching points are a paradigmatic feature of adaptive
dynamics, because they are potential starting points for adaptive
diversification. The antithesis to evolutionary branching points are
Continuously stable strategies (CSS's), which are convergent stable and
evolutionarily stable equilibrium points of the adaptive dynamics and hence are
thought to represent endpoints of adaptive processes. However, this assessment
is based on situations in which the invasion fitness function determining the
adaptive dynamics have non-zero second derivatives at a CSS. Here we show that
the scope of evolutionary branching can increase if the invasion fitness
function vanishes to higher than first order at a CSS. Using a class of
classical models for frequency-dependent competition, we show that if the
invasion fitness vanishes to higher orders, a CSS may be the starting point for
evolutionary branching, with the only additional requirement that mutant types
need to reach a certain threshold frequency, which can happen e.g. due to
demographic stochasticity. Thus, when invasion fitness functions vanish to
higher than first order at equilibrium points of the adaptive dynamics,
evolutionary diversification can occur even after convergence to an
evolutionarily stable strategy.
