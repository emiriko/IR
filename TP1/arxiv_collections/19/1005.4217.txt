The self adjoint operator of time in non-relativistic quantum mechanics is
found within the approach where the ordinary Hamiltonian is not taken to be
conjugate to time. The operator version of the reexpressed Liouville equation
with the total Hamiltonian, consisting of the part that is a conventional
function of coordinate and momentum and the part that is conjugate to time, is
considered. The von Neumann equation with quantized time is found and discussed
from the point of view of exact time measurement.
