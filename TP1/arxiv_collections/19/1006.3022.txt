Proteinaceous aggregation occurs through self-assembly-- a process not
entirely understood. In a recent article [1], an analytical theory for amyloid
fibril growth via secondary rather than primary nucleation was presented.
Remarkably, with only a single kinetic parameter, the authors were able to
unify growth characteristics for a variety of experimental data. In essence,
they seem to have uncovered the underlying allometric laws governing the
evolution of filament elongation simply from two coupled non-linear ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) stemming from a master equation. While this work
adds significantly to our understanding of filament self-assembly, it required
an approximate analytical solution representation. Here, we show that the same
results are found by purely numerical means once a straightforward and reliable
numerical solution to the set of ODEs has been established.
