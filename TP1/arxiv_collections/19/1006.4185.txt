It is well-known that a particle falling into a black hole will definitely
reach the center in finite proper time if it enters the sphere of radius
$3r_{s}/2$ where $r_{s}$ is the Schwarzschild radius. It is usually assumed
that once the particle reaches the central singularity, it stops. Here it shall
be shown that there are no theoretical reasons for this assumption. In fact,
due to the time-reversal symmetry of the equation of motion, it is more
``natural'' to assume that the particle will travel through the singularity and
come out on the other side. Of course, it is not possible to compute the
trajectory of the particle at the singularity itself. However, one may compute
the trajectory just before entry and just after exit. The continuity of the two
pieces at the singularity is maintained through energy and angular momentum
conservation conditions. The results of such computations are shown here. Also,
for the particle to come to a stop at the center, there must exist
nonconservative forces at that point. Such forces being unknown both
theoretically and experimentally, it is prudent to disregard them.
