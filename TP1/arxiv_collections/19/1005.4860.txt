Lipid monolayers have been shown to represent a powerful tool in studying
mechanical and thermodynamic properties of lipid membranes as well as their
interaction with proteins. Using Einstein's theory of fluctuations we here
demonstrate, that an experimentally derived linear relationship both between
transition entropy S and area A as well as between transition entropy and
charge q implies a linear relationships between compressibility \kappa_T, heat
capacity c_\pi, thermal expansion coefficient \alpha_T and electric capacity
CT. We demonstrate that these couplings have strong predictive power as they
allow calculating electrical and thermal properties from mechanical
measurements. The precision of the prediction increases as the critical point
TC is approached.
