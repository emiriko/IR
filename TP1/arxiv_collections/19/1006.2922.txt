We study numerically the dynamics of quantized vortices and solitons induced
by an oscillating potential inside a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. The
dynamics of the topological defects is much different from the case for a
linear uniform object; the metamorphosis between vortices and solitons is
characteristic of the dynamics. We discuss how vortices are nucleated by an
oscillating potential.
