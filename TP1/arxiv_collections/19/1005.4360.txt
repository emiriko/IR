A joint characterisation of the controllability and observability of a
particular kind of discrete system has been developed. The key idea of the
procedure can be reduced to a correct choice of the sampling sequence. This
freedom, owing to the arbitrary choice of the sampling instants, is used to
improve the sensitivity of system controllability and observability, by
exploiting an adequate geometric structure. Some qualitative examples are
presented for illustrative purposes.
