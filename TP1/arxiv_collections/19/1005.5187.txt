This modeling work investigates the electrical modulation characteristics of
field-effect gated nanopores. Highly nonlinear current modulations are observed
in nanopores with non-overlapping electric double layers, including those with
pore diameters 100 times the Debye screening length. We attribute this extended
field-effect gating to a descreening effect, i.e. the counter-ions do not fully
relax to screen the gating potential due to the presence of strong ionic
transport.
