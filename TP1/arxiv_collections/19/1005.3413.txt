Acoustic mechanics of air-reed instruments is investigated numerically with
compressible Large-eddy simulation (LES). Taking a two dimensional air-reed
instrument model, we have succeeded in reproducing sound oscillations excited
in the resonator and have studied the characteristic feature of air-reed
instruments, i.e., the relation of the sound frequency with the jet velocity
described by the semi-empirical theory developed by Cremer & Ising, Coltman and
other authors based on experimental results.
