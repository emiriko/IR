We introduce a new class of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, which we
call free energy SMC. This class is inspired by free energy methods, which
originate from Physics, and where one samples from a biased distribution such
that a given function $\xi(\theta)$ of the state $\theta$ is forced to be
uniformly distributed over a given interval. From an initial sequence of
distributions $(\pi_t)$ of interest, and a particular choice of $\xi(\theta)$,
a free energy SMC sampler computes sequentially a sequence of biased
distributions $(\tilde{\pi}_{t})$ with the following properties: (a) the
marginal distribution of $\xi(\theta)$ with respect to $\tilde{\pi}_{t}$ is
approximatively uniform over a specified interval, and (b) $\tilde{\pi}_{t}$
and $\pi_{t}$ have the same conditional distribution with respect to $\xi$. We
apply our methodology to mixture posterior distributions, which are highly
multimodal. In the mixture context, forcing certain hyper-parameters to higher
values greatly faciliates mode swapping, and makes it possible to recover a
symetric output. We illustrate our approach with univariate and bivariate
Gaussian mixtures and two real-world datasets.
