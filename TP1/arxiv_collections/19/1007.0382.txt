Many techniques exist to reconstruct New Physics masses from LHC data, though
these tend to either require high luminosity O(100) fb^-1, or an accurate
measurement of missing transverse energy (MET) which may not be available in
the early running of the LHC. Since in popular models such as SUSY a fairly
sharp, triangular dilepton invariant mass spectrum can emerge already at low
luminosity O(1) fb^-1, a Decay Kinematics (DK) technique can be used on events
near the dilepton mass endpoint to estimate squark, slepton, and neutralino
masses without relying on MET. With the first 2 fb^-1 of 7 TeV LHC data SPS1a
masses can thus be found to 20% or better accuracy, at least several times
better than what has been taken to be achievable.
