More than 450 extrasolar planets are known to date. To detect these
intriguing objects, many photometric and radial velocity (RV) surveys are in
progress. We developed the Keplerian FITting (KFIT) code, to model published
and available RV data. KFIT is based on a hybrid, quasi-global optimization
technique relying on the Genetic Algorithms and simplex algorithm. Here, we
re-analyse the RV data of evolved K3III star HD 240210. We confirm three
equally good solutions which might be interpreted as signals of 2-planet
systems. Remarkably, one of these best-fits describes the long-term stable
two-planet system, involved in the 2:1~mean motion resonance (MMR). It may be
the first instance of this strong MMR in a multi-planet system hosted by
evolved star, as the 2:1 MMR configurations are already found around a few
solar dwarfs.
