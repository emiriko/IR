We revisit the issue of the limit on the scale of Left-Right symmetry
breaking. We focus on the minimal SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_B-L gauge theory
with the seesaw mechanism and discuss the two possibilities of defining
Left-Right symmetry as parity or charge conjugation. In the commonly adopted
case of parity, we perform a complete numerical study of the quark mass
matrices and the associated left and right mixing matrices without any
assumptions usually made in the literature about the ratio of vacuum
expectation values. We find that the usual lower limit on the mass of the
right-handed gauge boson from the K mass difference, M_WR>2.5TeV, is subject to
a possible small reduction due to the difference between right and left Cabibbo
angles. In the case of charge conjugation the limit on M_WR is somewhat more
robust. However, the more severe bounds from CP-violating observables are
absent in this case. In fact, the free phases can also resolve the present mild
discrepancy between the Standard Model and CP-violation in the $B$-sector.
Thus, even in the minimal case, both charged and neutral gauge bosons may be
accessible at the Large Hadron Collider with spectacular signatures of lepton
number violation.
