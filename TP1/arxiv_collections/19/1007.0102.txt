We have introduced a mechanism for synchronizing chaotic systems by one way
coupling with a variable delay that is reset at finite intervals. Here we
extend this method to time delay systems and suggest a new cryptosystem based
on this. We present the stability analysis as applied to time delay systems and
supplement this by numerical simulations in a standard time delay system like
Mackey Glass system. We extend the theory to multi- delay systems and propose a
bi channel scheme for the implementation of the scheme for communication with
enhanced security. We show that since the synchronizing channel carries
information from transmitter only at intervals of reset time, it is not
susceptible to reconstruction. The message channel being separate can be made
complex by linear combination of transmitter variable at different delay times
using mutiple delay systems. This method has the additional advantage that it
can be adjusted to be delay or anticipatory in synchronization and these
provide two additional basic keys that are independent of system delay.
