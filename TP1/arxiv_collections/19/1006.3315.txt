We perform three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical calculations of
neutron star mergers to assess the reliability of an approximate treatment of
thermal effects in such simulations by combining an ideal-gas component with
zero-temperature, micro-physical equations of state. To this end we compare the
results of simulations that make this approximation to the outcome of models
with a consistent treatment of thermal effects in the equation of state. In
particular we focus on the implications for observable consequences of merger
events like the gravitational-wave signal. It is found that the characteristic
gravitational-wave oscillation frequencies of the post-merger remnant differ by
about 50 to 250 Hz (corresponding to frequency shifts of 2 to 8 per cent)
depending on the equation of state and the choice of the characteristic index
of the ideal-gas component. In addition, the delay time to black hole collapse
of the merger remnant as well as the amount of matter remaining outside the
black hole after its formation are sensitive to the description of thermal
effects.
