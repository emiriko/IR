This paper will propose a novel star schema attribute induction as a new
attribute induction paradigm and as improving from current attribute oriented
induction. A novel star schema attribute induction will be examined with
current attribute oriented induction based on characteristic rule and using non
rule based concept hierarchy by implementing both of approaches. In novel star
schema attribute induction some improvements have been implemented like
elimination threshold number as maximum tuples control for generalization
result, there is no ANY as the most general concept, replacement the role
concept hierarchy with concept tree, simplification for the generalization
strategy steps and elimination attribute oriented induction algorithm. Novel
star schema attribute induction is more powerful than the current attribute
oriented induction since can produce small number final generalization tuples
and there is no ANY in the results.
