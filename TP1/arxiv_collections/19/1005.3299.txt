Charged-hadron transverse-momentum and pseudorapidity distributions in
proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV are measured with the inner
tracking system of the CMS detector at the LHC. The charged-hadron yield is
obtained by counting the number of reconstructed hits, hit-pairs, and fully
reconstructed charged-particle tracks. The combination of the three methods
gives a charged-particle multiplicity per unit of pseudorapidity,
dN(charged)/d(eta), for |eta| < 0.5, of 5.78 +/- 0.01 (stat) +/- 0.23 (syst)
for non-single-diffractive events, higher than predicted by commonly used
models. The relative increase in charged-particle multiplicity from sqrt(s) =
0.9 to 7 TeV is 66.1% +/- 1.0% (stat) +/- 4.2% (syst). The mean transverse
momentum is measured to be 0.545 +/- 0.005 (stat) +/- 0.015 (syst) GeV/c. The
results are compared with similar measurements at lower energies.
