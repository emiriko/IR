We quantitatively investigate the non-classicality and non-locality of a
whole new class of mixed disparate quantum and semiquantum photon sources at
the quantum-classical boundary. The latter include photon added thermal and
photon added coherent sources, experimentally investigated recently by Zavatta
et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 140406 (2009)]. The key quantity in our
investigations is the visibility of the corresponding photon-photon correlation
function. We present explicit results on the violations of the Cauchy-Schwarz
inequality - which is a measure of nonclassicality - as well as of Bell-type
inequalities.
