Motivated by the strong discrepancy between the main sequence turn-off age
and the white dwarf cooling age in the metal-rich open cluster NGC 6791, we
compute a grid of white dwarf evolutionary sequences that incorporates for the
first time the energy released by the processes of 22Ne sedimentation and of
carbon/oxygen phase separation upon crystallization. The grid covers the mass
range from 0.52 to 1.0 Msun, and it is appropriate for the study of white
dwarfs in metal-rich clusters. The evolutionary calculations are based on a
detailed and self-consistent treatment of the energy released from these two
processes, as well as on the employment of realistic carbon/oxygen profiles, of
relevance for an accurate evaluation of the energy released by carbon/oxygen
phase separation. We find that 22Ne sedimentation strongly delays the cooling
rate of white dwarfs stemming from progenitors with high metallicities at
moderate luminosities, whilst carbon/oxygen phase separation adds considerable
delays at low luminosities. Cooling times are sensitive to possible
uncertainties in the actual value of the diffusion coefficient of 22Ne.
Changing the diffusion coefficient by a factor of 2, leads to maximum age
differences of approx. 8-20% depending on the stellar mass. We find that the
magnitude of the delays resulting from chemical changes in the core is
consistent with the slow down in the white dwarf cooling rate that is required
to solve the age discrepancy in NGC 6791.
