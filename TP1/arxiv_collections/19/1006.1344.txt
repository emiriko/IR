The Dirac equation in curved spacetimes is formulated using coordinate-free
notation. A Lagrangean density which corresponds to the subject equation is
presented. The subject equation is invariant under a local rotation of the
coframe. The current is independent of the local orientation of the coframe and
it is conserved. The subject equation has an equivalent formulation which uses
the Christoffel gamma. The stress-energy tensor is calculated.
