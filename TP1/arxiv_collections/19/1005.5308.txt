In this review paper, we present and critically re-examine the formal
expressions for the electrophoretic effect and the ionic field appearing in the
unpublished Yale University PhD dissertation of W. S. Wilson which form the
basis of the Onsager--Wilson theory of the Wien effect in the binary strong
electrolyte solutions. It is pointed out that some of the integrals that make
up the flow velocity formula obtained in the thesis and he evaluated at the
position of the center ion in the ionic atmosphere (i.e., the coordinate
origin) diverge. Therefore they cannot be evaluated by means of contour
integrals in the manner performed in his thesis for the reason pointed out in
the text of this paper. In this paper, the results for the integrals in
question are presented, which are alternatively and exactly evaluated. The
details will be described in the follow-up paper presented elsewhere together
with the improved formula for the Wien effect on conductivity.
