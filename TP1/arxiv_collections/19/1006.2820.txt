Crosstalk in VLSI interconnects is a major constrain in DSM and UDSM
technology. Among various strategies followed for its minimization, shield
insertion between Aggressor and Victim is one of the prominent options. This
paper analyzes the extent of crosstalk in inductively coupled interconnects and
minimizes the same through distributed shield insertion. Comparison is drawn
between signal voltage and crosstalk voltage in three different conditions i.e.
prior to shield insertion, after shield insertion and after additional ground
tap insertion at shield terminal.
