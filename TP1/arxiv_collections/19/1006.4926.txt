In the context of strategic games, we provide an axiomatic proof of the
statement Common knowledge of rationality implies that the players will choose
only strategies that survive the iterated elimination of strictly dominated
strategies. Rationality here means playing only strategies one believes to be
best responses. This involves looking at two formal languages. One is
first-order, and is used to formalise optimality conditions, like avoiding
strictly dominated strategies, or playing a best response. The other is a modal
fixpoint language with expressions for optimality, rationality and belief.
Fixpoints are used to form expressions for common belief and for iterated
elimination of non-optimal strategies.
