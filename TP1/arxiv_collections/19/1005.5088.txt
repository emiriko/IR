We propose a simple, yet highly efficient and robust device for producing
valley polarized current in graphene. The device comprises of two distinct
components; a region of uniform uniaxial strain, adjacent to an out-of-plane
magnetic barrier configuration formed by patterned ferromagnetic gates. We show
that when the amount of strain, magnetic field strength, and Fermi level are
properly tuned, the output current can be made to consist of only a single
valley contribution. Perfect valley filtering is achievable within
experimentally accessible parameters.
