In this paper, we briefly review the concept of memory circuit elements,
namely memristors, memcapacitors and meminductors, and then discuss some
applications by focusing mainly on the first class. We present several
examples, their modeling and applications ranging from analog programming to
biological systems. Since the phenomena associated with memory are ubiquitous
at the nanoscale, we expect the interest in these circuit elements to increase
in coming years.
