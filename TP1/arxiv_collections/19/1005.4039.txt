Giant protoplanets formed by gravitational instability in the outer regions
of circumstellar disks go through an early phase of quasi-static contraction
during which radii are large and internal temperatures are low. The main source
of opacity in these objects is dust grains. We investigate two problems
involving the effect of opacity on the evolution of planets of 3, 5, and 7 M_J.
First, we pick three different overall metallicities for the planet and simply
scale the opacity accordingly. We show that higher metallicity results in
slower contraction as a result of higher opacity. It is found that the
pre-collapse time scale is proportional to the metallicity. In this scenario,
survival of giant planets formed by gravitational instability is predicted to
be more likely around low-metallicity stars, since they evolve to the point of
collapse to small size on shorter time scales. But metal-rich planets, as a
result of longer contraction times, have the best opportunity to capture
planetesimals and form heavy-element cores. Second, we investigate the effects
of opacity reduction as a result of grain growth and settling, for the same
three planetary masses and for three different values of overall metallicity.
When these processes are included, the pre-collapse time scale is found to be
of order 1000 years for the three masses, significantly shorter than the time
scale calculated without these effects. In this case the time scale is found to
be relatively insensitive to planetary mass and composition. However, the
effects of planetary rotation and accretion of gas and dust, which could
increase the timescale, are not included in the calculation. The short time
scale we find would preclude metal enrichment by planetesimal capture, as well
as heavy-element core formation, over a large range of planetary masses and
metallicities.
