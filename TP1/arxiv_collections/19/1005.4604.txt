Starting in winter 2008/2009 an L-band 7-Feed-Array receiver is used for a
21-cm line survey performed with the 100-m telescope, the Effelsberg-Bonn HI
survey (EBHIS). The EBHIS will cover the whole northern hemisphere for decl.>-5
deg comprising both the galactic and extragalactic sky out to a distance of
about 230 Mpc. Using state-of-the-art FPGA-based digital fast Fourier transform
spectrometers, superior in dynamic range and temporal resolution to
conventional correlators, allows us to apply sophisticated radio frequency
interference (RFI) mitigation schemes.
  In this paper, the EBHIS data reduction package and first results are
presented. The reduction software consists of RFI detection schemes, flux and
gain-curve calibration, stray-radiation removal, baseline fitting, and finally
the gridding to produce data cubes. The whole software chain is successfully
tested using multi-feed data toward many smaller test fields (1--100 square
degrees) and recently applied for the first time to data of two large sky
areas, each covering about 2000 square degrees. The first large area is toward
the northern galactic pole and the second one toward the northern tip of the
Magellanic Leading Arm. Here, we demonstrate the data quality of EBHIS Milky
Way data and give a first impression on the first data release in 2011.
