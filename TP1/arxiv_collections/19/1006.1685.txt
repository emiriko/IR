We investigate the Mott transitions of three-component (colors) repulsive
fermionic atoms in optical lattices using the dynamical mean field theory. We
find that for SU(3) symmetry breaking interactions the Mott transition occurs
at incommensurate half filling. As a result, a characteristic Mott insulating
state appears, where paired atoms with two different colors and atoms with the
third color are localized at different sites. We also find another Mott state
where atoms with two different colors are localized at different sites and
atoms with the third color remain itinerant. We demonstrate that these exotic
Mott phases can be detected by experimental double occupancy observations.
