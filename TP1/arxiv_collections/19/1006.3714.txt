The article provides ready-to-use 1pN-accurate frequency-domain gravitational
wave forms for eccentric nonspinning compact binaries of arbitrary mass ratio
including the first post-Newtonian (1pN) point particle corrections to the
far-zone gravitational wave amplitude, given in terms of tensor spherical
harmonics. The averaged equations for the decay of the eccentricity and growth
of radial frequency due to radiation reaction are used to provide stationary
phase approximations to the frequency-domain wave forms.
