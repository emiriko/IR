We consider two entropic uncertainty relations of position and momentum
recently discussed in literature. By a suitable rescaling of one of them, we
obtain a smooth interpolation of both for high-resolution and low-resolution
measurements respectively. Because our interpolation has never been mentioned
in literature before, we propose it as a candidate for an improved entropic
uncertainty relation of position and momentum. Up to now, the author has
neither been able to falsify nor prove the new inequality. In our opinion it is
a challenge to do either one.
