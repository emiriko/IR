For every positive integer k we consider the class SCCk of all finite graphs
whose strongly connected components have size at most k. We show that for every
k, the Modal mu-Calculus fixpoint hierarchy on SCCk collapses to the level
Delta2, but not to Comp(Sigma1,Pi1) (compositions of formulas of level Sigma1
and Pi1). This contrasts with the class of all graphs, where
Delta2=Comp(Sigma1,Pi1).
