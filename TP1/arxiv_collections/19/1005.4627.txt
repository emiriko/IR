We prove density of hyperbolicity in spaces of (i) real transcendental entire
functions, bounded on the real line, whose singular set is finite and real and
(ii) transcendental self-maps of the punctured plane which preserve the circle
and whose singular set (apart from zero and infinity) is contained in the
circle. In particular, we prove density of hyperbolicity in the famous Arnol'd
family of circle maps and its generalizations, and solve a number of other open
problems for these functions, including three conjectures by de Melo, Salom\~ao
and Vargas.
  We also prove density of (real) hyperbolicity for certain families as in (i)
but without the boundedness condition. Our results apply, in particular, when
the functions in question have only finitely many critical points and
asymptotic singularities, or when there are no asymptotic values and the degree
of critical points is uniformly bounded.
