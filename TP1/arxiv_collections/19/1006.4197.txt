The LEPS/SPring-8 experiment made a comprehensive measurement of the
spin-density matrix elements for $\gamma p \to \phi p$, $\gamma d \to \phi p n$
and $\gamma d \to \phi d$ at forward production angles. A linearly polarized
photon beam at $E_{\gamma}$=1.6-2.4 GeV was used for the production of $\phi$
mesons. The natural-parity Pomeron exchange processes remains dominant
nearthreshold. The unnatural-parity processes of pseudoscalar exchange is
visible in the production from nucleons but is greatly reduced in the coherent
production from deuterons. There is no strong $E_{\gamma}$-dependence, but some
dependence on momentum-transfer. A small but finite value of the spin-density
matrix elements reflecting helicity-nonconserving amplitudes in the $t$-channel
is observed.
