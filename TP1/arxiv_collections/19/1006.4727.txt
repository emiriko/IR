We propose a scheme to evaluate the amount of quantum discord and
entanglement of formation for mixed states, and reveal their ordering relation
via an intrinsic relationship between the two quantities distributed in
different partners of the associated purification. This approach enables us to
achieve analytical expressions of the two measures for a sort of quantum
states, such as an arbitrary two-qubit density matrix reduced from pure
three-qubit states and a class of rank-2 mixed states of 4\times 2 systems.
Moreover, we apply the scheme to characterize fully the dynamical behavior of
quantum correlations for the specified physical systems under decoherence.
