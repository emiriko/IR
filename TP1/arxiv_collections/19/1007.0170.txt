The main purpose of this article is to lay the foundations for a
classification of isolated hypersurface singularities in positive
characteristic. Although our article is in the spirit of Arnol'd who classified
real an complex hypersurfaces in the 1970's with respect to right equivalence,
several new phenomena occur in positive characteristic. Already the notion of
isolated singularity is different for right resp. contact equivalence over
fields of characteristic other than zero. The heart of this paper consists of
the study of different notions of non-degeneracy and the associated piecewise
filtrations induced by the Newton diagram of a power series f. We introduce the
conditions AC and AAC which modify and generalise the conditions A and AA of
Arnol'd resp. Wall and which allow the classification with respect to contact
equivalence in any characteristic. Using this we deduce normal forms and rather
sharp determinacy bounds for f with respect to right and contact equivalence.
We apply this to classify hypersurface singularities of low modality in
positive characteristic.
