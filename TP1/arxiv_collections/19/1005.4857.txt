The superconducting pairing of electrons in doped graphene due to in-plane
and out-of-plane phonons is considered. It is shown that the structure of the
order parameter in the valley space substantially affects conditions of the
pairing. Electron-hole pairing in graphene bilayer in the strong coupling
regime is also considered. Taking into account retardation of the screened
Coulomb pairing potential shows a significant competition between the
electron-hole direct attraction and their repulsion due to virtual plasmons and
single-particle excitations.
