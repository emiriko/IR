In this work, we revisit the question of stability of multibreather
configurations, i.e., discrete breathers with multiple excited sites at the
anti-continuum limit of uncoupled oscillators. We present two methods that
yield quantitative predictions about the Floquet multipliers of the linear
stability analysis around such exponentially localized in space, time-periodic
orbits, based on the Aubry band method and the MacKay effective Hamiltonian
method and prove that their conclusions are equivalent. Subsequently, we
showcase the usefulness of the methods by a series of case examples including
one-dimensional multi-breathers, and two-dimensional vortex breathers in the
case of a lattice of linearly coupled oscillators with the Morse potential and
in that of the discrete $\phi^4$ model.
