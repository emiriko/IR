It is shown in the present Letter that the quantum noise due to high laser
intensities in Michelson interferometer for gravitational waves detection can
be reduced by sending squeezed vacuum states to the 'dark' port of the
interferometer. The experimental details of such physical system have been
described in a recent article by Barak and Ben-Aryeh (JOSA-B, 25, 361(2008)).
In another very recent article by Voronov and Weyrauch (Phys. Rev.A 81, 053816
(2010)) they have followed our methods for treating the same physical system,
and have pointed out an error in the sign of one of our expressions thus
claiming for the elimination of our physical results. I show here a method by
which the expectation value for the photon number operator is increased and at
the same time the standard deviation is reduced. Although due to the mistake in
sign in our expression the physical method for obtaining such result is
different from our original study [1], the main physical effect can remain .
