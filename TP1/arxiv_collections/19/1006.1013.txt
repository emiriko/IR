Since 2004, I have been collaborating with artist Josiah McElheny on the
design of cosmological sculptures, inspired originally by the chandeliers of
the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. The four works that we have completed
to date have appeared in galleries and museums in the United States, England,
and Spain. In this article, I describe the history of the project and offer
some conclusions about collaborations between scientists and artists. A
companion article presents the scientific background of the sculptures in
greater depth.
