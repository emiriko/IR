We introduce two-level discounted games played by two players on a
perfect-information stochastic game graph. The upper level game is a discounted
game and the lower level game is an undiscounted reachability game. Two-level
games model hierarchical and sequential decision making under uncertainty
across different time scales. We show the existence of pure memoryless optimal
strategies for both players and an ordered field property for such games. We
show that if there is only one player (Markov decision processes), then the
values can be computed in polynomial time. It follows that whether the value of
a player is equal to a given rational constant in two-level discounted games
can be decided in NP intersected coNP. We also give an alternate strategy
improvement algorithm to compute the value.
