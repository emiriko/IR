We report crystallographic, specific heat, transport, and magnetic properties
of the recently discovered noncentrosymmetric 5d-electron superconductors
CaIrSi3 (Tc = 3.6 K) and CaPtSi3 (Tc = 2.3 K). The specific heat suggests that
these superconductors are fully gapped. The upper critical fields are less than
1 T, consistent with limitation by conventional orbital depairing. High,
non-Pauli-limited {\mu}0 Hc2 values, often taken as a key signature of novel
noncentrosymmetric physics, are not observed in these materials because the
high carrier masses required to suppress orbital depairing and reveal the
violated Pauli limit are not present.
