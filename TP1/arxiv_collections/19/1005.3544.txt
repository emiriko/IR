The eighth part of the OGLE-III Catalog of Variable Stars (OIII-CVS) contains
type II Cepheids in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The sample consists of 43
objects, including 17 BL Her, 17 W Vir and 9 RV Tau stars (first examples ever
found in the SMC). Seven stars have been classified as peculiar W Vir stars - a
recently identified subclass of type II Cepheids. These stars have distinctive
light curves, are brighter and bluer than the ordinary W Vir variables. We
confirm that a large fraction of the peculiar W Vir stars are members of binary
systems.
  Three type II Cepheids exhibit eclipsing variations superimposed on the
pulsation light curves, and three other objects show long-period ellipsoidal
variability. All stars with the indication of binarity display secondary
periods which may be interpreted as amplitude and/or phase modulations of the
pulsation light curves with periods equal to the orbital periods or half the
orbital periods. We do not have any model for these modulations, however this
phenomenon rules out a possibility of the optical blends of a pulsating star
and a binary system.
  For each object the multi-epoch V- and I-band photometry collected over 8 or
13 years of observations and finding charts are available to the astronomical
community from the OGLE Internet archive.
