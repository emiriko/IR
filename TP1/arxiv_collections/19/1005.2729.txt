We report on the detection with the HIFI instrument on board the Herschel
satellite of the two hydrogen chloride isotopologues, H35Cl and H37Cl, towards
the massive star-forming region W3A. The J=1-0 line of both species was
observed with receiver 1b of the HIFI instrument at 625.9 and 624.9 GHz. The
different hyperfine components were resolved. The observations were modeled
with a non-local, non-LTE radiative transfer model that includes hyperfine line
overlap and radiative pumping by dust. Both effects are found to play an
important role in the emerging intensity from the different hyperfine
components. The inferred H35Cl column density (a few times 1e14 cm^-2), and
fractional abundance relative to H nuclei (~7.5e^-10), supports an upper limit
to the gas phase chlorine depletion of ~200. Our best-fit model estimate of the
H35Cl/H37Cl abundance ratio is ~2.1+/-0.5, slightly lower, but still compatible
with the solar isotopic abundance ratio (~3.1). Since both species were
observed simultaneously, this is the first accurate estimation of the
[35Cl]/[37Cl] isotopic ratio in molecular clouds. Our models indicate that even
for large line opacities and possible hyperfine intensity anomalies, the H35Cl
and H37Cl J=1-0 integrated line-intensity ratio provides a good estimate of the
35Cl/37Cl isotopic abundance ratio.
