The symbolic manipulation program FORM is specialized to handle very large
algebraic expressions. Some specific features of its internal structure make
FORM very well suited for parallelization.
  We have now two parallel versions of FORM, one is based on POSIX threads and
is optimal for modern multicore computers while another one uses MPI and can be
used to parallelize FORM on clusters and Massive Parallel Processing systems.
Most existing FORM programs will be able to take advantage of the parallel
execution without the need for modifications.
