Many eukaryotic cells are able to sense chemical gradients by directly
measuring spatial concentration differences. The precision of such gradient
sensing is limited by fluctuations in the binding of diffusing particles to
specific receptors on the cell surface. Here, we explore the physical limits of
the spatial sensing mechanism by modeling the chemotactic cell as an Ising spin
chain subject to a spatially varying field. This allows us to derive the
maximum likelihood estimators of the gradient parameters as well as explicit
expressions for their asymptotic uncertainties. The accuracy increases with the
cell's size and our results demonstrate that this accuracy be further increased
by introducing a non-zero cooperativity between neighboring receptors. Thus,
consistent with recent experimental data, it is possible for small bacteria to
perform spatial measurements of gradients.
