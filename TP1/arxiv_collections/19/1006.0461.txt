We consider the effect of two different environments on the performance of
the quantum adiabatic search algorithm, a thermal bath at finite temperature,
and a structured environment similar to the one encountered in systems coupled
to the electromagnetic field that exists within a photonic crystal. While for
all the parameter regimes explored here, the algorithm performance is worsened
by the contact with a thermal environment, the picture appears to be different
when considering a structured environment. In this case we show that, by tuning
the environment parameters to certain regimes, the algorithm performance can
actually be improved with respect to the closed system case. Additionally, the
relevance of considering the dissipation rates as complex quantities is
discussed in both cases. More particularly, we find that the imaginary part of
the rates can not be neglected with the usual argument that it simply amounts
to an energy shift, and in fact influences crucially the system dynamics.
