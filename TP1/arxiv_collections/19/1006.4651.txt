Among the possibly most intriguing aspects of quantum entanglement is that it
comes in "free" and "bound" instances. Bound entangled states require entangled
states in preparation but, once realized, no free entanglement and therefore no
pure maximally entangled pairs can be regained. Their existence hence certifies
an intrinsic irreversibility of entanglement in nature and suggests a
connection with thermodynamics. In this work, we present a first experimental
unconditional preparation and detection of a bound entangled state of light. We
consider continuous-variable entanglement, use convex optimization to identify
regimes rendering its bound character well certifiable, and realize an
experiment that continuously produced a distributed bound entangled state with
an extraordinary and unprecedented significance of more than ten standard
deviations away from both separability and distillability. Our results show
that the approach chosen allows for the efficient and precise preparation of
multimode entangled states of light with various applications in quantum
information, quantum state engineering and high precision metrology.
