Epsilon Aurigae is a complicated binary star that undergoes optical eclipses
every 27 years, including the present year. An update is given here on the
array of photometric and spectroscopic observations underway, thanks to the
eclipse observing campaign and its dedicated participants. In addition,
breakthrough results have emerged from (1) infrared and ultraviolet spectral
energy distribution observations, and (2) especially with interferometric
imaging that revealed the long suspected dark disk in transit, plus (3) new
optical spectra that are revealing substructure inside the disk itself.
Implications of many of these observations is discussed, but as the eclipse
data are still being collected, I anticipate that additional discoveries are
still to come, throughout 2010, and beyond.
