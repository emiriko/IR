We study fermion correlators in a holographic superfluid with a d-wave (spin
two) order parameter. We find that, with a suitable bulk Majorana coupling, the
Fermi surface is anisotropically gapped. At low temperatures the gap shrinks to
four nodal points. At high temperatures the Fermi surface is partially gapped
generating four Fermi arcs.
