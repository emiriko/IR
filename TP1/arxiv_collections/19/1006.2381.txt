Using Chandra, XMM-Newton, and optical photometric catalogs we study the
young X-ray binary (XRB) populations of the Small Magellanic Cloud. We find
that the Be/X-ray binaries (Be-XRBs) are observed in regions with star
formation rate bursts ~25-60 Myr ago. The similarity of this age with the age
of maximum occurrence of the Be phenomenon (~40 Myr) indicates that the
presence of a circumstellar decretion disk plays a significant role in the
number of observed XRBs in the 10-100 Myr age range. We also find that regions
with strong but more recent star formation (e.g., the Wing) are deficient in
Be-XRBs. By correlating the number of observed Be-XRBs with the formation rate
of their parent populations, we measure a Be-XRB production rate of ~1 system
per 3 x 10^(-3) M$_{\odot}$/yr. Finally, we use the strong localization of the
Be-XRB systems in order to set limits on the kicks imparted on the neutron star
during the supernova explosion.
