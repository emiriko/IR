Searches for the intermediate boson, $W^{\pm}$, the heavy quantum of the Weak
Interaction, via its semi-leptonic decay, $W\to e +\nu$, in the 1970's instead
discovered unexpectedly large hadron production at high $p_T$, notably $\pi^0$,
which provided a huge background of $e^{\pm}$ from internal and external
conversions. Methods developed at the CERN ISR which led to the discovery of
direct-single-$e^{\pm}$ in 1974, later determined to be from the semi-leptonic
decay of charm which had not yet been discovered, were used by PHENIX at RHIC
to make precision measurements of heavy quark production in p-p and Au+Au
collisions, leading to the puzzle of apparent equal suppression of light and
heavy quarks in the QGP. If the Higgs mechanism gives mass to gauge bosons but
not to fermions, then a proposal that all 6 quarks are nearly massless in a
QGP, which would resolve the puzzle, can not be excluded. This proposal can be
tested with future measurements of heavy quark correlations in A+A collisions
