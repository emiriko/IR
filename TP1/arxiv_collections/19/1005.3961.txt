Phase diagrams of binary mixtures of oppositely charged colloids are
calculated theoretically. The proposed mean-field-like formalism interpolates
between the limits of a hard-sphere system at high temperatures and the
colloidal crystals which minimize Madelung-like energy sums at low
temperatures. Comparison with computer simulations of an equimolar mixture of
oppositely charged, equally sized spheres indicate semi-quantitative accuracy
of the proposed formalism. We calculate global phase diagrams of binary
mixtures of equally sized spheres with opposite charges and equal charge
magnitude in terms of temperature, pressure, and composition. The influence of
the screening of the Coulomb interaction upon the topology of the phase diagram
is discussed. Insight into the topology of the global phase diagram as a
function of the system parameters leads to predictions on the preparation
conditions for specific binary colloidal crystals.
