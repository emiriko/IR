Quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement of collective variables by
off-resonant optical probing has the ability to create entanglement and
squeezing in atomic ensembles. Until now, this technique has been applied to
real or effective spin one-half systems. We show theoretically that the
build-up of Raman coherence prevents the naive application of this technique to
larger spin atoms, but that dynamical decoupling can be used to recover the
ideal QND behavior. We experimentally demonstrate dynamical decoupling by using
a two-polarization probing technique. The decoupled QND measurement achieves a
sensitivity 5.7(6) dB better than the spin projection noise.
