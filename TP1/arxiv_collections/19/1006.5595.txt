We present a theory of dark resonances in a fluorescence of a three-level
atom gas interacting with a polychromatic field of a frequency shifted feedback
(FSF) laser. We show that conditions for the resonance observation are optimal
when the phase relations between the laser spectral components provide
generation of a light pulses train. We study analytically the field broadening
and the light shift of the resonances.
