In the last decade, a large body of literature has been developed to explain
the universal features of inequality in terms of income and wealth. By now, it
is established that the distributions of income and wealth in various economies
show a number of statistical regularities. There are several models to explain
such static features of inequality in an unifying framework and the kinetic
exchange models, in particular, provide one such framework. Here we focus on
the dynamic features of inequality. In the process of development and growth,
inequality in an economy in terms of income and wealth follows a particular
pattern of rising in the initial stage followed by an eventual fall. This
inverted U-shaped curve is known as the Kuznets Curve. We examine the
possibilities of such behavior of an economy in the context of a generalized
kinetic exchange model. It is shown that under some specific conditions, our
model economy indeed shows inequality reversal.
