We present a direct relation, based upon a monogamic principle, between
entanglement of formation (EOF) and quantum discord (QD), showing how they are
distributed in an arbitrary tripartite pure system. By extending it to a
paradigmatic situation of a bipartite system coupled to an environment, we
demonstrate that the EOF and the QD obey a conservation relation. By means of
this relation we show that in the deterministic quantum computer with one pure
qubit the protocol has the ability to rearrange the EOF and the QD, which
implies that quantum computation can be understood on a different basis as a
coherent dynamics where quantum correlations are distributed between the qubits
of the computer. Furthermore, for a tripartite mixed state we show that the
balance between distributed EOF and QD results in a stronger version of the
strong subadditivity of entropy.
