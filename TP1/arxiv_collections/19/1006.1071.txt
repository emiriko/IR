Exotic $^8$Be and $^{12}$C decays from high-lying resonances in $^{24}$Mg are
analyzed in terms of a cluster model. The calculated quantities agree well with
the corresponding experimental data. It is found that the calculated decay
widths are very sensitive to the angular momentum carried by the outgoing
cluster. It is shown that this property makes cluster decay a powerful tool to
determine the spin as well as the molecular structures of the resonances.
