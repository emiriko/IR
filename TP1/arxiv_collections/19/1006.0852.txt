The important role played by chiral symmetry and axial anomaly in QCD in
nuclear physics is reviewed. Some recent topics on possible chiral restoration
in hot and/or dense matter are picked up. We also discuss so called {\em
effective} restoration of chiral anomaly hot and/or dense matter, as may be
seen in a character change of $\eta '$ meson.
