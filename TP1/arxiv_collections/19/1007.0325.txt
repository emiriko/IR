This paper concerns the Routh reduction procedure for Lagrangians systems
with symmetry. It differs from the existing results on geometric Routh
reduction in the fact that no regularity conditions on either the Lagrangian
$L$ or the momentum map $J_L$ are required apart from the momentum being a
regular value of $J_L$. The main results of this paper are: the description of
a general Routh reduction procedure that preserves the Euler-Lagrange nature of
the original system and the presentation of a presymplectic framework for Routh
reduced systems. In addition, we provide a detailed description and
interpretation of the Euler-Lagrange equations for the reduced system. The
proposed procedure includes Lagrangian systems with a non-positively definite
kinetic energy metric.
