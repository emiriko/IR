Using the closed-time-path formalism we quantify gradient corrections to the
kinetic equations for leptogenesis, that are neglected in the standard
Boltzmann approach. In particular we show that an additional CP-violating
source term arises, which is non-zero even when all species are in local
thermal equilibrium. In the early universe it is proportional to the expansion
rate and would vanish for static equilibrium configurations, in accordance with
the Sakharov conditions. We find that for thermal leptogenesis in a standard
cosmological background the additional source term is small. However, it can
become the dominant source in the limit of ultra-strong washout.
