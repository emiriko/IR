In this article we perform a computational study of Polyrakis algorithms
presented in [12,13]. These algorithms are used for the determination of the
vector sublattice and the minimal lattice-subspace generated by a finite set of
positive vectors of R^k. The study demonstrates that our findings can be very
useful in the field of Economics, especially in completion by options of
security markets and portfolio insurance.
