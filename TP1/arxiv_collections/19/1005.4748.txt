KMOS is a multi-object near-infrared integral field spectrometer with 24
deployable pick-off arms. Data processing is inevitably complex. We discuss
specific issues and requirements that must be addressed in the data reduction
pipeline, the calibration, the raw and processed data formats, and the
simulated data. We discuss the pipeline architecture. We focus on its modular
style and show how these modules can be used to build a classical pipeline, as
well as a more advanced pipeline that can account for both spectral and spatial
flexure as well as variations in the OH background. A novel aspect of the
pipeline is that the raw data can be reconstructed into a cube in a single
step. We discuss the advantages of this and outline the way in which we have
implemented it. We finish by describing how the QFitsView tool can now be used
to visualise KMOS data.
