The CALICE analog HCAL is a highly granular calorimeter, proposed for the
International Linear Collider. It is based on scintillator tiles, read out by
silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). The effects of gaps between the calorimeter
tiles, as well as the non-uniform response of the tiles, in view of the impact
on the energy resolution, are studied in Monte Carlo events. It is shown that
these type of effects do not have a significant influence on the measurement of
hadron showers.
