This is a nontechnical Perspective commentary on two recent neutron
scattering experiments (Science 326, 415 (2009) and Science 326, 411 (2009))
reporting evidence for the validity of a "Coulomb phase" description of the
low-temperature regime of frustrated spin ice magnetic materials as well as the
existence of topological defect (monopole-like) excitations in these systems.
