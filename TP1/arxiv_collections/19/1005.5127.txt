We study the log-concave measures, their characterization via the
Pr\'ekopa-Leindler property and also define a subset of it whose elements are
called super log-concave measures which have the property of satisfying a
logarithmic Sobolev inequality. We give some results about their stability.
Certain relations with measure transportation of Monge-Kantorovitch and the
Monge-Amp\'ere equation are also indicated with applications.
