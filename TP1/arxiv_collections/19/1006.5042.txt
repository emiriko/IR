We investigate a nonlinear circuit consisting of N tunnel diodes in series,
which shows close similarities to a semiconductor superlattice or to a neural
network. Each tunnel diode is modeled by a three-variable FitzHugh-Nagumo-like
system. The tunnel diodes are coupled globally through a load resistor. We find
complex bifurcation scenarios with symmetry-breaking transitions that generate
multiple fixed points off the synchronization manifold. We show that multiply
degenerate zero-eigenvalue bifurcations occur, which lead to multistable
current branches, and that these bifurcations are also degenerate with a Hopf
bifurcation. These predicted scenarios of multiple branches and degenerate
bifurcations are also found experimentally.
