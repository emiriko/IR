We study the effects of nonzero time delays in stochastic synchronization
problems with linear couplings in an arbitrary network. Using the known exact
threshold value from the theory of differential equations with delays, we
provide the synchronizability threshold for an arbitrary network. Further, by
constructing the scaling theory of the underlying fluctuations, we establish
the absolute limit of synchronization efficiency in a noisy environment with
uniform time delays, i.e., the minimum attainable value of the width of the
synchronization landscape. Our results have also strong implications for
optimization and trade-offs in network synchronization with delays.
