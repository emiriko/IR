It is strongly argued that high temperature superconductors (HTSC) exhibit an
anti-polar phase with a long range order in both normal and superconducting
states. This anti-polar phase is directly related to the onset of
superconductivity in all HTSC and it is responsible for strong coupling and of
two dimensionality aspect of HTSC, as it is described below.
