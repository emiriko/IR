On Moyal space-time, one can implement twisted Poincar\'e symmetry with the
resultant modification of symmetrization and anti-symmetrization postulates for
bosons and fermions. We develop the thermofield approach of Umezawa and
Takahashi on such a spacetime preserving the twisted Poincar\'e symmetry of the
underlying quantum field theory(qft). Implications of this twisted Poincar\'e
symmetry for qft's at finite temperature are pointed out.
