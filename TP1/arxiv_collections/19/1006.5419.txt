We systematically construct a semiclassical expansion for the eigenvalues of
the 2nd order quantum fluctuations of the folded spinning superstring rotating
in the AdS_3 part of AdS_5 x S^5 with two alternative methods; by using the
exact expression of the Bloch momentum generated by the curvature induced
periodic potentials and by using the large energy expansion of the dispersion
relation. We then calculate the one-loop correction to the energy by summing
over the eigenvalues. Our results are extremely accurate for strings whose ends
are not too close to the AdS radius. Finally we derive the small spin Regge
expansion in the context of zeta function approximation.
