We study the relationship between full-disk solar radiative flux at different
wavelengths and average solar photospheric magnetic-flux density, using daily
measurements from the Kitt Peak magnetograph and other instruments extending
over one or more solar cycles. We use two different statistical methods to
determine the underlying nature of these flux-flux relationships. First, we use
statistical correlation and regression analysis and show that the relationships
are not monotonic for total solar irradiance and for continuum radiation from
the photosphere, but are approximately linear for chromospheric and coronal
radiation. Second, we use signal theory to examine the flux-flux relationships
for a temporal component. We find that a well-defined temporal component exists
and accounts for some of the variance in the data. This temporal component
arises because active regions with high magnetic field strength evolve,
breaking up into small-scale magnetic elements with low field strength, and
radiative and magnetic fluxes are sensitive to different active-region
components. We generate empirical models that relate radiative flux to magnetic
flux, allowing us to predict spectral-irradiance variations from observations
of disk-averaged magnetic-flux density. In most cases, the model
reconstructions can account for 85-90% of the variability of the radiative flux
from the chromosphere and corona. Our results are important for understanding
the relationship between magnetic and radiative measures of solar and stellar
variability.
