So far there is no closed formula for relative entropy of entanglement of
arbitrary two-qubit states. In this paper we present a method, which guarantees
the derivation of the relative entropy of entanglement for most states that
have $z$-directional Bloch vectors. It is shown that the closest separable
states for those states also have $z$-directional Bloch vectors though there
are few exceptions.
