The solution of parity games over pushdown graphs (Walukiewicz '96) was the
first step towards an effective theory of infinite-state games. It was shown
that winning strategies for pushdown games can be implemented again as pushdown
automata. We continue this study and investigate the connection between game
presentations and winning strategies in altogether six cases of game arenas,
among them realtime pushdown systems, visibly pushdown systems, and counter
systems. In four cases we show by a uniform proof method that we obtain
strategies implementable by the same type of pushdown machine as given in the
game arena. We prove that for the two remaining cases this correspondence
fails. In the conclusion we address the question of an abstract criterion that
explains the results.
