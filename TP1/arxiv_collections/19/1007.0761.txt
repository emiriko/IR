We propose an analytical model to predict the adhesives penetration into hard
wood. Penetration of hard wood is dominated by the vessel network which
prohibits porous medium approximations. Our model considers two scales: a one
dimensional capillary fluid transport of a hardening adhesive through a single,
straight vessel with diffusion of solvent through its walls and a mesoscopic
scale based on topological characteristics of the vessel network, where results
from the single vessel scale are mapped onto a periodic network. Given an
initial amount of adhesive and applied bonding pressure, we calculate the
portion of the filled structure. The model is applied to beech wood samples
joined with three different types of adhesive (PUR, UF, PVAC) under various
growth ring angles. We evaluate adhesive properties and bond line morphologies
described in part I of this work. The model contains one free parameter that
can be adjusted in order to fit the experimental data.
