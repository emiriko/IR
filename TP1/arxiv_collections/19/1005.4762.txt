Mathematical learning environments help students in mastering mathematical
knowledge. Mature environments typically offer thousands of interactive
exercises. Providing feedback to students solving interactive exercises
requires domain reasoners for doing the exercise-specific calculations. Since a
domain reasoner has to solve an exercise in the same way a student should solve
it, the structure of domain reasoners should follow the layered structure of
the mathematical domains. Furthermore, learners, teachers, and environment
builders have different requirements for adapting domain reasoners, such as
providing more details, disallowing or enforcing certain solutions, and
combining multiple mathematical domains in a new domain. In previous work we
have shown how domain reasoners for solving interactive exercises can be
expressed in terms of rewrite strategies, rewrite rules, and views. This paper
shows how users can adapt and configure such domain reasoners to their own
needs. This is achieved by enabling users to explicitly communicate the
components that are used for solving an exercise.
