We study the intersite correlation effects on the Kondo dynamics of two
Anderson impurities. Two characteristic energy scales are present associated
with the splitting of the uniform and staggered spin susceptibilities. The high
energy scale has similar properties as the coherence scale in heavy fermion
materials while the low energy scale characterizes the competing orders between
Kondo singlet state and inter-impurity singlet state. A singlet
superconductivity instability is found near the quantum critical point and is
associated with the singular staggered spin susceptibility.
