Dynamical properties of the square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet in
applied magnetic field are studied for arbitrary value S of the spin. Above the
threshold field for two-particle decays, the standard spin-wave theory yields
singular corrections to the excitation spectrum with logarithmic divergences
for certain momenta. We develop a self-consistent approximation applicable for
S >= 1, which avoids such singularities and provides regularized magnon decay
rates. Results for the dynamical structure factor obtained in this approach are
presented for S = 1 and S = 5/2.
