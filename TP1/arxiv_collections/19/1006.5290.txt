Based on interrelation between the thermodynamic and electromechanical
phenomena in superfluid helium, the explanation of experimentally found
features of microwave interaction in the frequency range of 40-200 GHz is
given. Due to fast roton-roton and roton-phonon interactions resonant
excitation on frequency correspond to minimal roton energy relaxes and forms a
wide pedestal. Alongside these fast processes, there are also slower processes
of rotons' scattering by microwave photons taking place, which lead to
additional absorption of energy of resonant microwaves and to the appearance of
a narrow resonant peak on the background of a wide pedestal. The theoretical
explanation of the influence which streams exert on resonant absorption of
microwaves is given. The critical velocity of stream at which absorption of
microwaves was replaced by their radiation is found.
