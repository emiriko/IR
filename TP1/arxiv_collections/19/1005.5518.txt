Mechanical resonators are gradually becoming available as new quantum
systems. Quantum optics in combination with optomechanical interactions
(quantum optomechanics) provides a particularly helpful toolbox for generating
and controlling mechanical quantum states. We highlight some of the current
challenges in the field by discussing two of our recent experiments.
