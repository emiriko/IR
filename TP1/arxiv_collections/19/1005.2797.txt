A chiral constituent quark model approach, embodying s- and u-channel
exchanges,complemented with a Reggeized treatment for t-channel is presented. A
model is obtained allowing data for $\pi^- p \to \eta n$ and $\gamma p \to \eta
p$ to be describe satisfactorily. For the latter reaction, recently released
data by CLAS and CBELSA/TAPS Collaborations in the system total energy range
$1.6 \lesssim W \lesssim 2.8$ GeV are well reproduced due to the inclusion of
Reggeized trajectories instead of simple $\rho$ and $\omega$ poles.
Contribution from "missing" resonances is found to be negligible in the
considered processes.
