Here we consider our universe as inhomogeneous spherically symmetric
Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi Model and analyze the thermodynamics of this model of the
universe. The trapping horizon is calculated and is found to coincide with the
apparent horizon. The Einstein field equations are shown to be equivalent with
the unified first law of thermodynamics. Finally assuming the first law of
thermodynamics validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics is
examined at the apparent horizon for the perfect fluid and at the event horizon
for holographic dark energy.
