We calculate the Wigner quasiprobability distribution function of quantum
elliptical vortex in elliptical beam (EEV), produced by coupling squeezed
coherent states of two modes. The coupling between the two modes is performed
by using beam splitter (BS) or a dual channel directional coupler (DCDC). The
quantum interference due to the coupling between the two modes promises the
generation of controlled entanglement for quantum computation and quantum
tomography.
