We present results from three-dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of unmagnetized dense plasma jet injection into a uniform hot
strongly magnetized plasma, with the aim of providing insight into core fueling
of a tokamak with parameters relevant for ITER and NSTX (National Spherical
Torus Experiment). Unmagnetized dense plasma jet injection is similar to
compact toroid injection but with much higher plasma density and total mass,
and consequently lower required injection velocity. Mass deposition of the jet
into the background appears to be facilitated via magnetic reconnection along
the jet's trailing edge. The penetration depth of the plasma jet into the
background plasma is mostly dependent on the jet's initial kinetic energy, and
a key requirement for spatially localized mass deposition is for the jet's
slowing-down time to be less than the time for the perturbed background
magnetic flux to relax due to magnetic reconnection. This work suggests that
more accurate treatment of reconnection is needed to fully model this problem.
Parameters for unmagnetized dense plasma jet injection are identified for
localized core deposition as well as edge localized mode (ELM) pacing
applications in ITER and NSTX-relevant regimes.
