The dependency of the melting point of supported metal nanoclusters as
function of clusters height is theoretically investigated in the framework of
the uniform approach. The vacancy mechanism describing the melting point shift
in nanoclusters with decrease of their size is proposed. It is shown that the
essential role in clusters melting point shift is played by van der Waals
forces of cluster-substrate interaction. It is shown, that the account of
layer--by--layer fusion of a cluster allows to satisfactorily describe the
melting of nanoclusters of various metals, deposited onto a different
substrates. The proposed model satisfactorily accounts for the experimental
data.
