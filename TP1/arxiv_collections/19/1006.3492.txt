The dense beams used at CLIC to achieve a high luminosity will cause a large
amount of background particles through beam-beam interactions. Generator level
studies with GuineaPig and full detector simulation studies with an ILD based
CLIC detector have been performed to evaluate the amount of beam-beam
background hitting the vertex detector.
