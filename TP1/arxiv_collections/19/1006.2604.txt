We report laser Doppler ophthalmoscopic fundus imaging in the rat eye with
near-IR heterodyne holography. Sequential sampling of the beat of the reflected
radiation against a frequency-shifted optical local oscillator is made onto an
array detector. Wide-field maps of fluctuation spectra in the 10 Hz to 25 kHz
band exhibit angiographic contrasts in the retinal vascular tree without
requirement of an exogenous marker.
