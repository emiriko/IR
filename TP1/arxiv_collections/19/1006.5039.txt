There are exact solutions to Einstein's equations with negative cosmological
constant that represent black holes whose event horizons are manifolds of
negative curvature, the so-called topological black holes. Among these
solutions there is one, the massless topological black hole, whose mass is
equal to zero. Hod proposes that in the semiclassical limit the asymptotic
quasinormal frequencies determine the entropy spectrum of the black holes.
Taking into account this proposal, we calculate the entropy spectrum of the
massless topological black hole and we compare with the results on the entropy
spectra of other topological black holes.
