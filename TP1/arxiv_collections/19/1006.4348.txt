We show that the low-temperature sash features in the lowest Landau-level
(LLL) tunneling density-of-states (TDOS) recently discovered by Dial and
Ashoori are intimately related to the discrete Haldane-pseudopotential
interaction energy scales that govern fractional quantum Hall physics. Our
analysis is based on expressions for the tunneling density-of-states which
become exact at filling factors close to $\nu=0$ and $\nu=1$, where the sash
structure is most prominent. We comment on other aspects of LLL correlation
physics that can be revealed by accurate temperature-dependent tunneling data.
