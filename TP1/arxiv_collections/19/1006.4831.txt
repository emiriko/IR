We prove Knudsen's law for a gas of particles bouncing freely in a two
dimensional pipeline with serrated walls consisting of irrational triangles.
Dynamics are randomly perturbed and the corresponding random map studied under
a skew-type deterministic representation which is shown to be ergodic and
exact.
