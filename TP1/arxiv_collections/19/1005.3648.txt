We discuss the $\mu$-$e$ transition processes induced by non-holomorphic
Yukawa interactions in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM).
  When supersymmetry is broken, the coupling structures between Higgs doublets
and leptons are modified and flavor-changing neutral currents could be
generated. In the framework of the MSSM, we calculate those effects to the
rates for $\meg$, $\meee$, and $\mu$-$e$ conversion in nuclei. We perform more
detailed calculations of the lepton flavor violating (LFV) operators in the
heavy Higgs decoupling limit than previous works, and show the accurate
$\tan\beta$ dependence of them. Furthermore, we compare the contribution to the
LFV operators mediated by Higgs bosons with the one generated gaugino/slepton
exchange, and discuss the competition between these two effects.
