A method is proposed for determining the masses of the new particles N,X,Y,Z
in collider events containing a pair of effectively identical decay chains Z to
Y+jet, Y to X+l_1, X to N+l_2, where l_1, l_2 are opposite-sign same-flavour
charged leptons and N is invisible. By first determining the upper edge of the
dilepton invariant mass spectrum, we reduce the problem to a curve for each
event in the 3-dimensional space of mass-squared differences. The region
through which most curves pass then determines the unknown masses. A
statistical approach is applied to take account of mismeasurement of jet and
missing momenta. The method is easily visualized and rather robust against
combinatorial ambiguities and finite detector resolution. It can be successful
even for small event samples, since it makes full use of the kinematical
information from every event.
