This paper is devoted to investigate the cold plasma wave properties. The
analysis has been restricted to the neighborhood of the pair production region
of the Kerr magnetosphere. The Fourier analyzed general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamical equations are dealt under special circumstances and
dispersion relations are obtained. We find the $x$-component of the complex
wave vector numerically. The corresponding components of the propagation
vector, attenuation vector, phase and group velocities are shown in graphs. The
direction and dispersion of waves are investigated.
