A three-dimensional (3-D), self-consistent code is employed to solve for the
static potential structure surrounding a spacecraft in a high photoelectron
environment. The numerical solutions show that, under certain conditions, a
spacecraft can take on a negative potential in spite of strong photoelectron
currents. The negative potential is due to an electrostatic barrier near the
surface of the spacecraft that can reflect a large fraction of the
photoelectron flux back to the spacecraft. This electrostatic barrier forms if
(1) the photoelectron density at the surface of the spacecraft greatly exceeds
the ambient plasma density, (2) the spacecraft size is significantly larger
than local Debye length of the photoelectrons, and (3) the thermal electron
energy is much larger than the characteristic energy of the escaping
photoelectrons. All of these conditions are present near the Sun. The numerical
solutions also show that the spacecraft's negative potential can be amplified
by an ion wake. The negative potential of the ion wake prevents secondary
electrons from escaping the part of spacecraft in contact with the wake. These
findings may be important for future spacecraft missions that go nearer to the
Sun, such as Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus.
