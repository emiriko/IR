We study time-bounded reachability in continuous-time Markov decision
processes for time-abstract scheduler classes. Such reachability problems play
a paramount role in dependability analysis and the modelling of manufacturing
and queueing systems. Consequently, their analysis has been studied
intensively, and techniques for the approximation of optimal control are well
understood. From a mathematical point of view, however, the question of
approximation is secondary compared to the fundamental question whether or not
optimal control exists.
  We demonstrate the existence of optimal schedulers for the time-abstract
scheduler classes for all CTMDPs. Our proof is constructive: We show how to
compute optimal time-abstract strategies with finite memory. It turns out that
these optimal schedulers have an amazingly simple structure - they converge to
an easy-to-compute memoryless scheduling policy after a finite number of steps.
  Finally, we show that our argument can easily be lifted to Markov games: We
show that both players have a likewise simple optimal strategy in these more
general structures.
