We present the integrated J, H, K, L, M and N magnitudes and the colours
involving infrared bands, for an extensive set of instantaneous-burst binary
stellar populations (BSPs) by using evolutionary population synthesis (EPS). By
comparing the results for BSPs WITH and WITHOUT binary interactions we show
that the inclusion of binary interactions makes the magnitudes of populations
larger (fainter) and the integrated colours smaller (bluer) for t > 1Gyr. Also,
we compare our model magnitudes and colours with those of Bruzual & Charlot
(2003, hereafter BC03) and Maraston (2005, hereafter M05). At last, we compare
these model broad colours with Magellanic Clouds globular clusters (GCs) and
Milky Way GCs. In (V-R)-[Fe/H] and (V-I)-[Fe/H] diagrams it seems that our
models match the observations better than those of BC03 and M05.
