The classical limit $\hbar$->0 of quantum mechanics is known to be delicate,
in particular there seems to be no simple derivation of the classical Hamilton
equation, starting from the Schr\"odinger equation. In this paper I elaborate
on an idea of M. Reuter to represent wave functions by parallel sections of a
flat vector bundle over phase space, using the connection of Fedosov's
construction of deformation quantization. This generalizes the ordinary
Schr\"odinger representation, and allows naturally for a description of quantum
states in terms of a curve plus a wave function. Hamilton's equation arises in
this context as a condition on the curve, ensuring the dynamics to split into a
classical and a quantum part.
