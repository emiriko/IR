Building on the engine-pump paradigm of ChaNoXity, this paper argues that
complex holism - as the competitive homeostasis of dispersion and concentration
- is the operating mode of Nature. Specifically, we show that the negative
world \mathfrak{W} is a gravitationally collapsed black hole that was formed at
big-bang time t=0 as the pair (W,\mathfrak{W}), with W a real world, and
gravity the unique expression of the maximal multifunctional nonlinearity of
the negative world \mathfrak{W} in the functional reality of W. The temperature
of a gravitationally collapsed system does enjoy the relationship T\propto1/r
with its radius, but the entropy follows the usual volumetric alignment with
microstates, reducing to the surface approximation only at small r. It is not
clear if quantum non-locality is merely a linear manifestation of complex
holism, with the interaction of quantum gates in quantum entanglements
resulting in distinctive features from the self-evolved structures of complex
holism remaining an open question for further investigation
