A direct signature of electron transport at the metallic surface of a
topological insulator is the Aharonov-Bohm oscillation observed in a recent
study of Bi_2Se_3 nanowires [Peng et al., Nature Mater. 9, 225 (2010)] where
conductance was found to oscillate as a function of magnetic flux $\phi$
through the wire, with a period of one flux quantum $\phi_0=h/e$ and maximum
conductance at zero flux. This seemingly agrees neither with diffusive theory,
which would predict a period of half a flux quantum, nor with ballistic theory,
which in the simplest form predicts a period of $\phi_0$ but a minimum at zero
flux due to a nontrivial Berry phase in topological insulators. We show how h/e
and h/2e flux oscillations of the conductance depend on doping and disorder
strength, provide a possible explanation for the experiments, and discuss
further experiments that could verify the theory.
