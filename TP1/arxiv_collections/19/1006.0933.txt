Magnetotunneling spectroscopy was employed to probe the confinement in
vertical Si/Ge double-barrier resonant tunneling diodes with regularly
distributed Ge quantum dots. Their current-voltage characteristics reveal a
step-like behavior in the vicinity of zero bias, indicating resonant tunneling
of heavy-holes via three-dimensionally confined unoccupied hole states in Ge
quantum dots. Assuming parabolic confinement we extract the strength of the
confinement potential of quantum dots.
