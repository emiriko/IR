Using concave rectangular patches, a new solution to reduce mutual coupling
and return loss in two-dimensional array of microstrip antennas is proposed.
The effect of width and length concavity on mutual coupling and return loss is
studied. Also, the patch parameters as well as the amounts of width and length
concavity are optimized using an enhanced genetic algorithm. Simulation results
show that the resulting array antenna has low amounts of mutual coupling and
return loss.
