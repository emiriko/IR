We present a description of encoding/decoding for a concatenated quantum code
that enables both protection against quantum computational errors and the
occurrence of one quantum erasure. For this, it is presented how encoding and
decoding for quantum graph codes are done, which will provide the protection
against the occurrence of computational errors (external code). As internal
code is used encoding and decoding via scheme of GHZ states for protection
against the occurrence of one quantum erasure.
