We discuss the implementation of the FONLL general-mass scheme for heavy
quarks in deep-inelastic scattering in the FastKernel framework, used in the
NNPDF series of global PDF analysis. We present the general features of FONLL
and benchmark the accuracy of its implementation in FastKernel comparing with
the Les Houches heavy quark benchmark tables. We then show preliminary results
of the NNPDF2.1 analysis, in which heavy quark mass effects are included
following the FONLL-A GM scheme.
