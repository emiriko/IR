Exact Lagrangian in compact form is derived for planar internal waves in a
two-fluid system with a relatively small density jump (the Boussinesq limit
taking place in real oceanic conditions), in the presence of a background shear
current of constant vorticity, and over arbitrary bottom profile. Long-wave
asymptotic approximations of higher orders are derived from the exact
Hamiltonian functional in a remarkably simple way, for two different
parametrizations of the interface shape.
