We consider the problem of the renormalization of the vacuum polarization in
a symmetry space-time with axial but not spherical symmetry, Schwarzschild
space-time threaded by an infinite straight cosmic string. Unlike previous
calculations, our framework to compute the renormalized vacuum polarization
does not rely on special properties of Legendre functions, but rather has been
developed in a way that we expect to be applicable to Kerr space-time.
