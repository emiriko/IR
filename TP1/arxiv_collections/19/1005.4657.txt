We report possible evidence of non-Fermi liquid (NFL) observed at room
temperature from the quasi one-dimensional (1D) indium (In) nanowires
self-assembled on Si(111)-7$\times$7 surface. Using high-resolution
electron-energy-loss spectroscopy, we have measured energy and width
dispersions of a low energy intrasubband plasmon excitation in the In
nanowires. We observe the energy-momentum dispersion $\omega$(q) in the low q
limit exactly as predicted by both NFL theory and the
random-phase-approximation. The unusual non-analytic width dispersion $\zeta(q)
\sim q^{\alpha}$ measured with an exponent ${\alpha}$=1.40$\pm$0.24, however,
is understood only by the NFL theory. Such an abnormal width dispersion of low
energy excitations may probe the NFL feature of a non-ideal 1D interacting
electron system despite the significantly suppressed spin-charge separation
($\leq$40 meV).
