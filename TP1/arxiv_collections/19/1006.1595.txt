Flux-averaged and flux-integrated cross sections for quasi-elastic neutrino
charged-current scattering on nucleus are analyzed. It is shown that the
flux-integrated differential cross sections are nuclear model-independent. We
calculate these cross sections using the relativistic distorted-wave impulse
approximation and relativistic Fermi gas model with the Booster Neutrino
Beamline flux and compare results with the recent MiniBooNE experiment data.
Within these models an axial mass $M_A$ is extracted from a fit of the measured
$d\sigma/dQ^2$ cross section. The extracted value of $M_A$ is consistent with
the MiniBooNE result. The measured and calculated double differential cross
sections $d\sigma/dTd\cos\theta$ generally agree within the error of the
experiment. But the Fermi gas model predictions are completely off of the data
in the region of low muon energies and scattering angles.
