The escape fraction, fesc, of ionizing photons from early galaxies is a
crucial parameter for determining whether the observed galaxies at z > 6 are
able to reionize the high-redshift intergalactic medium. Previous attempts to
measure fesc have found a wide range of values, varying from less than 0.01 to
nearly 1. Rather than finding a single value of fesc, we clarify through
modeling how internal properties of galaxies affect fesc through the density
and distribution of neutral hydrogen within the galaxy, along with the rate of
ionizing photons production. We find that the escape fraction depends
sensitively on the covering factor of clumps, along with the density of the
clumped and interclump medium. One must therefore be cautious when dealing with
an inhomogeneous medium. Fewer, high-density clumps lead to a greater escape
fraction than more numerous low-density clumps. When more ionizing photons are
produced in a starburst, fesc increases, as photons escape more readily from
the gas layers. Large variations in the predicted escape fraction, caused by
differences in the hydrogen distribution, may explain the large observed
differences in fesc among galaxies. Values of fesc must also be consistent with
the reionization history. High-mass galaxies alone are unable to reionize the
universe, because fesc > 1 would be required. Small galaxies are needed to
achieve reionization, with greater mean escape fraction in the past.
