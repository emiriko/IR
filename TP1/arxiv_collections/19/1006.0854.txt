In this paper, we present a theoretical study of a two-component
Bose-Einstein condensate composed of Ytterbium (Yb) isotopes in a three
dimensional anisotropic harmonic potential. The condensate consists of a
mixture of ${}^{176}\textrm{Yb}$ atoms which have a negative s-wave scattering
length and ${}^{174}\textrm{Yb}$ atoms having a positive s-wave scattering
length. We study the ground state as well as dynamic properties of this
two-component condensate. Due to the attractive interactions between
${}^{176}\textrm{Yb}$ atoms, the condensate of ${}^{176}\textrm{Yb}$ undergo a
collapse when the particle number exceed a critical value. The critical number
and the collapse dynamics are modified due to the presence of
${}^{174}\textrm{Yb}$ atoms. We use coupled two-component Gross-Pitaevskii
equations to study the collapse dynamics. The theoretical results obtained are
in reasonable agreement with the experimental results of Fukuhara {\em et al.}
[PRA{\bf 79}, 021601(R) (2009)].
