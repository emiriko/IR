This paper presents an efficient method for approximation of temporal video
data using linear Bezier fitting. For a given sequence of frames, the proposed
method estimates the intensity variations of each pixel in temporal dimension
using linear Bezier fitting in Euclidean space. Fitting of each segment ensures
upper bound of specified mean squared error. Break and fit criteria is employed
to minimize the number of segments required to fit the data. The proposed
method is well suitable for lossy compression of temporal video data and
automates the fitting process of each pixel. Experimental results show that the
proposed method yields good results both in terms of objective and subjective
quality measurement parameters without causing any blocking artifacts.
