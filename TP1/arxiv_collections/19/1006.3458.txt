This paper reports the results of an experimental investigation of the
performance of two types of magnetic screens assembled from YBa2Cu3O7-d (YBCO)
coated conductors. Since effective screening of the axial DC magnetic field
requires the unimpeded flow of an azimuthal persistent current, we demonstrate
a configuration of a screening shell made out of standard YBCO coated conductor
capable to accomplish that. The screen allows the persistent current to flow in
the predominantly azimuthal direction at a temperature of 77 K. The persistent
screen, incorporating a single layer of superconducting film, can attenuate an
external magnetic field of up to 5 mT by more than an order of magnitude. For
comparison purposes, another type of screen which incorporates low critical
temperature quasi-persistent joints was also built. The shielding technique we
describe here appears to be especially promising for the realization of large
scale high-Tc superconducting screens.
