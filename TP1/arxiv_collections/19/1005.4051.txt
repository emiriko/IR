New physics models that increase the decay rate of $B_s \to \tau^+ \tau^-$
contribute to the absorptive part of $B_s$--$\bar{B}_s$ mixing, and may enhance
$\Delta\Gamma_s$ all the way up to its current experimental bound. In
particular, the model with a scalar leptoquark can lead to a significant
violation of the expectation $\Delta\Gamma_s \leq \Delta\Gamma_s$ (SM). It can
even allow regions in the $\Delta\Gamma_s$-$\beta_s$ parameter space that are
close to the best fit obtained by CDF and D\{O} through $B_s \to J/\psi \phi$.
In addition, it can help explain the anomalous like-sign dimuon charge
asymmetry observed recently by D\O. A measurement of $BR(B_s \to \tau^+
\tau^-)$ is thus crucial for a better understanding of new physics involved in
$B_s$--$\bar{B}_s$ mixing.
