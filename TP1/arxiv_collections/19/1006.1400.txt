The recently developed structure model that uses the generator coordinate
method to perform configuration mixing of angular-momentum projected wave
functions, generated by constrained self-consistent relativistic mean-field
calculations for triaxial shapes (3DAMP+GCM), is applied in a systematic study
of ground states and low-energy collective states in the even-even magnesium
isotopes $^{20-40}$Mg. Results obtained using a relativistic point-coupling
nucleon-nucleon effective interaction in the particle-hole channel, and a
density-independent $\delta$-interaction in the pairing channel, are compared
to data and with previous axial 1DAMP+GCM calculations, both with a
relativistic density functional and the non-relativistic Gogny force. The
effects of the inclusion of triaxial degrees of freedom on the low-energy
spectra and E2 transitions of magnesium isotopes are examined.
