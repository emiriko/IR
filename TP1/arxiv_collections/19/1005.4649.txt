The evolution of electromagnetic wave polarization is modeled for propagation
in the major radial direction in the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX)
with retroreflection from the center stack of the vacuum vessel. This modeling
illustrates that the Cotton-Mouton effect-elliptization due to the magnetic
field perpendicular to the propagation direction-is shown to be strongly
weighted to the high-field region of the plasma. An interaction between the
Faraday rotation and Cotton-Mouton effects is also clearly identified.
Elliptization occurs when the wave polarization direction is neither parallel
nor perpendicular to the local transverse magnetic field. Since Faraday
rotation modifies the polarization direction during propagation, it must also
affect the resultant elliptization. The Cotton-Mouton effect also intrinsically
results in rotation of the polarization direction, but this effect is less
significant in the plasma conditions modeled. The interaction increases at
longer wavelength, and complicates interpretation of polarimetry measurements.
