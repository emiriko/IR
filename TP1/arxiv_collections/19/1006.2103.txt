We propose to place a very intense source of 51Cr at the center of a 50-tonne
target of gallium metal that is divided into two concentric spherical zones and
to measure the neutrino capture rate in each zone. This experiment can set
limits on transitions from active to sterile neutrinos with Delta m^2 ~ 1 eV^2
with a sensitivity to disappearance of electron neutrinos of a few percent.
