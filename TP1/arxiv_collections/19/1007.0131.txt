V4332 Sgr experienced an outburst in 1994 whose observational characteristics
in many respects resemble those of the eruption of V838 Mon in 2002. It has
been proposed that these objects erupted because of a stellar-merger event. Our
aim is to derive, from observational data, information on the present (10-15
yrs after the outburst) nature and structure of the object. We present and
analyse a high-resolution (R = 21 000) spectrum of V4332 Sgr obtained with the
Subaru Telescope in June 2009. Various components (stellar-like continuum,
atomic emission lines, molecular bands in emission) in the spectrum are
analysed and discussed. We also investigate a global spectral energy
distribution (SED) of the object mostly derived from broadband optical and
infrared photometry. The observed continuum resembles that of an M6 giant. The
emission features (atomic and molecular) are most probably produced by
radiative pumping. The observed strengths of the emission features strongly
suggest that we only observe a small part of the radiation of the main object
responsible for pumping the emission features. An infrared component seen in
the observed SED, which can be roughly approximated by two blackbodies of 950
and 200 K, is 50 times brighter than the M6 stellar component seen in the
optical. This further supports the idea that the main object is mostly obscured
for us. The main object in V4332 Sgr, an M6 (super)giant, is surrounded by a
circumstellar disc, which is seen almost edge-on so the central star is
obscured. The observed M6 spectrum probably results from scattering the central
star spectrum on dust grains at the outer edge of the disc.
