We study coarsening dynamics in the ferromagnetic random bond Ising model in
d = 1; 2. We focus on the validity of super-universality and the scaling
properties of the response functions. In the d = 1 case, we obtain a complete
understanding of the evolution, from pre- asymptotic to asymptotic behavior.
The corresponding response function shows a clear violation of
super-universality. Further, our results for d = 1; 2 settle the controversy
regarding the decay exponent which characterizes the response function.
