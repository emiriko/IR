At the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati of the National Institute of Nuclear
Physics (INFN) an infrared (IR) array detector with fast response time has been
built and assembled in order to collect the IR image of e-/e+ sources of the
DA{\Phi}NE collider. Such detector is made by 32 bilinear pixels with an
individual size of 50x50 {\mu}m2 and a response time of ~1 ns. In the framework
of an experiment funded by the INFN Vth Committee dedicated to beam
diagnostics, the device with its electronic board has been tested and installed
on the DA{\Phi}NE positron ring. A preliminary characterization of few pixels
of the array and of the electronics has been carried out at the IR beamline
SINBAD at DA{\Phi}NE. In particular the detection of the IR source of the e-
beam has been observed using four pixels of the array acquiring signals
simultaneously with a four channels scope at 1 GHz and at 10 Gsamples/s. The
acquisition of four pixels allowed monitoring in real time differences in the
bunch signals in the vertical direction. A preliminary analysis of data is
presented and discussed. In particular we will outline the correlation between
signals and displacements of the source occurring with bunch refilling during a
complete shift of DA{\Phi}NE.
