The renormalization group flows of the one-dimensional anisotropic XY model
and quantum Ising model under a transverse field are obtained by different
multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz schemes. It is shown that the
optimized disentangler removes the short-range entanglement by rotating the
system in the parameter space spanned by the anisotropy and the magnetic field.
It is understood from the study that the disentangler reduces the entanglement
by mapping the system to another one in the same universality class but with
smaller short range entanglement. The phase boundary and corresponding critical
exponents are calculated using different schemes with different block sizes,
look-ahead steps and truncation dimensions. It is shown that larger truncation
dimension leads to more accurate results and that using larger block size or
look-ahead step improve the overall calculation consistency.
