Quantum Relativity is supposed to be a new theory, which locally is a
deformation of Special Relativity, and globally it is a background independent
theory including the main ideas of General Relativity, with hindsight from
Quantum Theory. The qubit viewed as a Hopf monopole bundle is considered as a
unifying gauge "group". Breaking its chiral symmetry is conjectured to yield
gravity as a deformation of electromagnetism. It is already a quantum theory in
the context of Quantum Information Dynamics as a discrete, background
independent theory, unifying classical and quantum physics.
  Based on the above, Quantum Gravity is sketched as an open project.
