We assemble a census of the most massive stars in Orion, then use stellar
isochrones to estimate their masses and ages, and use these results to
establish the stellar content of Orion's individual OB associations. From this,
our new population synthesis code is utilized to derive the history of the
emission of UV radiation and kinetic energy of the material ejected by the
massive stars, and also follow the ejection of the long-lived radioactive
isotopes 26Al and 60Fe. In order to estimate the precision of our method, we
compare and contrast three distinct representations of the massive stars. We
compare the expected outputs with observations of 26Al gamma-ray signal and the
extent of the Eridanus cavity. We find an integrated kinetic energy emitted by
the massive stars of 1.8(+1.5-0.4)times 10^52 erg. This number is consistent
with the energy thought to be required to create the Eridanus superbubble. We
also find good agreement between our model and the observed 26Al signal,
estimating a mass of 5.8(+2.7-2.5) times 10^-4 Msol of 26Al in the Orion
region. Our population synthesis approach is demonstrated for the Orion region
to reproduce three different kinds of observable outputs from massive stars in
a consistent manner: Kinetic energy as manifested in ISM excavation, ionization
as manifested in free-free emission, and nucleosynthesis ejecta as manifested
in radioactivity gamma-rays. The good match between our model and the
observables does not argue for considerable modifications of mass loss. If
clumping effects turn out to be strong, other processes would need to be
identified to compensate for their impact on massive-star outputs. Our
population synthesis analysis jointly treats kinematic output and the return of
radioactive isotopes, which proves a powerful extension of the methodology that
constrains feedback from massive stars.
