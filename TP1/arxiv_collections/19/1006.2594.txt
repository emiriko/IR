We briefly review the lepton flavor violating Z-decays at GigaZ as a probe of
supersymmetry by focusing on $Z \to \ell_i \overline{\ell}_j$ in two
representative supersymmetric models: the minimal supersymmetric model without
R-parity and the supersymmetric seesaw model. We conclude that under the
current experimental constraints from LEP and $\ell_i\to \ell_j \gamma$, these
rare decays can still be enhanced to reach the sensitivity of the GigaZ.
Therefore, supersymmetry can be probed via these decays at GigaZ.
