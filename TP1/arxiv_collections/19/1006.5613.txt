The Bianchi type-I universe filled with dark energy from a wet dark fluid has
been considered. A new equation of state for the dark energy component of the
universe has been used. It is modeled on the equation of state $p=\gamma (\rho
-\rho_\star)$ which can describe a liquid, for example water. The exact
solutions to the corresponding field equations are obtained in quadrature form.
The solution for constant deceleration parameter have been studied in detail
for power-law and exponential forms both. The cases $\gamma =1$ and $\gamma =0$
have been also analysed.
