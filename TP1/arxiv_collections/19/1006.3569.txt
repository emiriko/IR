The hydrodynamic theory of heterogeneous fluid membranes is extended to the
case of a membrane adjacent to a solid substrate. We derive the coupling
diffusion coefficients of pairs of membrane inclusions in the limit of large
separation compared to the inclusion size. Two-dimensional compressive stresses
in the membrane make the coupling coefficients decay asymptotically as $1/r^2$
with interparticle distance $r$. For the common case, where the distance to the
substrate is of sub-micron scale, we present expressions for the coupling
between distant disklike inclusions, which are valid for arbitrary inclusion
size. We calculate the effect of inclusions on the response of the membrane and
the associated corrections to the coupling diffusion coefficients to leading
order in the concentration of inclusions. While at short distances the response
is modified as if the membrane were a two-dimensional suspension, the
large-distance response is not renormalized by the inclusions.
