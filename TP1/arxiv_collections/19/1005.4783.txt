The reaction dynamics of axisymmetric deformed $^{24}$Mg + $^{24}$Mg
collisions have been investigated systematically by an isospin-dependent
quantum molecular dynamics (IDQMD) model. It is found that different
deformations and orientations result in apparently different properties of
reaction dynamics. We revealed that some observables such as nuclear stopping
power ($R$), multiplicity of fragments, and elliptic flow are very sensitive to
the initial deformations and orientations. There exists an eccentricity scaling
of elliptic flow in central body-body collisions with different deformations.
In addition, the tip-tip and body-body configurations turn out to be two
extreme cases in central reaction dynamical process.
