We develop a natural generalization to the notion of the central path -- a
notion that lies at the heart of interior-point methods for convex
optimization. The generalization is accomplished via the "derivative cones" of
a "hyperbolicity cone," the derivatives being direct and
mathematically-appealing relaxations of the underlying (hyperbolic) conic
constraint, be it the non-negative orthant, the cone of positive semidefinite
matrices, or other.
  We prove that a dynamics inherent to the derivative cones generates paths
always leading to optimality, the central path arising from a special case in
which the derivative cones are quadratic. Derivative cones of higher degree
better fit the underlying conic constraint, raising the prospect that the paths
they generate lead to optimality quicker than the central path.
