Services oriented grids will be more prominent among other kinds of grids in
the present distributed environments. With the advent of online government
services the governmental grids will come up in huge numbers. Apart from common
security issues as in other grids, the authorization in service oriented grids
faces certain shortcomings and needs to be looked upon differently. The CMMS
model presented here overcomes all these shortcomings and adds to the
simplicity of implementation because of its tight similarities with certain
government services and their functioning. The model is used to prototype a
State Police Information Grid (SPIG). Small technological restructuring is
required in PKIX and X.509 certificates.
