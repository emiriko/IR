We construct a nonequilibrium theory for the charge transfer through a
diffusive array of alternating normal (N) and superconducting (S) islands
comprising an SNSNS junction, with the size of the central S-island being
smaller than the energy relaxation length. We demonstrate that in the
nonequilibrium regime the central island acts as Andreev retransmitter with the
Andreev conversions at both NS interfaces of the central island correlated via
over-the-gap transmission and Andreev reflection. This results in a
synchronized transmission at certain resonant voltages which can be
experimentally observed as a sequence of spikes in the differential
conductivity.
