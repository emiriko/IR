The stalling radius of a merging massive binary black hole (BBH) is expected
to be below 0".1 even in nearby galaxies (Yu 2002), and thus BBHs are not
expected to be spatially resolved in the near future. However, as we show
below, a BBH may be detectable through the significantly anisotropic stellar
velocity distribution it produces on scales 5-10 times larger than the binary
separation. We calculate the velocity distribution of stable orbits near a BBH
by solving the restricted three body problem for a BBH embedded in a bulge
potential. We present high resolution maps of the projected velocity
distribution moments, based on snapshots of ~ 10^8 stable orbits. The kinematic
signature of a BBH in the average velocity maps is a counter rotating torus of
stars outside the BBH Hill spheres. The velocity dispersion maps reveal a dip
in the inner region, and an excess of 20-40% further out, compared to a single
BH of the same total mass. More pronounced signatures are seen in the third and
fourth Gauss-Hermite velocity moments maps. The detection of these signatures
may indicate the presence of a BBH currently, or at some earlier time, which
depends on the rate of velocity phase space mixing following the BBH merger.
