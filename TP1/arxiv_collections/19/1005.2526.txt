The goal of local helioseismology is to elicit three-dimensional information
about the sub-surface (or far-side) structure and dynamics of the Sun from
observations of the helioseismic wave field at the surface. The physical
quantities of interest include flows, sound-speed deviations and magnetic
fields. However, strong surface magnetic fields induce large perturbations to
the waves making inversions difficult to interpret. The purpose of this paper
is to outline the methods of analysis used in local helioseismology, review
discoveries associated with the magnetic Sun made using local helioseismology
from the past three years, and highlight the efforts towards imaging the
interior in the presence of strong magnetic fields.
