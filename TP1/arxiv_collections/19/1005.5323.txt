Despite being very successful in explaining the wide range of precision
experimental results obtained so far, the Standard Model (SM) of elementary
particles fails to address two of the greatest observations of the recent
decades: tiny but nonzero neutrino masses and the well-known problem of missing
mass in the Universe. Typically the new models beyond the SM explain only one
of these observations. Instead, in the present article, we take the view that
they both point towards the same new extension of the Standard Model. The new
particles introduced are responsible simultaneously for neutrino masses and for
the dark matter of the Universe. The stability of dark matter and the smallness
of neutrino masses are guaranteed by a U(1) global symmetry, broken to a
remnant Z_2. The canonical seesaw mechanism is forbidden and neutrino masses
emerge at the loop level being further suppressed by the small explicit
breaking of the U(1) symmetry. The new particles and interactions are invoked
at the electroweak scale and lead to rich phenomenology in colliders, in lepton
flavour violating rare decays and in direct and indirect dark matter searches,
making the model testable in the coming future.
