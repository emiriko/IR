The aim of this paper is to describe an approach to a a strengthened form of
J. Tits' Centre Conjecture for spherical buildings. This is accomplished by
generalizing a fundamental result of G. R. Kempf from Geometric Invariant
Theory and interpreting this generalization in the context of spherical
buildings. We are able to recapture the conjecture entirely in terms of our
generalization of Kempf's notion of a state. We demonstrate the utility of this
approach by proving the Centre Conjecture in some special cases.
