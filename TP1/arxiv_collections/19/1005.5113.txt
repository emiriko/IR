We extend the renormalized perturbation theory for the single impurity
Anderson model to the n-channel model with a Hund's rule coupling, and show
that the exact results for the spin, orbital and charge susceptibilities, as
well as the leading low temperature dependence for the resistivity, are
obtained by working to second order in the renormalized couplings. A universal
relation is obtained between the renormalized parameters, independent of n, in
the Kondo regime. An expression for the dynamic spin susceptibility is also
derived by taking into account repeated quasiparticle scattering, which is
asymptotically exact in the low frequency regime and satisfies the
Korringa-Shiba relation. The renormalized parameters, including the
renormalized Hund's rule coupling, are deduced from numerical renormalization
group calculations for the model for the case n=2. The results confirm
explicitly the universal relations between the parameters in the Kondo regime.
Using these results we evaluate the spin, orbital and charge susceptibilities,
temperature dependence of the low temperature resistivity and dynamic spin
susceptibility for the particle-hole symmetric n=2 model.
