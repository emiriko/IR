In DA{\Phi}NE, the Frascati e+/e- collider, the crab waist collision scheme
has been successfully implemented in 2008 and 2009. During the collision
operations for Siddharta experiment, an unusual synchrotron damping effect has
been observed. Indeed, with the longitudinal feedback switched off, the
positron beam becomes unstable with beam currents in the order of 200-300 mA.
The longitudinal instability is damped by bringing the positron beam in
collision with a high current electron beam (~2A). Besides, we have observed a
shift of \approx 600Hz in the residual synchrotron sidebands. Precise
measurements have been performed by using both a commercial spectrum analyzer
and the diagnostics capabilities of the DA{\Phi}NE longitudinal bunch-by-bunch
feedback. This damping effect has been observed in DA{\Phi}NE for the first
time during collisions with the crab waist scheme. Our explanation is that beam
collisions with a large crossing angle produce a longitudinal tune shift and a
longitudinal tune spread, providing Landau damping of synchrotron oscillations.
