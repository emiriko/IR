In OLAP, analysts often select an interesting sample of the data. For
example, an analyst might focus on products bringing revenues of at least 100
000 dollars, or on shops having sales greater than 400 000 dollars. However,
current systems do not allow the application of both of these thresholds
simultaneously, selecting products and shops satisfying both thresholds. For
such purposes, we introduce the diamond cube operator, filling a gap among
existing data warehouse operations.
  Because of the interaction between dimensions the computation of diamond
cubes is challenging. We compare and test various algorithms on large data sets
of more than 100 million facts. We find that while it is possible to implement
diamonds in SQL, it is inefficient. Indeed, our custom implementation can be a
hundred times faster than popular database engines (including a row-store and a
column-store).
