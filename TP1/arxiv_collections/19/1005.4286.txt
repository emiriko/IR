Many inequivalent approaches to study black holes yield identical results.
Any meaningful theory of gravity should explain the origin of this property.
Here we show that the basic holomorphic modes characterising the underlying two
dimensional conformal symmetry near the horizon bring about this universality.
Moreover these modes lead to a law of equipartition of energy for black holes
which suggests a statistical origin of gravity. This emergent nature of gravity
is further bolstered by showing the equivalence of entropy with the action
$\left(S=-\frac{i}{\hbar}\,I\right)$ and expressing the generalised Smarr
formula for mass as a thermodynamic relation, $S=\frac{E}{2T}$ where $S$, $E$
and $T$ are the entropy, energy and temperature, respectively, of a black hole.
