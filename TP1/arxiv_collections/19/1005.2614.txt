We present a method for computing the PDF and CDF of a non-negative
infinitely divisible random variable $X$. Our method uses the
L\'{e}vy-Khintchine representation of the Laplace transform $\mathbb{E}
e^{-\lambda X} = e^{-\phi(\lambda)}$, where $\phi$ is the Laplace exponent. We
apply the Post-Widder method for Laplace transform inversion combined with a
sequence convergence accelerator to obtain accurate results. We demonstrate
this technique on several examples including the stable distribution, mixtures
thereof, and integrals with respect to non-negative L\'{e}vy processes.
Software to implement this method is available from the authors and we
illustrate its use at the end of the paper.
