Up to now there has been no search for gravitational waves from the r-modes
of neutron stars in spite of the theoretical interest in the subject. Several
oddities of r-modes must be addressed to obtain an observational result: The
gravitational radiation field is dominated by the mass current
(gravitomagnetic) quadrupole rather than the usual mass quadrupole, and the
consequent difference in polarization affects detection statistics and
parameter estimation. To astrophysically interpret a detection or upper limit
it is necessary to convert the wave amplitude to an r-mode amplitude. Also, it
is helpful to know indirect limits on gravitational-wave emission to gauge the
interest of various searches. Here I address these issues, thereby providing
the ingredients to adapt broad-band searches for continuous gravitational waves
to obtain r-mode results. I also show that searches of existing data can
already have interesting sensitivities to r-modes.
