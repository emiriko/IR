The lightest supersymmetric particle may decay with branching ratios that
correlate with neutrino oscillation parameters. In this case the CERN Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) has the potential to probe the atmospheric neutrino
mixing angle with sensitivity competitive to its low-energy determination by
underground experiments. Under realistic detection assumptions, we identify the
necessary conditions for the experiments at CERN's LHC to probe the simplest
scenario for neutrino masses induced by minimal supergravity with bilinear R
parity violation.
