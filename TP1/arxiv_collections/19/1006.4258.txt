We report the design and construction of a novel soft x-ray diffractometer
installed at Diamond Light Source. The beamline endstation RASOR is constructed
for general users and designed primarily for the study of single crystal
diffraction and thin film reflectivity. The instrument is comprised of a
limited three circle ({\theta}, 2{\theta}, {\chi}) diffractometer with an
additional removable rotation ({\phi}) stage. It is equipped with a liquid
helium cryostat, and post-scatter polarization analysis. Motorised motions are
provided for the precise positioning of the sample onto the diffractometer
centre of rotation, and for positioning the centre of rotation onto the x-ray
beam. The functions of the instrument have been tested at Diamond Light Source,
and initial test measurements are provided, demonstrating the potential of the
instrument.
