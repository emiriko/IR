Despite the intensive efforts for determining the mechanism that causes
high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxide materials, no consensus on
the pairing mechanism has been reached. Recent advances in high resolution
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopies have suggested that a sizeable
electron-phonon coupling exists as the principal cause for kinks in the
dispersion relations (energy versus wave vector) of the electronic states.
Here, we report on a systematic study about the influence of the
electron-phonon coupling parameter "$\lambda$" in the electronic quasiparticle
dispersions along the nodal direction for $La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}$,
$Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+x}$ and $YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}$. Information about the
dressing of the charge carriers, i.e., on the enhancement of the effective mass
and the strength of the coupling mode, is obtained as a function of the doping
concentration, temperature, momentum and energy from the kink dispersion in the
(0-0)-$(\pi,\pi)$ direction of momentum-space avoiding the complications of the
\textit{d-}wave superconducting gap. Our analysis shows a remarkable agreement
between theory and experiment for different samples and at different doping
levels. This includes our recently introduced theoretical model to adjust the
experimental data of the fermionic band dispersion, emphasising the necessary
distinction between the general electron mass-enhancement parameter
$\lambda^{*}$ and the conventional electron-phonon coupling parameter
$\lambda$.
