Computation with advice is suggested as generalization of both computation
with discrete advice and Type-2 Nondeterminism. Several embodiments of the
generic concept are discussed, and the close connection to Weihrauch
reducibility is pointed out. As a novel concept, computability with random
advice is studied; which corresponds to correct solutions being guessable with
positive probability. In the framework of computation with advice, it is
possible to define computational complexity for certain concepts of
hypercomputation. Finally, some examples are given which illuminate the
interplay of uniform and non-uniform techniques in order to investigate both
computability with advice and the Weihrauch lattice.
