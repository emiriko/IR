The integral equations involved in Alekseev's "monodromy transform" technique
are shown to be simple combinations of Sibgatullin's integral equations and
normalizing conditions. An additional complex conjugation introduced by
Alekseev in the integrands makes his scheme mathematically inconsistent;
besides, in the electrovac case all Alekseev's principal value integrals
contain an intrinsic error which has never been identified before. We also
explain how operates a non-trivial double-step algorithm devised by Alekseev
for rewriting, by purely algebraic manipulations and in a different (more
complicated) parameter set, any particular specialization of the known
analytically extended N-soliton electrovac solution obtained in 1995 with the
aid of Sibgatullin's method.
