We consider a population of identical individuals preying on an exhaustible
resource. The individuals in the population choose a strategy that defines how
they use their available time over the course of their life for feeding, for
reproducing (say laying eggs), or split their energy in between these two
activities. We here suppose that their life lasts a full season, so that the
chosen strategy results in the production of a certain number of eggs laid over
the season. This number then helps define the long-run evolution of the
population since the eggs constitute the basis for the population for the next
season. However, in this paper, we strictly concentrate on what occurs within a
season, by considering two possible strategies: the collective optimum and the
uninvadable strategy. The (collective) optimal strategy involves a singular
arc, which has some resource saving feature and may, on the long-term, lead to
an equilibrium. However, it is susceptible to invasion by a greedy mutant which
free-rides on this resource saving strategy. Therefore, the "optimal" strategy
is not evolutionarily stable. We thus look for an evolutionarily stable
strategy, using the first ESS condition ("Nash-Wardrop condition"). This yields
a different singular arc and a strategy that conserves less the resource.
Unfortunately, we show in a forthcoming paper that, though it is an ESS, it is
not long-term (interseasonal) sustainable. This is an instance of the classical
"tragedy of the commons". In this paper we also investigate whether the mixed
strategy on the singular arcs may be interpreted in terms of population shares
using pure strategies. The answer is negative.
