Let {M_n}_{n\ge 0}$ be a nonnegative Markov process with stationary
transition probabilities. The quasistationary distributions referred to in this
note are of the form Q_A(x) = lim_{n\to\infty} P(M_n \le x | M_0 \le A, M_1 \le
A, ..., M_n \le A) . Suppose that $M_0$ has distribution $\Qb_A$ and define
T_A^{Q_A} = \min\{n | M_n > A, n\ge 1\}, the first time when M_n exceeds A. We
provide sufficient conditions for E T_A^{Q_A}$ to be an increasing function of
A.
