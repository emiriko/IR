We analyze equilibrium properties and adsorption desorption phase transition
behaviour of a linear semiflexible copolymer chain under constrained
geometrical situation on square lattice in a good solvent. One dimensional
stair shaped line imposes geometrical constrain on the chain. Lattice model of
fully directed self avoiding walk is used to model the chain, semiflexibility
of the chain is accounted by introducing energy barrier for each bend of the
chain. Exact expression of the partition function of the chain is obtained
using generating function technique for the cases, viz. (i) constrained
copolymer chain is in the bulk, (ii) constrained copolymer chain interacting
with an impenetrable flat surface, (iii) constrained copolymer chain
interacting with constraint itself and (iv) general expression of the partition
function of the copolymer chain, interacting with a flat surface and
geometrical constraint (stair shaped line). We have compared bulk properties
and adsorption desorption transition behaviour of a linear semiflexible
homopolymer chain without constraint to the case when the chain is constrained.
