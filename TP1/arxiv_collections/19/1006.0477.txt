We study the capabilities of the Fermi-LAT instrument on board of the Fermi
mission to constrain particle dark matter properties, as annihilation cross
section, mass and branching ratio into dominant annihilation channels, with
gamma-ray observations from the galactic center. Besides the prompt gamma-ray
flux, we also take into account the contribution from the electrons/positrons
produced in dark matter annihilations to the gamma-ray signal via inverse
Compton scattering off the interstellar photon background, which turns out to
be crucial in the case of dark matter annihilations into mu+mu- and e+e- pairs.
We study the signal dependence on different parameters like the region of
observation, the density profile, the assumptions for the dark matter model and
the uncertainties in the propagation model. We also show the effect of the
inclusion of a 20% systematic uncertainty in the gamma-ray background. If
Fermi-LAT is able to distinguish a possible dark matter signal from the large
gamma-ray background, we show that for dark matter masses below ~200 GeV,
Fermi-LAT will likely be able to determine dark matter properties with good
accuracy.
