X-ray reflectivity studies demonstrate the condensation of a monovalent ion
at the electrified interface between electrolyte solutions of water and
1,2-dichloroethane. Predictions of the ion distributions by standard
Poisson-Boltzmann (Gouy-Chapman) theory are inconsistent with these data at
higher applied interfacial electric potentials. Calculations from a
Poisson-Boltzmann equation that incorporates a non-monotonic ion-specific
potential of mean force are in good agreement with the data.
