We study the properties of propagating polariton wave-packets and their
connection to the stability of doubly charged vortices. Wave-packet propagation
and related photoluminescence spectra exhibit a rich behaviour dependent on the
excitation regime. We show that, because of the non-quadratic polariton
dispersion, doubly charged vortices are stable only when initiated in
wave-packets propagating at small velocities. Vortices propagating at larger
velocities, or those imprinted directly into the polariton optical parametric
oscillator (OPO) signal and idler are always unstable to splitting.
