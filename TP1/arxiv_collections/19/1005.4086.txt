A small and light polystyrene ball is released without initial speed from a
certain height above the floor. Then, it falls on air. The main responsible for
the friction force against the movement is the wake of successive air vortices
which form behind (above) the falling ball, a turbulent phenomenon. After the
wake appears, the friction force compensates the Earth gravitational attraction
and the ball speed stabilises in a certain limiting value Vl. Before the
formation of the turbulent wake, however, the friction force is not strong
enough, allowing the initially growing speed to surpass the future final value
Vl. Only after the wake finally becomes long enough, the ball speed decreases
and reaches the proper Vl.
