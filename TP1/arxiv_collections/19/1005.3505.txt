We investigate the experimentally allowed parameter space of an extension of
the standard model (SM3) by one additional family of fermions. Therefore we
extend our previous study of the CKM like mixing constraints of a fourth
generation of quarks. In addition to the bounds from tree-level determinations
of the 3$\times$3 CKM elements and FCNC processes ($K$-, $D$-, $B_d$-,
$B_s$-mixing and the decay $b \to s \gamma$) we also investigate the
electroweak $S$, $T$, $U$ parameters, the angle $\gamma$ of the unitarity
triangle and the rare decay $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$. Moreover we improve our
treatment of the QCD corrections compared to our previous analysis. We also
take leptonic contributions into account, but we neglect the mixing among
leptons. As a result we find that typically small mixing with the fourth family
is favored, but still some sizeable deviations from the SM3 results are not yet
excluded. The minimal possible value of $V_{tb}$ is 0.93. Also very large
CP-violating effects in $B_s$ mixing seem to be impossible within an extension
of the SM3 that consists of an additional fermion family alone. We find a
delicate interplay of electroweak and flavor observables, which strongly
suggests that a separate treatment of the two sectors is not feasible. In
particular we show that the inclusion of the full CKM dependence of the $S$ and
$T$ parameters in principle allows the existence of a degenerate fourth
generation of quarks.
