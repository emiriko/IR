We present a set of Bell inequalities which are sufficient and necessary for
separability of general pure multipartite quantum states in arbitrary
dimensions. The relations between Bell inequalities and distillability are also
studied. We show that any quantum states that violate one of these Bell
inequalities are distillable.
