We report on the observation of emerging beam resonances, well known as
Rayleigh-Wood anomalies and threshold resonances in photon and electron
diffraction, respectively, in an atom-optical diffraction experiment.
Diffraction of He atom beams reflected from a blazed ruled grating at grazing
incidence has been investigated. The total reflectivity of the grating as well
as the intensities of the diffracted beams reveal anomalies at the Rayleigh
angles of incidence, i.e., when another diffracted beam merges parallel to the
grating surface. The observed anomalies are discussed in terms of the classical
wave-optical model of Rayleigh and Fano.
