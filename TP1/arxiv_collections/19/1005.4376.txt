Community structure is one of the key properties of complex networks and
plays a crucial role in their topology and function. While an impressive amount
of work has been done on the issue of community detection, very little
attention has been so far devoted to the investigation of communities in real
networks. We present a systematic empirical analysis of the statistical
properties of communities in large information, communication, technological,
biological, and social networks. We find that the mesoscopic organization of
networks of the same category is remarkably similar. This is reflected in
several characteristics of community structure, which can be used as
``fingerprints'' of specific network categories. While community size
distributions are always broad, certain categories of networks consist mainly
of tree-like communities, while others have denser modules. Average path
lengths within communities initially grow logarithmically with community size,
but the growth saturates or slows down for communities larger than a
characteristic size. This behaviour is related to the presence of hubs within
communities, whose roles differ across categories. Also the community
embeddedness of nodes, measured in terms of the fraction of links within their
communities, has a characteristic distribution for each category. Our findings
are verified by the use of two fundamentally different community detection
methods.
