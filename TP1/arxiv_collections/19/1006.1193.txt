We present a Compression Tool, "GenBit Compress", for genetic sequences based
on our new proposed "GenBit Compress Algorithm". Our Tool achieves the best
compression ratios for Entire Genome (DNA sequences) . Significantly better
compression results show that GenBit compress algorithm is the best among the
remaining Genome compression algorithms for non-repetitive DNA sequences in
Genomes. The standard Compression algorithms such as gzip or compress cannot
compress DNA sequences but only expand them in size. In this paper we consider
the problem of DNA compression. It is well known that one of the main features
of DNA Sequences is that they contain substrings which are duplicated except
for a few random Mutations. For this reason most DNA compressors work by
searching and encoding approximate repeats. We depart from this strategy by
searching and encoding only exact repeats. our proposed algorithm achieves the
best compression ratio for DNA sequences for larger genome. As long as 8 lakh
characters can be given as input While achieving the best compression ratios
for DNA sequences, our new GenBit Compress program significantly improves the
running time of all previous DNA compressors. Assigning binary bits for
fragments of DNA sequence is also a unique concept introduced in this program
for the first time in DNA compression.
