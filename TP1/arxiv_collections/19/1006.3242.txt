We describe an apparatus for the stabilization of laser frequencies that
prevents long term frequency drifts. A Fabry-Perot interferometer is
thermostated by referencing it to a stabilized He-Ne laser (master), and its
length is scanned over more than one free spectral range allowing the analysis
of one or more lines generated by other (slave) lasers. A digital acquisition
system makes the detection of the position of all the laser peaks possible,
thus producing both feedback of both the thermostat and the error signal used
for stabilizing the slave lasers. This technique also allows for easy,
referenced scanning of the slave laser frequencies over range of several
hundred MHz, with a precision of the order of a few MHz. This kind of
stabilization system is particularly useful when no atomic or molecular
reference lines are available, as in the case of rare or short lived
radioactive species.
