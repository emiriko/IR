In this paper, we develop a quantum-jump approach for describing the
photon-emission process of single fluorophore systems coupled to complex
classically fluctuating reservoirs. The formalism relies on an open quantum
system approach where the dynamic of the system and the reservoir fluctuations
are described through a density matrix whose evolution is defined by a Lindblad
rate equation. For each realization of the photon measurement processes it is
possible to define a conditional system state (stochastic density matrix) whose
evolution depends on both the photon detection events and the fluctuations
between the configurational states of the reservoir. In contrast to standard
fluorescent systems the photon-to-photon emission process is not a renewal one,
being defined by a (stochastic) waiting time distribution that in each
recording event parametrically depends on the conditional state. The formalism
allows calculating experimental observables such as the full hierarchy of joint
probabilities associated to the time intervals between consecutive photon
recording events. These results provide a powerful basis for characterizing
different situations arising in single-molecule spectroscopy, such as spectral
fluctuations, lifetime fluctuations, and light assisted processes.
