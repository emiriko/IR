We apply the closed time-path Green function formalism in the
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. First of all, we use this formalism to obtain the
well-known gap equation for the quark condensate in a stationary homogeneous
system. We have also used this formalism to obtain the Ginzburg-Landau (GL)
equation and the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation for the chiral
order parameter in an inhomogeneous system. In our derived GL and TDGL
equations, there is no other parameters except for those in the original NJL
model.
