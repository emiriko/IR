I present a brief review of the recent phenomenological analyses of RHIC data
based on the the Color Glass Condensate, including the use of non-linear
evolution equations with running coupling. In particular, I focus in the study
of the total multiplicities in Au+Au collisions, and in the single inclusive
and double inclusive forward spectra in d+Au collisions. Predictions for the
LHC are also discussed.
