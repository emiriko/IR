An approach to hiding objects levitating or flying above a conducting sheet
is suggested in this letter. The proposed device makes use of isotropic
negative-refractive-index materials without extreme material parameters, and
creates an illusion of a remote conducting sheet. Numerical simulations are
performed to investigate the performance of this cloak in two-dimensional (2D)
and three-dimensional (3D) cases.
