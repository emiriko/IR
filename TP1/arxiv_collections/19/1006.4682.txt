We report on recent calculations of the differential cross section for
top-quark pair production at hadron colliders. The results are differential
with respect to the top-pair invariant mass and to the partonic scattering
angle. In these calculations, which were carried out by employing
soft-collinear effective theory techniques, we resummed threshold logarithms up
to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order. Starting from the differential
cross section, it is possible to obtain theoretical predictions for the
invariant-mass distribution and the total cross section. We summarize here our
results for these observables, and we compare them with the results obtained
from different calculational methods.
