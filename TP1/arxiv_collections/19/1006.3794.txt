We show that there is a close correspondence between the physical properties
of holographic metals near charged black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space,
and the fractionalized Fermi liquid phase of the lattice Anderson model. The
latter phase has a "small" Fermi surface of conduction electrons, along with a
spin liquid of local moments. This correspondence implies that certain
mean-field gapless spin liquids are states of matter at non-zero density
realizing the near-horizon, AdS_2 x R^2 physics of Reissner-Nordstrom black
holes.
