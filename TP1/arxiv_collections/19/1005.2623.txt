We report recent results on the use of charge division to obtain a
longitudinal coordinate from silicon strip detectors, and on sources of
electronic readout noise for long, thin strips. These results hold promise for
the design of Linear Collider charged particle tracking system composed of
silicon microstrip sensors.
