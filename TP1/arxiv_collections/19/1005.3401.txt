Recent experimental and theoretical research in the area of neutrino
interactions in the ~ 1 GeV region are reviewed including topics like: the
problem of value of quasielastic axial mass, neutral current Pi0 production,
coherent pion production. Many comments are devoted to status and current
development of Monte Carlo events generators.
