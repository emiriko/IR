Synthetic spectra covering the wavelength range 900\AA~to 3000\AA~provide an
accurate fit, established by a ${\chi}_{\nu}^2$ analysis, to a combined
observed spectrum of RW Sextantis. Two separately calibrated distances to the
system establish the synthetic spectrum comparison on an absolute flux basis
but with two alternative scaling factors, requiring alternative values of
$\dot{M}$ for final models. Based on comparisons for a range of $\dot{M}$
values, the observed spectrum does not follow the standard model. Rather than
the exponent 0.25 in the expression for the radial temperature profile, a value
close to 0.125 produces a synthetic spectrum with an accurate fit to the
combined spectrum. A study of time-series $FUSE$ spectra shows that a proposed
warped or tilted disk is not supported by the data; an alternative proposal is
that an observed non-axisymmetric wind results from an interaction with the
mass transfer stream debris.
