The effect of mutual drag between phonons and spin excitations on the thermal
conductivity of a quantum spin system is discussed. We derive general
expression for the drag component of the thermal current using both Boltzmann
equation approach and Kubo linear-response formalism to leading order in the
spin-phonon coupling. We demonstrate that aside from higher-order corrections
which appear in the Kubo formalism both approaches yield identical results for
the drag thermal conductivity. We discuss the range of applicability of our
result and provide a generalization of our consideration to the cases of
fermionic excitations and to anomalous forms of boson-phonon coupling. Several
asymptotic regimes of our findings relevant to realistic situations are
highlighted.
