We report the results of the first search for gravitational waves from
compact binary coalescence using data from the LIGO and Virgo detectors. Five
months of data were collected during the concurrent S5 (LIGO) and VSR1 (Virgo)
science runs. The search focused on signals from binary mergers with a total
mass between 2 and 35 Msun. No gravitational waves are identified. The
cumulative 90%-confidence upper limits on the rate of compact binary
coalescence are calculated for non-spinning binary neutron stars, black
hole-neutron star systems, and binary black holes to be 8.7x10^-3, 2.2x10^-3
and 4.4x10^-4 yr^-1 L_10^-1 respectively, where L_10 is 10^10 times the blue
solar luminosity. These upper limits are compared with astrophysical
expectations.
