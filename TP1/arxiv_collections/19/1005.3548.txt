Massive metal-poor stars might form massive stellar black holes (BHs), with
mass 25<=mBH/Msun<=80, via direct collapse. We derive the number of massive BHs
(NBH) that are expected to form per galaxy through this mechanism. Such massive
BHs might power most of the observed ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). We
select a sample of 64 galaxies with X-ray coverage, measurements of the star
formation rate (SFR) and of the metallicity. We find that NBH correlates with
the number of observed ULXs per galaxy (NULX) in this sample. We discuss the
dependence of our model on the SFR and on the metallicity. The SFR is found to
be crucial, consistently with previous studies. The metallicity plays a role in
our model, since a lower metallicity enhances the formation of massive BHs.
Consistently with our model, the data indicate that there might be an
anticorrelation between NULX, normalized to the SFR, and the metallicity. A
larger and more homogeneous sample of metallicity measurements is required, in
order to confirm our results.
