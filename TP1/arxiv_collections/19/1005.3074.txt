Motivated by recently observed disagreements with the SM predictions in $B$
decays, we study $b \to d, s$ transitions in an asymmetric class of $SU(2)_L
\times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ models, with a simple one-parameter structure
of the right handed mixing matrix for the quarks, which obeys the constraints
from kaon physics. We use experimental constraints on the branching ratios of
$b \to s \gamma$, $b \to c e {\bar \nu}_e$, and $B_{d,s}^0 -\bar{B}^0_{d,s}$
mixing to restrict the parameters of the model: $\displaystyle {g_R}/{g_L},
M_{W_2}, M_{H^\pm}, \tan \beta$ as well as the elements of the right-handed
quark mixing matrix $V^R_{CKM}$. We present a comparison with the more commonly
used (manifest) left-right symmetric model. Our analysis exposes the parameters
most sensitive to $b$ transitions and reveals a large parameter space where
left- and right-handed quarks mix differently, opening the possibility of
observing marked differences in behaviour between the standard model and the
left-right model.
