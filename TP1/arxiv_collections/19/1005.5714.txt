We have performed density functional calculations as well as employed a
tight-binding theory, to study the effect of passivation of zigzag graphene
nanoribbons (ZGNR) by Hydrogen. We show that each edge C atom bonded with 2 H
atoms open up a gap and destroys magnetism for small widths of the nanoribbon.
However, a re-entrant magnetism accompanied by a metallic electronic structure
is observed from 8 rows and thicker nanoribbons. The electronic structure and
magnetic state are quite complex for this type of termination, with sp$^3$
bonded edge atoms being non-magnetic, whereas the nearest neighboring atoms are
metallic and magnetic. We have also evaluated the phase stability of several
thicknesses of ZGNR, and demonstrate that sp$^3$ bonded edge atoms, with 2 H
atoms at the edge, should be stable at temperatures and pressures which are
reachable in a laboratory environment.
