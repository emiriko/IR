It is shown that, every entangled state in an infinite-dimensional composite
system has a simple entanglement witness of the form $\alpha I+T$ with $\alpha$
a nonnegative number and $T$ a finite rank self-adjoint operator. We also
provide two methods of constructing entanglement witness and apply them to
obtain some entangled states that cannot be detected by the PPT criterion and
the realignment criterion.
