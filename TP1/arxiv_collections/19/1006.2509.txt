We search for signatures of transition region explosive events (EEs) in
hydrogen Ly-beta profiles. Two rasters made by the SUMER (Solar Ultraviolet
Measurements of Emitted Radiation) instrument on board SOHO in a quiet-Sun
region and an equatorial coronal hole are selected for our study. Transition
region explosive events are identified from profiles of C II 1037 Angstrom and
O VI 1032 Angstrom, respectively. We compare Ly-beta profiles during EEs with
those averaged in the entire quiet-Sun and coronal-hole regions. The
relationship between the peak emission of Ly-beta profiles and the wing
emission of C II and O VI during EEs is investigated. We find that the central
part of Ly-beta profiles becomes more reversed and the distance of the two
peaks becomes larger during EEs, both in the coronal hole and in the quiet Sun.
The average Ly-beta profile of the EEs detected by C II has an obvious stronger
blue peak. During EEs, there is a clear correlation between the increased peak
emission of Ly-beta profiles and the enhanced wing emission of the C II and O
VI lines. The correlation is more pronounced for the Ly-beta peaks and C II
wings, and less significant for the Ly-beta blue peak and O VI blue wing. We
also find that the Ly-beta profiles are more reversed in the coronal hole than
in the quiet Sun. We suggest that the jets produced by EEs emit Doppler-shifted
Ly-beta photons, causing enhanced emission at positions of the peaks of Ly-beta
profiles. The more-reversed Ly-beta profiles confirm the presence of a larger
opacity in the coronal hole than in the quiet Sun. The finding that EEs modify
the Ly-beta line profile in QS and CHs implies that one should be careful in
the modelling and interpretation of relevant observational data.
