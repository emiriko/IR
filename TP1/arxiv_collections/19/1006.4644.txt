In this paper we report the prototype of the first coalescing binary
detection pipeline fully implemented on NVIDIA GPU hardware accelerators. The
code has been embedded in a GPU library, called cuInspiral and has been
developed under CUDA framework. The library contains for example a PN
gravitational wave signal generator, matched filtering/FFT and detection
algorithms that have been profiled and compared with the corresponding CPU code
with dedicated benchmark in order to provide gain factor respect to the
standard CPU implementation. In the paper we present performances and accuracy
results about some of the main important elements of the pipeline,
demonstrating the feasibility and the chance of obtain an impressive computing
gain from these new many-core architectures in the perspective of the second
and third generations of gravitational wave detectors.
