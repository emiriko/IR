The process of photoproduction of electron-positron pairs in bent single
crystals is considered in this paper. In particular, it is shown that the
probability of the process for gamma-quanta with energies from 100 GeV on is
significantly higher than the one in an amorphous medium.
  A possible scenario for the experimental validation of the process is
discussed and the positive features of the photoproduction in bent crystals
compared to straight ones are underlined from the point of view of possible
applications.
