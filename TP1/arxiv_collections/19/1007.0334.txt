A detailed analysis is presented of the modes of a class of spatiotemporal
photonic crystal. The structure analyzed is a perfect dielectric with periodic
variation of {\epsilon} in a single spatial direction, as well as periodic
variation in time. Analytic solutions are presented for {\epsilon} being
separated in both variables, that is
{\epsilon}(z,t)={\epsilon}0{\epsilon}r(z){\epsilon}t(t), and dispersion
diagrams are presented.
