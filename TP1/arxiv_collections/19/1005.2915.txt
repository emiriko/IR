A new implementation of the topological cluster state quantum computer is
suggested, in which the basic elements are linear optics, measurements, and a
two-dimensional array of quantum dots. This overcomes the need for non-linear
devices to create a lattice of entangled photons. We give estimates of the
minimum efficiencies needed for the detectors, fusion gates and quantum dots,
from a numerical simulation.
