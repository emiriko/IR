In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem of the linearized kinetic
equations for the models of Marle and Anderson-Witting, and compare these
dispersion relations with the 14-moment theory. First, we propose a
modification of the Marle model to improve the resultant transport coefficients
in accord with those obtained by the full Boltzmann equation. Using the
modified Marle model and Anderson-Witting model, we calculate dispersion
relations that are kinetically correct within the validity of the BGK
approximation. The 14-moment theory that includes the time derivative of
dissipation currents has causal structure, in contrast to the acausal
first-order Chapman-Enskog approximation. However, the dispersion relation of
the 14-moment theory does not accurately describe the result of the kinetic
equation. Thus, our calculation indicates that keeping these second-order terms
does not simply correspond to improving the physical description of the
relativistic hydrodynamics.
