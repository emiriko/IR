We propose various protocols for joint remotely prepare a four-dimensional
quantum state by using two- and three-particle four-dimensional entangled state
as the quantum channel. The single- and two-particle generalized projective
measurement and the appropriate unitary operation are needed in our protocols.
It is shown that the receiver can reconstruct the unknown original state only
if two senders collaborate with each other.
