We investigate bilayer graphene transport in the presence of electron-hole
puddles induced by long-range charged impurities in the environment. We explain
the insulating behavior observed in the temperature dependent conductivity of
low mobility bilayer graphene using an analytic statistical theory taking into
account the non-mean-field nature of transport in the highly inhomogeneous
density and potential landscape. We find that the puddles can induce, even far
from the charge neutrality point, a coexisting metallic and insulating
transport behavior due to the random local activation gap in the system.
