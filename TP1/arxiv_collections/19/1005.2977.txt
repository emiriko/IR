The possibility of treating colour in one-loop amplitude calculations alike
the other quantum numbers is briefly discussed for semi-numerical algorithms
based on generalized unitarity and parametric integration techniques. Numerical
results are presented for the calculation of virtual corrections in multi-gluon
scattering.
