The probabilities of finding the muon in various states in synthetic single
crystal and polycrystalline diamond were studied. In the IIa-type
single-crystal sample at 150 K the contributions of the diamagnetic muon,
`normal', and `anomalous' muonium were observed to be 1.5 %, 57 % and 8.1 %,
respectively. The missing fraction of muon polarization was 33.4 %, which is
approximately two times smaller than in the Ia-type natural diamond, and two or
three times greater than in the IIa- and IIb-type natural diamonds. The muon
spin relaxation rates at the `normal' and `anomalous' muonium states in the
synthetic and natural samples of IIa- and IIb-type are similar.
