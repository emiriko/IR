There have been numerous studies of entanglement in spin systems. These have
usually focussed on examining the entanglement between individual spins or
determining whether the state of the system is completely separable. Here we
present conditions that allow us to determine whether blocks of spins are
entangled. We show that sometimes these conditions can detect entanglement
better than conditions involving individual spins. We apply these conditions to
study entanglement in spin wave states, both when there are only a few magnons
present and also at finite temperature.
