It is shown that the unique sign structure of the ground state of the Hubbard
model on honeycomb lattice, which is shown to be insensitive to the trapped
$Z_{2}$ gauge flux when the system is defined on a torus, may cause the absence
of topological degeneracy on this bipartite system. Examples of variational
Mott insulating state on the honeycomb lattice are given to illustrate the
close relation between the sign structure of the ground state and the (absence
of) topological degeneracy.
