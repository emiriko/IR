The cascade mass reconstruction approach was applied to simulated production
of the lightest stop quark at the LHC in the cascade decay $\tilde{g} \to \sTop
\, \Top \to \tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0} \, \Top \, \Top \to \tilde{\ell}_{R} \, \ell
\, \Top \, \Top \to \tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0} \, \ell \, \ell \, \Top \, \Top$ with
top quarks decaying into hadrons. The stop quark mass was reconstructed
assuming that the masses of gluino, slepton and of the two lightest neutralinos
were reconstructed in advance.
  A data sample set for the SU3 model point containing 400k SUSY events was
generated which corresponded to an integrated luminosity of about 20 $\rm
fb^{-1}$ at 14 TeV. These events were passed through the AcerDET detector
simulator, which parametrized the response of a generic LHC detector. The mass
of the $\tilde{t}_{1}$ was reconstructed with a precision of about $10\%$.
