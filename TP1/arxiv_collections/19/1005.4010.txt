Multicast plays an important role in implementing the group communications in
bandwidth scarce multihop mobile ad hoc networks. However, due to the dynamic
topology of MANETs it is very difficult to build optimal multicast trees and
maintaining group membership, making even more challenging to implement
scalable and robust multicast in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET). A scalable and
energy efficient location aware multicast algorithm, called SEELAMP, for mobile
ad hoc networks is presented in the paper that is based on creation of shared
tree using the physical location of the nodes for the multicast sessions. It
constructs a shared bi-directional multicast tree for its routing operations
rather than a mesh, which helps in achieving more efficient multicast delivery.
The algorithm uses the concept of small overlapped zones around each node for
proactive topology maintenance with in the zone. Protocol depends on the
location information obtained using a distributed location service, which
effectively reduces the overheads for route searching and shared multicast tree
maintenance. In this paper a new technique of local connectivity management is
being proposed that attempts to improve the performance and reliability. It
employs a preventive route reconfiguration to avoid the latency in case of link
breakages and to prevent the network from splitting.
