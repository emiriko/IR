A cavity opto-electromechanical system is reported which combines the
ultrasensitive transduction of cavity optomechanical systems with the
electrical actuation of nanoelectromechanical systems. Ultrasensitive
mechanical transduction is achieved via opto-mechanical coupling. Electrical
gradient forces as large as 0.40 $\mu$N are realized, facilitating strong
actuation with ultralow dissipation. A scanning probe microscope is
implemented, capable of characterizing the mechanical modes. The integration of
electrical actuation into optomechanical devices is an enabling step towards
the regime of quantum nonlinear dynamics, and provides new capabilities for
quantum control of mechanical motion.
