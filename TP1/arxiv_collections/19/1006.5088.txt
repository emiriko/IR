The covariance group for general relativity, the diffeomorphisms, is replaced
by a group of coordinate transformations which contains the diffeomorphisms as
a proper subgroup. The larger group is defined by the assumption that all
observers will agree whether any given quantity is conserved. Alternatively,
and equivalently, it is defined by the assumption that all observers will agree
that the general relativistic wave equation describes the propagation of light.
Thus, the group replacement is analogous to the replacement of the Lorentz
group by the diffeomorphisms that led Einstein from special relativity to
general relativity, and is also consistent with the assumption of constant
light velocity that led him to special relativity. The enlarged covariance
group leads to a non-commutative geometry based not on a manifold, but on a
nonlocal space in which paths, rather than points, are the most primitive
invariant entities. This yields a theory which unifies the gravitational and
electroweak interactions. The theory contains no adjustable parameters, such as
those that are chosen arbitrarily in the standard model.
