Based on a construction by Kashiwara and Rouquier, we present an analogue of
the Beilinson- Bernstein localization theorem for hypertoric varieties. In this
case, sheaves of differential operators are replaced by sheaves of W-algebras.
As a special case, our result gives a localization theorem for rational
Cherednik algebras associated to cyclic groups.
