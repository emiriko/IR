We examine a recent prediction for the chirality-dependence of the Casimir
force in chiral metamaterials by numerical computation of the forces between
the exact microstructures, rather than homogeneous approximations. We compute
the exact force for a chiral bent-cross pattern, as well as forces for an
idealized "omega"-particle medium in the dilute approximation and identify the
effects of structural inhomogeneity (i.e. proximity forces and anisotropy). We
find that these microstructure effects dominate the force for separations where
chirality was predicted to have a strong influence. To get observations of
chirality free from microstructure effects, one must go to large separations
where the effect of chirality is at most $\sim10^{-4}$ of the total force.
