Performance demands for high and super-high luminosity at the LHC (up to
10^35 cm^(-2) sec^(-1) after the 2017 shutdown) and at future colliders demand
high resolution tracking detectors with very fast time response and excellent
temporal and spatial resolution. We are investigating a new radiation detector
technology based on Plasma Display Panels (PDP), the underlying engine of panel
plasma television displays. The design and production of PDPs is supported by
four decades of industrial development. Emerging from this television
technology is the Plasma Panel Sensor (PPS), a novel variant of the
micropattern radiation detector. The PPS is fundamentally an array of
micro-Geiger plasma discharge cells operating in a non-ageing, hermetically
sealed gas mixture . We report on the PPS development program, including design
of a PPS Test Cell.
