We report on the structural properties of Ge_(1-x)Mn_x layers grown by
molecular beam epitaxy. In these layers, nanocolumns with a high Mn content are
embedded in an almost-pure Ge matrix. We have used grazing-incidence X-ray
scattering, atomic force and transmission electron microscopy to study the
structural properties of the columns. We demonstrate how the elastic
deformation of the matrix (as calculated using atomistic simulations) around
the columns, as well as the average inter-column distance can account for the
shape of the diffusion around Bragg peaks.
