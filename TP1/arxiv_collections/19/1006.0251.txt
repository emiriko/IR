We report the realization of a quantum circuit in which an ensemble of
electronic spins is coupled to a frequency tunable superconducting resonator.
The spins are Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in a diamond crystal. The achievement of
strong coupling is manifested by the appearance of a vacuum Rabi splitting in
the transmission spectrum of the resonator when its frequency is tuned through
the NV center electron spin resonance.
