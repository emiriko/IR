Over the next decade we will witness the development of a new infrastructure
in support of data-intensive scientific research, which includes Astronomy.
This new networked environment will offer both challenges and opportunities to
our community and has the potential to transform the way data are described,
curated and preserved. Based on the lessons learned during the development and
management of the ADS, a case is made for adopting the emerging technologies
and practices of the Semantic Web to support the way Astronomy research will be
conducted. Examples of how small, incremental steps can, in the aggregate, make
a significant difference in the provision and repurposing of astronomical data
are provided.
