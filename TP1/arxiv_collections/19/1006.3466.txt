An analytical perturbation theory of short-pulse, matter-wave superradiant
scatterings is presented. We show that Bragg resonant enhancement is
incapacitated and both positive and negative order scatterings contribute
equally. We further show that propagation gain is small and scattering events
primarily occur at the end of the condensate where the generated field has
maximum strength, thereby explaining the apparent ``asymmetry" in the scattered
components with respect to the condensate center. In addition, the generated
field travels near the speed of light in a vacuum, resulting in significant
spontaneous emission when the one-photon detuning is not sufficiently large.
Finally, we show that when the excitation rate increases, the generated-field
front-edge-steepening and peak forward-shifting effects are due to depletion of
the ground state matter wave.
