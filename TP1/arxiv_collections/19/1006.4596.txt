The Michelson-Morley experiment led Einstein to introduce the concept of
spacetime and to propose that all of the laws of physics are Lorentz invariant.
However, so far only the Lorentz invariance of electromagnetism has been
convincingly confirmed. I would like to propose a new way to explain the
Michelson-Morley experiment that retains the Lorentz invariance of Maxwell's
equations without requiring the other laws of physics to be Lorentz invariant.
In this new theory Lorentz invariance is not fundamental, but instead is simply
a consequence of the fact that Maxwell's equations are incomplete because they
lack a way to define local inertial reference frames. This new theory
explicitly defines 3-dimensional local inertial reference frames in terms of
the gravitational potential $\VG{}$ along with a momentum potential $\VP{}$ and
a force potential $\VF{}$. This new theory decouples space and time, and
explains the Michelson-Morley experiment in ordinary 3-dimensional space.
