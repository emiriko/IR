We give embedding theorems for weighted Bergman-Orlicz spaces on the ball and
then apply our results to the study of composition operators in this context.
As one of the motivations of this work, we show that there exist some weighted
Bergman-Orlicz spaces, different from $H^{\infinity}$, on which every
composition operator is bounded.
