The wavelet regression detrended fluctuations of the reconstructed
temperature for the past three ice ages: approximately 340000 years (Antarctic
ice cores isotopic data), exhibit clear evidences of the galactic turbulence
modulation up to 2500 years time-scales. The observed strictly Kolmogorov
turbulence features indicates the Kolmogorov nature of galactic turbulence, and
provide explanation to random-like fluctuations of the global temperature on
the millennial time scales.
