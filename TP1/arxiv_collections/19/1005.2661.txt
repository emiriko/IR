A competing market model with a polyvariant profit function that assumes
"zeitnot" stock behavior of clients is formulated within the banking portfolio
medium and then analyzed from the perspective of devising optimal strategies.
An associated Markov process method for finding an optimal choice strategy for
monovariant and bivariant profit functions is developed. Under certain
conditions on the bank "promotional" parameter with respect to the "fee" for a
missed share package transaction and at an asymptotically large enough
portfolio volume, universal transcendental equations - determining the optimal
share package choice among competing strategies with monovariant and bivariant
profit functions - are obtained.
