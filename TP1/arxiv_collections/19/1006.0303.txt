LEP experiments indicate that the charge of the electron is distributed over
a small radius $\sim10^{-20} $m. By incorporating this information in spinning
sphere model of electron we arrive at a new interpretation of charge as the
Schwinger corrected or electromagnetic or magnetic self-energy mass. The
charge-energy equivalence is also arrived at in this paper. Further it is
predicted that particles with zero mass will not contain any charge.
