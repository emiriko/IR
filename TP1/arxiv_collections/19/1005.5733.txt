Random Boolean networks (RBNs) are models of genetic regulatory networks. It
is useful to describe RBNs as self-organizing systems to study how changes in
the nodes and connections affect the global network dynamics. This article
reviews eight different methods for guiding the self-organization of RBNs. In
particular, the article is focussed on guiding RBNs towards the critical
dynamical regime, which is near the phase transition between the ordered and
dynamical phases. The properties and advantages of the critical regime for
life, computation, adaptability, evolvability, and robustness are reviewed. The
guidance methods of RBNs can be used for engineering systems with the features
of the critical regime, as well as for studying how natural selection evolved
living systems, which are also critical.
