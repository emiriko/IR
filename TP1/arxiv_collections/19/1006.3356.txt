Let $(\MM ,{\tilde g})$ be an $N$-dimensional smooth compact Riemannian
manifold. We consider the singularly perturbed Allen-Cahn equation $$
\epsilon^2\Delta_{ {\tilde g}} {u}\,+\, (1 - {u}^2)u \,=\,0\quad \mbox{in }
\MM, $$ where $\epsilon$ is a small parameter. Let $\KK\subset \MM$ be an
$(N-1)$-dimensional smooth minimal submanifold that separates $\MM$ into two
disjoint components. Assume that $\KK$ is non-degenerate in the sense that it
does not support non-trivial Jacobi fields, and that
$|A_{\KK}|^2+\mbox{Ric}_{\tilde g}(\nu_{\KK}, \nu_{\KK})$ is positive along
$\KK$. Then for each integer $m\geq 2$, we establish the existence of a
sequence $\epsilon = \epsilon_j\to 0$, and solutions $u_{\epsilon}$ with
$m$-transition layers near $\KK$, with mutual distance $O(\epsilon |\ln
\epsilon|)$.
