Pseudospin symmetry is approximately conserved in nuclei. Normally shell
model interactions are written in terms of spin an orbital angular momentum
operators, not in terms of pseudospin and pseudo-orbital angular momentum
operators. We determine the shell model interactions which conserve pseudospin
symmetry and pseudo-orbital angular momentum symmetry and write them in terms
of spin and orbital angular momentum operators including the tensor
interaction. We show that, although the tensor interaction by itself does not
conserve pseudo-orbital angular momentum, certain combinations of the tensor
interaction with the two body angular momentum squared interaction and the two
body spin orbit interaction do conserve pseudo-orbital angular momentum.
