We present an evaluation of the quark mass renormalization factor for Nf=2+1
QCD. The Schroedinger functional scheme is employed as the intermediate scheme
to carry out non-perturbative running from the low energy region, where
renormalization of bare mass is performed on the lattice, to deep in the high
energy perturbative region, where the conversion to the renormalization group
invariant mass or the MS-bar scheme is safely carried out. For numerical
simulations we adopted the Iwasaki gauge action and non-perturbatively improved
Wilson fermion action with the clover term. Seven renormalization scales are
used to cover from low to high energy regions and three lattice spacings to
take the continuum limit at each scale. The regularization independent step
scaling function of the quark mass for the Nf=2+1 QCD is obtained in the
continuum limit. Renormalization factors for the pseudo scalar density and the
axial vector current are also evaluated for the same action and the bare
couplings as two recent large scale Nf=2+1 simulations; previous work of the
CP-PACS/JLQCD collaboration, which covered the up-down quark mass range heavier
than $m_\pi\sim 500$ MeV and that of PACS-CS collaboration for much lighter
quark masses down to $m_\pi=155$ MeV. The quark mass renormalization factor is
used to renormalize bare PCAC masses in these simulations.
