We present a model for plasma heating produced by time-dependent, spatially
localized reconnection within a flare current sheet separating skewed magnetic
fields. The reconnection creates flux tubes of new connectivity which
subsequently retract at Alfv\'enic speeds from the reconnection site. Heating
occurs in gas-dynamic shocks which develop inside these tubes. Here we present
generalized thin flux tube equations for the dynamics of reconnected flux
tubes, including pressure-driven parallel dynamics as well as temperature
dependent, anisotropic viscosity and thermal conductivity. The evolution of
tubes embedded in a uniform, skewed magnetic field, following reconnection in a
patch, is studied through numerical solutions of these equations, for solar
coronal conditions. Even though viscosity and thermal conductivity are
negligible in the quiet solar corona, the strong gas-dynamic shocks generated
by compressing plasma inside reconnected flux tubes generate large velocity and
temperature gradients along the tube, rendering the diffusive processes
dominant. They determine the thickness of the shock that evolves up to a
steady-state value, although this condition may not be reached in the short
times involved in a flare. For realistic solar coronal parameters, this
steady-state shock thickness might be as long as the entire flux tube. For
strong shocks at low Prandtl numbers, typical of the solar corona, the
gas-dynamic shock consists of an isothermal sub-shock where all the compression
and cooling occur, preceded by a thermal front where the temperature increases
and most of the heating occurs. We estimate the length of each of these
sub-regions and the speed of their propagation.
