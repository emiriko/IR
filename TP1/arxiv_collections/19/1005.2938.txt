We investigate few-boson systems in finite one-dimensional multi-well traps
covering the full interaction crossover from uncorrelated to fermionized
particles. Our treatment of the ground state properties is based on the
numerically exact Multi-Configurational Time-Dependent Hartree method. For
commensurate filling we trace the fingerprints of localisation, as the
interaction strength increases, in several observables like reduced density
matrices, fluctuations and momentum distribution. For filling factor larger
than one we observe on-site repulsion effects in the densities and
fragmentation of particles beyond the validity of the Bose-Hubbard model upon
approaching the Tonks-Girardeau limit. The presence of an incommensurate
fraction of particles induces incomplete localisation and spatial modulations
of the density profiles, taking into account the finite size of the system.
