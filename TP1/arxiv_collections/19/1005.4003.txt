We study in details the space-time dependence of the production of muonic,
pionic, and other exotic atoms by the coherent photon exchange between nuclei
at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. We show that a multipole expansion of the
electromagnetic interaction yields an useful insight of the bound-free
production mechanism which has not been explored in the literature. Predictions
for the spatial, temporal, and angular distribution, as well as the total cross
sections, for the production of exotic atoms are also included.
