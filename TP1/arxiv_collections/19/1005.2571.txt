Quantum dot arrays are a promising media for transferring quantum information
between two distant points without resorting to mobile qubits. Here we study
two most common disorders namely, hyperfine interaction and exchange coupling
fluctuations, in quantum dot arrays and their effects on quantum communication
through these chains. Our results show that the hyperfine interaction is more
destructive than the exchange coupling fluctuations. The average optimal time
for communication is not affected by any disorder in the system and our
simulations show that anti-ferromagnetic chains are much more resistive than
the ferromagnetic ones against both kind of disorders. Even when time
modulation of a coupling and optimal control is employed to improve the
transmission, the anti-ferromagnetic chain performs much better. We have
assumed the quasi-static approximation for hyperfine interaction and time
dependent fluctuations in the exchange couplings. Particularly, for studying
exchange coupling fluctuations we have considered the static disorder, white
noise and $1/f$ noise.
