It is common practice in scattering theory to correlate between the position
of a resonance peak in the cross section and the real part of a complex energy
of a pole of the scattering amplitude. In this work we show that the resonance
peak position appears at the absolute value of the pole's complex energy rather
than its real part. We further demonstrate that a local theory of resonances
can still be used even in cases previously thought impossible.
