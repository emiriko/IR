Sky coverage is one of the most important pieces of information about
astronomical observations. We discuss possible representations, and present
algorithms to create and manipulate shapes consisting of generalized spherical
polygons with arbitrary complexity and size on the celestial sphere. This shape
specification integrates well with our Hierarchical Triangular Mesh indexing
toolbox, whose performance and capabilities are enhanced by the advanced
features presented here. Our portable implementation of the relevant spherical
geometry routines comes with wrapper functions for database queries, which are
currently being used within several scientific catalog archives including the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Galaxy Evolution Explorer and the Hubble Legacy
Archive projects as well as the Footprint Service of the Virtual Observatory.
