We present five band imaging of the Vega debris disc obtained using the
Herschel Space Observatory. These data span a wavelength range of 70-500 um
with full-width half-maximum angular resolutions of 5.6-36.9". The disc is well
resolved in all bands, with the ring structure visible at 70 and 160 um. Radial
profiles of the disc surface brightness are produced, and a disc radius of 11"
(~ 85 AU) is determined. The disc is seen to have a smooth structure thoughout
the entire wavelength range, suggesting that the disc is in a steady state,
rather than being an ephemeral structure caused by the recent collision of two
large planetesimals.
