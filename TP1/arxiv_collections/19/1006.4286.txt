We use a simple iterative perturbation theory to study the singlet-triplet
(ST) transition in lateral and vertical quantum dots, modeled by the
non-equilibrium two-level Anderson model. To a great surprise, the region of
stable perturbation theory extends to relatively strong interactions, and this
simple approach is able to reproduce all experimentally-observed features of
the ST transition, including the formation of a dip in the differential
conductance of a lateral dot indicative of the two-stage Kondo effect, or the
maximum in the linear conductance around the transition point. Choosing the
right starting point to the perturbation theory is, however, crucial to obtain
reliable and meaningful results.
