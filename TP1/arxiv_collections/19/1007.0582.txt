We consider a heat conduction model introduced in \cite{Collet-Eckmann 2009}.
This is an open system in which particles exchange momentum with a row of
(fixed) scatterers. We assume simplified bath conditions throughout, and give a
qualitative description of the dynamics extrapolating from the case of a single
particle for which we have a fairly clear understanding. The main phenomenon
discussed is {\it freezing}, or the slowing down of particles with time. As
particle number is conserved, this means fewer collisions per unit time, and
less contact with the baths; in other words, the conductor becomes less
effective. Careful numerical documentation of freezing is provided, and a
theoretical explanation is proposed. Freezing being an extremely slow process,
however, the system behaves as though it is in a steady state for long
durations. Quantities such as energy and fluxes are studied, and are found to
have curious relationships with particle density.
