Observations of the spatial distribution and kinematics of young stars in the
Galactic centre can be interpreted as showing that the stars occupy one, or
possibly two, discs of radii ~0.05-0.5 pc. The most prominent (`clockwise')
disc exhibits a strong warp: the normals to the mean orbital planes in the
inner and outer third of the disc differ by ~60 deg. Using an analytical model
based on Laplace-Lagrange theory, we show that such warps arise naturally and
inevitably through vector resonant relaxation between the disc and the
surrounding old stellar cluster.
