We study the electronic states and the superconductivity in the
two-dimensional 16-band d-p model coupled with A1g, B1g and Eg local phonons
and obtain the rich phase diagram including the magnetic, charge and orbital
ordered phases on the parameter plane of the Coulomb and electron-phonon
interactions. When the electron-phonon interaction is dominant, the charge
fluctuations induce the s++ wave superconductivity, while when the Coulomb
interaction is dominant, the magnetic fluctuations induce the s+- wave
superconductivity. Remarkably, the orbital fluctuations are enhanced due to the
cooperative effects of the Coulomb and electron-phonon interactions and induce
the s++ wave and the nodal s+- wave superconductivities.
