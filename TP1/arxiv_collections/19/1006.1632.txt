A primary goal of numerical relativity is to provide estimates of the wave
strain, $h$, from strong gravitational wave sources, to be used in detector
templates. The simulations, however, typically measure waves in terms of the
Weyl curvature component, $\psi_4$. Assuming Bondi gauge, transforming to the
strain $h$ reduces to integration of $\psi_4$ twice in time. Integrations
performed in either the time or frequency domain, however, lead to secular
non-linear drifts in the resulting strain $h$. These non-linear drifts are not
explained by the two unknown integration constants which can at most result in
linear drifts. We identify a number of fundamental difficulties which can arise
from integrating finite length, discretely sampled and noisy data streams.
These issues are an artifact of post-processing data. They are independent of
the characteristics of the original simulation, such as gauge or numerical
method used. We suggest, however, a simple procedure for integrating numerical
waveforms in the frequency domain, which is effective at strongly reducing
spurious secular non-linear drifts in the resulting strain.
