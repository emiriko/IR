We present the results of a combined metadynamics--umbrella sampling
investigation of the puckered conformers of pyranoses described using the
gromos 45a4 force field. The free energy landscape of Cremer--Pople puckering
coordinates has been calculated for the whole series of alpha and beta
aldohexoses, showing that the current force field parameters fail in
reproducing proper puckering free energy differences between chair conformers.
We suggest a modification to the gromos 45a4 parameter set which improves
considerably the agreement of simulation results with theoretical and
experimental estimates of puckering free energies. We also report on the
experimental measurement of altrose conformers populations by means of NMR
spectroscopy, which show good agreement with the predictions of current
theoretical models.
