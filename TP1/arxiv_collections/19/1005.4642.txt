We discuss gravitational magnetic bags, i.e. clusters of large number of
monopoles in presence of gravitational effects. Physics depends on the
dimensionless ratio between the vev of the Higgs field at infinity and the
Planck mass. We solve the equations for the gravitational bags, and study the
transition from monopole to black hole. The critical coupling for this
transition is $v_{cr} = \sqrt{\pi}/(4 \sqrt{G})$, and it is larger than that of
a single 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole. We investigate in detail the black-hole
limit.
