We study the flavor structure in the three site Higgsless model. In this
model, the gauge bosons and fermions have heavy partners, coming from the
Kaluza-Klein excitation in the dimensional deconstruction picture. The yukawa
couplings are introduced in a way to minimize the flavor chaning neutral
current in the light sector at the tree level. Due to the flavor mixing between
the light and the heavy partner fields, new effects on FCNC's appear at
one-loop level. As an example of such FCNC processes, we calculate the
contribution to the b -> s gamma amplitude in the three site Higgsless model.
Interestingly, heavy particles which exist in the three site Higgsless model do
not completely decouple in the heavy-mass limit. One-loop level b -> s gamma
amplitude is calculated by considering all possible combinations of particles
in the loop, then it is compared to the experiment. The result shows that the
central value of the B -> X_s gamma branching ratio in the three site Higgsless
model takes closer value to its experimental central value as one takes the
larger value of a free parameter, \varepsilon_{tR}, within a range allowed by
the precision electroweak measurement.
