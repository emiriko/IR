Hadronic emission from parsec size radio lobes in active galactic nuclei
(AGN) is discussed. The lobes are composed of shocked jet plasmaand expected to
be filled with high energy particles. By using the Monte Carlo simulation, we
calculate the photon spectra from the lobes including photo-meson interaction
processes. When the synchrotron emission from primary electrons is bright,
synchrotron-self-Compton component is dominant in gamma-ray bands. The hadronic
emission from the lobes can be dominated in gamma-ray bands when the primary
emission is not very bright. Proton synchrotron component arises at sub MeV
band. The synchrotron emission radiated from secondary electron/positron pairs
produced via photo-meson cascade emerges in GeV-TeV energy ranges. These high
energy emission signatures provide a test for proton accelerations in young AGN
jets.
