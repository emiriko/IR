We study the short-time dynamics of a mean-field model with non-conserved
order parameter (Curie-Weiss with Glauber dynamics) by solving the associated
Fokker-Planck equation. We obtain closed-form expressions for the first moments
of the order parameter, near to both the critical and spinodal points, starting
from different initial conditions. This allows us to confirm the validity of
the short-time dynamical scaling hypothesis in both cases. Although the
procedure is illustrated for a particular mean-field model, our results can be
straightforwardly extended to generic models with a single order parameter.
