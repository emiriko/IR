We observe the two- and three-pulse photon echo emission from a scattering
powder, obtained by grinding a Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ rare earth doped single
crystal. We show that the collective emission is coherently constructed over
several grains. A well defined atomic coherence can therefore be created
between randomly placed particles. Observation of photon echo on powders as
opposed to bulk materials opens the way to faster material development. More
generally, time-domain resonant four-wave mixing offers an attractive approach
to investigate coherent propagation in scattering media.
