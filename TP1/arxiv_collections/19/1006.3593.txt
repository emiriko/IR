Using Yunnan evolutionary population synthesis (EPS) models, we present
integrated colours, integrated spectral energy distributions (ISEDs) and
absorption-line indices defined by the Lick Observatory image dissector scanner
(Lick/IDS) system, for an extensive set of instantaneous-burst binary stellar
populations (BSPs) with interactions. By comparing the results for populations
with and without interactions we show that the inclusion of binary interactions
makes the appearance of the population substantially bluer. This effect raises
the derived age and metallicity of the population.
  To be used in the studies of modern spectroscopic galaxy surveys at
intermediate/high spectral resolution, we also present intermediate- (3A) and
high-resolution (~0.3A) ISEDs and Lick/IDS absorption-line indices for BSPs. To
directly compare with observations the Lick/IDS absorption indices are also
presented by measuring them directly from the ISEDs.
