Thin-shell wormholes in Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton (EYMD) gravity are
considered. We show that a non-asymptotically flat (NAF) black hole solution of
the d-dimensional EYMD theory provides stable thin-shell wormholes which are
supported entirely by exotic matter. The presence of dilaton makes the
spacetime naturally NAF, and with our conclusion it remains still open to
construct wormholes supported by normal matter between two such spacetimes.
