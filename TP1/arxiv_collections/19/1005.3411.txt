We consider the bremsstrahlung of electrons of fully ionized plasma. Electron
energy range extends from a few hundred electron volts before the extreme
relativistic energies of several MeV. The results of calculations of effective
slow-down rate of a single electron and the power emission from a volume of the
plasma with Maxwellian electrons. At relativistic energies, the Born
approximation yields highly accurate results. Correction to the Born
approximation are considered for low-energy regimes. In the high-energy regimes
numerical results are close to extreme relativistic analytic results. The
formulas are suggested that approximate the results of numerical calculations.
