A damped detuned structure for the main X-band linacs of CLIC is being
investigated as an alternative design to the present baseline heavily damped
structure. In our earlier designs we studied detuned structures, operating at
11.994 GHz, with a range of dipole bandwidths in order to ensure the structure
satisfies beam dynamics and rf breakdown constraints. Here we report on the
development of a damped and detuned structure which satisfies both constraints.
Preparations for high power testing of the structure are also discussed
