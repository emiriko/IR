We theoretically investigate the confinement-induced resonance for
quasi-one-dimensional quan- tum systems under transversely anisotropic
confinement, using a two-body s-wave scattering model in the zero-energy
collision limit. We predict a single resonance for any transverse anisotropy,
whose position shows a slight downshift with increasing anisotropy. We compare
our prediction with the recent experimental result by Haller et al. [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 104, 153203 (2010)], in which two resonances are observed in the presence
of transverse anisotropy. The discrepancy between theory and experiment remains
to be resolved.
