In accelerating dark energy models, the estimates of H0 from
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) and X-ray surface brightness of galaxy clusters
may depend on the matter content (Omega_M), the curvature (Omega_K) and the
equation of state parameter (w). In this article, by using a sample of 25
angular diameter distances from galaxy clusters obtained through SZE/X-ray
technique, we constrain H_0 in the framework of a general LCDM models (free
curvature) and a flat XCDM model with equation of state parameter, w=p_x/\rho_x
(w=constant). In order to broke the degeneracy on the cosmological parameters,
we apply a joint analysis involving the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and
the CMB Shift Parameter signature. By neglecting systematic uncertainties, for
nonflat LCDM cosmologies we obtain $H_0=73.2^{+4.3}_{-3.7}$ km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$ (1sigma) whereas for a flat universe with constant equation of state
parameter we find $H_0=71.4^{+4.4}_{-3.4}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (1$\sigma$).
Such results are also in good agreement with independent studies from the
Hubble Space Telescope key project and recent estimates based on Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe, thereby suggesting that the combination of these
three independent phenomena provides an interesting method to constrain the
Hubble constant. In particular, comparing these results with a recent
determination for a flat LCDM model using only the SZE technique and BAO [Cunha
et al. MNRAS 379, L1 2007], we see that the geometry has a very weak influence
on H0 estimates for this combination of data.
