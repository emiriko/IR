The quantum state of a $d$-dimensional system can be represented by the $d^2$
probabilities corresponding to a SIC-POVM, and then this distribution of
probability can be represented by a vector of $\R^{d^2-1}$ in a simplex, we
will call this set of vectors $\mathcal{Q}$. Other way of represent a
$d$-dimensional system is by the corresponding Bloch vector also in
$\R^{d^2-1}$, we will call this set of vectors $\mathcal{B}$. In this paper it
is proved that with the adequate scaling $\mathcal{B}=\mathcal{Q}$. Also we
indicate some features of the shape of $\mathcal{Q}$.
