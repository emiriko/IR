We present a simple model of protein folding dynamics that captures key
qualitative elements recently seen in all-atom simulations. The goals of this
theory are to serve as a simple formalism for gaining deeper insight into the
physical properties seen in detailed simulations as well as to serve as a model
to easily compare why these simulations suggest a different kinetic mechanism
than previous simple models. Specifically, we find that non-native contacts
play a key role in determining the mechanism, which can shift dramatically as
the energetic strength of non-native interactions is changed. For protein-like
non-native interactions, our model finds that the native state is a kinetic
hub, connecting the strength of relevant interactions directly to the nature of
folding kinetics.
