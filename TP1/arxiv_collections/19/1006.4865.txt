In their Comment, Greer et al (i) put us in charge of a pretended wrong
claim, which we never made in Phys.~Rev.~B {\bf 78}, 115315 (2008), where we
criticized a method (DG)proposed by two of them, (ii) incorrectly claim that
the DG method can reproduce the conductance quantum $g_0$, but (iii) to deduce
$g_0$ for a toy model, they carry out calculations within the standard Landauer
method, which has nothing to do with the DG's. We present results for their
model obtained within the DG method, which demonstrate that the DG method fails
as lamentably as in the examples we presented in our earlier work. We also
analyze the physical reasons why the DG method fails.
