The results of time-resolved observations of SU UMa and U Gem obtained over
two-years are presented. Both stars are prototypes of different classes of
dwarf novae. We studied brightness variations on different time scales:
orbital, QPO and flickering. The multicolor BVRI photometry allows to
distinguisch the geometrical and physical sources of these variations.
