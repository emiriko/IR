The Gould Belt Legacy Survey (GBS) on the JCMT has observed a region of 260
square arcminutes in 12CO J=3--2 emission, and a 190 square arcminute subset of
this in 13CO and C18O towards the Serpens molecular cloud. We examine the
global velocity structure of the non-outflowing gas, and calculate excitation
temperatures and opacities. The large scale mass and energetics of the region
are evaluated, with special consideration for high velocity gas. We find the
cloud to have a mass of 203 solar masses, and to be gravitationally bound, and
that the kinetic energy of the outflowing gas is approximately seventy percent
of the turbulent kinetic energy of the cloud. We identify compact outflows
towards some of the submillimetre Class 0/I sources in the region
