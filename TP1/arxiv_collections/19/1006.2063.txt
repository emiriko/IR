We study the computation of Nash equilibria in a two-player normal form game
from the perspective of parameterized complexity. Recent results proved
hardness for a number of variants, when parameterized by the support size. We
complement those results, by identifying three cases in which the problem
becomes fixed-parameter tractable. These cases occur in the previously studied
settings of sparse games and unbalanced games as well as in the newly
considered case of locally bounded treewidth games that generalizes both these
two cases.
