The current-phase relation (CPR) of a Josephson junction reveals valuable
information about the microscopic processes and symmetries that influence the
supercurrent. In this Letter, we present direct measurements of the CPR for
Josephson junctions with a graphene barrier, obtained by a phase-sensitive
SQUID interferometry technique. We find that the CPR is skewed with respect to
the commonly observed sinusoidal behavior. The amount of skewness varies
linearly with critical current (Ic) regardless of whether Ic is tuned by the
carrier density or temperature.
