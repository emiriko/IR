Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars like IGR J00291+5934 are important
because it is possible to test theories of pulsar formation and evolution. They
give also the possibility to constrain gravitational wave emission theories and
the equation of state of ultra dense matter. Particularly crucial to our
understanding is the measurement of the long term spin evolution of the
accreting neutron star. An open question is whether these accreting pulsars are
spinning up during an outburst and spinning down in quiescence as predicted by
the recycling scenario. Until now it has been very difficult to measure
torques, due to the presence of fluctuations in the pulse phases that
compromise their measurements with standard coherent timing techniques. By
applying a new method, I am now able to measure a spin up during an outburst
and a spin down during quiescence. I ascribe the spin up
(Fdot=5.1(3)x10^{-13}\Hz/s) to accretion torques and the spin down
(Fdot=-3.0(8)x10^{-15} Hz/s) to magneto dipole torques, as those observed in
radio pulsars. Both values nicely fit in the recycling scenario and I infer the
existence of a magnetic field for the pulsar of B~2x10^{8} G. No evidence for
an enhanced spin down due to gravitational wave emission is found. The
accretion torques are smaller than previously reported and there is strong
evidence for an ordered process that is present in all outbursts that might be
connected with a motion of the hot spot on the neutron star surface.
