We use convex relaxation techniques to produce lower bounds on the optimal
value of subset selection problems and generate good approximate solutions. We
then explicitly bound the quality of these relaxations by studying the
approximation ratio of sparse eigenvalue relaxations. Our results are used to
improve the performance of branch-and-bound algorithms to produce exact
solutions to subset selection problems.
