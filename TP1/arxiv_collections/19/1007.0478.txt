The current status of the Adler function and two closely related Deep
Inelastic Scattering (DIS) sum rules, namely, the Bjorken sum rule for
polarized DIS and the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule are briefly reviewed. A
new result is presented: an analytical calculation of the coefficient function
of the latter sum rule in a generic gauge theory in order O(alpha_s^4). It is
demonstrated that the corresponding Crewther relation allows to fix two of
three colour structures in the O(alpha_s^4) contribution to the singlet part of
the Adler function.
