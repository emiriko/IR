We investigate the magnetic field effect on the spin gap state in CeRu2Al10
by measuring the magnetization and electrical resistivity. We found that the
magnetization curve for the magnetic field H//c shows a metamagnetic-like
anomaly at H*~4 T below T_0=27 K, but no anomaly for H//a and H//b. A shoulder
of the electrical resistivity at Ts~5 K for I//c is suppressed by applying a
longitudinal magnetic field above 5 T. Many anomalies are also found in the
magnetoresistance for Hkc below ~5 K. The obtained magnetic phase diagram
consists of at least two or three phases below T_0. These results strongly
indicate the existence of a fine structure at a low energy side in a spin gap
state with the excitation energy of 8 meV recently observed in the inelastic
neutron scattering experiments.
