A phenomenology for the deep spatial geometry of loop quantum gravity is
introduced. In the context of a simple model, an atom of space, it is shown how
purely combinatorial structures can affect observations. The angle operator is
used to develop a model of angular corrections to local, continuum flat-space
3-geometries. The physical effects involve neither breaking of local Lorentz
invariance nor Planck scale suppression, but rather reply on only the
combinatorics of SU(2) recoupling. Bhabha scattering is discussed as an example
of how the effects might be observationally accessible.
