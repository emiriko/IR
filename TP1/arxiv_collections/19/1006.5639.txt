We report the spectroscopic confirmation of SPT-CL J0546-5345 at <z> = 1.067.
To date this is the most distant cluster to be spectroscopically confirmed from
the 2008 South Pole Telescope (SPT) catalog, and indeed the first z > 1 cluster
discovered by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE). We identify 21 secure
spectroscopic members within 0.9 Mpc of the SPT cluster position, 18 of which
are quiescent, early-type galaxies. From these quiescent galaxies we obtain a
velocity dispersion of 1179^{+232}_{-167} km/s, ranking SPT-CL J0546-5345 as
the most dynamically massive cluster yet discovered at z > 1. Assuming that
SPT-CL J0546-5345 is virialized, this implies a dynamical mass of M_200 =
1.0^{+0.6}_{-0.4} x 10^{15} Msun, in agreement with the X-ray and SZE mass
measurements. Combining masses from several independent measures leads to a
best-estimate mass of M_200 = (7.95 +/- 0.92) x 10^{14} Msun. The spectroscopic
confirmation of SPT-CL J0546-5345, discovered in the wide-angle, mass-selected
SPT cluster survey, marks the onset of the high redshift SZE-selected galaxy
cluster era.
