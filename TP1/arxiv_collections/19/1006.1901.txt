We study M-theory solutions involving compact hyperbolic spaces. The
combination of a gap `a la Randall-Sundrum and the topology of an internal
Riemann surface allows a geometrical solution to the hierarchy problem that
does not require light Kaluza--Klein modes. We comment on the consequences of
such a compactification for LHC physics.
