A method is presented to obtain local unitary invariants for multipartite
quantum systems consisting of fermions or distinguishable particles. The
invariants are organized into infinite families, in particular, the
generalization to higher dimensional single particle Hilbert spaces is
straightforward. Many well-known invariants and their generalizations are also
included.
