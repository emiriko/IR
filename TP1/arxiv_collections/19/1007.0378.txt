It has been recently shown that the phase space trajectories for the
anomalous dynamics of a tagged monomer of a polymer --- for single polymeric
systems such as phantom Rouse, self-avoiding Rouse, Zimm, reptation, and
translocation through a narrow pore in a membrane; as well as for
many-polymeric system such as polymer melts in the entangled regime --- is
robustly described by the Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE). Here I show that
the probability distribution of phase space trajectories for all these
classical anomalous dynamics for single polymers is that of a fractional
Brownian motion (fBm), while the dynamics for polymer melts between the
entangled regime and the eventual diffusive regime exhibits small, but
systematic deviations from that of a fBm.
