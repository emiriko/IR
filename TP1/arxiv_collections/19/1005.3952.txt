Completing earlier work on three dimensional (3D) N=1 supergravity with
curvature-squared terms, we construct the general supergravity extension of
cosmological massive gravity theories. We expand about supersymmetric anti-de
Sitter vacua, finding the conditions for bulk unitarity and the critical points
in parameter space at which the spectrum changes. We discuss implications for
the dual conformal field theory.
