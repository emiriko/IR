The exceptional mechanical properties of graphene have made it attractive for
nano-mechanical devices and functional composite materials. Two key aspects of
graphene's mechanical behavior are its elastic and adhesive properties. These
are generally determined in separate experiments, and it is moreover typically
difficult to extract parameters for adhesion. In addition, the mechanical
interplay between graphene and other elastic materials has not been well
studied. Here, we demonstrate a technique for studying both the elastic and
adhesive properties of few-layer graphene (FLG) by placing it on deformable,
micro-corrugated substrates. By measuring deformations of the composite
graphene-substrate structures, and developing a related linear elasticity
theory, we are able to extract information about graphene's bending rigidity,
adhesion, critical stress for interlayer sliding, and sample-dependent tension.
The results are relevant to graphene-based mechanical and electronic devices,
and to the use of graphene in composite, flexible, and strain-engineered
materials.
