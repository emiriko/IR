Measurements of the double-differential proton production cross-section in
the range of momentum 0.5 GeV/c < p < 8.0 GeV/c and angle 0.05 rad < \theta <
0.25 rad in collisions of charged pions and protons on beryllium, carbon,
aluminium, copper, tin, tantalum and lead are presented. The data were taken
with the large acceptance HARP detector in the T9 beam line of the CERN Proton
Synchrotron. Incident particles were identified by an elaborate system of beam
detectors and impinged on a target of 5 % of a nuclear interaction length. The
tracking and identification of the produced particles was performed using the
forward spectrometer of the HARP experiment. Results are obtained for the
double-differential cross-sections mainly at four incident beam momenta (3
GeV/c, 5 GeV/c, 8 GeV/c and 12 GeV/c). Measurements are compared with
predictions of the GEANT4 and MARS Monte Carlo generators.
