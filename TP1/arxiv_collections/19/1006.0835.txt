A scanning tunneling microscope (STM) has been equipped with a nanoscale
force sensor and signal transducer composed of a single D2 molecule that is
confined in the STM junction. The uncalibrated sensor is used to obtain
ultra-high geometric image resolution of a complex organic molecule adsorbed on
a noble metal surface. By means of conductance-distance spectroscopy and
corresponding density functional calculations the mechanism of the
sensor/transducer is identified. It probes the short-range Pauli repulsion and
converts this signal into variations of the junction conductance.
