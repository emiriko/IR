In this paper we characterize and construct novel oversampled filter banks
implementing fusion frames. A fusion frame is a sequence of orthogonal
projection operators whose sum can be inverted in a numerically stable way.
When properly designed, fusion frames can provide redundant encodings of
signals which are optimally robust against certain types of noise and erasures.
However, up to this point, few implementable constructions of such frames were
known; we show how to construct them using oversampled filter banks. In this
work, we first provide polyphase domain characterizations of filter bank fusion
frames. We then use these characterizations to construct filter bank fusion
frame versions of discrete wavelet and Gabor transforms, emphasizing those
specific finite impulse response filters whose frequency responses are
well-behaved.
