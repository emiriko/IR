We study the S>1 nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model with a ferromagnetic
interaction J and a large non-collinear <111> easy-axis anisotropy D on a
pyrochlore lattice. For a finite D>>|J|, the low-energy physics is described by
a < 111 > Ising model with second- and third-neighbor exchange interactions.
The extensive degeneracy of the ground state manifold in the infinite
anisotropic limit is lifted by the transverse quantum fluctuations, and a q=0
ordered state is selected via the quantum order by disorder machanism, through
a first-order phase transition at low temperature.
