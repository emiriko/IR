During the past few years, advances in mobile communication theory have
enabled the development and deployment of different wireless technologies,
complementary to each other. Hence, their integration can realize a unified
wireless system that has the best features of the individual networks.
Next-Generation Wireless Systems (NGWS) integrate different wireless systems,
each of which is optimized for some specific services and coverage area to
provide ubiquitous communications to the mobile users. In this paper, we
propose to enhance the handoff performance of mobile IP in wireless IP networks
by reducing the false handoff probability in the NGWS handoff management
protocol. Based on the information of false handoff probability, we analyze its
effect on mobile speed and handoff signaling delay.
