In this paper we compare the prediction for deep inelastic scattering from
N=4 SYM with the HERA experimental data. The paper conveys two results. The
first is the message that N=4 SYM is able to describe the DIS data with very
good accuracy ($\chi^2/d.o.f. \,\leq\,1.5$) in the region of $Q^2 = 0.85 \div
60\,GeV^2$ with $2/\sqrt{\lambda} = 0.7 \div 0.8 $ . The second is that the
value of string coupling constant $g_s$ turns out to be so small that none of
saturation effects will be visible in the region of accessible energies,
including the maximal energy of the LHC (W = 14 \,\,TeV).
