The underlying dynamics (\partialt{\psi}=iH{\psi}) of quantum electrodynamics
are symmetric with respect to time (T and CPT), but traditional calculations
and designs in electronics and electromagnetics impose an observer formalism or
causality constraints which assume a gross asymmetry between forwards time and
backwards time. In 2008, I published a paper in the International Journal of
Theoretical Physics (see arXiv:0801.1234) which describes how to construct
physics based on the dynamics alone, without these extraneous assumptions. It
pointed out that this changes certain predictions of physics in a testable way,
and that evidence from experiment favors the new and simpler versions of
quantum theory. This disclosure follows up on that paper, by describing methods
for circuit design based on the new physics. It provides a striking example -
how to design a quantum separator (QS), which separates out the eigenfunctions
which supply ordinary time-forwards free energy from the time-inverted
eigenfunctions, when the QS is connected to bidirectional power supplies now
under development in several places.
