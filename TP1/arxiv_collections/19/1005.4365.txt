We report on exact diagonalization studies for fully spin polarized 5/2
fractional quantum Hall effect, incorporating Landau level mixing through the
Bishara-Nayak effective interaction. We find that there is an experimentally
accessible region in the phase diagram where the Pfaffian model accurately
describes not only the ground state but also the neutral and charged
excitations. These results are consistent with the observed persistence of the
5/2 Hall effect down to very low magnetic fields; they are also relevant to the
experimental attempts to detect nonabelian braid statistics.
