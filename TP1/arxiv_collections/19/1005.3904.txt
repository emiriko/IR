Using first-principles density functional theory method, we have investigated
the distribution and magnetism of doped Mn atoms in the vicinity of the 3 (112)
grain boundary in Ge. We find that at low concentration, the substitutional
sites are energetically favorable over the interstitial ones for Mn. The
binding energy of Mn varies with lattice sites in the boundary region, and
hence a non-uniform distribution of Mn nears the boundary. However, the average
of their segregation energy is quite small, thus no remarkable grain boundary
segregation of Mn is predicted. Due to volume expansion at the grain boundary,
the spin polarization of Mn is slightly enhanced. Overall, we find that the
magnetism of Mn-doped Ge is not sensitively dependent on the grain structure.
