The latest results on jet cross sections in neutral current deep inelastic
$ep$ scattering from the ZEUS Collaboration are presented. The new results were
used to perform stringent tests of perturbative QCD and extract precise values
of the strong coupling. Also, the measurements have the potential to constrain
further the parton distribution functions in the proton if included in QCD
fits.
