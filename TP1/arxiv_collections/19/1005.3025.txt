The well know radiogalaxy Cen A has been recently detected as a source of
very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays by the HESS experiment just before Fermi/LAT
detected it at high energies (HE). The detection, together with that of M87,
establishes radiogalaxies as VHE gamma-ray emitters. The aim of this work is to
present a lepto-hadronic model for the VHE emission from the relativistic jets
in FR I radiogalaxies. We consider that protons and electrons are accelerated
in a compact region near the base of the jet, and they cool emitting multi
wavelength radiation as they propagate along the jet. The proton and electron
distributions are obtained through an inhomogeneous steady-state transport
equation taking into account acceleration, radiative and non-radiative cooling
processes, as well as particle transport by convection. Considering the effects
of photon absorption at different wavelengths, we calculate the radiation
emitted by the primary protons and electrons, as well as the contribution of
secondaries particles (e+/-, pions and muons). The expected high-energy
neutrino signal is also obtained and the possibility of detections with KM3Net
and IceCube is discussed. The spectral energy distribution obtained in our
model with an appropriate set of parameters for an extended emission zone can
account for much of the observed spectrum for both AGNs.
