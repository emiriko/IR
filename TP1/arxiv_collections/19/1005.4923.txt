A short survey is presented on spin--glass--like states characteristics in
complex nonmagnetic systems. We discuss the interplay of the interaction
structure and symmetry with the classification scenarios of the replica
symmetry breaking. It is shown that the kind of the transition to the
nonergodic state depends not only on the presence or absence of the reflection
symmetry but on the number of interacting operators and their individual
characteristics.
