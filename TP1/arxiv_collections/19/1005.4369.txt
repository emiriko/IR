We demonstrate the realization of nearly massless electrons in the most
widely used device material, silicon, at the interface with a metal film. Using
angle-resolved photoemission, we found that the surface band of a monolayer
lead film drives a hole band of the Si inversion layer formed at the interface
with the film to have nearly linear dispersion with an effective mass about 20
times lighter than bulk Si and comparable to graphene. The reduction of mass
can be accounted for by repulsive interaction between neighboring bands of the
metal film and Si substrate. Our result suggests a promising way to take
advantage of massless carriers in silicon-based thin-film devices, which can
also be applied for various other semiconductor devices.
