We report transport measurements using pulsed magnetic fields to suppress the
superconducting fluctuations (SCF) conductivity in a series of YBa_2Cu_3O_(6+x)
samples. These experiments allow us altogether to measure the temperature T'c
at which SCF disappear, and the pseudogap temperature T*. While the latter are
consistent with previous determinations of T*, we find that T'c is slightly
larger than similar data taken by Nernst measurements. A careful investigation
near optimal doping shows that T* becomes smaller than T'c, which is an
unambiguous evidence that the pseudogap cannot be assigned to preformed pairs.
Studies of the incidence of disorder on both T'c and T* allow us to propose a
phase diagram including disorder which explains most observations done in other
cuprate families, and to discuss the available knowledge on the pseudogap line
in the phase diagram.
