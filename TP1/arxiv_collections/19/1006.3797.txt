Variation in high energy cosmic rays (HECRs) has been proposed to explain a
62 My periodicity in terrestrial fossil biodiversity. It has been suggested
that the infall of our galaxy toward the Virgo cluster could generate an
extragalactic shock, accelerating charged particles and exposing the earth to a
flux of high energy cosmic rays (HECRs). The oscillation of the Sun
perpendicular to the galactic plane could induce 62 My periodicity in the HECR
flux on the Earth, with a magnitude much higher than the Galactic cosmic ray
change we see in a solar cycle. This mechanism could potentially explain the
observed 62 My periodicity in terrestrial biodiversity over the past 500 My. In
addition to direct effects on life from secondaries, HECRs induced air showers
ionize the atmosphere leading to changes in atmospheric chemistry and
microphysical processes that can lead to cloud formation including low altitude
cloud cover. An increase in ionization changes the global electric circuit
which could enhance the formation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) through
microphysical processes such as electroscavenging and ion mediated nucleation,
leading to an increase in the cloud cover. This could increase the albedo and
reduce the solar flux reaching the ground, reducing the global temperature.
Using an existing model, we have calculated the enhancement in atmospheric
ionization at low altitudes resulting from exposure to HECRs. We use a
conservative model to estimate the change in low altitude cloud cover from this
increased ionization.
