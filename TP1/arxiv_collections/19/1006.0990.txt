The motility of the worm nematode \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans} is
investigated in shallow, wet granular media as a function of particle size
dispersity and area density ($\phi$). Surprisingly, we find that the nematode's
propulsion speed is enhanced by the presence of particles in a fluid and is
nearly independent of area density. The undulation speed, often used to
differentiate locomotion gaits, is significantly affected by the bulk material
properties of wet mono- and polydisperse granular media for $\phi \geq 0.55$.
This difference is characterized by a change in the nematode's waveform from
swimming to crawling in dense polydisperse media \textit{only}. This change
highlights the organism's adaptability to subtle differences in local structure
and response between monodisperse and polydisperse media.
