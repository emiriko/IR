We use high-resolution three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations
to investigate the interaction of high-redshift galaxy outflows with low-mass
virialized clouds of primordial composition. While atomic cooling allows star
formation in objects with virial temperatures above $10^4$ K, "minihaloes"
below this threshold are generally unable to form stars by themselves. However,
these objects are highly susceptible to triggered star formation, induced by
outflows from neighboring high-redshift starburst galaxies. Here we conduct a
study of these interactions, focusing on cooling through non-equilibrium
molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) and hydrogen deuteride (HD) formation. Tracking the
non-equilibrium chemistry and cooling of 14 species and including the presence
of a dissociating background, we show that shock interactions can transform
minihaloes into extremely compact clusters of coeval stars. Furthermore, these
clusters are all less than $\approx 10^6 M_\odot,$ and they are ejected from
their parent dark matter halos: properties that are remarkably similar to those
of the old population of globular clusters.
