We study the dynamics of matter waves in an effectively one-dimensional
Bose-Einstein condensate in a double well potential. We consider in particular
the case when one of the double wells confines excited states. Similarly to the
known ground state oscillations, the states can tunnel between the wells
experiencing the physics known for electrons in a Josephson junction, or be
self-trapped. As the existence of dark solitons in a harmonic trap are
continuations of such non-ground state excitations, one can view the
Josephson-like oscillations as tunnelings of dark solitons. Numerical existence
and stability analysis based on the full equation is performed, where it is
shown that such tunneling can be stable. Through a numerical path following
method, unstable tunneling is also obtained in different parameter regions. A
coupled-mode system is derived and compared to the numerical observations.
Regions of (in)stability of Josephson tunneling are discussed and highlighted.
Finally, we outline an experimental scheme designed to explore such dark
soliton dynamics in the laboratory.
