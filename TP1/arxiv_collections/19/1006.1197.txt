We use one-loop Heavy Meson Chiral Perturbation Theory (HMCHPT) as well as a
relativistic formulation to calculate the chiral logarithms
$m^2_\pi\log{\left(m^2_\pi/\mu^2\right)}$ contributing to the formfactors of
the semileptonic $B\rightarrow \pi$ decays at momentum transfer $q^2$ away from
$q^2_\mathrm{max}=(m_B-m_\pi)^2$. We give arguments why this chiral behavior is
reliable even in the energy regime with hard or fast pions. These results can
be used to extrapolate the formfactors calculated on the lattice to lower light
meson masses.
