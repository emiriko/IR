Following the anomalous like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry measured by the D0
collaboration at the Tevatron collider we discuss the implications of large CP
violation in $B_{d,s}$ mixing for Supersymmetric (SUSY) Standard Models,
focussing on those models which allow a family symmetry and unification. For
the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) we show that it is only
possible to account for $B_{s}$ mixing and CP violation at the expense of large
squark mixing which would require a new approach to family symmetry models. In
order to describe both $B_{s}$ and $B_{d}$ mixing and CP violation we are led
to consider SUSY models with Higgs fields transforming as triplets under a
family symmetry. We describe a realistic such model based on $\Delta_{27}$
family symmetry in which tree-level exchange of the second Higgs family
predicts $B_{s}$ and $B_{d}$ mixing and CP violation in good agreement with a
recent global fit, while naturally suppressing flavour and CP violation
involving the first and second quark and lepton families.
