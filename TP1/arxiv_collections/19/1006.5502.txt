Given its low dollar and maintenance cost, RFID is poised to become the
enabling technology for inventory control and supply chain management. However,
as an outcome of its low cost, RFID based inventory control is susceptible to
pernicious security and privacy threats. A deleterious attack on such a system
is corporate espionage, where attackers through illicit inventorying infer
sales and restocking trends for products. In this paper, we first present
plausible aftermaths of corporate espionage using real data from online
sources. Second, to mitigate corporate espionage in a retail store environment,
we present a simple lowcost system called Mirage. Mirage uses additional
programmable low cost passive RFID tags called honeytokens to inject noise in
retail store inven-torying. Using a simple history based algorithm that
controls activation and de-activation of honeytokens, Mirage randomizes sales
and restocking trends. We evaluate Mirage in a real warehouse environment using
a commercial off-the-shelf Motorola MC9090 handheld RFID reader and over 450
Gen2 low cost RFID tags. We show that Mirage successfully flattens and
randomizes sales and restocking trends while adding minimal cost to inventory
control.
