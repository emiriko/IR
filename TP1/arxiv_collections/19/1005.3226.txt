A substantial improvement in the accuracy of G-dot tests (The dot denotes the
time derivative.) would make it realistic to speak in terms of a measurement of
G-dot, rather than merely a smaller upper bound on |G-dot|. We show that the
accuracy delta|G-dot/G| \approx 10^-14 yr^-1 may be sufficient, given the
accuracy of other cosmological parameters, to observe effects predicted by
higher dimensions theories and, hence, to discriminate among different models.
The \.G design goal for the SEE (Satellite Energy Exchange) mission is
delta(G-dot/G) \approx 10^-14 yr^-1.
