We show that a Skoda complex with a general plurisubharmonic weight function
is exact if its 'degree' is sufficiently large. This answers a question of
Lazarsfeld and implies that not every integrally closed ideal is equal to a
multiplier ideal even if we allow general plurisubharmonic weights for the
multiplier ideal, extending the result of Lazarsfeld and Lee \cite{LL}.
