As more and more service providers choose Cloud platforms, which is provided
by third party resource providers, resource providers needs to provision
resources for heterogeneous workloads in different Cloud scenarios. Taking into
account the dramatic differences of heterogeneous workloads, can we
coordinately provision resources for heterogeneous workloads in Cloud
computing? In this paper we focus on this important issue, which is
investigated by few previous work. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we
respectively propose a coordinated resource provisioning solution for
heterogeneous workloads in two typical Cloud scenarios: first, a large
organization operates a private Cloud for two heterogeneous workloads; second,
a large organization or two service providers running heterogeneous workloads
revert to a public Cloud; (2) we build an agile system PhoenixCloud that
enables a resource provider to create coordinated runtime environments on
demand for heterogeneous workloads when they are consolidated on a Cloud site;
and (3) A comprehensive evaluation has been performed in experiments. For two
typical heterogeneous workload traces: parallel batch jobs and Web services,
our experiments show that: a) in a private Cloud scenario, when the throughput
is almost same like that of a dedicated cluster system, our solution decreases
the configuration size of a cluster by about 40%; b) in a public Cloud
scenario, our solution decreases not only the total resource consumption, but
also the peak resource consumption maximally to 31% with respect to that of EC2
+RightScale solution.
