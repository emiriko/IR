Spatial evolutionary games model individuals who are distributed in a spatial
domain and update their strategies upon playing a normal form game with their
neighbors. We derive integro-differential equations as deterministic
approximations of the microscopic updating stochastic processes. This
generalizes the known mean-field ordinary differential equations and provide a
powerful tool to investigate the spatial effects in populations evolution. The
deterministic equations allow to identify many interesting features of the
evolution of strategy profiles in a population, such as standing and traveling
waves, and pattern formation, especially in replicator-type evolutions.
