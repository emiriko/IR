In this paper we are proposing a new concept in MAC layer protocol design for
Cognitive radio by combining information held by physical layer and MAC layer
with analytical engine based on knowledge based reasoning approach. In the
proposed system a cross layer information regarding signal to interference and
noise ratio (SINR) and received power are analyzed with help of knowledge based
reasoning system to determine minimum power to transmit and size of contention
window, to minimize backoff, collision, save power and drop packets. The
performance analysis of the proposed protocol indicates improvement in power
saving, lowering backoff and significant decrease in number of drop packets.
The simulation environment was implement using OMNET++ discrete simulation tool
with Mobilty framework and MiXiM simulation library.
