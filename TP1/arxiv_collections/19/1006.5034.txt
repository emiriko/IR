The phenomenological Green's function developed in the works of Yang, Rice
and Zhang has been very successful in understanding many of the anomalous
superconducting properties of the deeply underdoped cuprates. It is based on
considerations of the resonating valence bond spin liquid approximation and is
designed to describe the underdoped regime of the cuprates. Here we emphasize
the region of doping, $x$, just below the quantum critical point at which the
pseudogap develops. In addition to Luttinger hole pockets centered around the
nodal direction, there are electron pockets near the antinodes which are
connected to the hole pockets by gapped bridging contours. We determine the
contours of nearest approach as would be measured in angular resolved
photoemission experiments and emphasize signatures of the Fermi surface
reconstruction from the large Fermi contour of Fermi liquid theory (which
contains $1+x$ hole states) to the Luttinger pocket (which contains $x$ hole
states). We find that the quasiparticle effective mass renormalization
increases strongly towards the edge of the Luttinger pockets beyond which it
diverges.
