Trapped two-component Fermi gases allow for the investigation of the
so-called BCS-BEC crossover by tuning the interspecies atom-atom $s$-wave
scattering length scattering $a^{(aa)}$ from attractive to repulsive, including
vanishing and infinitely large values. Here, we numerically determine the
energy spectrum of the equal-mass spin-balanced four-fermion system---the
smallest few-particle system that exhibits BCS-BEC crossover-like behavior---as
a function of $a^{(aa)}$ using the stochastic variational approach. For
comparative purposes, we also treat the two- and three-particle systems. States
with vanishing and finite total angular momentum as well as with natural and
unnatural parity are considered. In addition, the energy spectrum of
weakly-attractive and weakly-repulsive gases is characterized by employing a
perturbative framework that utilizes hyperspherical coordinates. The
hyperspherical coordinate approach allows for the straightforward assignment of
quantum numbers and furthermore provides great insights into the
strongly-interacting unitary regime.
