A brief review of the nanoscale free-electron model of metal nanowires is
presented. This continuum description of metal nanostructures allows for a
unified treatment of cohesive and conducting properties. Conductance channels
act as delocalized chemical bonds whose breaking is responsible for jumps in
the conductance and force oscillations. It is argued that surface and
quantum-size effects are the two dominant factors in the energetics of a
nanowire, and much of the phenomenology of nanowire stability and structural
dynamics can be understood based on the interplay of these two competing
factors. A linear stability analysis reveals a sequence of ``magic''
conductance values for which the underlying nanowire geometry is exceptionally
stable. The stable configurations include Jahn-Teller deformed wires of broken
axial symmetry. The model naturally explains the experimentally observed shell
and supershell structures.
