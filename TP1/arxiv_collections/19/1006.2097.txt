The TANAMI (Tracking AGN with Austral Milliarcsecond Interferometry) program
provides comprehensive VLBI monitoring of extragalactic gamma-ray sources south
of declination -30 degrees. Operating at two radio frequencies (8 and 22 GHz),
this program is a critical component of the joint quasi-simultaneous
observations with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and ground based
observatories to discriminate between competing theoretical blazar emission
models. We describe the TANAMI program and present early results on the 75
sources currently being monitored.
