We give a unified treatment of different models of supersymmetry breaking and
mediation from a four dimensional effective field theory standpoint. In
particular a comparison between GMSB and various gravity mediated versions of
SUSY breaking shows that, once the former is embedded within a SUGRA framework,
there is no particular advantage to that mechanism from the point of view of
FCNC suppression. We point out the difficulties of all these scenarios - in
particular the cosmological modulus problem. We end with a discussion of
possible string theory realizations.
