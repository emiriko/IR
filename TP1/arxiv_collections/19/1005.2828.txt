Constrained quantum dynamics is used to propose a nonlinear dynamical
equation for pure states of a generalized coarse-grained system. The relevant
constraint is given either by the generalized purity or by the generalized
invariant fluctuation, and the coarse-grained pure states correspond to the
generalized coherent i.e. generalized nonentangled states. Open system model of
the coarse-graining is discussed. It is shown that in this model and in the
weak coupling limit the constrained dynamical equations coincide with an
equation for pointer states, based on Hilbert-Schmidt distance, that was
previously suggested in the context of the decoherence theory.
