It has been proposed that primordial gas in early dark matter halos, with
virial temperatures above 10^4 K, can avoid fragmentation and undergo rapid
collapse, possibly resulting in a supermassive black hole (SMBH). This requires
the gas to avoid cooling and to remain at temperatures near T=10^4 K. We show
that this condition can be satisfied in the presence of a sufficiently strong
primordial magnetic field, which heats the collapsing gas via ambipolar
diffusion. If the field has a strength above B = 3.6 (comoving) nG, the
collapsing gas is kept warm (T=10^4K) until it reaches the critical density
n_crit=10^3 cm^{-3} at which the roto-vibrational states of H_2 approach local
thermodynamic equilibrium. H_2-cooling then remains inefficient, and the gas
temperature stays near 10^4K, even as it continues to collapse to higher
densities. The critical magnetic field strength required to permanently
suppress H_2-cooling is somewhat higher than upper limit of approx. 2 nG from
the cosmic microwave background (CMB). However, it can be realized in the rare
(2-3)-sigma regions of the spatially fluctuating B-field; these regions contain
a sufficient number of halos to account for the z=6 quasar BHs.
