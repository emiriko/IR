New measurements by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC for eta production at
midrapidity as a function of transverse momentum (p_T) and collision centrality
in sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV Au+Au and p+p collisions are presented. They indicate
nuclear modification factors (R_AA) that are similar both in magnitude and
trend to those found in earlier pi^0 measurements. Linear fits to R_AA in the
5--20 GeV/c p_T region show that the slope is consistent with zero within two
standard deviations at all centralities although a slow rise cannot be
excluded. Having different statistical and systematic uncertainties the pi^0
and eta measurements are complementary at high p_T; thus, along with the
extended p_T range of these data they can provide additional constraints for
theoretical modeling and the extraction of transport properties.
