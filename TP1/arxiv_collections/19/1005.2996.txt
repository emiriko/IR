After recalling the basic concepts of gravity as an emergent phenomenon, we
analyze the recent derivation of Newton's law in terms of entropic force
proposed by Verlinde. By reviewing some points of the procedure, we extend it
to the case of a generic quantum gravity entropic correction to get compelling
deviations to the Newton's law. More specifically, we study: (1) noncommutative
geometry deviations and (2) ungraviton corrections. As a special result in the
noncommutative case, we find that the noncommutative character of the manifold
would be equivalent to the temperature of a thermodynamic system. Therefore, in
analogy to the zero temperature configuration, the description of spacetime in
terms of a differential manifold could be obtained only asymptotically.
Finally, we extend the Verlinde's derivation to a general case, which includes
all possible effects, noncommutativity, ungravity, asymptotically safe gravity,
electrostatic energy, and extra dimensions, showing that the procedure is solid
versus such modifications.
