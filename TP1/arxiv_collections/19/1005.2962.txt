Electromagnetic bound states in the radiation continuum are studied for
periodic double arrays of subwavelength dielectric cylinders in TM
polarization. They are similar to localized waveguide mode solutions of
Maxwell's equations for metal cavities or defects of photonic crystals, but, in
contrast to the latter, their spectrum lies in the radiation continuum. The
phenomenon is identical to the existence of bound sates in the radiation
continuum in quantum mechanics, discovered by von Neumann and Wigner. In the
formal scattering theory, these states appear as resonances with the vanishing
width. For the system studied, the bound states are shown to exist at specific
distances between the arrays in the spectral region where one or two
diffraction channels are open. Analytic solutions are obtained for all bound
states (below the radiation continuum and in it) in the limit of thin cylinders
(the cylinder radius is much smaller than the wavelength). The existence of
bound states is also established in the spectral region where three and more
diffraction channels are open, provided the cylinders' dielectric constant and
radius are fine-tuned. The near field and scattering resonances of the
structure are investigated when the distance between the arrays varies in the
neighborhood of its critical values at which the bound states are formed. In
particular, it is shown that the near field in the scattering process becomes
significantly amplified in specific regions of the array as the distance
approaches its critical values. The effect may be used to control optical
non-linear effects by varying the distance between the arrays near its critical
values.
