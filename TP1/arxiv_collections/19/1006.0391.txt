We compute strain distributions in core-shell nanowires of zinc blende
structure. We use both continuum elasticity theory and an atomistic model, and
consider both finite and infinite wires. The atomistic valence force-field
(VFF) model has only few assumptions. But it is less computationally efficient
than the finite-element (FEM) continuum elasticity model. The generic
properties of the strain distributions in core-shell nanowires obtained based
on the two models agree well. This agreement indicates that although the
calculations based on the VFF model are computationally feasible in many cases,
the continuum elasticity theory suffices to describe the strain distributions
in large core-shell nanowire structures. We find that the obtained strain
distributions for infinite wires are excellent approximations to the strain
distributions in finite wires, except in the regions close to the ends. Thus,
our most computationally efficient model, the finite-element continuum
elasticity model developed for infinite wires, is sufficient, unless edge
effects are important. We give a comprehensive discussion of strain profiles.
We find that the hydrostatic strain in the core is dominated by the axial
strain-component, $\varepsilon_{\z \z}$. We also find that although the
individual strain components have a complex structure, the hydrostatic strain
shows a much simpler structure. All in-plane strain components are of similar
magnitude. The non-planar off-diagonal strain-components ($\varepsilon_{\x \z}$
and $\varepsilon_{\y \z}$) are small but nonvanishing. Thus the material is not
only stretched and compressed but also warped. The models used can be extended
for study of wurtzite nanowire structures, as well as nanowires with multiple
shells.
