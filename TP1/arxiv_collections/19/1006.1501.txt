We present the one-loop corrections originating from Quantum Chromo-Dynamics
(QCD) and Electro-Weak (EW) interactions of Supersymmetric (SUSY) origin within
the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) to the single-top processes bq
-> tq' and qbar q' -> tbar b. We illustrate their impact onto top quark
observables accessible at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the 't+jet' final
state, such as total cross section, several differential distributions and
left-right plus forward-backward asymmetries. We find that in many instances
these effects can be observable for planned LHC energies and luminosities,
quite large as well as rather sensitive to several MSSM parameters.
