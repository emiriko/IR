We introduce a new imaginary-Brownian-time-Brownian-angle process, which we
also call the linear-Kuramoto-Sivashinsky process (LKSP). Building on our
techniques in two recent articles involving the connection of Brownian-time
processes to fourth order PDEs, we give an explicit solution to a linearized
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE in $\scriptstyle d$-dimensional space:
$\scriptstyle{\eight{u_t=-\frac18\Delta^2u-\frac12\Delta u-\frac12u}}$.
  The solution is given in terms of a functional of our LKSP.
