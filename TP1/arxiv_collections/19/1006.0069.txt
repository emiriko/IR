Coherent quantum tunneling effects on quantum interference are investigated
in electron transport through a mesoscopic interferometer. An evanescent wave
tunneling through a potential barrier in one arm can interfere with a
propagating wave passing through the other arm of interferometer. It is shown
that, even for the same arm lengths, such a quantum interference can induce a
circulating current, where Fano antiresonances do not occur in electron
transmission. It is found that there exists a critical value of asymmetric arm
lengths that gives rise to a Fano antiresonance in electron transmission for
the quantum interference between evanescent and propagating waves. We discuss
the effects of Fano antiresonances originating from the asymmetric arm lengths
on circulating currents.
