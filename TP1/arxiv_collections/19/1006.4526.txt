A planar triplet of diffraction gratings is used to transform a single laser
beam into a four-beam tetrahedral magneto-optical trap. This `flat' pyramid
diffractor geometry is ideal for future microfabrication. We demonstrate the
technique by trapping and subsequently sub-Doppler cooling 87Rb atoms to
30microKelvin.
