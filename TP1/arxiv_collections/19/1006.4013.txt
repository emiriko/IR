Observations of the A5p star KIC 8677585 obtained during the Kepler 10-d
commissioning run with 1-min time resolution show that it is a roAp star with
several frequencies with periods near 10 min. In addition, a low frequency at
3.142 cycles/day is also clearly present. Multiperiodic gamma Doradus and delta
Scuti pulsations, never before seen in any Ap star, are present in Kepler
observations of at least three other Ap stars. Since gamma Doradus pulsations
are seen in Ap stars, it is likely that the low-frequency in KIC 8677585 is
also a gamma Doradus pulsation. The simultaneous presence of both gamma Doradus
and roAp pulsations and the unexpected detection of delta Scuti and gamma
Doradus pulsations in Ap stars present new opportunities and challenges for the
interpretation of these stars.
