We consider extensions of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)
where the extra degrees of freedom interact weakly with the Higgs sector. These
models allow to relax the tension between the lower bound on the lightest CP
even Higgs mass from direct LEP searches and the theoretical upper bound of the
MSSM. We study the beyond MSSM (BMSSM) effects via an effective field-theory
approach, assuming that the MSSM is valid up to a heavy physics scale M. We
compute the masses, couplings and branching fractions of the Higgs sector,
including all the relevant corrections up to order 1/M^2. We find that the
collider phenomenology can be greatly different with respect to both the SM and
the MSSM.
