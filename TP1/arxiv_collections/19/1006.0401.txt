We consider the solution of initial value problems within the context of
hybrid systems and emphasise the use of high precision approximations (in
software for exact real arithmetic). We propose a novel algorithm for the
computation of trajectories up to the area where discontinuous jumps appear,
applicable for holomorphic flow functions. Examples with a prototypical
implementation illustrate that the algorithm might provide results with higher
precision than well-known ODE solvers at a similar computation time.
