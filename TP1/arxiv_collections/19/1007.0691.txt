We derive the exact solution of a one-dimensional Markov functional model
with log-normally distributed interest rates in discrete time. The model is
shown to have two distinct limiting states, corresponding to small and
asymptotically large volatilities, respectively. These volatility regimes are
separated by a phase transition at some critical value of the volatility. We
investigate the conditions under which this phase transition occurs, and show
that it is related to the position of the zeros of an appropriately defined
generating function in the complex plane, in analogy with the Lee-Yang theory
of the phase transitions in condensed matter physics.
