The leading semiclassical estimates of the electromagnetic Casimir stresses
on a spherical and a cylindrical metallic shell are within 1% of the field
theoretical values. The electromagnetic Casimir energy for both geometries is
given by two decoupled massless scalars that satisfy conformally covariant
boundary conditions. Surface contributions vanish for smooth metallic
boundaries and the finite electromagnetic Casimir energy in leading
semiclassical approximation is due to quadratic fluctuations about periodic
rays in the interior of the cavity only. Semiclassically the non-vanishing
Casimir energy of a metallic cylindrical shell is almost entirely due to
Fresnel diffraction.
