We analyze both experimentally (where possible) and theoretically from
first-principles the dielectric tensor components and crystal structure of five
classes of Pbnm perovskites. All of these materials are believed to be stable
on silicon and are therefore promising candidates for high-K dielectrics. We
also analyze the structure of these materials with various simple models,
decompose the lattice contribution to the dielectric tensor into force constant
matrix eigenmode contributions, explore a peculiar correlation between
structural and dielectric anisotropies in these compounds and give phonon
frequencies and infrared activities of those modes that are infrared-active. We
find that CaZrO_3, SrZrO_3, LaHoO_3, and LaYO_3 are among the most promising
candidates for high-K dielectrics among the compounds we considered.
