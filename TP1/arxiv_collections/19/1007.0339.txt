We report detailed 17O, 139La, and 63Cu Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and
Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) measurements in a stripe ordered
La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 single crystal and in oriented powder samples of
La1.8-xEu0.2SrxCuO4. We observe a partial wipeout of the 17O NMR intensity and
a simultaneous drop of the 17O electric field gradient (EFG) at low
temperatures where the spin stripe order sets in. In contrast, the 63Cu
intensity is completely wiped out at the same temperature. The drop of the 17O
quadrupole frequency is compatible with a charge stripe order. The 17O spin
lattice relaxation rate shows a peak similar to that of the 139La, which is of
magnetic origin. This peak is doping dependent and is maximal at x ~ 1/8.
