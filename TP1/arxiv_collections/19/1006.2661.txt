It is a well known fact that subdiffusion equations in terms of fractional
derivatives can be obtained from Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) models with
long-tailed waiting time distributions. Over the last years various authors
have shown that extensions of such CTRW models incorporating reactive processes
to the mesoscopic transport equations may lead to non-intuitive
reaction-subdiffusion equations. In particular, one such equation has been
recently derived for a subdiffusive random walker subject to a linear
(first-order) death process. We take this equation as a starting point to study
the developmental biology key problem of morphogen gradient formation, both for
the uniform case where the morphogen degradation rate coefficient (reactivity)
is constant and for the non-uniform case (position-dependent reactivity). In
the uniform case we obtain exponentially decreasing stationary concentration
profiles and we study their robustness with respect to perturbations in the
incoming morphogen flux. In the non-uniform case we find a rich phenomenology
at the level of the stationary profiles. We conclude that the analytic form of
the long-time morphogen concentration profiles is very sensitive to the spatial
dependence of the reactivity and the specific value of the anomalous diffusion
coefficient.
