In a sub-excitable light-sensitive Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical medium an
asymmetric disturbance causes the formation of localized traveling
wave-fragments. Under the right conditions these wave-fragment can conserve
their shape and velocity vectors for extended time periods. The size and life
span of a fragment depend on the illumination level of the medium. When two or
more wave-fragments collide they annihilate or merge into a new wave-fragment.
In computer simulations based on the Oregonator model we demonstrate that the
outcomes of inter-fragment collisions can be controlled by varying the
illumination level applied to the medium. We interpret these wave-fragments as
values of Boolean variables and design collision-based polymorphic logical
gates. The gate implements operation XNOR for low illumination, and it acts as
NOR gate for high illumination. As a NOR gate is a universal gate then we are
able to demonstrate that a simulated light sensitive BZ medium exhibits
computational universality.
