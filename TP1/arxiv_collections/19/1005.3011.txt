Two recent preprints [B. Altshuler, H. Krovi, and J. Roland, "Quantum
adiabatic optimization fails for random instances of NP-complete problems",
arXiv:0908.2782 and "Anderson localization casts clouds over adiabatic quantum
optimization", arXiv:0912.0746] argue that random 4th order perturbative
corrections to the energies of local minima of random instances of NP-complete
problem lead to avoided crossings that cause the failure of quantum adiabatic
algorithm (due to exponentially small gap) close to the end, for very small
transverse field that scales as an inverse power of instance size N. The
theoretical portion of this work does not to take into account the exponential
degeneracy of the ground and excited states at zero field. A corrected analysis
shows that unlike those in the middle of the spectrum, avoided crossings at the
edge would require high [O(1)] transverse fields, at which point the
perturbation theory may become divergent due to quantum phase transition. This
effect manifests itself only in large instances [exp(0.02 N) >> 1], which might
be the reason it had not been observed in the authors' numerical work. While we
dispute the proposed mechanism of failure of quantum adiabatic algorithm, we
cannot draw any conclusions on its ultimate complexity.
