The strong coupling constant alpha_s and its dependence on the momentum scale
is determined from the p_T dependence of the inclusive jet cross section in
ppbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV measured with the D0 experiment. The jet
transverse momentum range of 50 < p_T < 145 GeV contributes to the
determination. Using perturbative QCD caclulations to order O(alpha_s^3)
combined with resummed threshold corrections to order O(alpha_s^4) an
alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1161^{+0.0041}_{-0.0048} is obtained. This is the most precise
result from a hadron-hadron collider.
