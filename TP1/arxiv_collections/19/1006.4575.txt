We investigate the collider signatures of heavy, long-lived, neutral
particles that decay to charged particles plus missing energy. Specifically, we
focus on the case of a neutralino NLSP decaying to Z and gravitino within the
context of General Gauge Mediation. We show that a combination of searches
using the inner detector and the muon spectrometer yields a wide range of
potential early LHC discoveries for NLSP lifetimes ranging from 10^(-1)-10^5
mm. We further show that events from Z(l+l-) can be used for detailed kinematic
reconstruction, leading to accurate determinations of the neutralino mass and
lifetime. In particular, we examine the prospects for detailed event study at
ATLAS using the ECAL (making use of its timing and pointing capabilities)
together with the TRT, or using the muon spectrometer alone. Finally, we also
demonstrate that there is a region in parameter space where the Tevatron could
potentially discover new physics in the delayed Z(l+l-)+MET channel. While our
discussion centers on gauge mediation, many of the results apply to any
scenario with a long-lived neutral particle decaying to charged particles.
