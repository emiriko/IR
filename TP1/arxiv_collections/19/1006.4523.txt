The X-ray spectrum of the Seyfert 1.5 source NGC 6860 is among the most
complex of the sources detected in the Swift Burst Alert Telescope all-sky
survey. A short XMM-Newton follow-up observation of the source revealed a flat
spectrum both above and below 2 keV. To uncover the complexity of the source,
in this paper we analyze both a 40 ks Suzaku and a 100 ks XMM-Newton
observation of NGC 6860. While the spectral state of the source changed between
the newer observations presented here and the earlier short XMM-Newton spectrum
- showing a higher flux and steeper power law component - the spectrum of NGC
6860 is still complex with clearly detected warm absorption signatures. We find
that a two component warm ionized absorber is present in the soft spectrum,
with column densities of about 10^20 and 10^21 cm$^-2, ionization parameters of
xi = 180 and 45 ergs cm s^-1, and outflow velocities for each component in the
range of 0-300 km s^-1. Additionally, in the hard spectrum we find a broad
(approx 11000 km s^-1) Fe K-alpha emission line, redshifted by approx 2800 km
s^-1.
