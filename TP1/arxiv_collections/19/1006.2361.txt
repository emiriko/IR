A graph is a data structure composed of dots (i.e. vertices) and lines (i.e.
edges). The dots and lines of a graph can be organized into intricate
arrangements. The ability for a graph to denote objects and their relationships
to one another allow for a surprisingly large number of things to be modeled as
a graph. From the dependencies that link software packages to the wood beams
that provide the framing to a house, most anything has a corresponding graph
representation. However, just because it is possible to represent something as
a graph does not necessarily mean that its graph representation will be useful.
If a modeler can leverage the plethora of tools and algorithms that store and
process graphs, then such a mapping is worthwhile. This article explores the
world of graphs in computing and exposes situations in which graphical models
are beneficial.
