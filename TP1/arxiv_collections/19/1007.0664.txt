In this paper, I provide a formal set of assumptions and give a natural
criterion for a quantum field theory to admit particles. I construct a na\"ive
approach to localization for a free bosonic quantum field theory and show how
this localization scheme, as a consequence of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem, fails
to satisfy this criterion. I then examine the Newton-Wigner concept of
localization and show that it fails to obey strong microcausality and thus is
subject to a more general version of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem. I review
approaches to quantum field theoretic explanations of particle detection events
and explain how particles can be regarded as emergent phenomena of a
relativistic field theory. In particular, I show that effective localization of
Hilbert space vectors is equivalent to an approximate locality of observable
algebras.
