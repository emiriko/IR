We derive lists of proper-motions and kinematic membership probabilities for
49 open clusters and possible open clusters in the zone of the Bordeaux PM2000
proper motion catalogue ($+11^{\circ}\le\delta\le+18^{\circ}$). We test
different parametrisations of the proper motion and position distribution
functions and select the most successful one. In the light of those results, we
analyse some objects individually. The segregation between cluster and field
member stars, and the assignment of membership probabilities, is accomplished
by applying a new and fully automated method based on both parametrisations of
the proper motion and position distribution functions, and genetic algorithm
optimization heuristics associated with a derivative-based hill climbing
algorithm for the likelihood optimization. We present a catalogue comprising
kinematic parameters and associated membership probability lists for 49 open
clusters and possible open clusters in the Bordeaux PM2000 catalogue region. We
note that this is the first determination of proper motions for five open
clusters. We confirm the non-existence of two kinematic populations in the
region of 15 previously suspected non-existent objects.
