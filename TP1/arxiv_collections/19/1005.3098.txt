Optical spectra of the peculiar supergiant 3Pup taken in 1997-2008 are used
to analyze the spectral peculiarities and velocity field in its atmosphere. The
profiles of strong FeII lines and of the lines of other iron-group ions have a
specific shape: the wings are raised by emissions, whereas the core is
sharpened by a depression. The latter feature becomes more pronounced with the
increasing line strength, and the increasing wavelength. Line profiles are
variable: the magnitude and sign of the absorption asymmetry, and the
blue-to-red emission intensity ratios vary from one spectrum to another. The
temporal Vr variations are minimal for the forbidden emissions and sharp shell
cores of the absorption features of FeII(42), and other strong lines of
iron-group ions. The average velocity for the above lines can be adopted as the
systemic velocity: Vsys=28.5+/-0.5km/s. The weakest photospheric absorptions
and photospheric MgII, SiII absorptions exhibit well-defined day-to-day
velocity variations of up to 7km/s. Quantitative spectral classification yields
the spectral type of A2.7+/-0.3 Ib. The equivalent widths and profiles of
Hdelta and Hgamma, and the equivalent width of the OI7774A triplet yield an
absolute magnitude estimate of Mv=-5.5+/-0.3mag, implying the heliocentric
distance of 0.7kpc.
