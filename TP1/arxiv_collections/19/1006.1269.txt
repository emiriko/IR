We propose a scheme to investigate the effect of frustration on the magnetic
phase transitions of cold atoms confined in an optical lattice. We also
demonstrate how to get two-leg spin ladders with frustrated spin-exchange
coupling which display a phase transition from a spin liquid to a fully
incompressible state. Various experimental quantities are further analyzed for
describing this phase.
