We compare the redshifts, host galaxy metallicities, and isotropic
(E_gamma,iso) and beaming-corrected (E_gamma) gamma-ray energy release of 16
long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) at z < 1. From this comparison, we find
no statistically significant correlation between host metallicity and redshift,
E_gamma,iso, or E_gamma. These results are at odds with previous theoretical
and observational predictions of an inverse correlation between gamma-ray
energy release and host metallicity, as well as the standard predictions of
metallicity-driven wind effects in stellar evolutionary models. We consider the
implications that these results have for LGRB progenitor scenarios, and discuss
our current understanding of the role that metallicity plays in the production
of LGRBs.
