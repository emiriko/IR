Using the large acceptance apparatus FOPI, we study central collisions in the
reactions (energies in A GeV are given in parentheses): 40Ca+40Ca (0.4, 0.6,
0.8, 1.0, 1.5, 1.93), 58Ni+58Ni (0.15, 0.25, 0.4), 96Ru+96Ru (0.4, 1.0, 1.5),
96Zr+96Zr (0.4, 1.0, 1.5), 129Xe+CsI (0.15, 0.25, 0.4), 197Au+197Au (0.09,
0.12, 0.15, 0.25, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5). The observables include
cluster multiplicities, longitudinal and transverse rapidity distributions and
stopping, and radial flow. The data are compared to earlier data where possible
and to transport model simulations.
