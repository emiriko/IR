While SUSY particles, if they exist at the TeV-scale, will be discovered at
the Tevatron or the LHC, the determination of the SUSY-breaking scenario and
its free parameters will require additional information, e.g. from a future
International Linear Collider. We point out that such information, in
particular on SUSY-particle mixing and the associated soft SUSY-breaking
parameters, can also be obtained from measurements at existing or future
polarized hadron colliders, since the polarization of initial-state quarks,
transmitted through weak gauge bosons or squarks, can be strongly correlated
with the helicity and gaugino/higgsino mixing of final-state sleptons, squarks,
neutralinos and charginos.
