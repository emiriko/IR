Two flavours Skyrmion will be analyzed analytically, in case of static and
rotational Skyrme equations. Numerical solution of a nonlinear scalar field
equation, i.e. the Skyrme equation, will be worked with finite difference
method. This article is a more comprehensive version of \textit{SU(2) Skyrme
Model for Hadron} which have been published at Journal of Theoretical and
Computational Studies, Volume \textbf{3} (2004) 0407.
