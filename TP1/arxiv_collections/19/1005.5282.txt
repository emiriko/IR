We find the distribution of the electromagnetic field inside and outside a
dielectric disk resonator placed in He-II. It is shown that this field consists
of a collection of "circular" (c-) photons. The wave function \Psi_c of a
c-phonon for the He-II + disk system is calculated in the zero-order
approximation in interaction. Due to the symmetry of the problem, the structure
of \Psi_c is such that a c-phonon possesses, similarly to a c-photon of the
resonator, a definite energy and an angular momentum with respect to the disk
axis, but it does not possess a definite momentum in the disk plane.
