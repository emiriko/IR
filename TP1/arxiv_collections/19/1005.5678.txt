We use deep observations taken with the Photodetector Array Camera and
Spectrometer (PACS), on board the Herschel satellite as part of the PACS
evolutionary probe (PEP) guaranteed project along with submm ground-based
observations to measure the dust mass of a sample of high-z submillimeter
galaxies (SMGs). We investigate their dust content relative to their stellar
and gas masses, and compare them with local star-forming galaxies. High-z SMGs
are dust rich, i.e. they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared to
local spiral galaxies (by a factor of 30) and also compared to local
ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs, by a factor of 6). This indicates that
the large masses of gas typically hosted in SMGs have already been highly
enriched with metals and dust. Indeed, for those SMGs whose gas mass is
measured, we infer dust-to-gas ratios similar or higher than local spirals and
ULIRGs. However, similarly to other strongly star-forming galaxies in the local
Universe and at high-z, SMGs are characterized by gas metalicities lower (by a
factor of a few) than local spirals, as inferred from their optical nebular
lines, which are generally ascribed to infall of metal-poor gas. This is in
contrast with the large dust content inferred from the far-IR and submm data.
In short, the metalicity inferred from the dust mass is much higher (by more
than an order of magnitude) than that inferred from the optical nebular lines.
We discuss the possible explanations of this discrepancy and the possible
implications for the investigation of the metalicity evolution at high-z.
