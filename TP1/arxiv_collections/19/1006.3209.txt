A product-quotient surface is the minimal resolution of the singularities of
the quotient of a product of two curves by the action of a finite group acting
separately on the two factors. We classify all minimal product-quotient
surfaces of general type with geometric genus 0: they form 72 families. We show
that there is exactly one product-quotient surface of general type with big
canonical class which is not minimal, and describe its (-1) curves. For all
these surfaces the Bloch conjecture holds.
