We consider a quantum field on a lukewarm black hole spacetime. We introduce
a new uniform approximation to the radial equation, constructed using an
extension of Green-Liouville asymptotics. We then use this new approximation to
construct the renormalized vacuum polarization in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum.
Previous calculations of the vacuum polarization rely on the WKB approximation
to the solutions of the radial equation, however the nonuniformity of the WKB
approximations obscures the results of these calculations near both horizons.
The use of our new approximation eliminates these obscurities, enabling us to
obtain explicitly finite and easily calculable values of the vacuum
polarization on the two horizons.
