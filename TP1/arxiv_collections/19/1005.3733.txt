We present an update on the next-to-leading order calculation of the rate for
Higgs boson production in association with two jets. Our new calculation
incorporates the full analytic result for the one-loop virtual amplitude.
Results are presented for the Tevatron, where implications for the Higgs search
are sketched, and for the LHC at \sqrt{s}=7 TeV.
