Polarization resolved micro-Raman spectroscopy was carried out at the edges
of bilayer graphene. We find strong dependence of the intensity of the G band
on the incident laser polarization, with its intensity dependence being 90
degrees out of phase for the armchair and zigzag case, in accordance with
theoretical predictions. For the case of mixed-state edges we demonstrate that
the polarization contrast reflects the fractional composition of armchair and
zigzag edges, providing a monitor of edge purity, which is an important
parameter for the development of efficient nanoelectronic devices.
