If the positron fraction and combined electron-positron flux excesses
recently observed by PAMELA, FERMI and HESS are due to dark matter annihilation
into lepton-rich final states, the accompanying final state radiation (FSR)
photons may be detected by ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes
(ACTs). Satellite dwarf galaxies in the vicinity of the Milky Way are
particularly promising targets for this search. We find that current and
near-future ACTs have an excellent potential for discovering the FSR photons
from dwarfs, although a discovery cannot be guaranteed due to large
uncertainties in the fluxes resulting from lack of precise knowledge of dark
matter distribution within the dwarfs. We also investigate the possibility of
discriminating between different dark matter models based on the measured FSR
photon spectrum. For typical parameters, we find that the ACTs can reliably
distinguish models predicting dark matter annihilation into two-lepton final
states from those favoring four-lepton final states (as in, for example, "axion
portal" models). In addition, we find that the dark matter particle mass can
also be determined from the FSR spectrum.
