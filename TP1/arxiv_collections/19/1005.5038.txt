After reviewing parity measurement based interferometry with twin-Fock
states, which allows for super-sensitivity (Heisenberg-limited) and
super-resolution, we consider interferometry with two different superpositions
of twin-Fock states, namely two-mode squeezed vacuum states and pair coherent
states. This study is motivated by the experimental challenge of producing
twin-Fock states on opposite sides of a beam splitter. We find that input
two-mode squeezed states, while allowing for Heisenberg-limited sensitivity, do
not yield super-resolutions, whereas we that find both are possible with input
pair coherent states.
