Vertical profiles for mean wind, standard deviations of velocity
fluctuations, and wave-induced part of the momentum flux over a wavy fluid
surface are calculated in the Cartesian coordinates on the basis of recent
numerical results by Chalikov and Rainchik. Besides, calculations of spectra
for surface elevation and wave-induced velocity components at this surface are
carried out. Unlike the profiles typical to the near-wall turbulence, the
calculated wind-velocity profiles deviate significantly from the logarithmic
law throughout the entire trough-crest zone of wind waves, and the wave-induced
part of the momentum flux changes its sign in close vicinity of the mean
surface level. Vertical scales of the profiles features are estimated. Spectral
analysis of the water-surface oscillations and wind-velocity components
suggests nonlinear and strongly anisotropic dynamics of the system under
consideration. Points of application of the results obtained are discussed.
