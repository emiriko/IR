We examine the effect of including the `combined' HERA structure function
data in the MSTW global fit for parton distribution functions (PDFs). The
combined neutral-current HERA data have a significant, if not dramatic, effect,
of up to 2--3% at NLO for Z boson and Higgs production at the Tevatron and LHC,
and a generally slightly smaller effect, particularly on LHC processes, at
NNLO. This is an amount comparable, or less than, the typical PDF
uncertainties, and hence we do not intend to release an imminent update to the
MSTW 2008 fit. We also investigate the consistency with the recent D0 data on
electron and muon charge asymmetry from W decays and the direct CDF measurement
of the W charge asymmetry. The D0 lepton charge asymmetry data imply a fairly
large change to the down-quark distribution and/or large nuclear corrections to
be applied when fitting to deuterium structure function data, while the CDF W
charge asymmetry data are more consistent with the existing PDFs. However, it
is difficult to reconcile all of the Tevatron W -> lepton neutrino charge
asymmetry data sets with the fit, and to some extent, with each other.
