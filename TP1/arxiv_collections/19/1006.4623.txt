Let G be a complex, affine algebraic group and D a meromorphic connection on
the trivial G-bundle over P^1, with a pole of order 2 at zero and a pole of
order 1 at infinity. We show that the map S taking the residue of D at zero to
the corresponding Stokes factors is given by an explicit, universal Lie series
whose coefficients are multilogarithms. Using a non-commutative analogue of the
compositional inversion of formal power series, we show that the same holds for
the inverse of S, and that the corresponding Lie series coincides with the
generating function for counting invariants in abelian categories constructed
by D. Joyce.
