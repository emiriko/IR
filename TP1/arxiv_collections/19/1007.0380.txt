Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has previously been shown to be a
useful decomposition for multivariate data. We interpret the factorization in a
new way and use it to generate missing attributes from test data. We provide a
joint optimization scheme for the missing attributes as well as the NMF
factors. We prove the monotonic convergence of our algorithms. We present
classification results for cases with missing attributes.
