We calculate the representation growth zeta function of the discrete
Heisenberg group over the integers of a quadratic number field. This is done by
forming equivalence classes of representations, called twist iso-classes, and
explicitly constructing a representative from each twist iso-class. Our method
of construction involves studying the eigenspace structure of the elements of
the image of the representation and then picking a suitable basis for the
representation.
