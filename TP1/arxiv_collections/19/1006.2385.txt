We present preliminary results from multidimensional numerical studies of
pair instability supernova (PSN), studying the fluid instabilities that occur
in multiple spatial dimensions. We use the new radiation-hydrodynamics code,
CASTRO, and introduce a new mapping procedure that defines the initial
conditions for the multidimensional runs in such a way that conservation of
physical quantities is guaranteed at any level of resolution.
