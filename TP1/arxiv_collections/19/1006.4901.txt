We present a detailed spectroscopic study of the hot gas in the Galactic halo
toward the direction of a blazer PKS 2155-304 (z=0.117). The OVII and OVIII
absorption lines are measured with the Low and High Energy Transmission Grating
Spectrographs aboard Chandra, and the OVII, OVIII, and NeIX emission lines
produced in the adjacent field of the PKS 2155-304 direction are observed with
the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer aboard Suzaku. Assuming vertically exponential
distributions of the gas temperature and the density, we perform a combined
analysis of the absorption and emission data. The gas temperature and density
at the Galactic plane are determined to be 2.5(+0.6,-0.3) MK and 1.4(+0.5,-0.4)
x 10^{-3} cm^{-3} and the scale heights of the gas temperature and density are
5.6(+7.4,-4.2) kpc and 2.3(+0.9,-0.8) kpc, respectively. These values are
consistent with those obtained in the LMC X-3 direction.
