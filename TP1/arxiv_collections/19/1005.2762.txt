It has been recognized that the turbulent cross helicity (correlation between
the velocity and magnetic-field fluctuations) can play an important role in
several magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma phenomena such as the global
magnetic-field generation, turbulence suppression, etc. Despite its relevance
to the cross-helicity evolution, little attention has been paid to the
dissipation rate of the turbulent cross helicity, $\epsilon_W$. In this paper,
we consider the model expression for the dissipation rate of the turbulent
cross helicity. In addition to the algebraic model, an evolution equation of
$\epsilon_W$ is proposed on the basis of the statistical analytical theory of
inhomogeneous turbulence. A turbulence model with the modeling of $\epsilon_W$
is applied to the solar-wind turbulence. Numerical results on the large-scale
evolution of the cross helicity is compared with the satellite observations. It
is shown that, as far as the solar-wind application is concerned, the simplest
possible algebraic model for $\epsilon_W$ is sufficient for elucidating the
large-scale spatial evolution of the solar-wind turbulence. Dependence of the
cross-helicity evolution on the large-scale velocity structures such as
velocity shear and flow expansion is also discussed.
