We construct a supersymmetric (SUSY) $SU(5)$ model with the flavor symmetry
$S_4\times Z_3\times Z_4$. Three generations of adjoint matter fields are
introduced to generate the neutrino masses via the combined type I and type III
see-saw mechanism. The first two generations of the the $\mathbf{10}$
dimensional representation in $SU(5)$ are assigned to be a doublet of $S_4$,
the second family $\mathbf{10}$ is chose as the first component of the doublet,
and the first family as the second component. Tri-bimaximal mixing in the
neutrino sector is predicted exactly at leading order, charged lepton mixing
leads to small deviation from the tri-bimaximal mixing pattern. Subleading
contributions introduce corrections of order $\lambda^2_c$ to all three lepton
mixing angles. The model also reproduces a realistic pattern of quark and
charged lepton masses and quark mixings. The phenomenological implications of
the model are analyzed in datail.
