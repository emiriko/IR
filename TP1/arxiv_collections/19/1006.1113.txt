The KamLAND and Borexino experiments have detected electron antineutrinos
produced in the decay chains of natural thorium and uranium (Th and U
geoneutrinos). We analyze the energy spectra of current geoneutrino data in
combination with solar and long-baseline reactor neutrino data, with
marginalized three-neutrino oscillation parameters. We consider the case with
unconstrained Th and U event rates in KamLAND and Borexino, as well as cases
with fewer degrees of freedom, as obtained by successively assuming for both
experiments a common Th/U ratio, a common scaling of Th+U event rates, and a
chondritic Th/U value. In combination, KamLAND and Borexino can reject the null
hypothesis (no geoneutrino signal) at 5 sigma. Interesting bounds or
indications emerge on the Th+U geoneutrino rates and on the Th/U ratio, in
broad agreement with typical Earth model expectations. Conversely, the results
disfavor the hypothesis of a georeactor in the Earth's core, if its power
exceeds a few TW. The interplay of KamLAND and Borexino geoneutrino data is
highlighted.
