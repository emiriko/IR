By using variational Monte Carlo method, we examine an effective low-energy
model for LaFeAsO derived from an ab initio downfolding scheme. We show that
quantum and many-body fluctuations near a quantum critical point largely reduce
the antiferromagnetic (AF) ordered moment and the model not only quantitatively
reproduces the small ordered moment in LaFeAsO, but also explains the diverse
dependence on LaFePO, BaFe2As2 and FeTe. We also find that LaFeAsO is under
large orbital fluctuations, sandwiched by the AF Mott insulator and weakly
correlated metals. The orbital fluctuations and Dirac-cone dispersion hold keys
for the diverse magnetic properties.
