We calculate the effect of interactions on the expansion of ultracold atoms
from a single site of an optical lattice. We use these results to predict how
interactions influence the interference pattern observed in a time of flight
experiment. We find that for typical interaction strengths their influence is
negligible, yet that they reduce visibility near a scattering resonance.
