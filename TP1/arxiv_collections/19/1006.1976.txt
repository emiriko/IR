Electrons in a quantum-dot spin valve, consisting of a single-level quantum
dot coupled to two ferromagnetic leads with magnetizations pointing in
arbitrary directions, experience an exchange field that is induced on the dot
by the interplay of Coulomb interaction and quantum fluctuations. We show that
a third, superconducting lead with large superconducting gap attached to the
dot probes this exchange field very sensitively. In particular, we find
striking signatures of the exchange field in the symmetric component of the
supercurrent with respect to the bias voltage applied between the ferromagnets
already for small values of the ferromagnets' spin polarization.
