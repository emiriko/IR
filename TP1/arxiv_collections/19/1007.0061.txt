The photo-induced metal-insulator transition is studied by the numerical
simulation of real-time quantum dynamics of a double-exchange model. The
spatial and temporal evolutions of the system during the transition have been
revealed including (i) the threshold behavior with respect to the intensity and
energy of light, (ii) multiplication of particle-hole (p-h) pairs by a p-h pair
of high energy, and (iii) the space-time pattern formation such as (a) the
stripe controlled by the polarization of light, (b) coexistence of metallic and
insulating domains, and (c) dynamical spontaneous symmetry-breaking associated
with the spin spiral formation imposed by the conservation of total spin for
small energy-dissipation rates.
