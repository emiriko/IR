In this work, a non-relativistic theory of the electroscalar field being an
expansion of the classical Maxwell's electrodynamics is presented. Expansion of
the classical electrodynamics is based on the hypothesis about an existing new
4-scalar potential complementary to the 4-vector electrodynamic potential.
4-scalar potential, from the viewpoint of the quantum field concept, describes
massless scalar particles with a zero spin whose superposition realizes the
Coulomb field. In a nonrelativistic approximation this hypothesis leads to the
theory in which along with the electric and magnetic fields there arises a new
scalar field that can propagate jointly with the electric field in vacuum in
the form of a longitudinal electroscalar wave and, thus, transport of the
Coulomb field is carried out. Indicative of the arising complementary scalar
field is the analogy between the linear theory of elasticity and Maxwell
electrodynamics considered in this work. From this analogy it follows that full
agreement between the Lame equations and Maxwell equations is reached under the
condition of incompressibility of the elastic continuum, while describing the
compressible continuum necessitates introduction of a new scalar field. Since
the 4-vector electrodynamic and new 4-scalar potentials do not form a single
geometric object in the Minkowski space-time, in a nonrelativistic
approximation the electromagnetic and electroscalar fields appear to be
independent and do not interfere. In the paper, the problem of interaction of
the introduced scalar field with charges and currents is also considered and
electrodynamics based on the Fock and Podolsky Lagrangian is briefly discussed.
