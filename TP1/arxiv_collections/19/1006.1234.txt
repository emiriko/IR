Final state of a black hole is studied by taking into account a general
unitary evolution of a black hole matter state. It is found that the mixedness
decreases under general unitary transformation when the initial matter state
was in mixed state and the mean fidelity at the evaporation is smaller than the
fidelity of the quantum teleportation by the factor of inverse square of the
number of states of a black hole. The change of entanglement Alice-Bob pair at
evaporation is also studied by calculating the entanglement fidelity and
eigenvalues of the partial transposed block density matrix. We assumed that
Alice fell onto the black hole when the hole was formed while Bob is
maintaining the safe distance from the black hole. It is found that the
entanglement fidelity is inversely proportional to the square of the Hilbert
space dimension N and the entanglement can survive the evaporation process.
