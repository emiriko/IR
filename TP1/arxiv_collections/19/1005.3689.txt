As the intensity of neutrino beams produced at accelerators increases,
important systematic errors due to poor knowledge of production cross sections
for pions and kaons arise. Among other goals, the NA61/SHINE (SHINE=SPS Heavy
Ion and Neutrino Experiment) detector at CERN SPS aims at precision
hadro-production measurements to characterise the neutrino beam of the T2K
experiment at J-PARC. These measurements are performed using a 30GeV proton
beam produced at the SPS with a thin carbon target and a full T2K replica
target. Preliminary spectra of $\pi^{+}$ and $\pi^{-}$ inclusive cross section
were obtained from pilot data collected in 2007 with a 2 cm thick target. After
a description of the SHINE detector and its particle identification
capabilities, results from three different analysis are discussed.
