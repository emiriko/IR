We present the analysis of RXTE monitoring data obtained during the January
2009 outburst of the hard X-ray transient 1A 1118-61. Using these observations
the broadband (3.5-120 keV) spectrum of the source was measured for the first
time ever. We have found that the broadband continuum spectrum of the source is
similar to other accreting pulsars and is well described by several
conventionally used phenomenological models. We have discovered that regardless
of the applied continuum model, a prominent broad absorption feature at ~55 keV
is observed. We interpret this feature as a cyclotron resonance scattering
feature (CRSF). The observed CRSF energy is one of the highest known and
corresponds to a magnetic field of B~4.8 x 10^12 G in the scattering region.
Our data also indicate the presence of an iron emission line presence that has
not been previously reported for 1A 1118-61. Timing properties of the source,
including a strong spin-up, were found to be similar to those observed by
CGRO/BATSE during the previous outburst, but the broadband capabilities of RXTE
reveal a more complicated energy dependency of the pulse-profile.
