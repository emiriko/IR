Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology one of the most promising
technologies in the field of ubiquitous computing. Indeed, RFID technology may
well replace barcode technology. Although it offers many advantages over other
identification systems, there are also associated security risks that are not
easy to be addressed. When designing a real lightweight authentication protocol
for low cost RFID tags, a number of challenges arise due to the extremely
limited computational, storage and communication abilities of Low-cost RFID
tags. This paper proposes a real mutual authentication protocol for low cost
RFID tags. The proposed protocol prevents passive attacks as active attacks are
discounted when designing a protocol to meet the requirements of low cost RFID
tags. However the implementation of the protocol meets the limited abilities of
low cost RFID tags.
