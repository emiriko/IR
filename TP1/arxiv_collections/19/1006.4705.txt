It has been suggested that either diamagnetism or paramagnetism of Bose
gases, due to the charge or spin degrees of freedom respectively, appears
solely to be extraordinarily strong. We investigate magnetic properties of
charged spin-1 Bose gases in external magnetic field, focusing on the
competition between the diamagnetism and paramagnetism, using the Lande-factor
$g$ of particles to evaluate the strength of paramagnetic effect. We propose
that a gas with $g<{1/\sqrt{8}}$ exhibits diamagnetism at all temperatures,
while a gas with $g>{1/2}$ always exhibits paramagnetism. Moreover, a gas with
the Lande-factor in between shows a shift from paramagnetism to diamagnetism as
the temperature decreases. The paramagnetic and diamagnetic contributions to
the total magnetization density are also calculated in order to demonstrate
some details of the competition.
