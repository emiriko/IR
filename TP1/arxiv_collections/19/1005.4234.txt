We construct a simple, spherical blastwave model to estimate the pressure
structure of the intergalactic medium surrounding hyper-starburst galaxies, and
argue that the effects of interaction with star-forming galaxy winds may be
approximated at early times by an adiabatically expanding, self-similar
`bubble' as described by Weaver et al. (1977) and Ostriker & McKee (1988). This
model is used to make observational predictions for the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in the shocked bubble plasma. Radiative cooling
losses are explored, and it is found that bremsstrahlung will limit the epoch
of adiabatic expansion to $10^7$--$10^8$ years: comparable to total
hyper-starburst lifetimes. Prospects for making a first Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
detection of galaxy wind bubbles using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array are
examined for a number of active hyper-starburst sources in the literature.
