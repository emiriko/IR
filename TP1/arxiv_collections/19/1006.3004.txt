We present numerical solutions of the Gross--Pitaevskii equation
corresponding to reconnecting vortex lines. We determine the separation of
vortices as a function of time during the approach to reconnection, and study
the formation of pyramidal vortex structures. Results are compared with
analytical work and numerical studies based on the vortex filament method.
