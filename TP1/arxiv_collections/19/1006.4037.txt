We demonstrate a new 'microsphere nanoscope' that uses ordinary SiO2
microspheres as superlenses to create a virtual image of the object in near
field. The magnified virtual image greatly overcomes the diffraction limit. We
are able to resolve clearly 50-nm objects under a standard white light source
in both transmission and reflection modes. The resolution achieved for white
light opens a new opportunity to image viruses, DNA and molecules in real time.
