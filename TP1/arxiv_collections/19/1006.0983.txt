Low energy cosmic ray antideuterons provide a unique low background channel
for indirect detection of dark matter. We compute the cosmic ray flux of
antideuterons from hadronic annihilations of dark matter for various Standard
Model final states and determine the mass reach of two future experiments
(AMS-02 and GAPS) designed to greatly increase the sensitivity of antideuteron
detection over current bounds. We consider generic models of scalar, fermion,
and massive vector bosons as thermal dark matter, describe their basic features
relevant to direct and indirect detection, and discuss the implications of
direct detection bounds on models of dark matter as a thermal relic. We also
consider specific dark matter candidates and assess their potential for
detection via antideuterons from their hadronic annihilation channels. Since
the dark matter mass reach of the GAPS experiment can be well above 100 GeV, we
find that antideuterons can be a good indirect detection channel for a variety
of thermal relic electroweak scale dark matter candidates, even when the rate
for direct detection is highly suppressed.
