We describe a number of strategies for minimizing and calculating accurately
the statistical uncertainty in quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We investigate
the impact of the sampling algorithm on the efficiency of the variational Monte
Carlo method. Our finding that a relative time-step ratio of 1:4 is optimal in
DMC is in agreement with the result of [J. Vrbik and S.M.Rothstein, Intern. J.
Quantum Chem. 29, 461-468 (1986)]. Finally, we discuss the removal of serial
correlation from data sets by reblocking, setting out criteria for the choice
of block length and quantifying the effects of the uncertainty in the estimated
correlation length.
