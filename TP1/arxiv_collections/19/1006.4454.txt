Micro and nano structures scatter light and amplify local electric fields
very effectively. Energy incident as intense ultrashort laser pulses can be
converted to x-rays and hot electrons more efficiently with a substrate that
suitably modifies the local fields. Here we demonstrate that coating a plain
glass surface with a few micron thick layer of an ubiquitous microbe, {\it
Escherichia coli}, catapults the brightness of hard x-ray bremsstrahlung
emission (up to 300 keV) by more than two orders of magnitude at an incident
laser intensity of 10$^{16}$ W cm$^{-2}$. This increased yield is attributed to
the local enhancement of electric fields around individual {\it E. coli} cells
and is reproduced by detailed particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. This
combination of laser plasmas and biological targets can lead to turnkey,
multi-kilohertz and environmentally safe sources of hard x-rays.
