In quantum field theory, elemental particles are assumed to be point
particles. As a result, the loop integrals are divergent in many cases.
Regularization and renormalization are necessary in order to get the physical
finite results from the infinite, divergent loop integrations. We propose new
quantization conditions for non-point particles. With this solid quantization,
divergence could be treated systematically. This method is useful for effective
field theory which is on hadron degrees of freedom. The elemental particles
could also be non-point ones. They can be studied in this approach as well.
