The fate of heavy quarkonia states has been investigated in QCD at high
temperature when the plasma has a small momentum space anisotropy within a
quasi-particle model. A real time static potential has been obtained from a
Hard thermal loop expression for the gluon self-energy, by employing the
quasi-parton equilibrium distribution functions extracted from hot QCD
equations of state of $O(g^5)$ and $O(g^6\ln(1/g))$. Employing the potential,
quarkonia melting has been studied. It is found that the equations of state and
the momentum anisotropy cause significant modifications in the screening
properties of the plasma.
