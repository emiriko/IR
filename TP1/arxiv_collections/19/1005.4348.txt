We study various types of multipartite states lying near the
quantum-classical boundary. The class of so-called classical states are
precisely those in which each party can perform a projective measurement to
identify a locally held state without disturbing the global state, a task known
as non-disruptive local state identification (NDLID). We introduce a new class
of states called generalized-classical states which allow for NDLID when the
most general quantum measurements are permitted. A simple analytic method as
well as a physical criterion are presented for detecting whether a multipartite
state is classical. To decide whether a state is generalized-classical, we
provide a semi-definite programming algorithm which can be adapted for use in
other unrelated contexts such as signal processing.
