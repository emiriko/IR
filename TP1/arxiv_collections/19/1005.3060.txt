We use the Science Demonstration Phase data of the Herschel Virgo Cluster
Survey to search for dust emission of early-type dwarf galaxies in the central
regions of the Virgo Cluster as an alternative way of identifying the
interstellar medium.We present the first possible far-infrared detection of
cluster early-type dwarf galaxies: VCC781 and VCC951 are detected at the 10
sigma level in the SPIRE 250 micron image. Both detected galaxies have dust
masses of the order of 10^5 Msun and average dust temperatures ~20K. The
detection rate (less than 1%) is quite high compared to the 1.7% detection rate
for Hi emission, considering that dwarfs in the central regions are more Hi
deficient. We conclude that the removal of interstellar dust from dwarf
galaxies resulting from ram pressure stripping, harassment, or tidal effects
must be as efficient as the removal of interstellar gas.
