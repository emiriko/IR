We identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 GHz, detected in first
HIFI spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret its
astrophysical origin. The characteristic hyperfine pattern of the H2O+
ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energy
transitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as H2O+ absorption
against the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocity
profile of the absorbing gas. By comparing this velocity profile with velocity
profiles of other tracers in the DR21 star-forming region, we constrain the
frequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. In DR21, the
velocity distribution of H2O+ matches that of the [CII] line at 158\mu\m and of
OH cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfaces
facing the HII-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. Diffuse
foreground gas dominates the absorption towards Sgr B2. The integrated
intensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the H2O+
column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in NGC 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in DR21, and 1.1e15
cm^-2 in Sgr B2.
