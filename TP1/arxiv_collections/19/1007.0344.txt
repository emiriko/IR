We have performed white-light reflectivity measurements on GaAs/AlAs
micropillar cavities with diameters ranging from 1 {\mu}m up to 20 {\mu}m. We
are able to resolve the spatial field distribution of each cavity mode in real
space by scanning a small-sized beam across the top facet of each micropillar.
We spectrally resolve distinct transverse optical cavity modes in reflectivity.
Using this procedure we can selectively address a single mode in the multimode
micropillar cavity. Calculations for the coupling efficiency of a
small-diameter beam to each mode are in very good agreement with our
reflectivity measurements.
