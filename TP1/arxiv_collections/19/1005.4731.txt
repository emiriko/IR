In the framework of a semi-classical expansion for quantum chromodynamics in
the instanton liquid background, the correlation function of the $0^{++}$
scalar glueball current is given. Besides the pure classical and quantum
contributions, the contributions arising from the interactions between the
classical instanton fields and quantum gluons are taken into account as well.
Instead of the usual zero-width approximation for the resonance, the
Brite-Wigner form for the spectral function of the finite-width resonance is
adopted. The family of the Laplace sum rules for the scalar glueball in quantum
chromodynamics with and without light quarks are studed. A consistency between
the subtracted and unsubtracted sum rules are very well justified, and the
values of the mass, decay width, and the coupling to the corresponding current
for the $0^{++}$ resonance in which the glueball fraction is dominant, are
obtained.
