The theory of gravity has undergone somewhat of a revolution lately. Gravity
is no longer a fundamental force it seems, but rather an effect of holographic
entropy. Building on the works by Jacobsson, Padmanabhan and Verlinde we review
the concept of Newtonian gravity as an entropic force and discuss a possible
general action approach to Verlinde's theory. We also discuss some open
problems and future prospects of Verlinde's approach.
