A 20 band sp3d5s* spin-orbit-coupled, semi-empirical, atomistic tight-binding
(TB) model is used with a semi-classical, ballistic, field-effect-transistor
(FET) model, to theoretically examine the bandstructure carrier velocity and
ballistic current in silicon nanowire (NW) transistors. Infinitely long,
uniform, cylindrical and rectangular NWs, of cross sectional diameters/sides
ranging from 3nm to 12nm are considered. For a comprehensive analysis, n-type
and p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (NMOS and PMOS) NWs in [100], [110] and
[111] transport orientations are examined. In general, physical cross section
reduction increases velocities, either by lifting the heavy mass valleys, or
significantly changing the curvature of the bands. The carrier velocities of
PMOS [110] and [111] NWs are a strong function of diameter, with the narrower
D=3nm wires having twice the velocities of the D=12nm NWs. The velocity in the
rest of the NW categories shows only minor diameter dependence. This behavior
is explained through features in the electronic structure of the silicon host
material. The ballistic current, on the other hand, shows the least sensitivity
with cross section in the cases where the velocity has large variations. Since
the carrier velocity is a measure of the effective mass and reflects on the
channel mobility, these results can provide insight into the design of NW
devices with enhanced performance and performance tolerant to structure
geometry variations. In the case of ballistic transport in high performance
devices, the [110] NWs are the ones with both high NMOS and PMOS performance,
as well as low on-current variations with cross section geometry variations.
