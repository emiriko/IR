We give a topological classification of the evolution of entanglement,
particularly the different ways the entanglement can disappear. Four categories
exhaust all possibilities given the initial quantum state is entangled and the
final one is not. Exponential decay of entanglement, entanglement sudden death
and sudden birth can all be understood and visualized in the associated
geometrical picture - the polarization vector representation. The entanglement
evolution categories of any model are determined by the topology of the state
space, the limiting state and the memory effect of the environment. Transitions
between these types of behaviors as a function of physical parameters are also
possible. These transitions are thus of topological nature. We illustrate the
general concepts with a visualizable model.
