This article is an attempt to provide a link between the quantum
nonequilibrium dynamics of cold gases and fifty years of progress in the
lowdimensional quantum chaos. We identify two atomic systems lying on the
interface: two interacting atoms in a harmonic multimode waveguide and an
interacting two-component Bose-Bose mixture in a double-well potential. In
particular, we study the level spacing distribution, the wavefunction
statistics, the eigenstate thermalization, and the ability to thermalize in a
relaxation process as such.
