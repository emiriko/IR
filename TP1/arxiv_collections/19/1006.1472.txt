We study the Lie algebras of the covariant representations transforming the
matter fields under the de Sitter isometries. We point out that the Casimir
operators of these representations can be written in closed forms and we deduce
how their eigenvalues depend on the field's rest energy and spin. For the
scalar, vector and Dirac fields, which have well-defined field equations, we
express these eigenvalues in terms of mass and spin obtaining thus the
principal invariants of the theory of free fields on the de Sitter spacetime.
We show that in the flat limit we recover the corresponding invariants of the
Wigner irreducible representations of the Poincare group.
