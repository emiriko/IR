The article is a tribute to my old mentor, collaborator and friend Murray
Gell-Mann. In it I describe work by Pierre Ramond, Sung-Soo Kim and myself
where we describe the N = 8 Supergravity in the light-cone formalism. We show
how the Cremmer-Julia E7(7) non-linear symmetry is implemented and how the full
supermultiplet is a representation of the E7(7) symmetry. I also show how the
E7(7) symmetry is a key to understand the higher order couplings in the theory
and is very useful when we discuss possible counterterms for this theory.
