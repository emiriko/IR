In a setup where two ferromagnetic electrodes are attached to a
superconductor, Andreev bound states are induced at both
ferromagnet/superconductor (FM/SC) interfaces. We study how these states
propagate through the SC and interact with each other. As a result of this
interaction, the energetic positions of the Andreev states are not anymore
determined solely by the magnetic properties of a single interface, but also
depend on the interface distance and the relative magnetization orientation of
the FM contacts. We discuss how these bound states show up as distinct peaks in
the nonlocal conductance signal, and lead to marked asymmetries with respect to
the applied voltage. We relate our results to nonlocal crossed Andreev and
elastic co-tunneling processes.
