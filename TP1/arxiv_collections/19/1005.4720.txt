A simple formula to read out the weak value from the wave function of the
measuring device after the postselection with the initial Gaussian profile is
proposed. We apply this formula for the weak value to the classical experiment
of the realization of the weak measurement by the optical polarization and
obtain the weak value for any pre- and post-selections. This formula
automatically includes the interference effect which is necessary to yields the
weak value as an outcome of the weak measurement.
