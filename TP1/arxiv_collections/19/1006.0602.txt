We have investigated the magnetic properties of transition metal oxide
superlattices with broken inversion symmetry composed of three different
antiferromagnetic insulators, [NdMnO3/SrMnO3/LaMnO3]. In the superlattices
studied here, we identify the emergence of a relaxor, glassy-like behavior
below spin glass temperature, T=36K. Our results offer the possibility to study
and utilize magnetically metastable devices confined in nano-scale interfaces.
