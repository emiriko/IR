In general, however, IT will empower students to have greater control over
the learning process, with all the benefits associated with active learning and
personal responsibility. Not only will students decide when to learn and how to
learn, increasingly they will also decide what to learn and how that learning
is to be certified. Traditionally, higher education institutions have combined
several functions in their faculty. Faculty are architects as they design
learning programs; navigators as they help advise students in their course of
study; instructors when they lecture; mentors when they help students form a
sense of connectedness to the world; and evaluators and certifiers as they
decide to grant students grades or degrees.
