We report electronic transport on silicon double and triple dots created with
the optimized number of two gates. Using silicon nitride spacers two dots in
series are created below two top gates overlapping a silicon nanowire. Coupling
between dots is controlled by gate voltages. A third dot is created either by
combined action of gate voltages or local doping depending on the spacers
length. The main characteristics of the triple dot stability diagram are
quantitatively fitted.
