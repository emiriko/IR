We generalize the colored Alexander invariant of knots to an invariant of
graphs, and we construct a face model for this invariant by using the
corresponding 6j-symbol, which comes from the non-integral representations of
the quantum group U_q(sl_2). We call it the SL(2, C) quantum 6j-symbol, and
show its relation to the hyperbolic volume of a truncated tetrahedron.
