We present our approach for deploying and managing distributed
component-based applications. A Desired State Description (DSD), written in a
high-level declarative language, specifies requirements for a distributed
application. Our infrastructure accepts a DSD as input, and from it
automatically configures and deploys the distributed application. Subsequent
violations of the original requirements are detected and, where possible,
automatically rectified by reconfiguration and redeployment of the necessary
application components. A constraint solving tool is used to plan deployments
that meet the application requirements.
