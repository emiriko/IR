The local dynamical features of a PEO melt studied by MD simulations are
compared to two model chain systems, namely the well-known Rouse model as well
as the semiflexible chain model (SFCM) that additionally incorporates chain
stiffness. Apart from the analysis of rather general quantities such as the
mean square displacement (MSD), we present a new statistical method to extract
the local bead mobility from the simulation data on the basis of the Langevin
equation, thus providing a complementary approach to the classical Rouse-mode
analysis. This allows us to check the validity of the Langevin equation and, as
a consequence, the Rouse model. Moreover, the new method has a broad range of
applications for the analysis of the dynamics of more complex polymeric systems
like comb-branched polymers or polymer blends.
