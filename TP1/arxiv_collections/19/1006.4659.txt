We present a multiscale integrator for Hamiltonian systems with slowly
varying quadratic stiff potentials that uses coarse timesteps (analogous to
what the impulse method uses for constant quadratic stiff potentials). This
method is based on the highly-non-trivial introduction of two efficient
symplectic schemes for exponentiations of matrices that only require O(n)
matrix multiplications operations at each coarse time step for a preset small
number n. The proposed integrator is shown to be (i) uniformly convergent on
positions; (ii) symplectic in both slow and fast variables; (iii) well adapted
to high dimensional systems. Our framework also provides a general method for
iteratively exponentiating a slowly varying sequence of (possibly high
dimensional) matrices in an efficient way.
