We investigate the behavior of an infinite array of (reverse) von K'arm'an
streets. Our primary motivation is to model the wake dynamics in large fish
schools. We ignore the fish and focus on the dynamic interaction of multiple
wakes where each wake is modeled as a reverse von K'arm'an street. There exist
configurations where the infinite array of vortex streets is in relative
equilibrium, that is, the streets move together with the same translational
velocity. We examine the topology of the streamline patterns in a frame moving
with the same translational velocity as the streets which lends insight into
fluid transport through the mid-wake region. Fluid is advected along different
paths depending on the distance separating two adjacent streets. Generally,
when the distance between the streets is large enough, each street behaves as a
single von K'arm'an street and fluid moves globally between two adjacent
streets. When the streets get closer to each other, the number of streets that
enter into partnership in transporting fluid among themselves increases. This
observation motivates a bifurcation analysis which links the distance between
streets to the maximum number of streets transporting fluid among themselves.
We also show that for short times, the analysis of streamline topologies for
the infinite arrays of streets can be expected to set the pattern for the more
realistic case of a finite array of truncated streets, which is not in an
equilibrium state and its dynamic evolution eventually destroys the exact
topological patterns identified in the infinite array case. The problem of
fluid transport between adjacent streets may be relevant for understanding the
transport of oxygen and nutrients to inner fish in large schools as well as
understanding flow barriers to passive locomotion.
