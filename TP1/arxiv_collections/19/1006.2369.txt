The Gowdy cosmologies are vacuum solutions to the Einstein equations which
possess two space-like Killing vectors and whose spatial sections are compact.
We consider the simplest of these cosmological models: the case where the
spatial topology is that of a three-torus and the gravitational waves are
linearly polarized. The subset of homogeneous solutions to this Gowdy model are
vacuum Bianchi I spacetimes with a three-torus topology. We deepen the analysis
of the loop quantization of these Bianchi I universes adopting the improved
dynamics scheme put forward recently by Ashtekar and Wilson-Ewing. Then, we
revisit the hybrid quantization of the Gowdy $T^3$ cosmologies by combining
this loop quantum cosmology description with a Fock quantization of the
inhomogeneities over the homogeneous Bianchi I background. We show that, in
vacuo, the Hamiltonian constraint of both the Bianchi I and the Gowdy models
can be regarded as an evolution equation with respect to the volume of the
Bianchi I universe. This evolution variable turns out to be discrete, with a
strictly positive minimum. Furthermore, we argue that this evolution is
well-defined inasmuch as the associated initial value problem is well posed:
physical solutions are completely determined by the data on an initial section
of constant Bianchi I volume. This fact allows us to carry out to completion
the quantization of these two cosmological models.
