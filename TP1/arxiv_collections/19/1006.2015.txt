A steradian of the southern sky has been imaged at 151.5 MHz using the
Mauritius Radio Telescope (MRT). These images show systematics in positional
errors of sources when compared to source positions in the Molonglo Reference
Catalogue (MRC). We have applied two-dimensional homography to correct for
systematic positional errors in the image domain and thereby avoid
re-processing the visibility data. Positions of bright (above 15-{\sigma})
point sources, common to MRT catalogue and MRC, are used to set up an
over-determined system to solve for the homography matrix. After correction the
errors are found to be within 10% of the beamwidth for these bright sources and
the systematics are eliminated from the images. This technique will be of
relevance to the new generation radio telescopes where, owing to huge data
rates, only images after a certain integration would be recorded as opposed to
raw visibilities. It is also interesting to note how our investigations cued to
possible errors in the array geometry. The analysis of positional errors of
sources showed that MRT images are stretched in declination by ~1 part in 1000.
This translates to a compression of the baseline scale in the visibility
domain. The array geometry was re-estimated using the astrometry principle. The
estimates show an error of ~1 mm/m, which results in an error of about half a
wavelength at 150 MHz for a 1 km north-south baseline. The estimates also
indicate that the east-west arm is inclined by an angle of ~40 arcsec to the
true east-west direction.
