We introduce a new OpenMath content dictionary, named tensor1, containing
symbols for the expression of tensor formulas. These symbols support the
expression of non-Cartesian coordinates and invariant, multilinear expressions
in the context of coordinate transformations. While current OpenMath symbols
support the expression of linear algebra formulas using matrices and vectors,
we find that there is an underlying assumption of Cartesian, or standard,
coordinates that makes the expression of general tensor formulas difficult, if
not impossible. In introducing these new OpenMath symbols for the expression of
tensor formulas, we attempt to maintain, as much as possible, consistency with
prior OpenMath symbol definitions for linear algebra.
