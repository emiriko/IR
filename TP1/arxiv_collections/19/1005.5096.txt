We present results from extensive 3-d molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of
phase separation kinetics in fluids. A coarse-graining procedure is used to
obtain state-of-the-art MD results. We observe an extended period of temporally
linear growth in the viscous hydrodynamic regime. The morphological similarity
of coarsening in fluids and solids is also quantified. The velocity field is
characterized by the presence of monopole-like defects, which yield a
generalized Porod tail in the corresponding structure factor.
