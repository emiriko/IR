We show that quantum-interference phenomena can be realized for the
dissipative nonlinear systems exhibiting hysteresis-cycle behavior and quantum
chaos. Such results are obtained for a driven dissipative nonlinear oscillator
with time-dependent parameters and take place for the regimes of long time
intervals exceeding dissipation time and for macroscopic levels of oscillatory
excitation numbers. Two schemas of time modulation: (i) periodic variation of
the strength of the {\chi}(3) nonlinearity; (ii) periodic modulation of the
amplitude of the driving force, are considered. These effects are obtained
within the framework of phase-space quantum distributions. It is demonstrated
that the Wigner functions of oscillatory mode in both bistable and chaotic
regimes acquire negative values and interference patterns in parts of
phase-space due to appropriately time-modulation of the oscillatory nonlinear
dynamics. It is also shown that the time-modulation of the oscillatory
parameters essentially improves the degree of sub-Poissonian statistics of
excitation numbers.
