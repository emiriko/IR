We prove that a single photon with quantum data encoded in its orbital
angular momentum can be manipulated with simple optical elements to provide any
desired quantum computation. We will show how to build any quantum unitary
operator using beamsplitters, phase shifters, holograms and an extraction gate
based on quantum interrogation. The advantages and challenges of these approach
are then discussed, in particular the problem of the readout of the results.
