Entanglement sudden death in spatially separated two-mode Gaussian states
coupled to local thermal and squeezed thermal baths is studied by mapping the
problem to that of the quantum-to-classical transition. Using Simon's criterion
concerning the characterisation of classicality in Gaussian states, the time to
ESD is calculated by analysing the covariance matrices of the system. The
results for the two-mode system at T=0 and T>0 for the two types of bath states
are generalised to $n$-modes, and are shown to be similar in nature to the
results for the general discrete $n$-qubit system.
