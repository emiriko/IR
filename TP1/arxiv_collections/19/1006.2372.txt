We show that, despite appearances, a theoretical approach to neutrino
oscillation in which the neutrino and its interaction partners are entangled
yields the standard result for the neutrino oscillation wavelength. We also
shed some light on the question of why plane-wave approaches to the neutrino
oscillation problem can yield the correct oscillation wavelength even though
they do not explicitly account for the localization of the neutrino source and
the detector.
