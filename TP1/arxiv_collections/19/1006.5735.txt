The Mid Infra Red Instrument (MIRI) is one of the four instruments onboard
the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), providing imaging, coronagraphy and
spectroscopy over the 5-28 microns band. To verify the optical performance of
the instrument, extensive tests were performed at CEA on the flight model (FM)
of the Mid-InfraRed IMager (MIRIM) at cryogenic temperatures and in the
infrared. This paper reports on the point spread function (PSF) measurements at
5.6 microns, the shortest operating wavelength for imaging. At 5.6 microns the
PSF is not Nyquist-sampled, so we use am original technique that combines a
microscanning measurement strategy with a deconvolution algorithm to obtain an
over-resolved MIRIM PSF. The microscanning consists in a sub-pixel scan of a
point source on the focal plane. A data inversion method is used to reconstruct
PSF images that are over-resolved by a factor of 7 compared to the native
resolution of MIRI. We show that the FWHM of the high-resolution PSFs were
5-10% wider than that obtained with Zemax simulations. The main cause was
identified as an out-of-specification tilt of the M4 mirror. After correction,
two additional test campaigns were carried out, and we show that the shape of
the PSF is conform to expectations. The FWHM of the PSFs are 0.18-0.20 arcsec,
in agreement with simulations. 56.1-59.2% of the total encircled energy
(normalized to a 5 arcsec radius) is contained within the first dark Airy ring,
over the whole field of view. At longer wavelengths (7.7-25.5 microns), this
percentage is 57-68%. MIRIM is thus compliant with the optical quality
requirements. This characterization of the MIRIM PSF, as well as the
deconvolution method presented here, are of particular importance, not only for
the verification of the optical quality and the MIRI calibration, but also for
scientific applications.
