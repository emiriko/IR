We study the stellar population far into the halo of one of the two brightest
galaxies in the Coma cluster, NGC 4889, based on deep medium resolution
spectroscopy with FOCAS at the Subaru 8.2m telescope. We fit single stellar
population models to the measured line-strength (Lick) indices (Hbeta, Mgb,
[MgFe]' and <Fe>). Combining with literature data, we construct radial profiles
of metallicity, [alpha/Fe] element abundance ratio and age for NGC 4889, from
the center out to ~60 kpc (~4Re). We find evidence for different chemical and
star formation histories for stars inside and outside 1.2Re = 18 kpc radius.
The inner regions are characterized by a steep [Z/H] gradient and high
[alpha/Fe] at ~2.5 times solar value. In the halo, between 18 and 60 kpc, the
[Z/H] is near-solar with a shallow gradient, while [alpha/Fe] shows a strong
negative gradient, reaching solar values at ~60 kpc. We interpret these data in
terms of different formation histories for both components. The data for the
inner galaxy are consistent with a rapid, quasi-monolithic, dissipative merger
origin at early redshifts, followed by one or at most a few dry mergers. Those
for the halo argue for later accretion of stars from old systems with more
extended star formation histories. The half-light radius of the inner component
alone is estimated as ~6 kpc, suggesting a significantly smaller size of this
galaxy in the past. This may be the local stellar population signature of the
size evolution found for early-type galaxies from high-redshift observations.
