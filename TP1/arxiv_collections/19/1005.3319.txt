A previous paper (arXiv:0902.2773, henceforth referred to as I) considered a
general class of problems involving the evolution of large systems of globally
coupled phase oscillators. It was shown there that, in an appropriate sense,
the solutions to these problems are time asymptotically attracted toward a
reduced manifold of system states (denoted M). This result has considerable
utility in the analysis of these systems, as has been amply demonstrated in
recent papers. In this note, we show that the analysis of I can be modified in
a simple way that establishes significant extensions of the range of validity
of our previous result. In particular, we generalize I in the following ways:
(1) attraction to M is now shown for a very general class of oscillator
frequency distribution functions g(\omega), and (2) a previous restriction on
the allowed class of initial conditions is now substantially relaxed.
