In this paper we introduce a framework for computing upper bounds yet
accurate WCET for hardware platforms with caches and pipelines. The methodology
we propose consists of 3 steps: 1) given a program to analyse, compute an
equivalent (WCET-wise) abstract program; 2) build a timed game by composing
this abstract program with a network of timed automata modeling the
architecture; and 3) compute the WCET as the optimal time to reach a winning
state in this game. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework on
standard benchmarks for an ARM9 processor with instruction and data caches, and
compute the WCET with UPPAAL-TiGA. We also show that this framework can easily
be extended to take into account dynamic changes in the speed of the processor
during program execution. %
