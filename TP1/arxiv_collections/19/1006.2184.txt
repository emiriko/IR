We theoretically study the Shapiro steps in a hetero Josephson junction made
of a single-gap superconductor and a two-gap one. We find that an anomalous DC
Josephson current is induced by tuning the frequency of an applied microwave to
the Josephson-Leggett mode frequency, which creates an extra step structure in
the $I$-$V$ characteristics besides the conventional Shapiro steps. The step
heights at the resonance voltages exhibit an alternate structure of a large and
small value reflecting the gap symmetry of the two-gap superconductor. In the
$\pm s-wave case in which the two gaps have opposite signs in the two-gap
superconductor the steps with odd index are enhanced, whereas in the s-wave
case the ones with even index have larger values. The existence of the
fractional Shapiro steps is also predicted.
