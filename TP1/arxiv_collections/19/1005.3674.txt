The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured the
invariant differential cross section for production of K^0_S , \omega, \eta
prime, and \phi mesons in p + p collisions at = 200 GeV. Measurements \omega
and \phi production in different decay channels give consistent results. New
results for the \phi are in agreement with previously published data and extend
the measured pT coverage. The spectral shapes of all hadron transverse momentum
distributions measured by PHENIX are well described by a Tsallis distribution
functional form with only two parameters, n and T, determining the high-pT and
characterizing the low-pT regions of the spectra, respectively. The values of
these parameters are very similar for all analyzed meson spectra, but with a
lower parameter T extracted for protons. The integrated invariant cross
sections calculated from the fitted distributions are found to be consistent
with existing measurements and with statistical model predictions.
