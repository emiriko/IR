We consider the inflationary scenario with non-minimal coupling in 4D Jordan
frame supergravity. We find that there occurs a tachyonic instability along the
direction of the accompanying non-inflaton field in generic Jordan frame
supergravity models. We propose a higher order correction to the Jordan frame
function for solving the tachyonic mass problem and show that the necessary
correction can be naturally generated by the heavy thresholds without spoiling
the slow-roll conditions. We discuss the implication of the result on the Higgs
inflation in NMSSM.
