Signatures of the non-Abelian statistics of quasi-particles in the $\nu=5/2$
quantum Hall state are predicted to be present in the current-voltage
characteristics of tunneling through one or two quantum Hall puddles of Landau
filling $\nu_a$ embedded in a bulk of filling $\nu_b$ with
$(\nu_a,\nu_b)=(2,5/2)$ and $(\nu_a,\nu_b)=(5/2,2)$.
