We show that only considering the largest cluster suffices to obtain a
first-order percolation transition. As opposed to previous realizations of
explosive percolation our models obtain Gaussian cluster distributions and
compact clusters as one would expect at first-order transitions. We also
discover that the cluster perimeters are fractal at the transition point,
yielding a fractal dimension of $1.23\pm0.03$, close to that of watersheds.
