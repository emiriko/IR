We quickly review labelled Markov processes (LMP) and provide a
counterexample showing that in general measurable spaces, event bisimilarity
and state bisimilarity differ in LMP. This shows that the logic in Desharnais
[*] does not characterize state bisimulation in non-analytic measurable spaces.
Furthermore we show that, under current foundations of Mathematics, such
logical characterization is unprovable for spaces that are projections of a
coanalytic set. Underlying this construction there is a proof that stationary
Markov processes over general measurable spaces do not have semi-pullbacks.
