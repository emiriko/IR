Recent evidence for a CP violating asymmetry in the semileptonic decays of
B_s mesons cannot be accommodated within the Standard Model. Such an asymmetry
can be explained by new physics contributions to Delta B=2 components of either
the mass matrix or the decay matrix. We show that mixing with a hidden
pseudoscalar meson with a mass around 5 GeV can result in a new CP violating
contribution to the mixing and can resolve several anomalies in this system
including the width difference, the average width and the charge asymmetry. We
also discuss the effects of the hidden meson on other b physics observables,
and present viable decay modes for the hidden meson. We make predictions for
new decay channels of B hadrons, which can be tested at the Tevatron, the LHC
and B-factories.
