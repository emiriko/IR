Changes in technology have resulted in new ways for bankers to deliver their
services to costumers. Electronic banking systems in various forms are the
evidence of such advancement. However, information security threats also
evolving along this trend. This paper proposes the application of Analytic
Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology to guide decision makers in banking
industries to deal with information security policy. The model is structured
according aspects of information security policy in conjunction with
information security elements. We found that cultural aspect is valued on the
top priority among other security aspects, while confidentiality is considered
as the most important factor in terms of information security elements.
