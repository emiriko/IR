Understanding nuclear effects in parton distribution functions (PDF) is an
essential component needed to determine the strange and anti-strange quark
contributions in the proton. In addition Nuclear Parton Distribution Functions
(NPDF) are critically important for any collider experiment with nuclei (e.g.
RHIC, ALICE). Here two next-to-leading order chi^2-analyses of NPDF are
presented. The first uses neutral current charged-lepton Deeply Inelastic
Scattering (DIS) and Drell-Yan data for several nuclear targets and the second
uses neutrino-nucleon DIS data. We compare the nuclear corrections factors
(F_2^Fe/F_2^D) for the charged-lepton data with other results from the
literature. In particular, we compare and contrast fits based upon the
charged-lepton DIS data with those using neutrino-nucleon DIS data.
