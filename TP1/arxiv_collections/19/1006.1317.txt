We study the evolution of the entanglement of noninteracting qubits coupled
to reservoirs under monitoring of the reservoirs by means of continuous
measurements. We calculate the average of the concurrence of the qubits
wavefunction over all quantum trajectories. For two qubits coupled to
independent baths subjected to local measurements, this average decays
exponentially with a rate depending on the measurement scheme only. This
contrasts with the known disappearance of entanglement after a finite time for
the density matrix in the absence of measurements. For two qubits coupled to a
common bath, the mean concurrence can vanish at discrete times. Our analysis
applies to arbitrary quantum jump or quantum state diffusion dynamics in the
Markov limit. We discuss the best measurement schemes to protect entanglement
in specific examples.
