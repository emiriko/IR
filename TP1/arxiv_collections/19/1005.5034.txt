The $\beta$-asymmetry parameter $\widetilde{A}$ for the Gamow-Teller decay of
$^{60}$Co was measured by polarizing the radioactive nuclei with the brute
force low-temperature nuclear-orientation method. The $^{60}$Co activity was
cooled down to milliKelvin temperatures in a $^3$He-$^4$He dilution
refrigerator in an external 13 T magnetic field. The $\beta$ particles were
observed by a 500 ${\mu}m$ thick Si PIN diode operating at a temperature of
about 10 K in a magnetic field of 0.6 T. Extensive GEANT4 Monte-Carlo
simulations were performed to gain control over the systematic effects. Our
result, $\widetilde{A} = -1.014(12)_{stat}(16)_{syst}$, is in agreement with
the Standard-Model value of $-0.987(9)$, which includes recoil-order
corrections that were addressed for the first time for this isotope. Further,
it enables limits to be placed on possible tensor-type charged weak currents as
well as other physics beyond the Standard Model.
