3G, processor of 2G services, is a family of standards for mobile
telecommunications defined by the International Telecommunication Union [1]. 3G
services include wide-area wireless voice telephone, video calls, and wireless
data, all in a mobile environment. It allows simultaneous use of speech and
data services and higher data rates.3G is defined to facilitate growth,
increased bandwidth and support more diverse applications. The focus of this
study is to examine the factors affecting the adoption of 3G services among
Indian people. The study adopts the revised Technology Acceptance Model by
adding five antecedents-perceived risks, cost of adoption, perceived service
quality, subjective norms, and perceived lack of knowledge. Data have collected
from more than 400 school/college/Institution students & employees of various
Government/Private sectors using interviews & various convenience sampling
procedures and analyzed using MS excel and MATLAB. Result shows that perceived
usefulness has the most significant influence on attitude towards using 3G
services, which is consistent with prior studies. Of the five antecedents,
perceived risk and cost of adoption are found to be significantly influencing
attitude towards use. The outcome of this study would be beneficial to private
and public telecommunication organizations, various service providers, business
community, banking services and people of India. Research findings and
suggestions for future research are also discussed.
