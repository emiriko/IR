After a brief review of the electroweak radiative corrections to gauge-boson
self-energies, otherwise known as the direct and oblique corrections, a tool
for calculation of the oblique parameters is presented. This tool, named
OPUCEM, brings together formulas from multiple physics models and provides an
error-checking machinery to improve reliability of numerical results. It also
sets a novel example for an "open-formula" concept, which is an attempt to
improve the reliability and reproducibility of computations in scientific
publications by encouraging the authors to open-source their numerical
calculation programs. Finally, we demonstrate the use of OPUCEM in two detailed
case studies related to the fourth Standard Model family. The first is a
generic fourth family study to find relations between the parameters compatible
with the EW precision data and the second is the particular study of the Flavor
Democracy predictions for both Dirac and Majorana-type neutrinos.
