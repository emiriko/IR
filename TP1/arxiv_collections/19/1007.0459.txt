Eulerian quasisymmetric functions were introduced by Shareshian and Wachs in
order to obtain a q-analog of Euler's exponential generating function formula
for the Eulerian numbers. They are defined via the symmetric group, and
applying the stable and nonstable principal specializations yields formulas for
joint distributions of permutation statistics. We consider the wreath product
of the cyclic group with the symmetric group, also known as the group of
colored permutations. We use this group to introduce colored Eulerian
quasisymmetric functions, which are a generalization of Eulerian quasisymmetric
functions. We derive a formula for the generating function of these colored
Eulerian quasisymmetric functions, which reduces to a formula of Shareshian and
Wachs for the Eulerian quasisymmetric functions. We show that applying the
stable and nonstable principal specializations yields formulas for joint
distributions of colored permutation statistics, which generalize the
Shareshian-Wachs q-analog of Euler's formula, formulas of Foata and Han, and a
formula of Chow and Gessel.
