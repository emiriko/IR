In this review, recent progress in theoretical models for blazar emission
will be summarized. The salient features of both leptonic and lepto-hadronic
approaches to modeling blazar spectral energy distributions will be reviewed. I
will present sample modeling results of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
different types of blazars along the blazar sequence, including Fermi
high-energy gamma-ray data, using both types of models. Special emphasis will
be placed on the implications of the recent very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray
detections of non-traditional VHE gamma-ray blazars, including intermediate and
low-frequency-peaked BL Lac objects and even flat-spectrum radio quasars. Due
to the featureless optical spectra of BL Lac objects, the redshifts of several
BL Lacs remain unknown. I will briefly discuss possible constraints on their
redshift using spectral modeling of their SED including Fermi + ground-based
VHE gamma-ray data. It will be shown that in some cases, spectral modeling with
time-independent single-zone models alone is not sufficient to constrain
models, as both leptonic and lepto-hadronic models are able to provide
acceptable fits to the overall SED. Subsequently, recent developments of
time-dependent and inhomogeneous blazar models will be discussed, including
detailed numerical simulations as well as a semi-analytical approach to the
time-dependent radiation signatures of shock-in-jet models.
