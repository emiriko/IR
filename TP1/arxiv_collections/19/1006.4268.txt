We consider quantum pumping of Dirac fermions in a monolayer of graphene in
the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field in the central pumping region.
The two external pump parameters are electrical voltages applied to the
graphene sheet on either side of the pumping region. We analyze this pump
within scattering matrix formalism and calculate both pumped charge and spin
currents. The predicted charge currents are of the order of 1000 nA, which is
readily observable using current technology.
