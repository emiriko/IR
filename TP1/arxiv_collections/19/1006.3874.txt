Spider is a balloon-borne array of six telescopes that will observe the
Cosmic Microwave Background. The 2624 antenna-coupled bolometers in the
instrument will make a polarization map of the CMB with approximately one-half
degree resolution at 145 GHz. Polarization modulation is achieved via a
cryogenic sapphire half-wave plate (HWP) skyward of the primary optic. We have
measured millimeter-wave transmission spectra of the sapphire at room and
cryogenic temperatures. The spectra are consistent with our physical optics
model, and the data gives excellent measurements of the indices of A-cut
sapphire. We have also taken preliminary spectra of the integrated HWP, optical
system, and detectors in the prototype Spider receiver. We calculate the
variation in response of the HWP between observing the CMB and foreground
spectra, and estimate that it should not limit the Spider constraints on
inflation.
