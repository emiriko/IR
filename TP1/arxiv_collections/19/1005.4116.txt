In a well-stirred system undergoing chemical reactions, fluctuations in the
reaction propensities are approximately captured by the corresponding chemical
Langevin equation. Within this context, we discuss in this work how the Kramers
escape theory can be used to predict rare events in chemical reactions. As an
example, we apply our approach to a recently proposed model on cell
proliferation with relevance to skin cancer [P.B. Warren, Phys. Rev. E {\bf
80}, 030903 (2009)]. In particular, we provide an analytical explanation for
the form of the exponential exponent observed in the onset rate of uncontrolled
cell proliferation.
