We implement a binary collision approximation to study pulse propagation in a
chain of o-rings. In particular, we arrive at analytic results from which the
pulse velocity is obtained by simple quadrature. The predicted pulse velocity
is compared to the velocity obtained from the far more resource-intensive
numerical integration of the equations of motion. We study chains without
precompression, chains precompressed by a constant force at the chain ends
(constant precompression), and chains precompressed by gravity (variable
precompression). The application of the binary collision approximation to
precompressed chains provides an important generalization of a successful
theory that had up to this point only been implemented to chains without
precompression, that is, to chains in a sonic vacuum.
