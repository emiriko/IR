Rare semileptonic decays of B and B_c mesons are investigated in the
framework of the QCD-motivated relativistic quark model based on the
quasipotential approach. Form factors parametrizing the matrix elements of the
weak transitions between corresponding meson states are calculated with the
complete account of the relativistic effects including contributions of
intermediate negative energy states and relativistic transformations of the
meson wave functions. The momentum transfer dependence of the form factors is
reliably determined in the whole accessible kinematical range. On this basis
the total and differential branching fractions of the B\to
K^{(*)}l^+l^-(\nu\bar\nu) and B_c\to D_s^{(*)}l^+l^-(\nu\bar\nu), B_c\to
D^{(*)}l^+l^-(\nu\bar\nu) decays as well as the longitudinal polarization
fractions F_L of the final vector meson and the muon forward-backward
asymmetries A_{FB} are calculated. Good agreement of the obtained results with
the recent detailed experimental data on the B\to K^{(*)}\mu^+\mu^- decays from
Belle and CDF is found. Predictions for the rare semileptonic decays of the B_c
mesons are given.
