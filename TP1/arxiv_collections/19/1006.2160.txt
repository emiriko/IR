We briefly report on zero-temperature photoassociation of a Bose-Einstein
condensate, focusing on the many-body rate limit for atom-molecule conversion.
An upgraded model that explicitly includes spontaneous radiative decay leads to
an unanticipated shift in the position of the photoassociation resonance, which
affects whether the rate (constant) maximizes or saturates, as well as the
limiting value itself. A simple analytical model agrees with numerical
experiments, but only for high density. Finally, an explicit comparison with
the two-body unitary limit, set by the size of the condensate, finds that the
many-body rate limit is generally more strict.
