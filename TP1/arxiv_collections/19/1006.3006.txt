We investigate the interactions between ultracold alkali metal atoms and
closed-shell atoms using electronic structure calculations on the prototype
system Rb+Sr. There are molecular bound states that can be tuned across atomic
thresholds with magnetic field, and there are previously neglected terms in the
collision Hamiltonian that can produce zero-energy Feshbach resonances with
significant widths. The largest effect comes from the interaction-induced
variation of the Rb hyperfine coupling. The resonances may be used to form
paramagnetic polar molecules if the magnetic field can be controlled precisely
enough.
