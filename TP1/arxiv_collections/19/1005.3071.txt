We present grism spectra of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) from 0.6-1.6
microns from the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope. These new
infrared grism data augment previous optical Advanced Camera for Surveys G800L
0.6-0.95 micron grism data in GOODS-South from the PEARS program, extending the
wavelength covereage well past the G800L red cutoff. The ERS grism field was
observed at a depth of 2 orbits per grism, yielding spectra of hundreds of
faint objects, a subset of which are presented here. ELGs are studied via the
Ha, [OIII], and [OII] emission lines detected in the redshift ranges 0.2<z<1.4,
1.2<z<2.2 and 2.0<z<3.3 respectively in the G102 (0.8-1.1 microns; R~210) and
G141 (1.1-1.6 microns; R~130) grisms. The higher spectral resolution afforded
by the WFC3 grisms also reveals emission lines not detectable with the G800L
grism (e.g., [SII] and [SIII] lines). From these relatively shallow
observations, line luminosities, star-formation rates, and grism spectroscopic
redshifts are determined for a total of 48 ELGs to m(AB)~25 mag. Seventeen
GOODS-South galaxies that previously only had photometric redshifts now have
new grism-spectroscopic redshifts, in some cases with large corrections to the
photometric redshifts (Delta(z)~0.3-0.5). Additionally, one galaxy had no
previously-measured redshift but now has a secure grism-spectroscopic redshift,
for a total of 18 new GOODS-South spectroscopic redshifts. The faintest source
in our sample has a magnitude m(AB)=26.9 mag. The ERS grism data also reflect
the expected trend of lower specific star formation rates for the highest mass
galaxies in the sample as a function of redshift, consistent with downsizing
and discovered previously from large surveys. These results demonstrate the
remarkable efficiency and capability of the WFC3 NIR grisms for measuring
galaxy properties to faint magnitudes and redshifts to z>2.
