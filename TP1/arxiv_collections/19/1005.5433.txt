Nowadays, Data Warehouse (DW) plays a crucial role in the process of decision
making. However, their design remains a very delicate and difficult task either
for expert or users. The goal of this paper is to propose a new approach based
on the clover model, destined to assist users to design a DW. The proposed
approach is based on two main steps. The first one aims to guide users in their
choice of DW schema model. The second one aims to finalize the chosen model by
offering to the designer views related to former successful DW design
experiences.
