Spin transport driven by the temperature gradient in ferromagnetic metals is
studied based on a microscopic theory. It is shown that the temperature
gradient works as an effective field equivalent to the electric field as for
both the spin current generation and the spin relaxation torque. The thermally
driven contribution of the spin current and the relaxation torque are thus
proportional to $\nabla T$ and $\nabla^2 T$, respectively.
