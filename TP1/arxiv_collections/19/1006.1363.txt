Diaconis and Isaacs have defined the supercharacter theories of a finite
group to be certain approximations to the ordinary character theory of the
group. We make explicit the connection between supercharacter theories and
Schur rings, and we provide supercharacter theory constructions which
correspond to Schur ring constructions of Leung and Man and of Tamaschke.
