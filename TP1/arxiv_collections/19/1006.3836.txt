This study investigates Parker instability in an interstellar medium (ISM)
near the Galactic plane using three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic
simulations. Parker instability arises from the presence of a magnetic field in
a plasma, wherein the magnetic buoyant pressure expels the gas and cause the
gas to move along the field lines. The process is thought to induce the
formation of giant molecular clouds in the Galaxy. In this study, the effects
of cosmic-ray (CR) diffusion are examined. The ISM at equilibrium is assumed to
comprise a plasma fluid and a CR fluid at various temperatures, with a uniform
magnetic field passing through it in the azimuthal direction of the Galactic
disk. After a small perturbation, the unstable gas aggregates at the footpoint
of the magnetic fields and forms dense blobs. The growth rate of the
instability increases with the strength of the CR diffusion. The formation of
dense clouds is enhanced by the effect of cosmic rays (CRs), whereas the shape
of the clouds depends sensitively on the initial conditions of perturbation.
