We report on the results of numerical simulations of $SU(N)$ lattice Yang
Mills with two flavors of (light) Wilson fermion in the adjoint representation.
We analytically and numerically address the question of center symmetry
realization on lattices with $\Gamma$ sites in each direction in the large-$N$
limit. We show, by a weak coupling calculation that, for massless fermions,
center symmetry realization is independent of $\Gamma$, and is unbroken. Then,
we extend our result by conducting simulations at non zero mass and finite
gauge coupling. Our results indicate that center symmetry is intact for a range
of fermion mass in the vicinity of the critical line on lattices of volume
$2^4$. This observation makes it possible to compute infinite volume physical
observables using small volume simulations in the limit $N\to\infty$, with
possible applications to the determination of the conformal window in gauge
theories with adjoint fermions.
