We first review the general framework which enables one to resum high-energy
logarithms in hadronic processes, both in the evolution of parton densities and
in the coefficient functions. We then present an all-order calculation in
perturbative QCD of the inclusive Drell Yan and vector boson production in
hadron-hadron collisions, in the limit where centre of mass energy is much
bigger than the invariant mass of the final state. Our calculation resums
leading non-trivial logarithms in the ratio of these two scales.
  We also study the phenomenological relevance of the high-energy corrections
for Drell-Yan processes at the LHC. We find that the resummation corrects the
NNLO result by a few percent, for values of the invariant mass of the lepton
pair below 100 GeV. Corrections to W, Z production are expected to be of the
same order.
