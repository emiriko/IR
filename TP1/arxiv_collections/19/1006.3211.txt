We study the dynamics of individual agents in some kinetic models of wealth
exchange, particularly, the models with savings. For the model with uniform
savings, agents perform simple random walks in the "wealth space". On the other
hand, we observe ballistic diffusion in the model with distributed savings.
There is an associated skewness in the gain-loss distribution which explains
the steady state behavior in such models. We find that in general an agent
gains while interacting with an agent with a larger saving propensity.
