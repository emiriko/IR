The measure of the characteristics of a transistor is an important step in an
introductory electronics course. We propose to use a digital oscilloscope with
a USB connection to perform a measurement of the characteristic curves with no
additional custom circuitry. The setup is presented alongside with code that
allows the importation and analysis of the results with open-source software.
