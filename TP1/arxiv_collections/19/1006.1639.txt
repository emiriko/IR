We employ 3D Langevin Dynamics simulations to study the dynamics of polymer
chains translocating through a nanopore in presence of asymmetric solvent
conditions. Initially a large fraction ($>$ 50%) of the chain is placed at the
\textit{cis} side in a good solvent while the $trans$ segments are placed in a
bad solvent that causes the chain to collapse and promotes translocation from
the $cis$ to the $trans$ side. In particular, we study the ratcheting effect of
a globule formed at the \textit{trans} side created by the translocated
segment, and how this ratchet drives the system towards faster translocation.
Unlike in the case of unbiased or externally forced translocation where the
mean first passage time $\langle \tau \rangle $ is often characterized by
algebraic scaling as a function of the chain length $N$ with a single scaling
exponent $\alpha$, and the histogram of the mean first passage time
$P(\tau/\langle\tau \rangle)$ exhibits scaling, we find that scaling is not
well obeyed. For relatively long chains we find $\langle \tau \rangle \sim
N^\alpha$ where $\alpha \approx 1$ for $\varepsilon/k_{B}T > 1$. In this limit,
we also find that translocation proceeds with a nearly constant velocity of the
individual beads(monomers), which is attributed to the coiling of the globule.
We provide an approximate theory assuming rotat ional motion restricted on a 2D
disc to demonstrate that there is a crossover from diffusive behavior of the
center of mass for short chains to a single file translocation for long chains,
where the average translocation time scales linearly with the chain length $N$.
