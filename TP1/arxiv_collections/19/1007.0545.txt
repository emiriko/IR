The electronic structure and magnetic properties of the Jahn-Teller-distorted
perovskite KAgF3 have been investigated using the full-potential linerized aug-
mented plane-wave method. It is found that KAgF3 exhibits significant
quasi-one- dimensional antiferromagnetism with the ratio of exchange constant
jJ?j (perpen- dicular to the z axis) and J (along the z axis) about 0.04,
although the sublattice of magnetic ion is three-dimensional. The strong
quasi-one-dimensional antiferromag- netism originates from the
C-antiferro-distortive orbital ordering of the Ag2+ 4d9 ions. The orbital
ordered antiferromagnetic insulating state in KAgF3 is determined by on-site
Coulomb repulsion to a large extent.
