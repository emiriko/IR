Transport properties of concentrated electrolytes have been analyzed using
classical molecular dynamics simulations with the algorithms and parameters
typical of simulations describing complex electrokinetic phenomena. The
electrical conductivity and transport numbers of electrolytes containing
monovalent (KCl), divalent (MgCl$_2$), a mixture of both (KCl + MgCl$_2$), and
trivalent (LaCl$_3$) cations have been obtained from simulations of the
electrolytes in electric fields of different magnitude. The results obtained
for different simulation parameters have been discussed and compared with
experimental measurements of our own and from the literature. The
electroosmotic flow of water molecules induced by the ionic current in the
different cases has been calculated and interpreted with the help of the
hydration properties extracted from the simulations.
