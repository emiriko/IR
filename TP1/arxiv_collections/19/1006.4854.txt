The richness of optical and electronic properties of graphene attracts
enormous interest. Graphene has high mobility and optical transparency, in
addition to flexibility, robustness and environmental stability. So far, the
main focus has been on fundamental physics and electronic devices. However, we
believe its true potential to be in photonics and optoelectronics, where the
combination of its unique optical and electronic properties can be fully
exploited, even in the absence of a bandgap, and the linear dispersion of the
Dirac electrons enables ultra-wide-band tunability. The rise of graphene in
photonics and optoelectronics is shown by several recent results, ranging from
solar cells and light emitting devices, to touch screens, photodetectors and
ultrafast lasers. Here we review the state of the art in this emerging field.
