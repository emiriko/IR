Digital medical images are always displayed scaled to fit particular view.
Interpolation is responsible for this scaling, and if not done properly, can
significantly degrade diagnostic image quality. However, theoretically-optimal
interpolation algorithms may also be the most time-consuming and impractical.
We propose a new approach, adapted to the needs of digital medical imaging, to
combine high interpolation speed and superior L2-optimal image quality.
