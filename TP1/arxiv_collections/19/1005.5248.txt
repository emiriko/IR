A scaling consideration of the Kondo lattices is performed with account of
logarithmic Van Hove singularities (VHS) in the electron density of states. The
scaling trajectories are presented for different magnetic phases. It is
demonstrated that VHS lead to a considerable increase of the non-Fermi-liquid
behavior region owing to softening of magnon branches during the
renormalization process. Although the effective coupling constant remains
moderate, renormalized magnetic moment and spin-fluctuation frequency can
decrease by several orders of magnitude. A possible application to f-systems
and weak itinerant magnets is discussed.
