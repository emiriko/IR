We investigate the dynamics of quantum and classical correlations in a system
of two qubits under local colored-noise dephasing channels. The time evolution
of a single qubit interacting with its own environment is described by a memory
kernel non-Markovian master equation. The memory effects of the non-Markovian
reservoirs introduce new features in the dynamics of quantum and classical
correlations compared to the white noise Markovian case. Depending on the
geometry of the initial state, the system can exhibit frozen discord and
multiple sudden transitions between classical and quantum decoherence [L.
Mazzola, J. Piilo and S. Maniscalco, Phys. Rev. Lett. 104 (2010) 200401]. We
provide a geometric interpretation of those phenomena in terms of the distance
of the state under investigation to its closest classical state in the Hilbert
space of the system.
