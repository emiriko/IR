Noise simulation is a very powerful tool in signal analysis helping to
foresee the system performance in real experimental situations. Time series
generation is however a hard challenge when a robust model of the noise sources
is missing. We present here a simple computational technique which allows the
generation of noise samples of fixed length, given a desired power spectrum. A
few applications of the method are also discussed.
