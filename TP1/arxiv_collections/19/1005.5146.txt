We study the general relativistic orbital equation and using a
straightforward perturbation method and a mathematical device first introduced
by d'Alembert, we work out approximate expressions of a bound planetary orbit
in the form of trigonometrical polynomials and the first three terms of the
power series development of the perihelion advance. The results are applied to
a more precise determination of the total mass of the double pulsar J0737-3039.
