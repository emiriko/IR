Under the assumption that isospin is a good quantum number, symmetry is
expected for the transitions from ground state of the pair T=1, T$_Z$=$\pm$1
nuclei to the excited states of the T=0 nucleus situated betweem them. To study
the isospin symmetry of these transitions in mass A=54, we have performed two
different experiment: 1) High resolution charge exchange reactions at RCNP
(Osaka) for the T$_Z$=+1 $\rightarrow$ 0. 2) $\beta$-decay experiment a Louvain
la Neuve. \\ The present work shows the first results in the analysis of the
$\beta$-decay experiment as part of the Diploma and PhD thesis of Francisco
Molina Palacios at Instituto de Fisica Corpuscular in Valencia.
