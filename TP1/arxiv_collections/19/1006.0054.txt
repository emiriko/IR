Compressive sensing (CS) is a technique for estimating a sparse signal from
the random measurements and the measurement matrix. Traditional sparse signal
recovery methods have seriously degeneration with the measurement matrix
uncertainty (MMU). Here the MMU is modeled as a bounded additive error. An
anti-uncertainty constraint in the form of a mixed L2 and L1 norm is deduced
from the sparse signal model with MMU. Then we combine the sparse constraint
with the anti-uncertainty constraint to get an anti-uncertainty sparse signal
recovery operator. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed operator
has a better reconstructing performance with the MMU than traditional methods.
