Motivated by atom optics experiments, we investigate a new class of fidelity
functions describing the reconstruction of quantum states by time-reversal
operations as $M_{\mathrm{Da}}(t) = | <\psi | e^{i H_2 t / 2} e^{i H_1 t / 2}
e^{-i H_2 t / 2} e^{-i H_1 t / 2} | \psi >|^2$. We show that the decay of
$M_{\mathrm{Da}}$ is quartic in time at short times, and that it freezes well
above the ergodic value at long times, when $H_2-H_1$ is not too large. The
long-time saturation value of $M_{\mathrm{Da}}$ contains easily extractable
information on the strength of decoherence in these systems.
