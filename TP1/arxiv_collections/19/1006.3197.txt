We analyze a realistic microscopic model for electronic scattering with the
neutral differential delay equations of motion of point charges of the
Wheeler-Feynman electrodynamics. We propose a microscopic model according to
the electrodynamics of point charges, complex enough to describe the essential
physics. Our microscopic model reaches a simple qualitative agreement with the
experimental results as regards interference in double-slit scattering and in
electronic scattering by crystals. We discuss our model in the light of
existing experimental results, including a qualitative disagreement found for
the double-slit experiment. We discuss an approximation for the complex neutral
differential delay equations of our model using piecewise-defined
(discontinuous) velocities for all charges and piecewise-constant-velocities
for the scattered charge. Our approximation predicts the De Broglie wavelength
as an inverse function of the incoming velocity and in the correct order of
magnitude. We explain the scattering by crystals in the light of the same
simplified modeling with Einstein-local interactions. We include a discussion
of the qualitative properties of the neutral-delay-equations of electrodynamics
to stimulate future experimental tests on the possibility to complete quantum
mechanics with electromagnetic models.
