We define a very general "parametric connect sum" construction which can be
used to eliminate isolated conical singularities of Riemannian manifolds. We
then show that various important analytic and elliptic estimates, formulated in
terms of weighted Sobolev spaces, can be obtained independently of the
parameters used in the construction. Specifically, we prove uniform estimates
related to (i) Sobolev Embedding Theorems, (ii) the invertibility of the
Laplace operator and (iii) Poincare' and Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev type
inequalities.
  Our main tools are the well-known theories of weighted Sobolev spaces and
elliptic operators on "conifolds". We provide an overview of both, together
with an extension of the former to general Riemannian manifolds.
  For a geometric application of our results we refer the reader to our paper
"Special Lagrangian conifolds, II: Gluing constructions in C^m".
