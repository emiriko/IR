We report room temperature ferromagnetism in as-implanted Eu doped ZnO
(ZnO:Eu). To address the origin of ferromagnetism ab initio calculations of
ZnO:Eu system are performed. Results show that the ferromagnetism is induced by
ZnO point defects as Eu ions in perfect ZnO tend to align
antiferromagnetically.
