We have fabricated transistor structures using fluorinated single-layer
graphene flakes and studied their electronic properties at different
temperatures. Compared with pristine graphene, fluorinated graphene has very
large and strongly temperature dependent resistance in the electro-neutrality
region. We show that fluorination creates a mobility gap in graphene's spectrum
where electron transport takes place via localised electron states.
