We study the decay of quantum nonlocality, identified by the violation of the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality, for two noninteracting
Josephson qubits subject to independent baths with broadband spectra typical of
solid state nanodevices. The bath noise can be separated in an adiabatic
(low-frequency) and in a quantum (high-frequency) part. We point out the
qualitative different effects on quantum nonlocal correlations induced by
adiabatic and quantum noise. A quantitaive analysis is performed for typical
noise figures in Josephson systems. Finally we compare, for this system, the
dynamics of nonlocal correlations and of entanglement.
