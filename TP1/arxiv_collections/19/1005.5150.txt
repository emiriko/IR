We derive the fermionic contribution to the longitudinal and Hall
conductivities within a Kubo formalism, using a phenomenological Greens
function which has been previously developed to describe photoemission data in
the pseudogap phase of the cuprates. We find that the in-plane electrical and
thermal conductivities are metallic-like, showing a universal limit behavior
characteristic of a d-wave spectrum as the scattering rate goes to zero. In
contrast, the c-axis resistivity and the Hall number are insulating-like, being
divergent in the same limit. The relation of these results to transport data in
the pseudogap phase is discussed.
