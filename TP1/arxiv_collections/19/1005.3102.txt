In this paper we examine the role of crystal chemistry factors in creating
conditions for formation of magnetoelectric ordering in BiFeO3. It is generally
accepted that the main reason of the ferroelectric distortion in BiFeO3 is
concerned with a stereochemical activity of the Bi lone pair. However, the lone
pair is stereochemically active in the paraelectric orthorhombic beta-phase as
well. We demonstrate that a crucial role in emerging of phase transitions of
the metal-insulator, paraelectric-ferroelectric and magnetic disorder-order
types belongs to the change of the degree of the lone pair stereochemical
activity - its consecutive increase with the temperature decrease. Using the
structural data, we calculated the sign and strength of magnetic couplings in
BiFeO3 in the range from 945 C down to 25 C and found the couplings, which
undergo the antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic transition with the temperature
decrease and give rise to the antiferromagnetic ordering and its delay in
regard to temperature, as compared to the ferroelectric ordering. We discuss
the reasons of emerging of the spatially modulated spin structure and its
suppression by doping with La3+.
