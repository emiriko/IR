It has been suggested that the algebraic structure of AES (and other similar
block ciphers) could lead to a weakness exploitable in new attacks. In this
paper, we use the algebraic structure of AES-like ciphers to construct a cipher
embedding where the ciphers may lose their non-linearity. We show some examples
and we discuss the limitations of our approach.
