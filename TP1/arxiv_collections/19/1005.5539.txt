The basic ideas of a homotopy-based multiple-variable method is proposed and
applied to investigate the nonlinear interactions of periodic traveling waves.
Mathematically, this method does not depend upon any small physical parameters
at all and thus is more general than the traditional multiple-scale
perturbation techniques. Physically, it is found that, for a fully developed
wave system, the amplitudes of all wave components are finite even if the wave
resonance condition given by Phillips (1960) is exactly satisfied. Besides, it
is revealed that there exist multiple resonant waves, and that the amplitudes
of resonant wave may be much smaller than those of primary waves so that the
resonant waves sometimes contain rather small part of wave energy. Furthermore,
a wave resonance condition for arbitrary numbers of traveling waves with large
wave amplitudes is given, which logically contains Phillips' four-wave
resonance condition but opens a way to investigate the strongly nonlinear
interaction of more than four traveling waves with large amplitudes. This work
also illustrates that the homotopy multiple-variable method is helpful to gain
solutions with important physical meanings of nonlinear problems, if the
multiple variables are properly defined with clear physical meanings.
