A plasma blob is modeled as consisting of two homogeneous spheres of equal
radius and equal but opposite charge densities that can move relative to each
other. Relative translational and rotational motion are considered separately.
Magnetic effects from the current density caused by the relative motion are
included. Magnetic interaction is seen to cause an inductive inertia. In the
relative translation case the Coulomb attraction, approximately a linear force
for small amplitudes, causes an oscillation. For a large number of particles
the corresponding oscillation frequency will not be the Langmuir plasma
frequency, because of the large inductive inertia. For rotation an external
magnetic field is included and the energy and diamagnetism of the plasma in the
model is calculated. Finally it is noted how the neglect of resistivity is
motivated by the results.
