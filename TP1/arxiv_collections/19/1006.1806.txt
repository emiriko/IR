It may be possible to use operator regularization with Feynman diagrams,
which would greatly simplify its use as it has so far been limited to the more
complicated Schwinger approach. Operator regularization, unlike
$\zeta$-function regularization, is not limited to one-loop order, and
preserves supersymmetry unlike dimensional regularization. In practice the use
of operator regularization in the context of Feynman diagrams is found not to
complicate the calculation.
