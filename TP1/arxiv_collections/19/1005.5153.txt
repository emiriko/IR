We solve the CCFM equation numerically in the presence of a boundary
condition which effectively incorporates the non-linear dynamics. We retain the
full dependence of the unintegrated gluon distribution on the coherence scale,
and extract the saturation momentum. The resulting saturation scale is a
function of both rapidity and the coherence momentum. In Deep Inelastic
Scattering this will lead to a dependence of the saturation scale on the photon
virtuality in addition to the usual x-Bjorken dependence. At asymptotic
energies the interplay between the perturbative non-linear physics, and that of
the QCD coherence, leads to an interesting and novel dynamics where the
saturation momentum itself eventually saturates. We also investigate various
implementations of the "non-Sudakov" form factor. It is shown that the
non-linear dynamics leads to almost identical results for different form
factors. Finally, different choices of the scale of the running coupling are
analyzed and implications for the phenomenology are discussed.
