The phase diagram of model anisotropic particles with four attractive patches
in a tetrahedral arrangement has been computed at two different values for the
range of the potential, with the aim of investigating the conditions under
which a diamond crystal can be formed. We find that the diamond phase is never
stable for our longer-ranged potential. At low temperatures and pressures, the
fluid freezes into a body-centred-cubic solid that can be viewed as two
interpenetrating diamond lattices with a weak interaction between the two
sublattices. Upon compression, an orientationally ordered face-centred-cubic
crystal becomes more stable than the body-centred-cubic crystal, and at higher
temperatures a plastic face-centered-cubic phase is stabilized by the increased
entropy due to orientational disorder. A similar phase diagram is found for the
shorter-ranged potential, but at low temperatures and pressures, we also find a
region over which the diamond phase is thermodynamically favored over the
body-centred-cubic phase. The higher vibrational entropy of the diamond
structure with respect to the body-centred-cubic solid explains why it is
stable even though the enthalpy of the latter phase is lower. Some preliminary
studies on the growth of the diamond structure starting from a crystal seed
were performed. Even though the diamond phase is never thermodynamically stable
for the longer-ranged model, direct coexistence simulations of the interface
between the fluid and the body-centred-cubic crystal and between the fluid and
the diamond crystal show that, at sufficiently low pressures, it is quite
probable that in both cases the solid grows into a diamond crystal, albeit
involving some defects. These results highlight the importance of kinetic
effects in the formation of diamond crystals in systems of patchy particles.
