Microwave absorption measurements in magnetic fields from zero up to 16 T
were used to determine the temperature range of superconducting fluctuations
above the superconducting critical temperature T_c in YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}.
Measurements were performed on deeply underdoped, slightly underdoped, and
overdoped single crystals. The temperature range of the superconducting
fluctuations above T_c is determined by an experimental method which is free
from arbitrary assumptions about subtracting the nonsuperconducting
contributions to the total measured signal, and/or theoretical models to
extract the unknown parameters. The superconducting fluctuations are detected
in the ab-plane, and c-axis conductivity, by identifying the onset temperature
T'. Within the sensitivity of the method, this fluctuation regime is found only
within a fairly narrow region above T_c. Its width increases from 7 K in the
overdoped sample (T_c = 89 K), to at most 23 K in the deeply underdoped sample
(T_c = 57 K), so that T' falls well below the pseudogap temperature T*.
Implications of these findings are discussed in the context of other
experimental probes of superconducting fluctuations in the cuprates.
