In this paper I propose a new principle in physics: the principle of
"finiteness". It stems from the definition of physics as a science that deals
(among other things) with measurable dimensional physical quantities. Since
measurement results, including their errors, are always finite, the principle
of finiteness postulates that the mathematical formulation of "legitimate" laws
of physics should prevent exactly zero or infinite solutions. Some consequences
of the principle of finiteness are discussed, in general, and then more
specifically in the fields of special relativity, quantum mechanics, and
quantum gravity. The consequences are derived independently of any other theory
or principle in physics. I propose "finiteness" as a postulate (like the
constancy of the speed of light in vacuum, "c"), as opposed to a notion whose
validity has to be corroborated by, or derived theoretically or experimentally
from other facts, theories, or principles.
