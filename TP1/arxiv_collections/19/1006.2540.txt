We report the observation of photon generation in a microwave cavity with a
time-dependent boundary condition. Our system is a microfabricated quarter-wave
coplanar waveguide cavity. The electrical length of the cavity is varied using
the tunable inductance of a superconducting quantum interference device. It is
measured in the quantum regime, where the temperature is significantly less
than the resonance frequency (~ 5 GHz). When the length is modulated at
approximately twice the static resonance frequency, spontaneous oscillations of
the cavity field are observed. Time-resolved measurements of the dynamical
state of the cavity show multiple stable states. The behavior is well described
by theory. Connections to the dynamical Casimir effect are discussed.
