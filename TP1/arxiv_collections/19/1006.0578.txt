The role of Poincar\'e covariant space-time translations is investigated in
the case of the pseudoscalar-meson charge form factors. It is shown that this
role extends beyond the standard energy-momentum conservation, which is
accounted for in all relativistic quantum mechanics calculations. It implies
constraints that have been largely ignored until now but should be fulfilled to
ensure the full Poincar\'e covariance. The violation of these constraints,
which is more or less important depending on the form of relativistic quantum
mechanics that is employed, points to the validity of using a single-particle
current, which is generally assumed in calculations of form factors. In short,
these constraints concern the relation of the momentum transferred to the
constituents to the one transferred to the system. How to account for the
related constraints, as well as restoring the equivalence of different
relativistic quantum mechanics approaches in estimating form factors, is
discussed. Some conclusions relative to the underlying dynamics are given in
the pion case.
