We show that a single photon can ionize the two helium atoms of the helium
dimer in a distance up to 10 {\deg}A. The energy sharing among the electrons,
the angular distributions of the ions and electrons as well as comparison with
electron impact data for helium atoms suggest a knock-off type double
ionization process. The Coulomb explosion imaging of He_2 provides a direct
view of the nuclear wave function of this by far most extended and most diffuse
of all naturally existing molecules.
