Using a flowchart representation of quantum optomechanical dynamics, we
design coherent quantum-noise-cancellation schemes that can eliminate the
back-action noise induced by radiation pressure at all frequencies and thus
overcome the standard quantum limit of force sensing. The proposed schemes can
be regarded as novel examples of coherent feedforward quantum control.
