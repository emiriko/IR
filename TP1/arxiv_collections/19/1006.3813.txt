NGC6611 and its parental cloud, the Eagle Nebula (M16), are well-studied
star-forming regions, thanks to their large content of both OB stars and stars
with disks and the observed ongoing star formation. We identified 834
disk-bearing stars associated with the cloud, after detecting their excesses in
NIR bands from J band to 8.0 micron. In this paper, we study in detail the
nature of a subsample of disk-bearing stars that show peculiar characteristics.
They appear older than the other members in the V vs. V-I diagram, and/or they
have one or more IRAC colors at pure photospheric values, despite showing NIR
excesses, when optical and infrared colors are compared. We confirm the
membership of these stars to M16 by a spectroscopic analysis. The physical
properties of these stars with disks are studied by comparing their spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) with the SEDs predicted by models of T-Tauri stars
with disks and envelopes. We show that the age of these stars estimated from
the V vs. V-I diagram is unreliable since their V-I colors are altered by the
light scattered by the disk into the line of sight. Only in a few cases their
SEDs are compatible with models with excesses in V band caused by optical
veiling. Candidate members with disks and photospheric IRAC colors are selected
by the used NIR disk diagnostic, which is sensitive to moderate excesses, such
as those produced by disks with low masses. In 1/3 of these cases, scattering
of stellar flux by the disks can also be invoked. The photospheric light
scattered by the disk grains into the line of sight can affect the derivation
of physical parameters of ClassII stars from photometric optical and NIR data.
Besides, the disks diagnostic we defined are useful for selecting stars with
disks, even those with moderate excesses or whose optical colors are altered by
veiling or photospheric scattered light.
