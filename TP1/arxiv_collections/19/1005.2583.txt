The Planck spectrum of thermal scalar radiation is derived suggestively
within classical physics by the use of an accelerating coordinate frame. The
derivation has an analogue in Boltzmann's derivation of the Maxwell velocity
distribution for thermal particle velocities by considering the thermal
equilibrium of noninteracting particles in a uniform gravitational field. For
the case of radiation, the gravitational field is provided by the acceleration
of a Rindler frame through Minkowski spacetime. Classical zero-point radiation
and relativistic physics enter in an essential way in the derivation which is
based upon the behavior of free radiation fields and the assumption that the
field correlation functions contain but a single correlation time in thermal
equilibrium. The work has connections with the thermal effects of acceleration
found in relativistic quantum field theory.
