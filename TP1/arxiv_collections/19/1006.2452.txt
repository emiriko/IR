A replicator equation with explicit space and global regulation is
considered. This model provides a natural framework to follow frequencies of
species that are distributed in the space. For this model, analogues to
classical notions of the Nash equilibrium and evolutionary stable strategy are
provided. A sufficient condition for a uniform stationary state to be a
spatially distributed evolutionary stable state is presented and illustrated
with examples.
