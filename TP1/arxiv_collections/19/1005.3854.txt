The principle of least action provides a holistic worldview in which nature
in its entirety and every detail is pictured in terms of actions. Each and
every action is ultimately composed of one or multiples of the most elementary
action which corresponds to the Planck's constant. Elements of space are closed
actions, known as fermions, whereas elements of time are open actions, known as
bosons. The actions span energy landscape, the Universe which evolves
irreversibly according to the 2nd law of thermodynamics by diminishing density
differences in least time. During the step-by-step evolution densely-curled
actions unfold by opening up and expelling one or multiple elementary actions
to their surrounding sparser space. The manifold's varieties process from one
symmetry group to another until the equivalence to their dual, i.e., the
surrounding density has been attained. The scale-free physical portrayal of
nature does not recognize any fundamental difference between fundamental
particles and fundamental forces. Instead a plethora of particles and a
diaspora of forces are perceived merely as diverse manifestations of a natural
selection for various mechanisms and ways to decrease free energy in the least
time.
