Peer-evaluation based measures of group research quality such as the UK's
Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), which do not employ bibliometric analyses,
cannot directly avail of such methods to normalize research impact across
disciplines. This is seen as a conspicuous flaw of such exercises and calls
have been made to find a remedy. Here a simple, systematic solution is proposed
based upon a mathematical model for the relationship between research quality
and group quantity. This model manifests both the Matthew effect and a
phenomenon akin to the Ringelmann effect and reveals the existence of two
critical masses for each academic discipline: a lower value, below which groups
are vulnerable, and an upper value beyond which the dependency of quality on
quantity reduces and plateaus appear when the critical masses are large. A
possible normalization procedure is then to pitch these plateaus at similar
levels. We examine the consequences of this procedure at RAE for a multitude of
academic disciplines, corresponding to a range of critical masses.
