Here, DGP model of brane-gravity is analyzed and compared with the standard
general relativity and Randall-Sundrum cases using non-linear equation of
state. Phantom fluid is known to violate the weak energy condition. In this
paper, it is found that this characteristic of phantom energy is affected
drastically by the negative brane-tension $\lambda$ of the RS-II model. It is
found that in DGP model strong energy condition(SEC) is always violated and the
universe accelerates only where as in RS-II model even SEC is not violated for
$1 < \rho/\lambda < 2$ and the universe decelerates.
