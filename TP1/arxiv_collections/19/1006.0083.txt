Magnetic nanomaterials (23-43 nm) of Cu$_x$Co$_{1-x}$Fe$_2$O$_4$\ (x = 0.0,
0.5 and 1.0) were synthesized by auto combustion method. The crystallite sizes
of these materials were calculated from X-ray diffraction peaks. The band
observed in Fourier transform infrared spectrum near 575 cm$^{-1}$ in these
samples confirm the presence of ferrite phase. Conductivity measurement shows
the thermal hysteresis and demonstrates the knee points at 475$^o$C, 525$^o$C
and 500$^o$C for copper ferrite, cobalt ferrite and copper-cobalt mixed ferrite
respectively. The hystersis M-H loops for these materials were traced using the
Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) and indicate a significant increase in the
saturation magnetization (M$_s$) and remanence (M$_r$) due to the substitution
of Cu$^{2+}$ ions in cobalt ferrite, while the intrinsic coercivity (H$_c$) was
decreasing. Among these ferrites, copper ferrite exhibits highest sensitivity
for humidity.
