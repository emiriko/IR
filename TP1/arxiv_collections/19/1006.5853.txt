We study numerically the depinning transition of driven elastic interfaces in
a random-periodic medium with localized periodic-correlation peaks in the
direction of motion. The analysis of the moving interface geometry reveals the
existence of several characteristic lengths separating different length-scale
regimes of roughness. We determine the scaling behavior of these lengths as a
function of the velocity, temperature, driving force, and transverse
periodicity. A dynamical roughness diagram is thus obtained which contains, at
small length scales, the critical and fast-flow regimes typical of the
random-manifold (or domain wall) depinning, and at large length-scales, the
critical and fast-flow regimes typical of the random-periodic (or
charge-density wave) depinning. From the study of the equilibrium geometry we
are also able to infer the roughness diagram in the creep regime, extending the
depinning roughness diagram below threshold. Our results are relevant for
understanding the geometry at depinning of arrays of elastically coupled thin
manifolds in a disordered medium such as driven particle chains or vortex-line
planar arrays. They also allow to properly control the effect of transverse
periodic boundary conditions in large-scale simulations of driven disordered
interfaces.
