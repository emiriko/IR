The conductivity of graphite is analytically evaluated in the range of
0.1-1.5 eV, where the electron relaxation processes can be neglected, and the
low energy excitations at the "Dirac" points are most essential. The value of
conductivity calculated per one graphite layer is close to the universal
conductivity of graphene. The features of the conductivity are explained in
terms of singularities of the electron dispersion in graphite.
