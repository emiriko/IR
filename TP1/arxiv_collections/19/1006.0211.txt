The dynamical mechanism of channel coupling with the decay channels is
applied to the case of coupled charmonium - $DD^*$ states with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$.
A pole analysis is done and the $DD^*$ production cross section is calculated
in qualitative agreement with experiment. The sharp peak at the $D_0D^*_0$
threshold and flat background are shown to be due to Breit-Wigner resonance,
shifted by channel coupling from the original position of 3954 MeV for the
$2^3P_1$, $Q\bar Q$ state. A similar analysis, applied to the $n=2$, $^3P_2$,
$^1P_1$, $^3P_0$, allows us to associate the first one with the observed
$Z(3930)$ J=2 and explains the destiny of $^3P_0$.
