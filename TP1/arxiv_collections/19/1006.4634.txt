Modeling QCD at large temperature with a simple holographic five dimensional
theory encoding minimal breaking of conformality, allows for the calculation of
all the transport coefficients, up to second order, in terms of a single
parameter. In particular, the shear and bulk relaxation times are provided. The
result follows by deforming the AdS background with a scalar dual to a
marginally relevant operator, at leading order in the deformation parameter.
