We investigate electronic transport in n-i-n GaN nanowires with and without
AlN double barriers. The nanowires are grown by catalyst-free, plasma-assisted
molecular beam epitaxy enabling abrupt GaN/AlN interfaces as well as
longitudinal n-type doping modulation. At low temperature, transport in n-i-n
GaN nanowires is dominated by the Coulomb blockade effect. Carriers are
confined in the undoped middle region, forming single or multiple islands with
a characteristic length of ~100 nm. The incorporation of two AlN tunnel
barriers causes confinement to occur within the GaN well in between. In the
case of 6-nm-thick wells and 2-nm-thick barriers, we observe characteristic
signatures of Coulomb-blockaded transport in single quantum dots with discrete
energy states. For narrower wells and barriers, Coulomb-blockade effects do not
play a significant role while the onset of resonant tunneling via the confined
quantum levels is accompanied by a negative differential resistance surviving
up to ~150 K.
