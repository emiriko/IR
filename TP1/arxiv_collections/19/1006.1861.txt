A 3-dimensional non-commutative oscillator with no mass term but with a
certain momentum-dependent potential admits a conserved Runge-Lenz vector,
derived from the dual description in momentum space. The latter corresponds to
a Dirac monopole with a fine-tuned inverse-square plus Newtonian potential,
introduced by McIntosh, Cisneros, and by Zwanziger some time ago. The
trajectories are (arcs of) ellipses, which, in the commutative limit, reduce to
the circular hodographs of the Kepler problem. The dynamical symmetry allows
for an algebraic determination of the bound-state spectrum and actually extends
to the conformal algebra o(4,2).
