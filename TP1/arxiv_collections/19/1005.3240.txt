We study the general phenomenology of neutrinoless double beta decay in
seesaw models. In particular, we focus on the dependence of the neutrinoless
double beta decay rate on the mass of the extra states introduced to account
for the Majorana masses of light neutrinos. For this purpose, we compute the
nuclear matrix elements as functions of the mass of the mediating fermions and
estimate the associated uncertainties. We then discuss what can be inferred on
the seesaw model parameters in the different mass regimes and clarify how the
contribution of the light neutrinos should always be taken into account when
deriving bounds on the extra parameters. Conversely, the extra states can also
have a significant impact, cancelling the Standard Model neutrino contribution
for masses lighter than the nuclear scale and leading to vanishing neutrinoless
double beta decay amplitudes even if neutrinos are Majorana particles. We also
discuss how seesaw models could reconcile large rates of neutrinoless double
beta decay with more stringent cosmological bounds on neutrino masses.
