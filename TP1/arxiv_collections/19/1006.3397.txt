We investigate the full phase diagram of a column of grains near jamming, as
a function of varying levels of frustration. Frustration is modelled by the
effect of two opposing fields on a grain, due respectively to grains above and
below it. The resulting four dynamical regimes (ballistic, logarithmic,
activated and glassy) are characterised by means of the jamming time of
zero-temperature dynamics, and of the statistics of attractors reached by the
latter. Shape effects are most pronounced in the cases of strong and weak
frustration, and essentially disappear around a mean-field point.
