In ZM theory the direction of time has a non-zero projection onto space and
this projection corresponds to the local velocity relative to the observer.
Classical trajectories can be obtained by following the local direction of
time. The relationship of time to space enables the change in momentum over
time to be related to the spatial change in energy and momentum. Previously
Hamilton's equations-of-motion were derived by considering trajectories in one
space and one time dimensions. Here we consider three space and one time
dimension. Without any other assumptions we derive the Lorentz force law of
electromagnetism with relevant definitions of the scalar and vector potentials.
