In this paper the sharp Garding inequality is established on compact Lie
groups. The positivity condition is expressed in the non-commutative phase
space in terms of the full symbol, which is defined using the representations
of the group. Applications are given to the $L^2$ and Sobolev boundedness of
pseudo-differential operators.
