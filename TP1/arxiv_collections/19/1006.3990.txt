For over a century, x-ray scattering has been the most powerful tool for
determining the equilibrium structure of crystalline materials. Deviations from
perfect periodicity, for example due to thermal motion of the atoms, reduces
the intensity of the Bragg peaks as well as produces structure in the diffuse
scattering background. Analysis of the thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) had
been used to determine interatomic force constants and phonon dispersion in
relatively simple cases before inelastic neutron scattering became the
preferred technique to study lattice dynamics. With the advent of intense
synchrotron x-ray sources, there was a renewed interest in TDS for measuring
phonon dispersion. The relatively short x-ray pulses emanating from these
sources also enables the measurement of phonon dynamics in the time domain.
Prior experiments on nonequilibrium phonons were either limited by
time-resolution and/or to relatively long wavelength excitations. Here we
present the first images of nonequilibrium phonons throughout the Brillouin
zone in photoexcited III-V semiconductors, indium-phosphide and
indium-antimonide, using picosecond time-resolved diffuse scattering. In each
case, we find that the lattice remain out of equilibrium for several hundred
picoseconds up to nanoseconds after laser excitation. The non-equilibrium
population is dominated by transverse acoustic phonons which in InP are
directed along high-symmetry directions. The results have wide implications for
the detailed study of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon coupling in solids.
