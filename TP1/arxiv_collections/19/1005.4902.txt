We derive a generalized linear dispersion relation of waves in a strongly
magnetized, compressible, homogeneous and isotropic quasineutral plasma.
Starting from a two fluid model, describing distinguishable electron and ion
fluids, we obtain a six order linear dispersion relation of magnetized waves
that contains effects due to electron and ion inertia, finite plasma beta and
angular dependence of phase speed. We investigate propagation characteristics
of these magnetized waves in a regime where scale lengths are comparable with
electron and ion inertial length scales. This regime corresponds essentially to
the solar wind plasma where length scales, comparable with ion cyclotron
frequency, lead to dispersive effects. These scales in conjunction with linear
waves present a great deal of challenges in understanding the high frequency,
small scale dynamics of turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind plasma.
