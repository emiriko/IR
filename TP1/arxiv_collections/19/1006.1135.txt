The structural and magnetic phase transitions have been studied on NdFeAsO
single crystals by neutron and x-ray diffraction complemented by resistivity
and specific heat measurements. Two low-temperature phase transitions have been
observed in addition to the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic transition at T_S = 142
K and the onset of antiferromagnetic (AFM) Fe order below T_N = 137 K. The Fe
moments order AFM in the well-known stripe-like structure in the (ab) plane,
but change from AFM to ferromagnetic (FM) arrangement along the c direction
below T* = 15 K accompanied by the onset of Nd AFM order below T_Nd = 6 K with
this same AFM configuration. The iron magnetic order-order transition in
NdFeAsO accentuates the Nd-Fe interaction and the delicate balance of c-axis
exchange couplings that results in AFM in LaFeAsO and FM in CeFeAsO and
PrFeAsO.
