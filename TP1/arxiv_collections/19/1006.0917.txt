We demonstrate in this paper a method to reconstruct the atom number
distribution of a cloud containing a few tens of cold atoms. The atoms are
first loaded from a magneto-optical trap into a microscopic optical dipole trap
and then released in a resonant light probe where they undergo a Brownian
motion and scatter photons. We count the number of photon events detected on an
image intensifier. Using the response of our detection system to a single atom
as a calibration, we extract the atom number distribution when the trap is
loaded with more than one atom. The atom number distribution is found to be
compatible with a Poisson distribution.
