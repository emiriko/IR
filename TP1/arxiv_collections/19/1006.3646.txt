The properties of charmed mesons in dense matter are studied using a unitary
coupled-channel approach in the nuclear medium which takes into account
Pauli-blocking effects and meson self-energies in a self-consistent manner. We
obtain the open-charm meson spectral functions in this dense nuclear
environment, and discuss their implications on hidden charm and charm scalar
resonances and on the formation of $D$-mesic nuclei at FAIR energies.
