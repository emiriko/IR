Motivated by recent estimates of the isospin-violating process tau \to eta pi
nu_tau, mostly relying on the rho and a_0 dominance of the relevant form
factors near threshold, we present an assessment for the branching ratio that
accounts for additional, potential, effects from the lowest radial excitations
rho(1450) and a_0(1450), respectively, also lying in the decay phase space.
