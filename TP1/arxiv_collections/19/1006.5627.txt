To construct ternary "quaternions" following Hamilton we must introduce two
"imaginary "units, $q_1$ and $q_2$ with propeties $q_1^n=1$ and $q_2^m=1$. The
general is enough difficult, and we consider the $m=n=3$. This case gives us
the example of non-Abelian groupas was in Hamiltonian quaternion. The
Hamiltonian quaternions help us to discover the $SU(2)=S^3$ group and also the
group $L(2,C)$. In ternary case we found the generalization of U(3) which we
called $TU(3)$ group and also we found the the SL(3,C) group. On the matrix
language we are going from binary Pauly matrices to three dimensional nine
matrices which are called by nonions. This way was initiated by algebraic
classification of $CY_m$-spaces for all m=3,4,...where in reflexive Newton
polyhedra we found the Berger graphs which gave in the corresponding Cartan
matrices the longest simple roots $B_{ii}=3,4,..$ comparing with the case of
binary algebras in which the Cartan diagonal element is equal 2, {\it i.e. }
$A_{ii}=2$.
