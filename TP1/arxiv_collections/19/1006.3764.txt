In recent years, spatial and spatio-temporal modeling have become an
important area of research in many fields (epidemiology, environmental studies,
disease mapping). In this work we propose different spatial models to study
hospital recruitment, including some potentially explicative variables.
Interest is on the distribution per geographical unit of the ratio between the
number of patients living in this geographical unit and the population in the
same unit. Models considered are within the framework of Bayesian Latent
Gaussian models. Our response variable is assumed to follow a binomial
distribution, with logit link, whose parameters are the population in the
geographical unit and the corresponding relative risk. The structured additive
predictor accounts for effects of various covariates in an additive way,
including smoothing functions of the covariates (for example spatial effect),
linear effect of covariates. To approximate posterior marginals, which not
available in closed form, we use integrated nested Laplace approximations
(INLA), recently proposed for approximate Bayesian inference in latent Gaussian
models. INLA has the advantage of giving very accurate approximations and being
faster than McMC methods when the number of parameters does not exceed 6 (as it
is in our case). Model comparisons are assessed using DIC criterion.
