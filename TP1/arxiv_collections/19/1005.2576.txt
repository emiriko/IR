We investigate the occurrence of Borromean three-body continuum s-wave
resonances, in an $\alpha\alpha\beta$ system for large negative two-body
scattering lengths. The energy and width are determined by a scaling function
with arguments given by energy ratios of the two-body virtual state subsystem
energies with the shallowest three-body bound state. The Borromean continuum
resonances emerging from Efimov states present a peculiar behavior for trapped
ultracold atoms near a Feshbach resonance: two resonances with equal energies
at different values of the scattering length. The corresponding three-body
recombination peaks should merge as the temperature is raised, with one moving
towards lower values of the scattering length as the other moves to larger
values.
