Response functions and fluctuations measured locally in complex materials
should equally well characterize mesoscopic-scale dynamics. The
fluctuation-dissipation-relation (FDR), relates the two in equilibrium, a fact
used regularly, for example, to infer mechanical properties of soft matter from
the fluctuations in light scattering. In slowly-evolving non-equilibrium
systems, such as aging spin and structural glasses, sheared soft matter, and
active matter, a form of FDR has been proposed in which an effective
temperature, Teff, replaces the usual temperature, and universal behavior is
found in mean-field models and simulations. Thus far, only experiments on
spin-glasses and liquid crystals have succeeded in accessing the strong aging
regime, where Teff >T and possible scaling behavior are expected. Here we test
these ideas through measurements of local dielectric response and polarization
noise in an aging structural glass, poly-vinyl-acetate . The relaxation-time
spectrum, as measured by noise, is compressed, and by response, is stretched,
relative to equilibrium, requiring an effective temperature with a scaling
behavior similar to that of certain mean-field spin-glass models.
