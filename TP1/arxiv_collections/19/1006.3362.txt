We construct Green's function for the quantum degenerate parametric
oscillator in terms of standard solutions of Ince's equation in a framework of
a general approach to harmonic oscillators. Exact time-dependent wave functions
and their connections with dynamical invariants and SU(1,1) group are also
discussed.
