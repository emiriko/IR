Kaon physics can test new-physics effects in leptonic or semileptonic decays.
A unitarity test of the first row of the CKM mixing matrix is obtained from the
precision measurements of Kl3 widths for K{\pm}, KL, and (unique to KLOE) KS.
The KLOE measurement of RK = {\Gamma}(Ke2)/{\Gamma}(K{\mu}2) with an accuracy
at the % level, aims at finding evidence of deviations from the SM prediction
induced by lepton-flavor violation new-physics effects.
