The use of Raman scattering techniques to study the mechanical properties of
graphene films is reviewed here. The determination of Gruneisen parameters of
suspended graphene sheets under uni- and bi-axial strain is discussed and the
values are compared to theoretical predictions. The effects of the
graphene-substrate interaction on strain and to the temperature evolution of
the graphene Raman spectra are discussed. Finally, the relation between
mechanical and thermal properties is presented along with the characterization
of thermal properties of graphene with Raman spectroscopy.
