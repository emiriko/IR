The key factor of component based software development is component
composition technology. A Component interaction graph is used to describe the
interrelation of components. Drawing a complete component interaction graph
(CIG) provides an objective basis and technical means for making the testing
outline. Although many researches have focused on this subject, the quality of
system that is composed of components has not been guaranteed. In this paper, a
CIG is constructed from a state chart diagram and new test cases are generated
to test the component composition.
