A general input-output modelling technique for aperiodic-sampling linear
systems has been developed. The procedure describes the dynamics of the system
and includes the sequence of sampling periods among the variables to be
handled. Some restrictive conditions on the sampling sequence are imposed in
order to guarantee the validity of the model. The particularization to the
periodic case represents an alternative to the classic methods of
discretization of continuous systems without using the Z-transform. This kind
of representation can be used largely for identification and control purposes.
