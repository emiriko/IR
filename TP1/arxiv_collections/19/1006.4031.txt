Through an extended kinetic model, we study the nonlinear generation of
quasi-static magnetic fields by high-frequency fields in a plasma, taking into
account the effects of the electron spin. It is found that although the largest
part of the nonlinear current in a moderate density, moderate temperature
plasma is due to the classical terms, the spin may still give a significant
contribution to the magnetic field generation mechanism. Applications of our
results are discussed.
