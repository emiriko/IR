We report an absorption spectroscopy experiment and the observation of
electromagnetically induced transparency from a single trapped atom. We focus a
weak and narrowband Gaussian light beam onto an optically cooled Barium ion
using a high numerical aperture lens. Extinction of this beam is observed with
measured values of up to 1.3 %. We demonstrate electromagnetically induced
transparency of the ion by tuning a strong control beam over a two-photon
resonance in a three-level lambda-type system. The probe beam extinction is
inhibited by more than 75 % due to population trapping.
