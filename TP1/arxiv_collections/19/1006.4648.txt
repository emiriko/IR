We present a first principles study of an unusual heterostructure, an
atomic-scale checkerboard of BiFeO3-BiMnO3, and compare its properties to the
two bulk constituent materials, BiFeO3 and BiMnO3. The "nanocheckerboard" is
found to have a multiferroic ground state with the desired properties of each
constituent: polar and ferrimagnetic due to BiFeO3 and BiMnO3, respectively.
The effect of B-site cation ordering on magnetic ordering in the BiFeO3-BiMnO3
system is studied. The checkerboard geometry is seen to give rise to a a novel
magnetostructural effect that is neither present in the bulk constituent
materials, nor in the layered BiFeO3-BiMnO3 superlattice.
