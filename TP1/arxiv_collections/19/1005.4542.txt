We give an alternative formulation of the no-cloning theorem that applies to
harmonic oscillator coherent states. It says that {\em unknown} single harmonic
oscillator coherent states can not be {\em amplified}. Conversely it says that
{\em known} harmonic oscillator coherent states can be directly amplified
through an universal unitary process. It is also shown that such a formulation
is needed for the consistency of {\em information cloning} proposed by us long
ago.
