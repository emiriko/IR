Quantum state detectors based on switching of hysteretic Josephson junctions
biased close to their critical current are simple to use but have strong
back-action. We show that the back-action of a DC-switching detector can be
considerably reduced by limiting the switching voltage and using a fast
cryogenic amplifier, such that a single readout can be completed within 25 ns
at a repetition rate of 1 MHz without loss of contrast. Based on a sequence of
two successive readouts we show that the measurement has a clear quantum
non-demolition character, with a QND fidelity of 75 %.
