We formulate a quantitative theory of non-local electron transport in
three-terminal disordered ferromagnet-superconductor-ferromagnet structures. We
demonstrate that magnetic effects have different implications: While strong
exchange field suppresses disorder-induced electron interference in
ferromagnetic electrodes, spin-sensitive electron scattering at
superconductor-ferromagnet interfaces can drive the total non-local conductance
negative at sufficiently low energies. At higher energies magnetic effects
become less important and the non-local resistance behaves similarly to the
non-magnetic case. Our predictions can be directly tested in future experiments
on non-local electron transport in hybrid FSF structures.
