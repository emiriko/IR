We analyze numerically the thermal conductivity of carbon nanoribbons with
ideal and rough edges. We demonstrate that edge disorder can lead to a
suppression of thermal conductivity by several orders of magnitude. This effect
is associated with the edge-induced Anderson localization and suppression of
the phonon transport, and it becomes more pronounced for longer nanoribbons and
low temperatures.
