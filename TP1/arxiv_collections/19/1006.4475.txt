We present colour transformations from Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)
photometric system to Johnson-Cousins system and to Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) system for late-type giants and vice versa. The giant star sample was
formed using surface gravity constraints ($2 < \log g \leq 3$) to Cayrel de
Strobel et al.\rq s (2001) spectroscopic catalogue. 2MASS, SDSS and
Johnson-Cousins photometric data was taken from Cutri et al. (2003), Ofek
(2008) and van Leeuwen (2007), respectively. The final sample was refined
applying the following steps: (1) the data were dereddened, (2) the sample
stars selected are of the highest photometric quality. We give two--colour
dependent transformations as a function of metallicity as well as independent
of metallicity. The transformations provide absolute magnitudes and distance
determinations which can be used in space density evaluations at relatively
short distances where some or all of the SDSS magnitudes of late-type giants
are saturated.
