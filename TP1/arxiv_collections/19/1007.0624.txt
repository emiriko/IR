The eikonal approximation is at the heart of many theoretical and
phenomenological studies involving multiple soft gauge boson emissions in high
energy physics. We describe our efforts towards the extension of the eikonal
approximation for scattering amplitudes to the first subleading power in the
soft momentum.
