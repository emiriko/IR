How can one discriminate different inequivalent classes of multiparticle
entanglement experimentally? We present an approach for the discrimination of
an experimentally prepared state from the equivalence class of another state.
We consider two possible measures for the discrimination strength of an
observable. The first measure is based on the difference of expectation values,
the second on the relative entropy of the probability distributions of the
measurement outcomes. The interpretation of these measures and their usefulness
for experiments with limited resources are discussed. In the case of graph
states, the stabilizer formalism is employed to compute these quantities and to
find sets of observables that result in the most decisive discrimination.
