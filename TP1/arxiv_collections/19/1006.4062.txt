While QCD appears not to be accurately solvable in the regime of interest for
neutron star physics, microscopic calculations are feasible at both low and
very high densities. In this work, we propose using the most realistic
calculations in these two regimes of nuclear physics and perturbative QCD, and
construct equations of state by matching the results requiring thermodynamic
consistency. We find that the resulting equations of state --- in contrast to
several hadronic ones --- are able to reproduce current observational data on
neutron stars without any fine tuning, and allow stable hybrid stars with
masses up to 2.1M_{sun}. Using recent observations of star radii, we perform a
maximum likelihood analysis to further constrain the equation of state, and in
addition show that the effects of rotation on radii and masses should not be
neglected in future precision studies.
