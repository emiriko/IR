Experimental studies of soft Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at Tevatron are
reported in this note. Results on inclusive inelastic interactions, underlying
events, double parton interaction and exclusive diffractive production and
their implications to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) physics are discussed.
