We have grown epitaxial thin films of multiferroic BiMnO$_3$ using pulsed
laser deposition. The films were grown on SrTiO$_3$ (001) substrates by
ablating a Bi-rich target. Using x-ray diffraction we confirmed that the films
were epitaxial and the stoichiometry of the films was confirmed using Auger
electron spectroscopy. The films have a ferromagnetic Curie temperature ($T_C$)
of 85$\pm$5 K and a saturation magnetization of 1 $\mu_B$/Mn. The electric
polarization as a function of electric field ($P-E$) was measured using an
interdigital capacitance geometry. The $P-E$ plot shows a clear hysteresis that
confirms the multiferroic nature of the thin films.
