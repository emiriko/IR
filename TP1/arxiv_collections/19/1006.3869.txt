The multivariate Tutte polynomial $\hat Z_M$ of a matroid $M$ is a
generalization of the standard two-variable version, obtained by assigning a
separate variable $v_e$ to each element $e$ of the ground set $E$. It encodes
the full structure of $M$. Let $\bv = \{v_e\}_{e\in E}$, let $K$ be an
arbitrary field, and suppose $M$ is connected. We show that $\hat Z_M$ is
irreducible over $K(\bv)$, and give three self-contained proofs that the Galois
group of $\hat Z_M$ over $K(\bv)$ is the symmetric group of degree $n$, where
$n$ is the rank of $M$. An immediate consequence of this result is that the
Galois group of the multivariate Tutte polynomial of any matroid is a direct
product of symmetric groups. Finally, we conjecture a similar result for the
standard Tutte polynomial of a connected matroid.
