The nonmesonic decay of $\Lambda$-hypernuclei provides access to the
nonleptonic weak decay process $\Lambda N \to NN$, which is achievable only
through the observation of hypernuclear ground-state decays. We continue the
discussion of some specific cases which make it possible to detect a few
exclusive transitions, namely, the stripping of nucleon from the ground state
results in a resonance state decaying via emission of two clusters. Delayed
clusters accompanying weak decay of light hypernuclei give a unique information
on spin dependence of the weak decay matrix elements.
