It is commonly believed that strongly interacting one-dimensional Fermi
systems with gapless excitations are effectively described by Luttinger liquid
theory. However, when the temperature of the system is high compared to the
spin energy, but small compared to the charge energy, the system becomes
"spin-incoherent". We present numerical evidence showing that the
one-dimensional "t-J-Kondo" lattice, consisting of a t-J chain interacting with
localized spins, displays all the characteristic signatures of spin-incoherent
physics, but in the {\it ground state}. We argue that similar physics may be
present in a wide range of strongly interacting systems.
