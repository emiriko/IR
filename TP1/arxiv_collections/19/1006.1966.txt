A prototype of a low cost Adaptive Optics (AO) system has been developed at
the Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia (CSIC) and tested at the 2.2m
telescope of the Calar Alto observatory. We present here the status of the
project, which includes the image stabilization system and compensation of high
order wavefront aberrations with a membrane deformable mirror. The image
stabilization system consists of magnet driven tip-tilt mirror. The higher
order compensation system comprises of a Shack-Hartmann sensor, a membrane
deformable mirror with 39 actuators and the control computer that allows
operations up to 420Hz in closed loop mode. We have successfully closed the
high order AO loop on natural guide stars. An improvement of 4 times in terms
of FWHM was achieved. The description and the results obtained on the sky are
presented in this paper.
