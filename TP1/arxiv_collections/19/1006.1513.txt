Recently Yang et al. [Int. J. Theo. Phys. 48 (2009) 516] have shown that an
unknown qubit can be teleported by using a particular GHZ-like state as quantum
channel. However, there are several errors in the calculation which lead to
incorrect conclusions. The errors have been indicated and corrected. It is also
noted that their scheme and the independently proposed teleportation scheme of
Zhang et al. [Int. J. Theo. Phys. 48 (2009) 3331] uses quantum channel from the
same family and any state of that family may be used for teleportation.
