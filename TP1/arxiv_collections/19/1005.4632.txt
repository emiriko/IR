Four-top production and top pair production in association with missing
energy at e+e- colliders are sensitive probes of beyond-the-Standard-Model
physics. We consider Standard Model (SM) extensions containing a new U(1)'
which couples preferably to the most massive states of the SM such as the top
quark or Dark Matter but has suppressed couplings to all the light states of
the SM, as inspired by Randall-Sundrum-like setups or theories of partial
fermion compositeness. These simple models are poorly constrained by
experimental data but lead to striking new signatures at colliders. In this
note we consider Z' production in association with a top quark pair in 3 TeV
e+e- collisions at CLIC, leading to interesting four-top final states and
ttbar+missing energy events.
