In this Letter we investigate networks that have been optimized to realize a
trade-off between enhanced synchronization and cost of wire to connect the
nodes in space. Analyzing the evolved arrangement of nodes in space and their
corresponding network topology a class of small world networks characterized by
spatial and network modularity is found. More precisely, for low cost of wire
optimal configurations are characterized by a division of nodes into two
spatial groups with maximum distance from each other, whereas network
modularity is low. For high cost of wire, the nodes organize into several
distinct groups in space that correspond to network modules connected on a
ring. In between, spatially and relationally modular small world networks are
found.
