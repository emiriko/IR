Anomalous X-ray Pulsars and Soft Gamma-Ray Repeaters have been generally
recognized as neutron stars with super strong magnetic fields, namely
"magnetars". The "magnetars" manifest that the luminosity in X-ray band are
larger than the rotational energy loss rate, i.e. $L_{X}>\dot {E}_{\rm rot}$,
and then the radiation energy is coming from the energy of magnetic field. Here
it is argued that magnetars may not really exist. Some X-ray and radio
observational results are contradicted with the magnetar model.
  (1) The X-ray luminosity of PSR J1852+0040 is much larger than the rotational
energy loss rate ($L_{X}/\dot {E}_{\rm rot}\simeq 18)$, but the magnetic field
is just $3.1\times 10^{11}$ G. Does this X-ray radiation energy come from the
magnetic field?
  (2) In contrast to the above, the magnetic fields of radio pulsars J1847-0130
and PSR J1718-3718 are higher than that of AXP 1E 2259+586, why is the
radiation energy of those two radio pulsars still coming from rotational
energy? Furthermore, the magnetic field of the newly discovered SGR 0418+5729
with the lowest magnetic field is 3.0 e13 G, lower than the critical magnetic
field $B_{\rm C}=4.414$ e13 G) (Esposito et al. 2010).
  (3) Some "magnetars" also emit normal transient radio pulses, what is the
essential difference between radio pulsars and the "magnetars"?
  The observational fact arguments will be presented at first, then we discuss
in what situation the conventional method to obtain magnetic field could not be
correct.
