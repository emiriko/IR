We present the results of an exploratory study of broad line region (BLR)
metallicity in 34 2.2 < z < 4.6 quasars with far-infrared (FIR) luminosities
(L_FIR) from 10^13.4 to 10^12.1 L_\odot . Quasar samples sorted by L_FIR might
represent an evolutionary sequence if the star formation rates (SFRs) in quasar
hosts generally diminish across quasar lifetimes. We use rest-frame ultraviolet
spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to construct three composite spectra
sorted by L_FIR, corresponding to average SFRs of 4980, 2130 and 340 M_\odot
yr^-1 after correcting for a nominal quasar FIR contribution. The measured N V
{\lambda} 1240/C IV {\lambda} 1550 and Si IV {\lambda} 1397+O IV] {\lambda}
1402/C IV {\lambda} 1550 emission line ratios indicate super-solar BLR
metallicities in all three composites, with no evidence for a trend with the
star formation rate. The formal derived metallicities, Z ~ 5-9 Z_\odot , are
similar to those derived for the BLRs of other quasars at similar redshifts and
luminosities. These results suggest that the ongoing star formation in the host
is not responsible for the metal enrichment of the BLR gas. Instead, the BLR
gas must have been enriched before the visible quasar phase. These results for
high quasar metallicities, regardless of L_FIR, are consistent with evolution
scenarios wherein visibly bright quasars appear after the main episode(s) of
star formation and metal enrichment in the host galaxies. Finally, young
quasars, those more closely associated with a recent merger or a blowout of gas
and dust, may exhibit tracers of these events, such as redder continuum slopes
and higher incidence of narrow absorption lines. With the caveat of small
sample sizes, we find no relation between L_FIR and the reddening or the
incidence of absorption lines.
