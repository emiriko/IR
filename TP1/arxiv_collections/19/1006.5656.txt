Given a Dirichlet eigenfunction of a 2D quantum billiard, the boundary domain
count is the number of intersections of the nodal lines with the boundary. We
study the integer sequence defined by these numbers, sorted according to the
energies of the eigenfunctions. Based on a variant of Berry's random wave
model, we derive a semi-classical trace formula for the sequence of boundary
domain counts. The formula consists of a Weyl-like smooth part, and an
oscillating part which depends on classical periodic orbits and their geometry.
The predictions of this trace formula are supported by numerical data computed
for the Africa billiard.
