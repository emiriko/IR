We prove Manin's conjecture for two del Pezzo surfaces of degree four which
are split over Q and whose singularity types are respectively 3A_1 and A_1+A_2.
For this, we study a certain restricted divisor function and use a result about
the equidistribution of its values in arithmetic progressions. In this task,
Weil's bound for Kloosterman sums plays a key role.
