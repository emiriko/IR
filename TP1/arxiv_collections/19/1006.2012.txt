The goal of this paper is to specify dynamic term structure models with
discrete tenor structure for credit portfolios in a top-down setting driven by
time-inhomogeneous L\'evy processes. We provide a new framework, conditions for
absence of arbitrage, explicit examples, an affine setup which includes
contagion and pricing formulas for STCDOs and options on STCDOs. A calibration
to iTraxx data with an extended Kalman filter shows an excellent fit over the
full observation period. The calibration is done on a set of CDO tranche
spreads ranging across six tranches and three maturities.
