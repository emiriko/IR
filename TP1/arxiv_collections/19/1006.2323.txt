We present a phenomenological study for the production of the Higgs boson at
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD via the vector boson fusion (VBF)
process. After a general discussion about the different production channels of
the Higgs, we show results for hadron colliders like LHC and Tevatron in VBF.
The theoretical predictions are obtained using the structure function approach.
This approximation turns out to be more accurate than the precision to which
the VBF Higgs production channel can be considered a well defined process by
itself and the theoretical uncertainty are of the order of 1-2%. The
uncertainties due to parton distributions are also discussed and are estimated
to be at the same level.
