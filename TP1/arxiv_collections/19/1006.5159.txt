We have used the expansion process of hot milk, which has similarities with
the cosmic expansion, to facilitate easier and better visualization and
teaching of cosmological concepts. Observations of the milk are used to
illustrate phenomena related to the Planck era, the standard hot big bang
model, cosmic inflation, problems with the formation of structure, and other
subjects. This innovative and easily implemented demonstration can enhance the
learning of cosmological concepts.
