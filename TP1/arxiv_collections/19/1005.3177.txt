A number of ideas and questions related to the construction of quantum
processes are discussed. Quantum state extension, entanglement and asymptotic
behaviour of the entropy are some of the issues explored. These topics are
studied in more detail for a class of quantum processes known as finitely
correlated states. Several examples of such processes are presented,
specifically a Free Fermionic model.
