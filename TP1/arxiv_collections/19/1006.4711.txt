We introduce a class of central symmetric infinitely divisible probability
measures on compact Lie groups by lifting the characteristic exponent from the
real line via the Casimir operator. The class includes Gauss, Laplace and
stable-type measures. We find conditions for such a measure to have a smooth
density and give examples. The Hunt semigroup and generator of convolution
semigroups of measures are represented as pseudo-differential operators. For
sufficiently regular convolution semigroups, the transition kernel has a
tractable Fourier expansion and the density at the neutral element may be
expressed as the trace of the Hunt semigroup. We compute the short time
asymptotics of the density at the neutral element for the Cauchy distribution
on the $d$-torus, on SU(2) and on SO(3), where we find markedly different
behaviour than is the case for the usual heat kernel.
