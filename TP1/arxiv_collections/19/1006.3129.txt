We examine bound orbits of particles around singly rotating black rings. We
show that there exist stable bound orbits in toroidal spiral shape near the
axis of the ring, and also exist stable circular orbits on the axis as special
cases. The stable bound orbits can have arbitrary large size if the thickness
of the ring is less than a critical value.
