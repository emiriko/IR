Most extragalactic jets in radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei are bright and
variable gamma-ray sources, which are continuously monitored with Fermi/LAT. We
present the gamma-ray properties of the MOJAVE and TANAMI AGN samples of
radio-loud AGN. Both programs provide properties of the parsec-scale radio jets
using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) techniques. This information is
important to understand the broad-band emission mechanism of these sources. In
this work we compare the radio and gamma -ray properties of the two samples and
present upper limits on the gamma-ray flux of the radio-brightest jet sources
not yet detected by Fermi/LAT.
