In this article we study the Ces\`{a}ro operator $$
\mathcal{C}(f)(z)=\frac{1}{z}\int_{0}^{z}f(\zeta)\,d\zeta, $$ and its companion
operator $\mathcal{T}$ on Hardy spaces of the upper half plane. We identify
$\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ as resolvents for appropriate semigroups of
composition operators and we find the norm and the spectrum in each case. The
relation of $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ with the corresponding Ces\`{a}ro
operators on Lebesgue spaces $L^p(\R)$ of the boundary line is also discussed.
