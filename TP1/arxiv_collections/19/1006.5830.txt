Magnetic measurements on optimally doped single crystals of
BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_2$ ($x\approx0.35$) with magnetic fields applied
along different crystallographic axes were performed under pressure, enabling
the pressure evolution of coherence lengths and the anisotropy factor to be
followed. Despite a decrease in the superconducting critical temperature, our
studies reveal that the superconducting properties become more anisotropic
under pressure. With appropriate scaling, we directly compare these properties
with the values obtained for BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_2$ as a function of
phosphorus content.
