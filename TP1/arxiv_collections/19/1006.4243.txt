We construct an analytical model derived from nuclear reaction theory and
having a simple functional form to demonstrate the quantitative agreement with
the measured cross sections for neutron induced reactions. The neutron-nucleus
total, reaction and scattering cross sections, for energies ranging from 5 to
700 MeV and for several nuclei spanning a wide mass range are estimated.
Systematics of neutron scattering cross sections on various materials for
neutron energies upto several hundred MeV are important for ADSS applications.
The reaction cross sections of neutrons are useful for determining the neutron
induced fission yields in actinides and pre-actinides. The present model based
on nuclear reaction theory provides good estimates of the total cross section
for neutron induced reaction.
