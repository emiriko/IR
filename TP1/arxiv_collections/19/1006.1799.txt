A two-dimensional generalized hydrodynamics (GH) model is developed to study
the full spectrum of both longitudinal and transverse dust acoustic waves (DAW)
in strongly coupled complex (dusty) plasmas, with memory-function-formalism
being implemented to enforce high-frequency sum rules. Results are compared
with earlier theories (such as quasi-localized charge approximation and its
extended version) and with a self-consistent Brownian dynamics simulation. It
is found that the GH approach provides good account, not only for dispersion
relations, but also for damping rates of the DAW modes in a wide range of
coupling strengths, an issue hitherto not fully addressed for dusty plasmas.
