The modification of the Vlasov equation, in its standard form describing a
charged particle distribution in the six-dimensional phase space, is derived
explicitly within a formal Hamiltonian approach for arbitrarily curved
spacetime. The equation accounts simultaneously for the Lorentz force and the
effects of general relativity, with the latter appearing as the gravity force
and an additional force due to the extrinsic curvature of spatial
hypersurfaces. For an arbitrary spatial metric, the equations of collisionless
hydrodynamics are also obtained in the usual three-vector form.
