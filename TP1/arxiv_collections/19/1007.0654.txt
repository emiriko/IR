Rabi waves have been experimentally registered for the first time by Raman
scattering studies of zigzag nanotubes, produced by high energy ion beam
modification of natural diamond single crystals. Antiferroelectric spin wave
resonance has been detected for the first time in Raman spectroscopy practice
in given samples. Substantial qualitative and quantitative changes in Raman
spectra in dependence on propagation direction of laser excitation wave have
been found.
