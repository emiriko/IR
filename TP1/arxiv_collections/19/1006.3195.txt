An electrodeposition cell is used to sustain a destabilizing concentration
difference of copper ions in aqueous solution between the top and bottom
boundaries of the cell. The resulting convecting motion is analogous to
Rayleigh-B\'enard convection at high Prandtl numbers. In addition, a
stabilizing temperature gradient is imposed across the cell. Even for thermal
buoyancy two orders of magnitude smaller than chemical buoyancy, the presence
of the weak stabilizing gradient has a profound effect on the convection
pattern. Double diffusive fingers appear in all cases. The size of these
fingers and the flow velocities are independent of the height of the cell, but
they depend on the ion concentration difference between top and bottom
boundaries as well as on the imposed temperature gradient. The scaling of the
mass transport is compatible with previous results on double diffusive
convection.
