We provide an account of some of the mathematics of Bott periodicity and the
Atiyah, Bott, Shapiro construction. We apply these ideas to understanding the
twisted bundles of electron bands that underly the properties of topological
insulators, spin Hall systems, and other topologically interesting materials.
