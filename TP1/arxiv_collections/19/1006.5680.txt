We present an analysis of 18 short-cadence (SC) transit lightcurves of
TrES-2b using quarter 0 (Q0) and quarter 1 (Q1) from the Kepler Mission. The
photometry is of unprecedented precision, 237ppm per minute, allowing for the
most accurate determination of the transit parameters yet obtained for this
system. Global fits of the transit photometry, radial velocities and known
transit times are used to obtain a self-consistent set of refined parameters
for this system, including updated stellar and planetary parameters. Special
attention is paid to fitting for limb darkening and eccentricity. We place an
upper limit on the occultation depth to be <72.9ppm to 3-sigma confidence,
indicating TrES-2b has the lowest determined geometric albedo for an exoplanet,
of Ag<0.146. We also produce a transit timing analysis using Kepler's
short-cadence data and demonstrate exceptional timing precision at the level of
a few seconds for each transit event. With 18 fully-sampled transits at such
high precision, we are able to produce stringent constraints on the presence of
perturbing planets, Trojans and extrasolar moons. We introduce the novel use of
control data to identify phasing effects. We also exclude the previously
proposed hypotheses of short-period TTV and additional transits but find the
hypothesis of long-term inclination change is neither supported nor refuted by
our analysis.
