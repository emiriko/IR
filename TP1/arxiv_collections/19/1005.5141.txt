This paper proposes some extensions to the work on kernels dedicated to
string or time series global alignment based on the aggregation of scores
obtained by local alignments. The extensions we propose allow to construct,
from classical recursive definition of elastic distances, recursive edit
distance (or time-warp) kernels that are positive definite if some sufficient
conditions are satisfied. The sufficient conditions we end-up with are original
and weaker than those proposed in earlier works, although a recursive
regularizing term is required to get the proof of the positive definiteness as
a direct consequence of the Haussler's convolution theorem. The classification
experiment we conducted on three classical time warp distances (two of which
being metrics), using Support Vector Machine classifier, leads to conclude
that, when the pairwise distance matrix obtained from the training data is
\textit{far} from definiteness, the positive definite recursive elastic kernels
outperform in general the distance substituting kernels for the classical
elastic distances we have tested.
