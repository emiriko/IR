We show how the recently proposed Taylor-Lagrange renormalization scheme can
lead to extensions of singular distributions which are reminiscent of the
Pauli-Villars subtraction. However, at variance with the Pauli-Villars
regularization scheme, no infinite mass limit is performed in this scheme. As
an illustration of this mechanism, we consider the calculation of the
self-energy in second order perturbation theory in the Yukawa model, within the
covariant formulation of light-front dynamics. We show in particular how
rotational invariance is preserved in this scheme.
