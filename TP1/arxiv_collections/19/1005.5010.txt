We describe several projects addressing the growth of galaxies and massive
black holes, for which adaptive optics is mandatory to reach high spatial
resolution but is also a challenge due to the lack of guide stars and long
integrations. In each case kinematics of the stars and gas, derived from
integral field spectroscopy, plays a key role. We explain why deconvolution is
not an option, and that instead the PSF is used to convolve a physical model to
the required resolution. We discuss the level of detail with which the PSF
needs to be known, and the ways available to derive it. We explain how
signal-to-noise can limit the resolution achievable and show there are many
science cases that require high, but not necessarily diffraction limited,
resolution. Finally, we consider what requirements astrometry and photometry
place on adaptive optics performance and design.
