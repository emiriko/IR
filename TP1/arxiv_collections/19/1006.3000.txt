We consider the exit problem for small white noise perturbation of a smooth
dynamical system on the plane in the neighborhood of a hyperbolic critical
point. We show that if the distribution of the initial condition has a scaling
limit then the exit distribution and exit time also have a joint scaling limit
as the noise intensity goes to zero. The limiting law is computed explicitly.
The result completes the theory of noisy heteroclinic networks in two
dimensions. The analysis is based on normal forms theory.
