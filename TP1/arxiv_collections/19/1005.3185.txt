The quality of a simulator equipped with a haptic interface is given by the
dynamical properties of its components: haptic interface, simulator and control
system. Some application areas of such kind of simulator like musical
synthesis, animation or more general, instrumental art have specific
requirements as for the "haptic rendering" of small movements that go beyond
the usual haptic interfaces allow. Object properties variability and different
situations of object combination represent important aspects of such type of
application which makes that the user can be interested as much in the
restitution of certain global properties of an entire object domain as in the
restitution of properties that are specific to an isolate object. In the
traditional approaches, the usual criteria are founded on the paradigm of
transparency and are related to the impedance error introduced by the technical
aspects of the system. As a general aim, rather than to minimize these effects,
we look to characterize them by physical metaphors conferring to haptic medium
the role of a tool. This positioning leads to firstly analyze the natural human
object interaction as a simplified evolutive system and then considers its
synthesis in the case of the interactive physical simulation. By means of a
frequential method, this approach is presented for some elementary
configurations of the simulator
