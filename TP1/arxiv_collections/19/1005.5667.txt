We briefly review a subtraction scheme for computing radiative corrections to
QCD jet cross sections that can be defined at any order in perturbation theory.
Hereafter we discuss the computational methods used to evaluate analytically
and numerically the integrated counterterms arising from such a subtraction
scheme. Basically these methods the Mellin-Barnes (MB) representations
technique together with the harmonic summation and the sector decomposition.
