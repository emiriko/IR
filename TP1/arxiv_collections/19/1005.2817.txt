We study a model with Majorana neutrino masses generated through doubly
charged scalars at two-loop level. We give explicit relationships between the
neutrino masses and the same sign dilepton decays of the doubly charged
scalars. In particular, we demonstrate that at the tribimaximal limit of the
neutrino mixings, the absolute neutrino masses and Majorana phases can be
extracted through the measurements of the dilepton modes at colliders.
