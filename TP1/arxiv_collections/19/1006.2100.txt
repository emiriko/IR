We investigate the detectability of neutralino Dark Matter via direct and
indirect searches as well as collider signatures of an $SO(10)$ model with two
intermediate scales. We compare the direct Dark Matter detection cross section
and the muon flux due to neutralino annihilation in the Sun that we obtain in
this model with mSUGRA predictions and with the sensitivity of current and
future experiments. In both cases, we find that the detectability improves as
the model deviates more from mSUGRA. In order to study collider signatures, we
choose two benchmark points that represent the main phenomenological features
of the model: a lower value of $|\mu|$ and reduced third generation sfermion
masses due to extra Yukawa coupling contributions in the Renormalization Group
Equations, and increased first and second generation slepton masses due to new
gaugino loop contributions. We show that measurements at the LHC can
distinguish this model from mSUGRA in both cases, by counting events containing
leptonically decaying $Z^0$ bosons, heavy neutral Higgs bosons, or like--sign
lepton pairs.
