We probe the validity of Crooks' fluctuation relation on the fluctuating
lattice-Boltzmann model (FLBM), a highly simplified lattice model for a thermal
ideal gas. We drive the system between two thermodynamic equilibrium states and
compute the distribution of the work performed. By comparing the distributions
of the work performed during the forward driving and time reversed driving, we
show that the system satisfies Crooks' relation. The results of the numerical
experiment suggest that the temperature and the free energy of the system are
well defined.
