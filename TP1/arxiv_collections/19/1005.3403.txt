In this letter, we investigate the validity of the generalized second law of
thermodynamics of the universe bounded by the event horizon in the holographic
dark energy model. The universe is chosen to be homogeneous and isotropic and
the validity of the first law has been assumed here. The matter in the universe
is taken in the form of non-interacting two fluid system- one component is the
holographic dark energy model and the other component is in the form of dust.
