The readout noise of a H2RG HgCdTe NIR detector from Teledyne is measured at
a temperature T=110K. It is shown that a Fowler mode with n = 240 allows to
reach a noise of 2.63e (single read). A description of the power spectrum in
terms of 3 parameters reproduces the variation of the noise as a function the
number of Fowler samples, as well as its dependence on the periodicity of the
sampling. The variance of the noise decreases with frequency with an effective
power of 0.62 in our measurement domain. The behaviour of the detector under
different experimental conditions can then be predicted.
