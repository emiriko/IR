The $\Upsilon(1S+2S+3S)\to e^{+}e^{-}$ cross section is measured at
mid-rapidity ($y$) in $p+p$ collisions and in d$+Au$ collisions at
center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV with the STAR detector at RHIC. In
$p+p$, the measured cross section is found to be consistent with the world data
trend as a function of $\sqrt{s}$, in agreement with the Color Evaportaion
Model (CEM), and underestimated by the Color Singlet Model (CSM) up to the
Next-to-Leading-Order Quantum Chromodynamics (NLO QCD) calculations. In d+$Au$,
the measured cross section is in agreement with the CEM prediction with
anti-shadowing effects, and the nuclear modification factor indicates that
$\Upsilon(1S+2S+3S)$ production follows binary scaling within the current
uncertainties. These measurements provide a benchmark for the future
measurements of $\Upsilon$ production in $Au+Au$ collisions.
