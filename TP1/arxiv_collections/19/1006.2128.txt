Last years many interesting effects related to incoherent MAR have been
experimentally found, but only few of them were theoretically explained. It was
shown, for example, that if the voltage at the edges of a linear array is $V$
then subgarmonic structures in the current -voltage characteristics appear not
only at usual for nonstationary Josephson effect positions, $V_n=2\Delta/n$,
where $n$ is integer, but also at voltages other than $V_n$. A step towards
description of electron transport in a dirty array of SNS junctions is done in
this letter. It is shown that subgarmonic structures may indeed appear at
``unusual'' voltages.
