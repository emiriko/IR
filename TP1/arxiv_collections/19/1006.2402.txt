We study an underdamped oscillator with shot-noise frequency fluctuations.
The oscillator spectrum is determined by the interference of the
susceptibilities for different eigenfrequencies. Depending on the parameters,
it has a fine structure or displays a single asymmetric peak. For
nano-mechanical resonators with a fluctuating number of attached molecules, the
spectrum is found in a simple analytical form. The results bear on various
types of systems where the reciprocal correlation time of frequency
fluctuations can be comparable to the typical frequency jumps.
