We develop theories of entanglement distribution and of entanglement dynamics
for qudit systems, which incorporate previous qubit formulations. Using
convex-roof extended negativity, we generalize previous qubit results for
entanglement distribution with isotropic states and for entanglement dynamics
with the depolarizing channel, and we establish a relation between these two
types of entanglement networks.
