We explore properties of the value function and existence of optimal stopping
times for functionals with discontinuities related to the boundary of an open
(possibly unbounded) set $\mathcal{O}$. The stopping horizon is either random,
equal to the first exit from the set $\mathcal{O}$, or fixed: finite or
infinite. The payoff function is continuous with a possible jump at the
boundary of $\mathcal{O}$. Using a generalization of the penalty method we
derive a numerical algorithm for approximation of the value function for
general Feller-Markov processes and show existence of optimal or
$\epsilon$-optimal stopping times.
