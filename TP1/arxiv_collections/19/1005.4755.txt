We revisit the pairing symmetry competition in quasi-one-dimensional systems.
We show that spin-triplet s-wave pairing, where the pair is formed by electrons
with different times and has an odd-frequency symmetry, can be realized in
systems with strong one-dimensionality when the strength of charge fluctuation
dominates over spin fluctuation. The present study provides a novel microscopic
mechanism for this exotic pairing originally proposed by Berezinskii in 1974.
