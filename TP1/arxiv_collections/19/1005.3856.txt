Our results complement D. Calegari's result that there are no hyperbolic
once-punctured torus bundles over $S^1$ with trace field having real place. We
exhibit several infinite families of pairs $(-\chi, p)$ such that there exist
hyperbolic surface bundles with over $S^1$ with fiber having $p$ punctures and
Euler characteristic $\chi$ with trace field of having a real place. This
supports our conjecture that there exist such examples for each pair $(-\chi,
p)$ with finitely many known exceptions.
