Neutrino oscillations occur only if it is impossible to determine $\nu$ mass
by using conservation laws on measurements of nucleon-lepton system absorbing
$\nu$. No oscillations if $\nu$ detector is mass spectrometer. Beam is split
into components with different masses entering different counters. For each
event only one counter will click and determine $\nu$ mass. Condensed matter
physics needed to describe the $\nu$ detector, show it is not a mass
spectrometer and identify which properties of the incident $\nu$ are
unobservable. Relativistic quantum field theory can only describe $\nu$ wave
function entering detector but not large uncertain momentum transfers to
detector nor associated energy-momentum asymmetry. Absorption of incident
$\nu$'s with different momenta but same energy leaves no trace of initial $\nu$
momentum difference in finite-size $\nu$ detector with effectively infinite
mass at rest in laboratory. Undetectable recoil-free momentum is transferred to
the detector with negligible energy transfer. The Debye-Waller factor common in
X-ray diffraction by crystals gives probability that absorbing $\nu$'s with
different momenta produce same nucleon-charged-lepton final state. Oscillations
in time described in textbooks as interference between $\nu$ states with
different energies not observable in realistic experiments. Different energy
$\nu$'s not coherent because energy can be determined by measurements on
initial and final states. Experiments detecting $\nu$ produced by $\pi to \mu
\nu$ decay observe no electrons even though $\nu$ mass eigenstates produce
electrons. Electron amplitude canceled by interference between amplitudes from
different $\nu$ mass eigenstates with same energy and different momenta
entering massive detector.
