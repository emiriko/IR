We provide the most general forms of covariant and normalized time operators
and their probability densities, with applications to quantum clocks, the time
of arrival, and Lyapunov quantum operators. Examples are discussed of the
profusion of possible operators and their physical meaning. Criteria to define
unique, optimal operators for specific cases are given.
