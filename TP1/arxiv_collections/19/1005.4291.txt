We report an investigation of perovskite-type SmScO3 and NdScO3 single
crystals by Raman scattering in various scattering configurations and at
different wavelengths. The reported Raman spectra, together with the phonon
mode assignment, set the basis for the use of Raman scattering for the
structural investigation of RE-scandates. Further to the phonon signature, a
fluorescence signal is observed for both scandates and is particularly intense
for NdScO3 when using a 488 or 514 nm excitation line. A comparison of Raman
spectra of RE-scandates with literature Raman data on orthorhombic perovskites
shows that the frequency of particular modes scales with the orthorhombic
distortion in terms of the rotation (or tilt) angle of the ScO6 octahedra
