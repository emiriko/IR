The semiclassical quantization of cyclotron orbits for two-dimensional Bloch
electrons in a coupled two band model with a particle-hole symmetric spectrum
is considered. As concrete examples, we study graphene (both mono and bilayer)
and boron nitride. The main focus is on wave effects -- such as Berry phase and
Maslov index -- occurring at order $\hbar$ in the semiclassical quantization
and producing non-trivial shifts in the resulting Landau levels. Specifically,
we show that the index shift appearing in the Landau levels is related to a
topological part of the Berry phase -- which is basically a winding number of
the direction of the pseudo-spin 1/2 associated to the coupled bands --
acquired by an electron during a cyclotron orbit and not to the complete Berry
phase, as commonly stated. As a consequence, the Landau levels of a coupled
band insulator are shifted as compared to a usual band insulator. We also study
in detail the Berry curvature in the whole Brillouin zone on a specific example
(boron nitride) and show that its computation requires care in defining the
"k-dependent Hamiltonian" H(k), where k is the Bloch wavevector.
