We study the analytic properties of the $AdS_5/CFT_4$ Y functions. It is
shown that the TBA equations, including the dressing factor, can be obtained
from the Y-system with some additional information on the square-root
discontinuities across semi-infinite segments in the complex plane. The
Y-system extended by the discontinuity relations constitutes a fundamental set
of local functional constraints that can be easily transformed into integral
form through Cauchy's theorem.
