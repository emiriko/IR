The objective of a SEE mission is to support development of unification
theory by carrying out sensitive gravitational tests capable of determining
whether various alternative theories are compatible with nature. Gravitation is
a key "missing link" in unification theory. Nearly all unification theories
incorporate gravity at a fundamental level, and therefore precise measurements
of gravitational forces will place important constraints on unification
theories. Ground-based gravitational measurements to the accuracy required are
impossible due to the many sources of noise present in the terrestrial
environment. The proposed space-based Satellite Energy Exchange (SEE) mission
will measure several important parameters to an accuracy between 100 and 10,000
times better than current or planned measurement capabilities. It will test for
time variation of the gravitational "constant" G and for violations of the weak
equivalence principle (WEP) and the inverse-square-law (ISL), and it will
determine G. It is well-known that the discovery of breakdowns in WEP or ISL
and the possible determination of a time-varying G would have significant
consequences on virtually all aspects of unification theory.
