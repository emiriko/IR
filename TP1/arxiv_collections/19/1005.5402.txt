It is well established that both total and spectral solar irradiance are
modulated by variable magnetic activity on the solar surface. However, there is
still disagreement about the contribution of individual solar features for
changes in the solar output, in particular over decadal time scales. Ionized Ca
II K line spectroheliograms are one of the major resources for these long-term
trend studies, mainly because such measurements have been available now for
more than 100 years. In this paper we introduce a new Ca II K plage and active
network index time series derived from the digitization of almost 40,000
photographic solar images that were obtained at the 60-foot solar tower,
between 1915 and 1985, as a part of the monitoring program of the Mount Wilson
Observatory. We describe here the procedure we applied to calibrate the images
and the properties of our new defined index, which is strongly correlated to
the average fractional area of the visible solar disk occupied by plages and
active network. We show that the long-term variation of this index is in an
excellent agreement with the 11-year solar cycle trend determined from the
annual international sunspot numbers series. Our time series agrees also very
well with similar indicators derived from a different reduction of the same
data base and other \caii K spectroheliograms long-term synoptic programs, such
as those at Kodaikanal Observatory (India), and at the National Solar
Observatory at Sacramento Peak (USA). Finally, we show that using appropriate
proxies it is possible to extend this time series up to date, making this data
set one of the longest Ca II K index series currently available.
