We present a new model of radiative neutrino mass generation wherein TeV
scale leptoguark scalars induce tiny neutrino masses as two-loop radiative
corrections. The neutrino oscillation parameter \sin^2\theta_{13} is predicted
to be close to the current experimental limit within the model. Rare lepton
flavor violating processes mediated by leptoquarks have an interesting pattern:
\mu -> e \gamma$ may be suppressed, while \mu -> 3 e and \mu-e conversion in
nuclei are within reach of the next generation experiments. New CP violating
contributions to B_s- \bar{B}_s mixing via leptoquark box diagrams are in a
range that can explain the recently reported discrepancy with the standard
model. D_s^- -> \ell^- \nu decays mediated by leptoquarks brings theory and
experiment closer, removing an observed 2 sigma anomaly. Muon g-2 receives new
positive contributions, which can resolve the discrepancy between theory and
experiment. The leptoquarks of the model are accessible to the LHC, and their
decay branching ratios probe neutrino oscillation parameters.
