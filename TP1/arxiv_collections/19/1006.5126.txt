We present optical and X-ray properties for the first confirmed galaxy
cluster sample selected by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect from 148 GHz maps over
455 square degrees of sky made with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. These
maps, coupled with multi-band imaging on 4-meter-class optical telescopes, have
yielded a sample of 23 galaxy clusters with redshifts between 0.118 and 1.066.
Of these 23 clusters, 10 are newly discovered. The selection of this sample is
approximately mass limited and essentially independent of redshift. We provide
optical positions, images, redshifts and X-ray fluxes and luminosities for the
full sample, and X-ray temperatures of an important subset. The mass limit of
the full sample is around 8e14 Msun, with a number distribution that peaks
around a redshift of 0.4. For the 10 highest significance SZE-selected cluster
candidates, all of which are optically confirmed, the mass threshold is 1e15
Msun and the redshift range is 0.167 to 1.066. Archival observations from
Chandra, XMM-Newton, and ROSAT provide X-ray luminosities and temperatures that
are broadly consistent with this mass threshold. Our optical follow-up
procedure also allowed us to assess the purity of the ACT cluster sample.
Eighty (one hundred) percent of the 148 GHz candidates with signal-to-noise
ratios greater than 5.1 (5.7) are confirmed as massive clusters. The reported
sample represents one of the largest SZE-selected sample of massive clusters
over all redshifts within a cosmologically-significant survey volume, which
will enable cosmological studies as well as future studies on the evolution,
morphology, and stellar populations in the most massive clusters in the
Universe.
