The main objective of this paper is to control the geometry of null cones
with time foliation in Einstein vacuum spacetime under the assumptions of small
curvature flux and a weaker condition on the deformation tensor for $\bT$. We
establish a series of estimates on Ricci coefficients, which plays a crucial
role to prove the improved breakdown criterion in [12].
