The disciplines of asteroseismology and extrasolar planet science overlap
methodically in the branch of high-precision photometric time series
observations. Light curves are, amongst others, useful to measure intrinsic
stellar variability due to oscillations, as well as to discover and
characterize those extrasolar planets that transit in front of their host
stars, periodically causing shallow dips in the observed brightness. Both
fields ultimately derive fundamental parameters of stellar and planetary
objects, allowing to study for example the physics of various classes of
pulsating stars, or the variety of planetary systems, in the overall context of
stellar and planetary system formation and evolution. Both methods typically
also require extensive spectroscopic follow-up to fully explore the dynamic
characteristics of the processes under investigation. In particularly
interesting cases, a combination of observed pulsations and signatures of a
planet allows to characterize a system's components to a very high degree of
completeness by combining complementary information. The planning of the
relevant space missions has consequently converged with respect to science
cases, where at the outset there was primarily a coincidence in instrumentation
and techniques. Whether space- or ground-based, a specific type of stellar
pulsations can themselves be used in an innovative way to search for extrasolar
planets. Results from this additional method at the interface of stellar
pulsation studies and exoplanet hunts in a beyond-mainstream area are
presented.
