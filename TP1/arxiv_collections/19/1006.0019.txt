The Influenza Pandemic of 1918-1919, also called Spanish Flu Pandemic, was
one of the severest pandemics in history. It is thought that the First World
War much influenced the spread of the pandemic. In this paper, we model the
pandemic considering both civil and military traffic. We propose a hybrid model
to determine how the pandemic spread through the world. Our approach considers
both the SEIR-based model for local areas and the network model for global
connection between countries. First, we reproduce the situation in 12
countries. Then, we simulate another scenario: there was no military traffic
during the pandemic, to determine the influence of the influenced of the war on
the pandemic. By considering the simulation results, we find that the influence
of the war varies in countries; in countries which were deeply involved in the
war, the infections were much influenced by the war, while in countries which
were not much engaged in the war, the infections were not influenced by the
war.
