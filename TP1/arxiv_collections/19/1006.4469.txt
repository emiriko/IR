Gamma-ray bursts are usually classified through their high-energy emission
into short-duration and long-duration bursts, which presumably reflect two
different types of progenitors. However, it has been shown on statistical
grounds that a third, intermediate population is needed in this classification
scheme, although an extensive study of the properties of this class has so far
not been done. The large amount of follow-up studies generated during the Swift
era allows us to have a suficient sample to attempt a study of this third
population through the properties of their prompt emission and their
afterglows. Our study is focused on a sample of GRBs observed by Swift during
its first four years of operation. The sample contains those bursts with
measured redshift since this allows us to derive intrinsic properties.
Intermediate bursts are less energetic and have dimmer afterglows than long
GRBs, especially when considering the X-ray light curves, which are on average
one order of magnitude fainter than long bursts. There is a less significant
trend in the redshift distribution that places intermediate bursts closer than
long bursts. Except for this, intermediate bursts show similar properties to
long bursts. In particular, they follow the Epeak vs. Eiso correlation and
have, on average, positive spectral lags with a distribution similar to that of
long bursts. Like long GRBs, they normally have an associated supernova,
although some intermediate bursts have shown no supernova component. This study
shows that intermediate bursts are different from short bursts and, in spite of
sharing many properties with long bursts, there are some differences between
them as well. We suggest that the physical difference between intermediate and
long bursts could be that for the first the ejecta are thin shells while for
the latter they are thick shells.
