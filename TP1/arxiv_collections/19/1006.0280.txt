We study the Brownian motion (BM) of optically trapped graphene flakes. These
orient orthogonal to the light polarization, due to the optical constants
anisotropy. We explain the flake dynamics, measure force and torque constants
and derive a full electromagnetic theory of optical trapping. The understanding
of two dimensional BM paves the way to light-controlled manipulation and
all-optical sorting of biological membranes and anisotropic macromolecules.
