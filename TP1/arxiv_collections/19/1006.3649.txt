Solvent-mediated solid-solid phase transformations often result in the
formation of a porous medium, which may be stable on long time scales or
undergo ripening and consolidation. We have studied replace- ment processes in
the KBr-KCl-H2O system using both in situ and ex situ experiments. The
replacement of a KBr crystal by a K(Br,Cl) solid solution in the presence of an
aqueous solution is facilitated by the gen- eration of a surprisingly stable,
highly anisotropic and connected pore structure that pervades the product
phase. This pore structure ensures efficient solute transport from the bulk
solution to the reacting KBr and K(Br,Cl) surfaces. The compositional profile
of the K(Br,Cl) solid solu- tion exhibits striking discontinuities across
disc-like cavities in the product phase. Similar transformation mechanisms are
probably important in con- trolling phase transformation processes and rates in
a variety of natural and man-made systems.
