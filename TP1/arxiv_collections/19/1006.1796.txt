The timing capabilities and sensitivity of Kepler, NASA's observatory to find
Earth-sized planets within the habitable zone of stars, are well matched to the
timescales and amplitudes of accretion disk variability in cataclysmic
variables. This instrumental combination provides an unprecedented opportunity
to test and refine stellar accretion paradigms with high-precision, uniform
data, containing none of the diurnal or season gaps that limit ground-based
observations. We present a 3-month, 1 minute cadence Kepler light curve of V344
Lyr, a faint, little-studied dwarf nova within the Kepler field. The light
curve samples V344 Lyr during five full normal outbursts and one superoutburst.
Surprisingly, the superhumps found during superoutburst continue to be detected
during the following quiescent state and normal outburst. The fractional excess
of superhump period over the presumed orbital period suggests a relatively high
binary mass ratio in a system where the radius of the accretion disk must vary
by less than 2% in order to maintain tidal precession throughout the extended
episode of superhumping. Disk radius is less restricted if the quiescent signal
identified tentatively as the orbital period is a negative superhump, generated
by a retrograde-precessing accretion disk, tilted with respect to the binary
orbital plane.
