Using a ladder-rainbow kernel previously established for the soft scale of
light quark hadrons, we explore the extension to masses and electroweak decay
constants of ground state pseudoscalar and vector quarkonia and heavy-light
mesons in the c- and b-quark regions. We make a systematic study of the
effectiveness of a constituent mass concept as a replacement for a heavy quark
dressed propagator. The difference between vector and axial vector current
correlators is examined to estimate the four quark chiral condensate. The
valence quark distributions, in the pion and kaon, defined in deep inelastic
scattering, and measured in the Drell Yan process, are investigated with the
same ladder-rainbow truncation of the Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter
equations.
