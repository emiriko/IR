In the present letter, we consider the DeBroglie-Bohm interpretation of
quantum Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models in the presence of a negative
cosmological constant and cosmic strings. We compute the Bohm's trajectories
and quantum potentials for a quantity related to the scale factor. Then, we
compare our results with the ones already in the literature, where the many
worlds interpretation of the same models was used.
