Coherent conversion between a Raman pump field and its Stokes field is
observed in a Raman process with a strong atomic spin wave initially prepared
by another Raman process operated in the stimulated emission regime. The
oscillatory behavior resembles the Rabi oscillation in atomic population in a
two-level atomic system driven by a strong light field. The Rabi-like
oscillation frequency is found to be related to the strength of the pre-built
atomic spin wave. High conversion efficiency of 40% from the Raman pump field
to the Stokes field is recorded and it is independent of the input Raman pump
field. This process can act as a photon frequency multiplexer and may find wide
applications in quantum information science.
