In recent years it has become widely accepted that a dynamical length scale
{\xi}_{\alpha} plays an important role in supercooled liquids near the glass
transition. We examine the implications of the interplay between the growing
{\xi}_{\alpha} and the size of the crystal nucleus, {\xi}_M, which shrinks on
cooling. We argue that at low temperatures where {\xi}_{\alpha} > {\xi}_M a new
crystallization mechanism emerges enabling rapid development of a large scale
web of sparsely connected crystallinity. Though we predict this web percolates
the system at too low a temperature to be easily seen in the laboratory, there
are noticeable residual effects near the glass transition that can account for
several previously observed unexplained phenomena of deeply supercooled liquids
including Fischer clusters, and anomalous crystal growth near T_g.
