We report the discovery of thermal X-ray emission from the youngest Galactic
supernova remnant G1.9+0.3, from a 237-ks Chandra observation. We detect strong
K-shell lines of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe. In addition, we detect a 4.1 keV line
with 99.971% confidence which we attribute to 44Sc, produced by electron
capture from 44Ti. Combining the data with our earlier Chandra observation
allows us to detect the line in two regions independently. For a remnant age of
100 yr, our measured total line strength indicates synthesis of $(1 - 7) \times
10^{-5}$ solar masses of 44Ti, in the range predicted for both Type Ia and
core-collapse supernovae, but somewhat smaller than the $2 \times 10^{-4}$
solar masses reported for Cas A. The line spectrum indicates supersolar
abundances. The Fe emission has a width of about 28,000 km/s, consistent with
an age of about 100 yr and with the inferred mean shock velocity of 14,000 km/s
deduced assuming a distance of 8.5 kpc. Most thermal emission comes from
regions of lower X-ray but higher radio surface brightness. Deeper observations
should allow more detailed spatial mapping of scandium, with significant
implications for models of nucleosynthesis in Type Ia supernovae.
