Static analysis by abstract interpretation aims at automatically proving
properties of computer programs. To do this, an over-approximation of program
semantics, defined as the least fixpoint of a system of semantic equations,
must be computed. To enforce the convergence of this computation, widening
operator is used but it may lead to coarse results. We propose a new method to
accelerate the computation of this fixpoint by using standard techniques of
numerical analysis. Our goal is to automatically and dynamically adapt the
widening operator in order to maintain precision.
