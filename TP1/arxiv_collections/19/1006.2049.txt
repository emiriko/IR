We present the analysis of simultaneous multi-frequency Very Large Array
(VLA) observations of 57 out of 61 sources from the ``faint'' high frequency
peaker (HFP) sample carried out in various epochs. Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) data have been used to identify the optical counterpart of each radio
source. From the analysis of the multi-epoch spectra we find that 24 sources do
not show evidence of spectral variability, while 12 objects do not possess a
peaked spectrum anymore at least in one of the observing epochs. Among the
remaining 21 sources showing some degree of variability, we find that in 8
objects the spectral properties change consistently with the expectation for a
radio source undergoing adiabatic expansion. The comparison between the
variability and the optical identification suggests that the majority of radio
sources hosted in galaxies likely represent the young radio source population,
whereas the majority of those associated with quasars are part of a different
population similar to flat-spectrum objects, which possess peaked spectra
during short intervals of their life, as found in other samples of
high-frequency peaking objects. The analysis of the optical images from the
SDSS points out the presence of companions around 6 HFP hosted in galaxies,
suggesting that young radio sources resides in groups.
