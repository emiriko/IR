In this paper we evaluate the expression for the Green function of a
pseudo-classical spinning particle interacting with constant electromagnetic
external fields by taking into account the anomalous magnetic and electric
moments of the particle. The spin degrees of freedom are described in terms of
Grassmann variables and the evolution operator is obtained through the
Fock-Schwinger proper time method.
