This paper attempts to undertake the study of segmentation image techniques
by using five threshold methods as Mean method, P-tile method, Histogram
Dependent Technique (HDT), Edge Maximization Technique (EMT) and visual
Technique and they are compared with one another so as to choose the best
technique for threshold segmentation techniques image. These techniques applied
on three satellite images to choose base guesses for threshold segmentation
image.
