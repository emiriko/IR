It can be shown in a solvable field theory model that the couplings of the
composite vector bosons made of a fermion pair approach the gauge couplings in
the limit of strong binding. Although this phenomenon may appear accidental and
special to the vector boson made of a fermion pair, we extend it to the case of
bosons being constituents and find that the same phenomenon occurs in more an
intriguing way. The functional formalism not only facilitates computation but
also provides us with a better insight into the generating mechanism of
approximate gauge symmetry, in particular, how the strong binding and global
current conservation conspire to generate such an approximate symmetry. Remarks
are made on its possible relevance or irrelevance to electroweak and higher
symmetries.
