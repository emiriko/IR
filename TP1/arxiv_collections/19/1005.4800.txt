The possibility to describe the astrophysical S-factor of the 4He12C
radiative capture is considered in the potential cluster model at the energy
range 0.1-4.0 MeV. It is shown that the approach used, which takes into account
E2 transitions only, gives a good description of the new experimental data for
adjusted parameters of potentials and leads to the value S(300) =
16.0$\cdotp$keV b.
