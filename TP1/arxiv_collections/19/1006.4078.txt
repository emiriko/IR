The possibility of intrinsic superconductivity in alkali-coated graphene
monolayers has been recently suggested theoretically. Here, we derive the
possible pairing symmetries of a carbon honeycomb lattice and discuss their
phase diagram. We also evaluate the superconducting local density of states
(LDOS) around an isolated impurity. This is directly related to scanning
tunneling microscopy experiments, and may evidence the occurrence of
unconventional superconductivity in graphene.
