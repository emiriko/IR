Effective Riemann space effect of vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics is
considered in the context of theory for unified gravitation and
electromagnetism. The electromagnetic four-vector potential in the scope of
Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics model is considered as the unified field.
The electromagnetic interaction appears naturally in the first perturbation
order by the small field of distant material objects. The gravitational
interaction appears naturally in the appropriate second order. In this case the
effective metric components contain the corresponding energy-momentum tensor
components for quick-oscillating electromagnetic field of the distant objects.
