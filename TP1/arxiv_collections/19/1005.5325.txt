Using the isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamical (IQMD) model, we
systematically study the role of momentum dependent interactions in global
stopping and analyze the effect of symmetry energy in the presence of momentum
dependent interactions. For this, we simulate the reactions by varying the
total mass of the system from 80 to 394 at different beam energies from 30 to
1000 MeV/nucleon over central and semi-central geometries. The study is carried
in the presence of momentum dependent interactions and symmetry energy by
taking into account hard equation of state. The nuclear stopping is found to be
sensitive towards the momentum dependent interactions and symmetry energy at
low incident energies. The momentum dependent interactions are found to weaken
the finite size effects in nuclear stopping.
