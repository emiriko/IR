We consider deflection of polarizable molecules by inhomogeneous optical
fields, and analyze the role of molecular orientation and rotation in the
scattering process. It is shown that molecular rotation induces spectacular
rainbow-like features in the distribution of the scattering angle. Moreover, by
preshaping molecular angular distribution with the help of short and strong
femtosecond laser pulses, one may efficiently control the scattering process,
manipulate the average deflection angle and its distribution, and reduce
substantially the angular dispersion of the deflected molecules. We provide
quantum and classical treatment of the deflection process. The effects of
strong deflecting field on the scattering of rotating molecules are considered
by the means of the adiabatic invariants formalism. This new control scheme
opens new ways for many applications involving molecular focusing, guiding and
trapping by optical and static fields.
