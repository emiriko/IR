A new type of redescending M-estimators is constructed, based on data
augmentation with an unspecified outlier model. Necessary and sufficient
conditions for the convergence of the resulting estimators to the Hubertype
skipped mean are derived. By introducing a temperature parameter the concept of
deterministic annealing can be applied, making the estimator insensitive to the
starting point of the iteration. The properties of the annealing M-estimator as
a function of the temperature are explored. Finally, two applications are
presented. The first one is the robust estimation of interaction vertices in
experimental particle physics, including outlier detection. The second one is
the estimation of the tail index of a distribution from a sample using robust
regression diagnostics.
