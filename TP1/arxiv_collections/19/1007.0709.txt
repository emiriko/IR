The continuous nematic to smectic-A (N-SmA) phase transition has been studied
by high-resolution ac-calorimetry in binary mixtures of the liquid crystal
octylcyanobiphenyl(8CB) and a non-mesogenic, low-molecular weight, solvent
n-hexane(hex) as a function of temperature and solvent concentration. Heating
and cooling scans about the N-SmA transition temperature were repeatedly
performed on pure and six 8CB+hex samples having hexane molar concentration
ranging from x_{hex}= 0.02 to 0.12. All 8CB+hex samples in this range of
x_{hex} remain macroscopically miscible and exhibit an N-SmA heat capacity peak
that shifts non-monotonically to lower temperature and evolves in shape, with a
reproducible hysteresis, as x_{hex} increases. The imaginary part of heat
capacity remains zero up to x^{TCP}_{hex}\simeq 0.07$ above which the distinct
peak is observed, corresponding to a jump in both the real and imaginary
enthalpy. A simple power-law analysis reveals an effective exponent that
increases smoothly from 0.30 to 0.50 with an amplitude ratio
A^{-}/A^{+}\rightarrow 1 as x_{hex}\rightarrow x^{TCP}_{hex}. This observed
crossover towards the N-SmA tricritical point driven by solvent concentration
is consistent with previous results and can be understood as weakening of the
liquid crystal intermolecular potential promoting increased nematic
fluctuations.
