Despite many important applications of a-Fe2O3 and Fe doped SnO2 in
semiconductors, catalysis, sensors, clinical diagnosis and treatments, one
fundamental issue that is crucial to these applications remains theoretically
equivocal- the reversible carrier-type transition between n- and p-type
conductivities during gas-sensing operations. Here, we give unambiguous and
rigorous theoretical analysis in order to explain why and how the oxygen
vacancies affect the n-type semiconductors, a-Fe2O3 and Fe doped SnO2 in which
they are both electronically and chemically transformed into a p-type
semiconductor. Furthermore, this reversible transition also occurs on the oxide
surfaces during gas-sensing operation due to physisorbed gas molecules (without
any chemical reaction). We make use of the ionization energy theory and its
renormalized ionic displacement polarizability functional to reclassify,
generalize and to explain the concept of carrier-type transition in solids, and
during gas-sensing operation. The origin of such a transition is associated to
the change in ionic polarizability and the valence states of cations in the
presence of (a) oxygen vacancies and (b) physisorped gas molecules.
