In this paper, we analyze the behavior of statistical complexity in several
systems where two identical densities that travel in opposite direction cross
each other. Besides the crossing between two Gaussian, rectangular and
triangular densities studied in a previous work, we also investigate in detail
the crossing between two exponential and two gamma distributions. For all these
cases, the shape of the total density presenting an extreme value in complexity
is found.
