Modeling of forests' vegetation in North Eurasia has been performed for
1982-2006 on the basis of remote sensing data. Four meteorological parameters
and one parameter, characterizing geomagnetic field disturbance level, were
used for this aim. It was found out that revealed formula is adequate both for
coniferous evergreen and coniferous deciduous forests for accuracy to a
coefficient. The most proper parameters' combination gives the correlation
coefficients ~ 0.9 between modeling parameter and original data rows. These
results could solve problems of climate-forests feedbacks' investigations and
be useful for dendrological aims.
