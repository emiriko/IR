A Bianchi type-VI cosmological model in the presence of a magnetic flux
together with a cloud of cosmic strings is considered. In general, the presence
of a magnetic field imposes severe restrictions regarding the consistency of
the field equations. These difficulties could be overtaken working either in a
Bianchi type-VI$_0$ spacetime or assuming a particular coordinate-dependence of
the magnetic field. Using a few plausible assumptions regarding the
parametrization of the cosmic strings, some exact analytical solutions are
presented. Their asymptotic behavior for large time is exhibited.
