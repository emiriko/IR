We analyze localization of light in honeycomb photonic lattices restricted in
one dimension which can be regarded as an optical analog of (``armchair'' and
``zigzag'') graphene nanoribbons. We find the conditions for the existence of
spatially localized states and discuss the effect of lattice topology on the
properties of discrete solitons excited inside the lattice and at its edges. In
particular, we discover a novel type of soliton bistability, the so-called
geometry-induced bistability, in the lattices of a finite extent.
