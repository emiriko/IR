We consider the random graph M^n_{\bar{p}} on the set [n], were the
probability of {x,y} being an edge is p_{|x-y|}, and \bar{p}=(p_1,p_2,p_3,...)
is a series of probabilities. We consider the set of all \bar{q} derived from
\bar{p} by inserting 0 probabilities to \bar{p}, or alternatively by decreasing
some of the p_i. We say that \bar{p} hereditarily satisfies the 0-1 law if the
0-1 law (for first order logic) holds in M^n_{\bar{q}} for any \bar{q} derived
from \bar{p} in the relevant way described above. We give a necessary and
sufficient condition on \bar{p} for it to hereditarily satisfy the 0-1 law.
