We consider the decay of metastable walls and strings populated by additional
degrees of freedom. The examples involve the decay of an axion wall in an
external magnetic field, pionic walls, metastable walls in dense QCD. It is
shown that the induced fermions escape from the wall during the decay process
providing an example of the chiral magnetic effect. An absolute stabilization
of metastable and unstable walls in a large magnetic field is found. A possible
higher dimensional generalization of the chiral magnetic effect is mentioned.
