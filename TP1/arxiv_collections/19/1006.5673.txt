We measure the photoluminescence (PL) lifetime, $\tau$, of excitons in
colloidal PbSe nanocrystals (NCs) at low temperatures to 270~mK and in high
magnetic fields to 15~T. For all NCs (1.3-2.3~nm radii), $\tau$ increases
sharply below 10~K but saturates by 500~mK. In contrast to the usual picture of
well-separated ``bright" and ``dark" exciton states (found, e.g., in CdSe NCs),
these dynamics fit remarkably well to a system having two exciton states with
comparable - but small - oscillator strengths that are separated by only
300-900 $\mu$eV. Importantly, magnetic fields reduce $\tau$ below 10~K,
consistent with field-induced mixing between the two states. Magnetic circular
dichroism studies reveal exciton g-factors from 2-5, and magneto-PL shows
$>$10\% circularly polarized emission.
