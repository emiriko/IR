We study the mechanical unfolding pathways of the $FnIII_{10}$ domain of
fibronectin by means of an Ising--like model, using both constant force and
constant velocity protocols. At high forces and high velocities our results are
consistent with experiments and previous computational studies. Moreover, the
simplicity of the model allows us to probe the biologically relevant low force
regime, where we predict the existence of two intermediates with very close
elongations. The unfolding pathway is characterized by stochastic transitions
between these two intermediates.
