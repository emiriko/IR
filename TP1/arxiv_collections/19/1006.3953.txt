We studied the edge states and transverse electron focusing in the presence
of spin-orbit interaction in a two dimensional electron gas. Assuming strong
spin-orbit coupling we derived semiclassical quantization conditions to
describe the dispersion of the edge states. Using the dispersion relation we
then make predictions about certain properties of the focusing spectrum.
Comparison of our analytical results with quantum mechanical transport
calculations reveals that certain features of the focusing spectrum can be
quite well understood in terms of the interference of the edge states while the
explanation of other features seems to require a different approach.
