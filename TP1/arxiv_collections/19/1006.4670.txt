We investigate the statistical mechanics of chirality and biaxiality in
liquid crystals through a variety of theoretical approaches, including Monte
Carlo simulations, lattice mean-field theory, and Landau theory. All of these
calculations show that there is an important interaction between cholesteric
twist and biaxial order: The twist acts as a field on the biaxial order, and
conversely, the biaxial order increases the twist, i.e. reduces the pitch. We
model the behavior of chiral biaxial liquid crystals as a function of
temperature, and discuss how the predictions can be tested in experiments.
