The temperature and frequency dependences of the optical conductivity of Co
and Ni-doped BaFe2As2 are analyzed and the electron-boson spectral density
a2F(w) extracted using Eliashberg's formalism. The characteristic energy of a
large peak in the spectrum around 10 meV coincide with the resonance peak in
the spin excitation spectra, giving compelling evidence that in iron-based
superconductors spin fluctuations strongly couple to the charge carriers and
mediate superconductivity. In addition the spectrum is found to evolve with
temperature towards a less structured background at higher energies as in the
spin susceptibility.
