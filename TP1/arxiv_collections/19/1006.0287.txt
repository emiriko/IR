Aims. Recent ATCA, XMM-Newton and MCELS observations of the Magellanic Clouds
(MCs) cover a number of new and known SNRs which are poorly studied, such as
SNR J0528-6714 . This particular SNR exhibits luminous radio-continuum
emission, but is one of the unusual and rare cases without detectable optical
and very faint X-ray emission (initially detected by ROSAT and listed as object
[HP99] 498). We used new multi-frequency radio-continuum surveys and new
optical observations at H{\alpha}, [S ii] and [O iii] wavelengths, in
combination with XMM-Newton X-ray data, to investigate the SNR properties and
to search for a physical explanation for the unusual appearance of this SNR.
  Methods. We analysed the X-ray and Radio-Continuum spectra and present
multi-wavelength morphological studies of this SNR.
  Results. We present the results of new moderate resolution ATCA observations
of SNR J0528-6714. We found that this object is a typical older SNR with a
radio spectral index of {\alpha}=-0.36 \pm 0.09 and a diameter of D=52.4 \pm
1.0 pc. Regions of moderate and somewhat irregular polarisation were detected
which are also indicative of an older SNR. Using a non-equilibrium ionisation
collisional plasma model to describe the X-ray spectrum, we find temperatures
kT of 0.26 keV for the remnant. The low temperature, low surface brightness,
and large extent of the remnant all indicate a relatively advanced age. The
near circular morphology indicates a Type Ia event.
  Conclusions. Our study revealed one of the most unusual cases of SNRs in the
Local Group of galaxies - a luminous radio SNR without optical counterpart and,
at the same time, very faint X-ray emission. While it is not unusual to not
detect an SNR in the optical, the combination of faint X-ray and no optical
detection makes this SNR very unique.
