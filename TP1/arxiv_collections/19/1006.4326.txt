In this work, we study the target detection and tracking problem in mobile
sensor networks, where the performance metrics of interest are probability of
detection and tracking coverage, when the target can be stationary or mobile
and its duration is finite. We propose a physical coverage-based mobility
model, where the mobile sensor nodes move such that the overlap between the
covered areas by different mobile nodes is small. It is shown that for
stationary target scenario the proposed mobility model can achieve a desired
detection probability with a significantly lower number of mobile nodes
especially when the detection requirements are highly stringent. Similarly,
when the target is mobile the coverage-based mobility model produces a
consistently higher detection probability compared to other models under
investigation.
