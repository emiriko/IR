This paper presents a novel type-2 Fuzzy logic System to define the Shape of
a facial component with the crisp output. This work is the part of our main
research effort to design a system (called FASY) which offers a novel face
construction approach based on the textual description and also extracts and
analyzes the facial components from a face image by an efficient technique. The
Fuzzy model, designed in this paper, takes crisp value of width and height of a
facial component and produces the crisp value of Shape for different facial
components. This method is designed using Matlab 6.5 and Visual Basic 6.0 and
tested with the facial components extracted from 200 male and female face
images of different ages from different face databases.
