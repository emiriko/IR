Based on original investigations into the stages of nucleation and growth of
martensite, a consideration has been given to dynamic models of formation of
martensite plates with a fine structure of transformation twins, which are
compatible with the supersonic growth rate of martensite crystals. Along with
relatively long quasi-longitudinal waves, which determine the orientation of
the habit plane, the control wave process includes relatively short
longitudinal waves, which act in synchronism and control the growth of the main
component of a regular twin structure. Preference is given to a model
containing, at the initial moment of time, the only active dynamic cell capable
of periodic reproduction in the interphase region at the stage of the
martensite crystal growth. Conditions providing the ratio between the
components of the twin structure, which would be optimal for minimization of
the transformation time, have been discussed. A transition to final
deformations, which are two to three orders of magnitude larger than the
threshold deformations, have been made. The calculated macroscopic
morphological attributes, which were deduced from dynamic considerations, have
been compared with the experimental data and crystallogeometrical calculation.
