Software Development is a core second-year course currently offered to
undergraduate students at Victoria University at its five local and
international campuses. The project aims to redesign the existing course
curriculum to support student-centred teaching and learning. It is intended to
provide a learning context in which learners can reflect on new material,
discuss their tentative understandings with others, actively search for new
information, develop skills in communication and collaboration, and build
conceptual connections to their existing knowledge base. The key feature of the
cross-campus curriculum innovation is the use of Blackboard, short for
Blackboard Learning System, to assist in course content organization and online
delivery. A well-defined and integrated case study is used throughout the
course to provide realistic practical experience of software development. It
allows students to take control of their own learning while at the same time
providing support to those students who have particular learning difficulties.
In this paper, the developed curriculum and the learning outcome are described.
The e-Learning material and various Blackboard tools used for teaching and
learning activities are presented. Finally, conclusion is drawn from classroom
experience.
