The presented paper is a review of papers on the microcosm physics
geometrization in the last twenty years. These papers develop a new direction
of the microcosm physics. It is so-called geometric paradigm, which is
alternative to the quantum paradigm, which is conventionally used now. The
hypothesis on discreteness of the space-time geometry appears to be more
fundamental, than the hypothesis on quantum nature of microcosm. Discrete
space-time geometry admits one to describe quantum effects as pure geometric
effects. Mathematical technique of the microcosm physics geometrization
(geometric paradigm) is based on the physical geometry, which is described
completely by the world function. Equations, describing motion of particles in
the microcosm, are algebraic (not differential) equations. They are written in
a coordinateless form in terms of world function. The geometric paradigm
appeared as a result of overcoming of inconsistency of the conventional
elementary particle theory. In the suggested skeleton conception the state of
an elementary particle is described by its skeleton (several space-time
points). The skeleton contains all information on the particle properties
(mass, charge, spin, etc.). The skeleton conception is a monistic construction,
where elementary particle motion is described in terms of skeleton and world
function and only in these terms. The skeleton conception can be constructed
only on the basis of the physical geometry. Unfortunately, most mathematicians
do not accept the physical geometries, because these geometries are
nonaxiomatizable. It is a repetition of the case, when mathematicians did not
accept the non-Euclidean geometries of Lobachevsky-Bolyai. As a result this
review is a review of papers of one author.
