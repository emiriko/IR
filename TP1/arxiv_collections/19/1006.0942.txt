By using a previously developed phenomenological kernel for the study of the
light quark QCD sector and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking effects we will
examine the relative infrared and ultraviolet QCD dynamics for J=0,1 meson
properties. For the same reasons we extend and explore a quark mass depended
generalization of the kernel in the heavy quark region and we also compare with
the original model. The relation between the dynamics of the quark propagator
and the effective kernel with the J=0,1 QQ and qQ mesons and quarks Compton
size is also discussed.
