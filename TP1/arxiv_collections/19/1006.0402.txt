We show that the computational complexity of Riemann mappings can be bounded
by the complexity needed to compute conformal mappings locally at boundary
points. As a consequence we get first formally proven upper bounds for
Schwarz-Christoffel mappings and, more generally, Riemann mappings of domains
with piecewise analytic boundaries.
