Over the past decade the study of solar-like oscillations in red-giant stars
has developed significantly. Not only the number of red-giant stars for which
solar-like oscillations have been observed has increased, but the quality of
these observations has improved as well. These steps forward were possible
thanks to the development of instrumentation to measure radial velocity
variations with a precision of the order of m/s, as well as the launch of
dedicated space missions, which provide timeseries of data with unprecedented
photometric precision. Many more exciting discoveries are to be expected in the
(near) future. This article provides an overview of the development of the
field over the last decade, discusses difficulties encountered and overcome in
interpreting the observational data, and addresses some challenges and
opportunities for further research.
