Under Windows operating system, existing I/O benchmarking tools does not
allow a developer to efficiently define a file access strategy according to the
applications' constraints. This is essentially due to the fact that the
existing tools do allow only a restricted set of I/O workloads that does not
generally correspond to the target applications. To cope with this problem, we
designed and implemented a precise I/O simulator allowing to simulate whatever
real I/O trace on a given defined architecture, and in which most of file and
disk cache strategies, their interactions and the detailed storage system
architecture are implemented. Simulation results on different workloads and
architectures show a very high degree of precision. In fact, the mean error
rate as compared to real measures is of about 6% with a maximum of 10% on
global throughput.
