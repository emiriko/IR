The production of $W^\pm$ bosons in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions
at RHIC provides a new means of studying the spin-flavour asymmetries of the
proton sea quark spin distributions. Details of the W$^\pm$ event selection
through the $e^\pm$ decay channel at mid-rapidity are presented, along with
preliminary results for the production cross section and parity-violating
single-spin asymmetry, $A_L$, from the STAR Collaboration's 2009 data set at
$\sqrt{s} = 500$ GeV. Lastly, the expected sensitivities for future running are
discussed.
