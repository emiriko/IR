Gradient index sonic lenses based on two-dimensional sonic crystals are here
designed, fabricated and characterized. The index-gradient is achieved in these
type of flat lenses by a gradual modification of the sonic crystal filling
fraction along the direction perpendicular to the lens axis. The focusing
performance is well described by an analytical model based on ray theory as
well as by numerical simulations based on the multiple-scattering theory.
