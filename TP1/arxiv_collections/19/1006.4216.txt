We propose a continuous variable quantum key distribution protocol based on
discrete modulation of eight-state coherent states. We present a rigorous
security proof against the collective attacks considering both of realistic
lossy, noisy quantum channels, imperfect detector efficiency, and detector
electronic noise. This protocol shows high tolerance against excess noise and
it is promising to achieve hundreds distance long in optical fiber base.
