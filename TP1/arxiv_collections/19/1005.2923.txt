The goal of the Herschel Open Time Key programme "TNOs are Cool!" is to
derive the physical and thermal properties for a large sample of Centaurs and
trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), including resonant, classical, detached and
scattered disk objects. We present results for seven targets either observed in
PACS point-source, or in mini scan-map mode. Spitzer-MIPS observations were
included for three objects. The sizes of these targets range from 100 km to
almost 1000 km, five have low geometric albedos below 10%, (145480) 2005 TB190
has a higher albedo above 15%. Classical thermal models driven by an
intermediate beaming factor of $\eta$=1.2 or $\eta$-values adjusted to the
observed colour temperature fit the multi-band observations well in most cases.
More sophisticated thermophysical models give very similar diameter and albedo
values for thermal inertias in the range 0-25 Jm-2s-0.5K-1, consistent with
very low heat conductivities at temperatures far away from the Sun. The early
experience with observing and model strategies will allow us to derive physical
and thermal properties for our complete Herschel TNO sample of 140 targets as a
benchmark for understanding the solar system debris disk, and extra-solar ones
as well.
