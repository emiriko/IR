We calculate the set of O(alpha_s^2) corrections to the branching ratio and
to the photon energy spectrum of the decay process B -> X_s gamma originating
from the interference of diagrams involving the electromagnetic dipole operator
O_7 with diagrams involving the chromomagnetic dipole operator O_8. The
corrections evaluated here are one of the elements needed to complete the
calculations of the B -> X_s gamma branching ratio at next-to-next-to-leading
order in QCD. We conclude that this set of corrections does not change the
central value of the Standard Model prediction for Br(B -> X_s gamma) by more
than 1 %.
