We complete the coordinate space calculation of the three-parton correlation
in the two-loop massive soft anomalous dimension matrix. The full answer agrees
with the result found previously by a different approach. The coordinate space
treatment of renormalized two-loop gluon exchange diagrams exhibits their color
symmetries in a transparent fashion. We compare coordinate space calculations
of the soft anomalous dimension matrix with massive and massless eikonal lines
and examine its nonuniform limit at absolute threshold.
