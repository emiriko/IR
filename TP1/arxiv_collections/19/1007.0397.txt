We demonstrate the first deterministic entanglement of two individually
addressed neutral atoms using a Rydberg blockade mediated controlled-NOT gate.
Parity oscillation measurements reveal an entanglement fidelity of
$F=0.58\pm0.04$, which is above the entanglement threshold of $F=0.5$, without
any correction for atom loss, and $F=0.71\pm0.05$ after correcting for
background collisional losses. The fidelity results are shown to be in good
agreement with a detailed error model.
