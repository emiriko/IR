Evidence is presented indicating that in the hard state of Cygnus X-1, the
coronal mag- netic field might be below equipartition with radiation
(suggesting that the corona is not powered by magnetic field dissipation) and
that the ion temperature in the corona is significantly lower than what
predicted by ADAF like models. It is also shown that the current estimates of
the jet power set interesting contraints on the jet velocity (which is at least
mildly relativistic), the accretion efficiency (which is large in both spectral
states), and the nature of the X-ray emitting region (which is unlikely to be
the jet).
