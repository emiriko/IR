We present Herschel far-infrared (FIR) observations of two sub-mm bright
quasars at high redshift: SDSS J1148+5251 (z=6.42) and BR 1202-0725 (z=4.69)
obtained with the PACS instrument. Both objects are detected in the PACS
photometric bands. The Herschel measurements provide additional data points
that constrain the FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of both sources,
and they emphasise a broad range of dust temperatures in these objects. For
lambda_rest ~< 20mu, the two SEDs are very similar to the average SEDs of
quasars at low redshift. In the FIR, however, both quasars show excess emission
compared to low-z QSO templates, most likely from cold dust powered by vigorous
star formation in the QSO host galaxies. For SDSS J1148+5251 we detect another
object at 160mu with a distance of ~10 arcseconds from the QSO. Although no
physical connection between the quasar and this object can be shown with the
available data, it could potentially confuse low-resolution measurements, thus
resulting in an overestimate of the FIR luminosity of the z=6.42 quasar.
