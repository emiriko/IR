We perform multi-dimensional radiative transfer simulations to compute
spectra for a hydrodynamical simulation of a line-driven accretion disk wind
from an active galactic nucleus. The synthetic spectra confirm expectations
from parameterized models that a disk wind can imprint a wide variety of
spectroscopic signatures including narrow absorption lines, broad emission
lines and a Compton hump. The formation of these features is complex with
contributions originating from many of the different structures present in the
hydrodynamical simulation. In particular, spectral features are shaped both by
gas in a successfully launched outflow and in complex flows where material is
lifted out of the disk plane but ultimately falls back. We also confirm that
the strong Fe Kalpha line can develop a weak, red-skewed line wing as a result
of Compton scattering in the outflow. In addition, we demonstrate that X-ray
radiation scattered and reprocessed in the flow has a pivotal part in both the
spectrum formation and determining the ionization conditions in the wind. We
find that scattered radiation is rather effective in ionizing gas which is
shielded from direct irradiation from the central source. This effect likely
makes the successful launching of a massive disk wind somewhat more challenging
and should be considered in future wind simulations.
