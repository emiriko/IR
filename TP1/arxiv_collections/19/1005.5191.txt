The correlations between stripe order, superconductivity, and crystal
structure in La(2-x)Ba(x)CuO(4) single crystals have been studied by means of
x-ray and neutron diffraction as well as static magnetization measurements. The
derived phase diagram shows that charge stripe order (CO) coexists with bulk
superconductivity in a broad range of doping around x=1/8, although the CO
order parameter falls off quickly for x<>1/8. Except for x=0.155, the onset of
CO always coincides with the transition between the orthorhombic and the
tetragonal low temperature structures. The CO transition evolves from a sharp
drop at low x to a more gradual transition at higher x, eventually falling
below the structural phase boundary for optimum doping. With respect to the
interlayer CO correlations, we find no qualitative change of the stripe
stacking order as a function of doping, and in-plane and out-of-plane
correlations disappear simultaneously at the transition. Similarly to the CO,
the spin stripe order (SO) is also most pronounced at x=1/8. Truly static SO
sets in below the CO and coincides with the first appearance of in-plane
superconducting correlations at temperatures significantly above the bulk
transition to superconductivity (SC). Indications that bulk SC causes a
reduction of the spin or charge stripe order could not be identified. We argue
that CO is the dominant order that is compatible with SC pairing but competes
with SC phase coherence. Comparing our results with data from the literature,
we find good agreement if all results are plotted as a function of x' instead
of the nominal x, where x' represents an estimate of the actual Ba content,
extracted from the doping dependence of the structural transition between the
orthorhombic phase and the tetragonal high-temperature phase.
