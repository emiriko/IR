In this second part, we generalize the results of the previous paper. We
present an analytic superwind solution considering extended
gravitationally-interacting dark-matter and baryonic haloes. The incorporation
of the latter is critical, since they can have a substantial effect on the
hydrodynamics of superwinds generated by massive galaxies. Although the
presence of extended and massive haloes does not change the limit for the
closed-box enrichment of galaxies established in the first paper, they can
trigger an earlier activation of the open-box enrichment scenario, since their
gravitational potentials can contribute to the inhibition of the free
superwind. Moreover, the incorporation of the extended haloes will also enhance
the physical setting behind the superwind model, as we consider mass
distributions with properties that emulate the results of recent simulations of
$\Lambda$CDM haloes.
