We consider the maximization of the long-term growth rate in the
Black-Scholes model under proportional transaction costs as in Taksar, Klass
and Assaf [Math. Oper. Res. 13, 1988]. Similarly as in Kallsen and Muhle-Karbe
[Ann. Appl. Probab., 20, 2010] for optimal consumption over an infinite
horizon, we tackle this problem by determining a shadow price, which is the
solution of the dual problem. It can be calculated explicitly up to determining
the root of a deterministic function. This in turn allows to explicitly compute
fractional Taylor expansions, both for the no-trade region of the optimal
strategy and for the optimal growth rate.
