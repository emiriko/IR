Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) support data collection and distributed data
processing by means of very small sensing devices that are easy to tamper and
cloning: therefore classical security solutions based on access control and
strong authentication are difficult to deploy. In this paper we look at the
problem of assessing security of node localization. In particular, we analyze
the scenario in which Verifiable Multilateration (VM) is used to localize nodes
and a malicious node (i.e., the adversary) try to masquerade as non-malicious.
We resort to non-cooperative game theory and we model this scenario as a
two-player game. We analyze the optimal players' strategy and we show that the
VM is indeed a proper mechanism to reduce fake positions.
