The Suarez-Scarani model is a non-covariant (frame-dependent) relativistic
(time-ordered causal) nonlocal extension of quantum theory, which is not
refuted by the experiments proposed in Reference [arXiv:1005.5173v1]. The
covariant extensions considered in this Reference are actually
self-contradictory and do not require experimental falsification.
