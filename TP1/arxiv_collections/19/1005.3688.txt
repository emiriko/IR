In my talk I will present an overview of our recent work involving the use of
supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY-QM). I begin by discussing the
mathematical underpinnings of SUSY-QM and then discuss how we have used this
for developing novel theoretical and numerical approaches suitable for studying
molecular systems. I will conclude by discussing our attempt to extend SUSY-QM
to multiple dimensions.
