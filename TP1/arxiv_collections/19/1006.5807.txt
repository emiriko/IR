We analyze the avalanche size distribution of the Abelian Manna model on two
different fractal lattices with the same dimension d_g=ln(3)/ln(2), with the
aim to probe for scaling behavior and to study the systematic dependence of the
critical exponents on the dimension and structure of the lattices. We show that
the scaling law D(2-tau)=d_w generalizes the corresponding scaling law on
regular lattices, in particular hypercubes, where d_w=2. Furthermore, we
observe that the lattice dimension d_g, the fractal dimension of the random
walk on the lattice d_w, and the critical exponent D, form a plane in 3D
parameter space, i.e. they obey the linear relationship D=0.632(3) d_g +
0.98(1) d_w - 0.49(3).
