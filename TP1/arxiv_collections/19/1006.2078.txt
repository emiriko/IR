I review recent progress in theoretical calculations related to the CKM
unitarity triangle. After briefly discussing hints for new physics in
B_d-B_d-bar mixing and B_s-B_s-bar mixing I present three topics of MSSM flavor
physics: First I discuss new tan-beta-enhanced radiative corrections to
flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) amplitudes which go beyond the familiar
Higgs-mediated FCNC diagrams and may enhance the mixing-induced CP asymmetry in
B_d -> phi K_S. The second topic is a reappraisal of the idea that flavor
violation originates from the soft supersymmetry-breaking terms. Finally I
discuss how mu -> e gamma can be used to constrain the flavor structure of the
dimension-5 Yukawa interactions which appear in realistic grand unified
theories.
