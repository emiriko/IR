Synchrotron X-ray total scattering studies of structural changes in rutile
VO2 at the metal-insulator transition temperature of 340 K reveal that
monoclinic and tetragonal phases of VO2 coexist in equilibrium, as expected for
a first-order phase transition. No evidence for any distinct intermediate phase
is seen. Unbiased local structure studies of the changes in V--V distances
through the phase transition, using reverse Monte Carlo methods, support the
idea of phase coexistence and point to the high degree of correlation in the
dimerized low-temperature structure. No evidence for short range V--V
correlations that would be suggestive of local dimers is found in the metallic
phase.
