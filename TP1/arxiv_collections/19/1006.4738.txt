The possibility to produce superheavy elements in the course of low-yield
nuclear explosions is analyzed within a simple kinetic model which includes
neutron capture, gamma-emission, fission and particle evaporation from excited
nuclei. We have calculated average numbers of absorbed neutrons as well as mass
distributions of U and Cm nuclei exposed to an impulsive neutron flux, as
functions of its duration. It is demonstrated that detectable amounts of heavy
nuclei absorbing from 20 to 60 neutrons may be produced in this process.
According to an optimistic scenario, after multiple beta-decay such nuclei may
reach the long-living elements of the predicted ``island of stability''.
