Full jet reconstruction allows access to the parton kinematics over a large
energy domain and can be used to constrain the mechanisms of energy loss in
heavy-ion collisions. Such measurements are challenging at RHIC, due to the
high-multiplicity environments created in heavy-ion collisions. In these
proceedings, we report an overview of the results on full jet reconstruction
obtained by the STAR experiment. Jet measurements in 200 GeV p+p show that jets
are calibrated pQCD probes and provide a baseline for jet measurements in Au+Au
collisions. Inclusive differential jet production cross sections and ratios are
reported for central 200 GeV Au+Au collisions and compared to p+p. We also
present measurements of fully reconstructed di-jets at mid-rapidity, and
compare spectra and fragmentation functions in p+p and central Au+Au
collisions.
