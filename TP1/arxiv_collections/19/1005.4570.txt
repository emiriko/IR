This paper is concerned with SIR (susceptible $\to$ infected $\to$ removed)
household epidemic models in which the infection response may be either mild or
severe, with the type of response also affecting the infectiousness of an
individual. Two different models are analysed. In the first model, the
infection status of an individual is predetermined, perhaps due to partial
immunity, and in the second, the infection status of an individual depends on
the infection status of its infector and on whether the individual was infected
by a within- or between-household contact. The first scenario may be modelled
using a multitype household epidemic model, and the second scenario by a model
we denote by the infector-dependent-severity household epidemic model. Large
population results of the two models are derived, with the focus being on the
distribution of the total numbers of mild and severe cases in a typical
household, of any given size, in the event that the epidemic becomes
established. The aim of the paper is to investigate whether it is possible to
determine which of the two underlying explanations is causing the varying
response when given final size household outbreak data containing mild and
severe cases. We conduct numerical studies which show that, given data on
sufficiently many households, it is generally possible to discriminate between
the two models by comparing the Kullback-Leibler divergence for the two fitted
models to these data.
