It is shown that the theoretical result according to which electrons can be
reflected because of magnetic flux in the Aharonov-Bohm ring contradicts to the
fundamental law of momentum conservation and can not conform with the
Aharonov-Bohm effect. Therefore a publication of Phys. Rev. Lett.
[arXiv:0909.2197] based on this result can not be correct.
