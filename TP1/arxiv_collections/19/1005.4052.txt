In this paper we prove new $(\ell^p, \ell^q)$ bounds for a discrete
fractional integral operator by applying techniques motivated by the circle
method of Hardy and Littlewood to the Fourier multiplier of the operator. From
a different perspective, we describe explicit interactions between the Fourier
multiplier and mean values of Weyl sums. These mean values express the average
behaviour of the number $r_{s,k}(l)$ of representations of a positive integer
$l$ as a sum of $s$ positive $k$-th powers. Recent deep results within the
context of Waring's problem and Weyl sums enable us to prove a further range of
complementary results for the discrete operator under consideration.
