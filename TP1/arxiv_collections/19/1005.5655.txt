The effects of "quark sea" in determining the flavor structure of the octet
baryons have been investigated in the chiral constituent quark model (\chiCQM).
The \chiCQM is able to qualitatively generate the requisite amount of quark sea
and is also known to provide a satisfactory explanation of the proton spin and
related issues in the nonperturbative regime. The Bjorken scaling variable x
has been included phenomenologically in the sea quark distribution functions to
understand its implications on the quark sea asymmetries like \bar d(x)-\bar
(x), \bar d(x)/\bar u(x) and Gottfried integral for the octet baryons. The
results strengthen the importance of quark sea at lower values of x.
