Equilibration of an isolated Fermi gas in one spatial dimension after an
interaction quench is studied. Evaluating Kadanoff-Beym dynamic equations for
correlation functions obtained from the two-particle-irreducible effective
action in nonperturbative approximation, the gas is seen to evolve to states
characterized by thermal as well as nonthermal momentum distributions,
depending on the assumed initial conditions. For total energies near the Fermi
temperature, stationary power laws emerge for the high-momentum tails while at
lower momenta the distributions are of Fermi-Dirac type. The relation found
between fluctuations and dissipation exhibits nonthermal final states.
