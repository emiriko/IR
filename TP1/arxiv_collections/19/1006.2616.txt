Graph states are an elegant and powerful quantum resource for measurement
based quantum computation (MBQC). They are also used for many quantum protocols
(error correction, secret sharing, etc.). The main focus of this paper is to
provide a structural characterisation of the graph states that can be used for
quantum information processing. The existence of a gflow (generalized flow) is
known to be a requirement for open graphs (graph, input set and output set) to
perform uniformly and strongly deterministic computations. We weaken the gflow
conditions to define two new more general kinds of MBQC: uniform
equiprobability and constant probability. These classes can be useful from a
cryptographic and information point of view because even though we cannot do a
deterministic computation in general we can preserve the information and
transfer it perfectly from the inputs to the outputs. We derive simple graph
characterisations for these classes and prove that the deterministic and
uniform equiprobability classes collapse when the cardinalities of inputs and
outputs are the same. We also prove the reversibility of gflow in that case.
The new graphical characterisations allow us to go from open graphs to graphs
in general and to consider this question: given a graph with no inputs or
outputs fixed, which vertices can be chosen as input and output for quantum
information processing? We present a characterisation of the sets of possible
inputs and ouputs for the equiprobability class, which is also valid for
deterministic computations with inputs and ouputs of the same cardinality.
