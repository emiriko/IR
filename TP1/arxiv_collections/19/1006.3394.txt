The Natural Immune System (NIS) is a distributed system that solves
challenging search and response problems while operating under constraints
imposed by physical space and resource availability. Remarkably, NIS search and
response times do not scale appreciably with the physical size of the animal in
which its search is conducted. Many distributed systems are engineered to solve
analogous problems, and the NIS demonstrates how such engineered systems can
achieve desirable scalability. We hypothesize that the architecture of the NIS,
composed of a hierarchical decentralized detection network of lymph nodes (LN)
facilitates efficient search and response. A sub-modular architecture in which
LN numbers and size both scale with organism size is shown to efficiently
balance tradeoffs between local antigen detection and global antibody
production, leading to nearly scale-invariant detection and response. We
characterize the tradeoffs as balancing local and global communication and show
that similar tradeoffs exist in distributed systems like LN inspired artificial
immune system (AIS) applications and peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. Taking
inspiration from the architecture of the NIS, we propose a modular RADAR
(Robust Adaptive Decentralized search with Automated Response) strategy for
distributed systems. We demonstrate how two existing distributed systems (a LN
inspired multi-robot control application and a P2P system) can be improved by a
modular RADAR strategy. Such a sub-modular architecture is shown to balance the
tradeoffs between local communication (within artificial LNs and P2P clusters)
and global communication (between artificial LNs and P2P clusters), leading to
efficient search and response.
