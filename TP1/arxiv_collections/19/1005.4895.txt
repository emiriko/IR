The QR Decomposition (QRD) of communication channel matrices is a fundamental
prerequisite to several detection schemes in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output
(MIMO) communication systems. Herein, the main feature of the QRD is to
transform the non-causal system into a causal system, where consequently
efficient detection algorithms based on the Successive Interference
Cancellation (SIC) or Sphere Decoder (SD) become possible. Also, QRD can be
used as a light but efficient antenna selection scheme. In this paper, we
address the study of the QRD methods and compare their efficiency in terms of
computational complexity and error rate performance. Moreover, a particular
attention is paid to the parallelism of the QRD algorithms since it reduces the
latency of the matrix factorization.
