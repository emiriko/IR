We present an application of Artificial Intelligence techniques to the field
of Information Security. The problem of remote Operating System (OS) Detection,
also called OS Fingerprinting, is a crucial step of the penetration testing
process, since the attacker (hacker or security professional) needs to know the
OS of the target host in order to choose the exploits that he will use. OS
Detection is accomplished by passively sniffing network packets and actively
sending test packets to the target host, to study specific variations in the
host responses revealing information about its operating system.
  The first fingerprinting implementations were based on the analysis of
differences between TCP/IP stack implementations. The next generation focused
the analysis on application layer data such as the DCE RPC endpoint
information. Even though more information was analyzed, some variation of the
"best fit" algorithm was still used to interpret this new information. Our new
approach involves an analysis of the composition of the information collected
during the OS identification process to identify key elements and their
relations. To implement this approach, we have developed tools using Neural
Networks and techniques from the field of Statistics. These tools have been
successfully integrated in a commercial software (Core Impact).
