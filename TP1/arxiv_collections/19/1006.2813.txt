Predicting protein structure from amino acid sequence is one of the most
important unsolved problems of molecular biology and biophysics.Not only would
a successful prediction algorithm be a tremendous advance in the understanding
of the biochemical mechanisms of proteins, but, since such an algorithm could
conceivably be used to design proteins to carry out specific
functions.Prediction of the secondary structure of a protein (alpha-helix,
beta-sheet, coil) is an important step towards elucidating its three
dimensional structure as well as its function. In this research, we use
different Hidden Markov models for protein secondary structure prediction. In
this paper we have proposed an algorithm for predicting protein secondary
structure. We have used Hidden Markov model with sliding window for secondary
structure prediction.The secondary structure has three regular forms, for each
secondary structural element we are using one Hidden Markov Model.
