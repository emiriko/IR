We summarize cm through submm observations of the host galaxies of z ~ 6
quasars. These observations reveal the cool molecular gas (the fuel for star
formation), the warm dust (heated by star formation), the fine structure line
emission (tracing the CNM and PDRs), and the synchrotron emission. Our results
imply active star formation in ~ 30% of the host galaxies, with star formation
rates ~ 10^3 M_sun/year, and molecular gas masses ~ 10^10 M_sun. Imaging of the
[CII] emission from the most distant quasar reveals a 'maximal starburst disk'
on a scale ~ 1.5 kpc. Gas dynamical studies suggest a departure of these
galaxies from the low-z M_{BH} -- M_{bulge} relation, with the black holes
being, on average, 15 times more massive than expected. Overall, we are
witnessing the co-eval formation of massive galaxies and supermassive black
holes within 1 Gyr of the Big Bang.
