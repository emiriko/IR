A powerful method of manipulating the dynamics of quantum coherent particles
is to control the phase of their tunneling. We consider a system of two
electrons hopping on a quasi one-dimensional lattice in the presence of a
uniform magnetic field, and study the effect of adding a time-periodic driving
potential. We show that the dynamical phases produced by the driving can
combine with the Aharonov-Bohm phases to give precise control of the
localization and dynamics of the particles, even in the presence of strong
particle interactions.
