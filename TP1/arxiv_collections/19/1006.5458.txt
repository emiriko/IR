Sterile neutrinos have been invoked to explain the observed neutrino masses,
but they can also have significant implications for cosmology and accelerator
experiments. We explore the collider signatures of a simple extension of the
Standard Model, where sterile neutrinos acquire their mass after electroweak
symmetry breaking, via their coupling to a real singlet Higgs. In this model,
heavy sterile neutrinos can be produced in accelerators from decays of the
Higgs bosons. Their own decay can yield distinct signals, suggesting both the
presence of an extended Higgs sector and the coupling of the singlet fermions
to the latter. In the same scenario, a relic matter abundance arises from the
decay of the singlet Higgs into weakly coupled keV sterile neutrinos. The
coupling of the Higgs doublet to particles outside the Standard Model relaxes
the current experimental bounds on its mass.
