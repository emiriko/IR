WY Per and RW Leo are two Algol-type binaries. Based on our new CCD
observations and the almost century-long historical record of the times of
primary eclipse for WY Per and RW Leo, the orbital period changes and their
explanations were reanalyzed and rediscussed in detail. It is found that the
orbital period of WY Per shows a cyclic oscillation with a period of $P_{3} =
71.5$ yr and a semiamplitude of $A_{3} = 0^{\textrm{d}}.0739$. The period
variation can be interpreted by the light-travel time effect (LTTE) via the
presence of a third body in an eccentric orbit with an eccentricity of $e_{3}
\simeq 0.602$ in the system. For RW Leo, its orbital period shows complex
variations. Two cyclic variations (i.e., $P_{3} = 77.8$ yr and $A_{3} =
0^{\textrm{d}}.033$, and $P_{4} = 39.1$ yr and $A_{4} = 0^{\textrm{d}}.022$)
are discovered. The cyclic variation of $P_{3} = 77.8$ yr and $A_{3} =
0^{\textrm{d}}.033$ can be attributed to the LTTE via the presence of a third
body in an eccentric orbit with an eccentricity of $e_{3} \simeq 0.732$.
