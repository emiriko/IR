The stationary one dimensional Schr\"odinger-Poisson system on a bounded
interval is considered in the limit of a small Debye length (or small
temperature). Electrons are supposed to be in a mixed state with the Boltzmann
statistics. Using various reformulations of the system as convex minimization
problems, we show that only the first energy level is asymptotically occupied.
The electrostatic potential is shown to converge towards a boundary layer
potential with a profile computed by means of a half space
Schr\"odinger-Poisson system.
