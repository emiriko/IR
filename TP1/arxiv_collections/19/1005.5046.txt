Recently, a new type of battery has been proposed that relies on the
principle of self-assembling of a liquid metalloid positive electrode, a liquid
electrolyte, and a liquid metal negative electrode. While this configuration
has been claimed to allow arbitrary up-scaling, there is a size limitation of
such a system due to a current-driven kink-type instability that is known as
the Tayler instability. We characterize this instability in large-scale
self-assembled liquid metal batteries and discuss various technical means how
it can be avoided.
