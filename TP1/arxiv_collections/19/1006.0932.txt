By the end of 2009, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) provided a short run of
pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 900 GeV$. The LHCb
Experiment has taken its first collision data with the aim to finalize the
commissioning of the detector and perform the spatial and time alignments. This
paper presents a collection of preliminary results of the LHCb detector
obtained with the data acquired in this first LHC run. A brief outlook of the
physics expected with the first data in 2010 at 7 TeV centre-of-mass energy is
also presented.
