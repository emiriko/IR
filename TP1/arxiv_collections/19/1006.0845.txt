The topic of this paper is the evaluation of QoS parameters in live Pre-Wimax
environments. The main contribution is the validation of an analytical
delay-jitter behavior model. These models can be used in optimization
algorithms in order to provide opportunistic and reliable all-IP networks. It
allows understanding the impact of the jitter constraints on the throughput and
packet loss in wireless systems. However, we show that the real-time QoS
requirements of real-time and interactive services can be avoided to a large
degree by controlling only the packet delay-jitter in a fixed and mobile
environment. The QoS metrics have been computed from live measurements in a
Pre-Wimax realistic environment (Toulouse/Blagnac Airport).
