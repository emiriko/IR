An accurate simulation of Green's function and self-energy function of
non-interacting electrons in disordered graphenes are performed. Fundamental
physical quantities such as the elastic relaxation time {\tau}e, the phase
velocity vp, and the group velocity vg are evaluated. New features around the
Dirac point are revealed, showing hints that multi-scattering induced
hybridization of Bloch states plays an important role in the vicinity of the
Dirac point.
