Gene duplications are one of major primary driving forces for evolutionary
novelty. We took population genetics models of genes duplicate to study how
evolutionary forces acting during the fixation of mutant allele at duplicate
loci. We study the fixation time of mutant allele at duplicate loci under
double null recessive model (DNR) and haploinsufficient model (HI). And we also
investigate how selection coefficients with other evolutionary force influence
the fixation frequency of mutant allele at duplicate loci. Our results suggest
that the selection plays a role in the evolutionary fate of duplicate genes,
and tight linkage would help the mutant allele preserved at duplicate loci. Our
theoretical simulation agree with the genomics data analysis result well, that
selection, rather than drift, plays a important role in the establishment of
duplicate loci, and recombination have a great opportunity to be acted upon
selection.
