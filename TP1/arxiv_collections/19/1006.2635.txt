With its excellent sensitivity, large field of view, broad energy coverage,
and good per-photon angular resolution, the Large Area Telescope aboard the
Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope satellite provides us with an unprecedented
view of the high-energy Universe, revealing a large diversity of cosmic
particle accelerators that are active at various scales. We present in this
paper a selection of science highlights of the Fermi mission, with particular
emphasis on results that are relevant for cosmic-ray physics. We cover
observations of supernova remnants and studies of interstellar gamma-ray
emission, reaching from the vicinity of the solar system out to the more
distant starburst galaxies.
