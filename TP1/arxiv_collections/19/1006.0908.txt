The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect is reported in a high mobility CdTe
quantum well at mK temperatures. Fully-developed FQH states are observed at
filling factor 4/3 and 5/3 and are found to be both spin-polarized ground state
for which the lowest energy excitation is not a spin-flip. This can be
accounted for by the relatively high intrinsic Zeeman energy in this single
valley 2D electron gas. FQH minima are also observed in the first excited (N=1)
Landau level at filling factor 7/3 and 8/3 for intermediate temperatures.
