The quantum entanglement dynamics of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 anisotropic
XXZ model is studied using the method of the adaptive time-dependent
density-matrix renormalization-group when two cases of quenches are performed
in the system. An anisotropic interaction quench and the maximum number of
domain walls of staggered magnetization quench are considered. The dynamics of
pairwise entanglement between the nearest two qubits in the spin chain is
investigated. The entanglement of the two-spin qubits can be created and
oscillates in both cases of the quench. The anisotropic interaction has a
strong influence on the oscillation frequency of entanglement.
