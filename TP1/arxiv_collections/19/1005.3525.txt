The detector for the MiniBooNE experiment at the Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory employs 1520 8 inch Hamamatsu models R1408 and R5912 photomultiplier
tubes with custom-designed bases. Tests were performed to determine the dark
rate, charge and timing resolutions, double-pulsing rate, and desired operating
voltage for each tube, so that the tubes could be sorted for optimal placement
in the detector. Seven phototubes were tested to find the angular dependence of
their response. After the Super-K phototube implosion accident, an analysis was
performed to determine the risk of a similar accident with MiniBooNE.
