We study the ground state phase diagram of a mixture of bosonic and fermionic
cold atoms confined on two- and three-dimensional optical lattices. The
coupling between bosonic fluctuations and fermionic atoms can be attractive or
repulsive and has similarities with electron-phonon coupling in crystals. We
investigate behavior of the mixtures in the limit, where the Bogoliubov sound
velocity that dictates bosonic dynamics is comparable to the Fermi velocity,
hence the retardation effects are important part of the physics. The dynamic
Lindhard response function of the fermionic density to changes in the bosonic
number of particles above some critical frequency can alter the sign and in
consequence the inter-species interaction between particles becomes repulsive
in contrast to the static limit (instantaneous and always attractive).
Considering the above we show that the structure of the phase diagrams
crucially depends on the difference in masses of the bosons and fermions. We
discuss the situations where integrating out fermionic field provides an
additional interaction that can decrease or increase bosonic coherence.
