In this paper, we propose a cognitive radio based Internet access framework
for disaster response network deployment in challenged environments. The
proposed architectural framework is designed to help the existent but partially
damaged networks to restore their connectivity and to connect them to the
global Internet. This architectural framework provides the basis to develop
algorithms and protocols for the future cognitive radio network deployments in
challenged environments.
