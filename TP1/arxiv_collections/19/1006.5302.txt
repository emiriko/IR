Based on static and dynamical density functional theory, a
phase-field-crystal model is derived which involves both the translational
density and the orientational degree of ordering as well as a local director
field. The model exhibits stable isotropic, nematic, smectic A, columnar,
plastic crystalline and orientationally ordered crystalline phases. As far as
the dynamics is concerned, the translational density is a conserved order
parameter while the orientational ordering is non-conserved. The derived
phase-field-crystal model can serve for efficient numerical investigations of
various nonequilibrium situations in liquid crystals.
