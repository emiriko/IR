Up to now the basic theoretical description of charge extraction by linearly
increasing voltage (CELIV) is solved for a low conductivity approximation only.
Here we present the full analytical solution, thus generalize the theoretical
framework for this method. We compare the analytical solution and the
approximated theory, showing that especially for typical organic solar cell
materials the latter approach has a very limited validity. Photo-CELIV
measurements on poly(3-hexyl thiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid
methyl ester based solar cells were then evaluated by fitting the current
transients to the analytical solution. We found that the fit results are in a
very good agreement with the experimental observations, if ambipolar transport
is taken into account, the origin of which we will discuss. Furthermore we
present parametric equations for the mobility and the charge carrier density,
which can be applied over the entire experimental range of parameters.
