Generalized Parton Distributions describe, within QCD factorization, the non
perturbative component in the amplitudes for deeply virtual exclusive
processes. However, in order for a partonic interpretation to hold,
semi-disconnected diagrams should not contribute. We show that this condition
is not satisfied for non-forward kinematics at leading order, and that gluon
mediated re-interactions are essential for a consistent description in terms of
parton degrees of freedom.
