With the use of the general covariant matrix 10-dimensional Petiau -- Duffin
-- Kemmer formalism in cylindrical coordinates and tetrad there are constructed
exact solutions of the quantum-mechanical equation for a particle with spin 1
in presence of an external homogeneous magnetic field. There are separated
three linearly independent types of solutions; in each case the formula for
energy levels has been found.
