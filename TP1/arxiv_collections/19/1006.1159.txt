We demonstrate that the presence of a supporting substrate can break the
symmetry of a metamaterial structure, changing the symmetry of its effective
parameters, and giving rise to bianisotropy. This indicates that
magneto-electric coupling will occur in all metamaterials fabricated on a
substrate, including those with symmetric designs.
