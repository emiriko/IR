Recently we have introduced a simplified model of ecosystem assembly (Capitan
et al., 2009) for which we are able to map out all assembly pathways generated
by external invasions in an exact manner. In this paper we provide a deeper
analysis of the model, obtaining analytical results and introducing some
approximations which allow us to reconstruct the results of our previous work.
In particular, we show that the population dynamics equations of a very general
class of trophic-level structured food-web have an unique interior equilibrium
point which is globally stable. We show analytically that communities found as
end states of the assembly process are pyramidal and we find that the
equilibrium abundance of any species at any trophic level is approximately
inversely proportional to the number of species in that level. We also find
that the per capita growth rate of a top predator invading a resident community
is key to understand the appearance of complex end states reported in our
previous work. The sign of these rates allows us to separate regions in the
space of parameters where the end state is either a single community or a
complex set containing more than one community. We have also built up
analytical approximations to the time evolution of species abundances that
allow us to determine, with high accuracy, the sequence of extinctions that an
invasion may cause. Finally we apply this analysis to obtain the communities in
the end states. To test the accuracy of the transition probability matrix
generated by this analytical procedure for the end states, we have compared
averages over those sets with those obtained from the graph derived by
numerical integration of the Lotka-Volterra equations. The agreement is
excellent.
