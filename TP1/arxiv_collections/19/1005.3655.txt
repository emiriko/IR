While Bayesian model selection is a useful tool to discriminate between
competing cosmological models, it only gives a relative rather than an absolute
measure of how good a model is. Bayesian doubt introduces an unknown benchmark
model against which the known models are compared, thereby obtaining an
absolute measure of model performance in a Bayesian framework. We apply this
new methodology to the problem of the dark energy equation of state, comparing
an absolute upper bound on the Bayesian evidence for a presently unknown dark
energy model against a collection of known models including a flat LambdaCDM
scenario. We find a strong absolute upper bound to the Bayes factor B between
the unknown model and LambdaCDM, giving B < 3. The posterior probability for
doubt is found to be less than 6% (with a 1% prior doubt) while the probability
for LambdaCDM rises from an initial 25% to just over 50% in light of the data.
We conclude that LambdaCDM remains a sufficient phenomenological description of
currently available observations and that there is little statistical room for
model improvement.
