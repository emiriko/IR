Artificial spin ice has been recently implemented in two-dimensional arrays
of mesoscopic magnetic wires. We propose a theoretical model of magnetization
dynamics in artificial spin ice under the action of an applied magnetic field.
Magnetization reversal is mediated by domain walls carrying two units of
magnetic charge. They are emitted by lattice junctions when the the local field
exceeds a critical value $H_c$ required to pull apart magnetic charges of
opposite sign. Positive feedback from Coulomb interactions between magnetic
charges induces avalanches in magnetization reversal.
