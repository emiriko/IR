We reconsider an inflationary model that inflaton field is non-minimally
coupled to gravity. We study parameter space of the model up to the second (
and in some cases third ) order of the slow-roll parameters. We calculate
inflation parameters in both Jordan and Einstein frames and the results are
compared in these two frames and also with observations. Using the recent
observational data from combined WMAP5+SDSS+SNIa datasets, we study constraint
imposed on our model parameters especially the nonminimal coupling $\xi$.
