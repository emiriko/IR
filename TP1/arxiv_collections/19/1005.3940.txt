The thermoelectric transport through a molecular bridge is discussed, with an
emphasis on the effects of inelastic processes of the transport electrons
caused by the coupling to the vibrational modes of the molecule. In particular
it is found that when the molecule is strongly coupled to a thermal bath of its
own, which may be at a temperature different from those of the electronic
reservoirs, a heat current between the molecule and the electrons can be
converted into electric current. Expressions for the transport coefficients
governing this conversion and similar ones are derived, and a possible scenario
for increasing their magnitudes is outlined.
