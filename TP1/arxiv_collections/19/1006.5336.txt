We perform hydrodynamical calculations of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with
low explosion energies. These SNe do not have enough energy to eject the whole
progenitor and most of the progenitor falls back to the central remnant. We
show that such fallback SNe can have a variety of light curves (LCs) but their
photospheric velocities can only have some limited values with lower limits. We
also perform calculations of nucleosynthesis and LCs of several fallback SN
model, and find that a fallback SN from the progenitor with a main-sequence
mass of 13 Msun can account for the properties of the peculiar Type Ia
supernova SN 2008ha. The kinetic energy and ejecta mass of the model are
1.2*10^{48} erg and 0.074 Msun, respectively, and the ejected 56Ni mass is
0.003 Msun. Thus, SN 2008ha can be a core-collapse SN with a large amount of
fallback. We also suggest that SN 2008ha could have been accompanied with long
gamma-ray bursts and long gamma-ray bursts without associated SNe may be
accompanied with very faint SNe with significant amount of fallback which are
similar to SN 2008ha.
