Renormalization group equations in a two-valley system with valley-splitting
and intervalley scattering are derived in the presence of spin-splitting
induced by a parallel magnetic field. The relevant amplitudes in different
regimes set by the relative strengths of the spin and valley splittings and the
intervalley scattering rate are identified. The range of applicability of the
standard formula for the magnetoconductance is discussed.
