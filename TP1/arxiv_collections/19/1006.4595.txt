How do individuals accumulate wealth as they interact economically? We
outline the consequences of a simple microscopic model in which repeated
pairwise exchanges of assets between individuals build the wealth distribution
of a population. This distribution is determined for generic exchange rules ---
transactions that involve a fixed amount or a fixed fraction of individual
wealth, as well as random or greedy exchanges. In greedy multiplicative
exchange, a continuously evolving power law wealth distribution arises, a
feature that qualitatively mimics empirical observations.
