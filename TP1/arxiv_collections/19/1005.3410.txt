We consider a random walk on one-dimensional inhomogeneous graphs built from
Cantor fractals. Our study is motivated by recent experiments that demonstrated
superdiffusion of light in complex disordered materials, thereby termed L\'evy
glasses. We introduce a geometric parameter $\alpha$ which plays a role
analogous to the exponent characterizing the step length distribution in random
systems. We study the large-time behavior of both local and average
observables; for the latter case, we distinguish two different types of
averages, respectively over the set of all initial sites and over the
scattering sites only. The "single long jump approximation" is applied to
analytically determine the different asymptotic behaviours as a function of
$\alpha$ and to understand their origin. We also discuss the possibility that
the root of the mean square displacement and the characteristic length of the
walker distribution may grow according to different power laws; this anomalous
behaviour is typical of processes characterized by L\'evy statistics and here,
in particular, it is shown to influence average quantities.
