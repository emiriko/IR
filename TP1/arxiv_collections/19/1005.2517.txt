The molecular gas in the DR21 massive star formation region is known to be
affected by the strong UV field from the central star cluster and by a fast
outflow creating a bright shock. The relative contribution of both heating
mechanisms is the matter of a long debate. By better sampling the excitation
ladder of various tracers we provide a quantitative distinction between the
different heating mechanisms. HIFI observations of mid-J transitions of CO and
HCO+ isotopes allow us to bridge the gap in excitation energies between
observations from the ground, characterizing the cooler gas, and existing ISO
LWS spectra, constraining the properties of the hot gas. Comparing the detailed
line profiles allows to identify the physical structure of the different
components. In spite of the known shock-excitation of H2 and the clearly
visible strong outflow, we find that the emission of all lines up to > 2 THz
can be explained by purely radiative heating of the material. However, the new
Herschel/HIFI observations reveal two types of excitation conditions. We find
hot and dense clumps close to the central cluster, probably dynamically
affected by the outflow, and a more widespread distribution of cooler, but
nevertheless dense, molecular clumps.
