We propose the implementation of an electronic Veselago lens on the
conducting surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator (such as
Bi2Te3). The negative refraction needed for such a flat lens results from the
sign change of the curvature of the Fermi surface, changing from a circular to
a snowflake-like shape across a sufficiently large electrostatic potential
step. No interband transition (as in graphene) is needed. For this reason, and
because the topological insulator provides protection against backscattering,
the potential step is able to focus a broad range of incident angles. We
calculate the quantum interference pattern produced by a point source,
generalizing the analogous optical calculation to include the effect of a
noncircular Fermi surface (having a nonzero conic constant).
