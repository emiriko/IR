Respondent-driven sampling is a form of link-tracing network sampling, which
is widely used to study hard-to-reach populations, often to estimate population
proportions. Previous treatments of this process have used a with-replacement
approximation, which we show induces bias in estimates for large sample
fractions and differential network connectedness by characteristic of interest.
  We present a treatment of respondent-driven sampling as a successive sampling
process. Unlike existing representations, our approach respects the essential
without-replacement feature of the process, while converging to an existing
with-replacement representation for small sample fractions, and to the sample
mean for a full-population sample.
  We present a successive-sampling based estimator for population means based
on respondent-driven sampling data, and demonstrate its superior performance
when the size of the hidden population is known. We present sensitivity
analyses for unknown population sizes. In addition, we note that like other
existing estimators, our new estimator is subject to bias induced by the
selection of the initial sample. Using data collected among three populations
in two countries, we illustrate the application of this approach to populations
with varying characteristics. We conclude that the successive sampling
estimator improves on existing estimators, and can also be used as a diagnostic
tool when population size is not known.
