We derive a quantum master equation to treat quantum systems interacting with
multiple reservoirs. The formalism is used to investigate atomic transport
across a variety of lattice configurations. We demonstrate how the behavior of
an electronic diode, a field-effect transistor, and a bipolar junction
transistor can be realized with neutral, ultracold atoms trapped in optical
lattices. An analysis of the current fluctuations is provided for the case of
the atomtronic diode. Finally, we show that it is possible to demonstrate AND
logic gate behavior in an optical lattice.
