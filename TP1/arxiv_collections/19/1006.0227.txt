We review the idea of leptonic unitary triangles and extend the concept of
the recently proposed unitary boomerangs to the lepton sector. Using a
convenient parameterization of the lepton mixing, we provide approximate
expressions for the side lengths and the angles of the six different triangles
and give examples of leptonic unitary boomerangs. Possible applications of the
leptonic unitary boomerangs are also briefly discussed.
