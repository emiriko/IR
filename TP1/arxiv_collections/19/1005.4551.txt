A mass transport directed from low to high density region in an inhomogeneous
medium is modeled as a limiting case of a two-component lattice gas with
excluded volume constraint and one of the components fixed. In the
long-wavelength approximation, density relaxation of mobile particles is
governed by a diffusion process and interaction with a medium inhomogeneity
represented by a static component distribution. It is shown that density
relaxation can be locally accompanied by a density distribution compression. In
quasi one-dimensional case, the compression dynamics manifests itself in a
hopping-like motion of diffusing substance packet front position due to a
staged passing through inhomogeneity barriers and leads to a fragmentation of a
packet and retardation of its spreading. A root-mean-square displacement
reflects only an averaged packet front dynamics and becomes inappropriate as a
transport characteristic in this regime. In a stationary case mass transport
throughout a whole system may be directed from a boundary with low
concentration towards a boundary with that of high one. Implications of the
excluded volume constraint and particles distinguishability for these effects
are discussed.
