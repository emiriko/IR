We study a system of diffusing-aggregating particles with deposition and
evaporation of monomers. By combining theoretical and numerical methods, we
establish a clearer understanding of the non-equilibrium phase transition known
to occur in such systems. The transition is between a growing phase in which
the total mass increases for all time and a non-growing phase in which the
total mass is bounded. In addition to deriving rigorous bounds on the position
of the transition point, we show that the growing phase is in the same
universality class as diffusion-aggregation models with deposition but no
evaporation. In this regime, the flux of mass in mass space becomes
asymptotically constant (as a function of mass) at large times. The magnitude
of this flux depends on the evaporation rate but the fact that it is
asymptotically constant does not. The associated constant flux relation exactly
determines the scaling of the two-point mass correlation function with mass in
all dimensions while higher-order mass correlation functions exhibit nonlinear
multi-scaling in dimension less than 2. If the deposition rate is below some
critical value, a different stationary state is reached at large times
characterised by a global balance between evaporation and deposition with a
scale-by-scale balance between the mass fluxes due to aggregation and
evaporation. Both the mass distribution and the flux decay exponentially in
this regime. Finally, we develop a scaling theory of the model near the
critical point, which yields non-trivial scaling laws for the critical
two-point mass correlation function with mass. These results are well supported
by numerical measurements.
