We demonstrate experimentally how to remove an arbitrary node from a
continuous-variable cluster state and how to shorten any quantum wires of such
a state. These two basic operations, performed in an unconditional fashion, are
a manifestation of quantum erasure and can be employed to obtain various graph
states from an initial cluster state. Starting with a sufficiently large
cluster, the resulting graph states can then be used for universal quantum
information processing. In the experiment, all variations of this
cluster-shaping are demonstrated on a four-mode linear cluster state through
homodyne measurements and feedforward.
