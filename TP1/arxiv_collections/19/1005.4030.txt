Cloud computing is a set of services that provide infrastructure resources
using internet media and data storage on a third party server. SMEs are said to
be the lifeblood of any vibrant economy. They are known to be the silent
drivers of a nation's economy. SMEs of India are one of the most aggressive
adopters of ERP Packages. Most of the Indian SMEs have adopted the traditional
ERP Systems and have incurred a heavy cost while implementing these systems.
This paper presents the cost savings and reduction in the level of difficulty
in adopting a cloud computing Service (CCS) enabled ERP system. For the study,
IT people from 30 North Indian SMEs were interviewed. In the cloud computing
environment the SMEs will not have to own the infrastructure so they can
abstain from any capital expenditure and instead they can utilize the resources
as a service and pay as per their usage. We consider the results of the paper
to be supportive to our proposed research concept.
