We have investigated the magnetic state of Nd0.4Sr0.6MnO3 with the variation
of its grain size down to average nanometric diameter (40 nm). The bulk sample
is antiferromagnetic (AFM) in nature. However, on reduction of the grain size,
emergence of ferromagnetic behavior is experimentally observed. Linear and
nonlinear ac magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that ferromagnetic
nature is enhanced as the grain size is reduced. Large coercivity and
bifurcation between zero field cooled and field cooled magnetization curves
indicate an intrinsic disorder and large anisotropy in the system. Observed
behaviors are attributed to surface disorder as well as to possible pressure
effect on nano grains.
