Results obtained with multichannel installation created for long-term studies
of various processes, are collated with the data published by J.H. Jenkins and
E.Fischbach, who found a decrease of 54Mn radioactivity near the time of series
of solar flares between 5 and 17 December 2006. Analysis of the data from our
installation in December 2006 has not revealed any deviations from the usual
behaviour of the count rates for 90Sr-90Y, 60Co and 239Pu sources. The same can
be said of the data collected during the period of highly powerful solar flares
between 19 October and 4 November 2003. Apparent drops in the count rate were
detected between 10 and 12 May 2002 while registering the activity of 60Co and
on 19 and 20 June 2004 for 90Sr-90Y source. Around the time of these events, no
observations of large solar flares were reported. Thus, proposed link between
the drop in the rates of radioactive decay and appearance of solar flares could
not be confirmed. From obtained outcomes follows, that the radioactivity drop
effect, if it really exists, is rather rare, and that the reason calling this
effect unequally influences various radioactive sources.
