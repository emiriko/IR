In a previous report (arxiv:0901.2487), we introduced a new fermionic
variational wavefunction, suitable for interacting multi-species systems and
sustaining superfluidity. This wavefunction contains a new quantum index. Here
we introduce a spin triplet version of this wavefunction, with parallel spin
pairs only. We also present a single fermion species wavefunction, which may be
relevant for the problem of the BCS to BEC transition.
