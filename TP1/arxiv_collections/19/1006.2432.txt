We show that when N>>1 the geometric entanglement measure of general N-qubit
W states, except maximally entangled W states, is a one-variable function and
depends only on the Bloch vector with the minimal z component. Hence one can
prepare a W state with the required maximal product overlap by altering the
Bloch vector of a single qubit. Next we compute analytically the geometric
measure of large-scale W states by describing these systems in terms of very
few parameters. The final formula relates two quantities, namely the maximal
product overlap and the Bloch vector, that can be easily estimated in
experiments.
