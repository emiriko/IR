Cavity-mediated cooling has the potential to become one of the most efficient
techniques to cool molecular species down to very low temperatures. In this
paper we analyse cavity cooling with single-laser driving for relatively large
cavity decay rates kappa and relatively large phonon frequencies nu. It is
shown that cavity cooling and ordinary laser cooling are essentially the same
within the validity range of the Lamb-Dicke approximation. This is done by
deriving a closed set of rate equations and calculating the corresponding
stationary state phonon number and cooling rate. For example, when nu is either
much larger or much smaller than kappa, the minimum stationary state phonon
number scales as kappa^2/16 nu^2 (strong confinement regime) and as kappa / 4
nu (weak confinement regime), respectively.
