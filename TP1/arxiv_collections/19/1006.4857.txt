Starting from the proper charge transfer model for Cu$_2$O$_5$ coupled
ladders in Sr$_{14-x}$Ca$_x$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ we derive the low energy
Hamiltonian for this system. It occurs that the widely used ladder t-J model is
not sufficient and has to be supplemented by the Coulomb repulsion term between
holes in the neighboring ladders. Furthermore, we show how a simple mean-field
solution of the derived t-J model may explain the onset of the charge density
wave with the odd period in Sr$_{14-x}$Ca$_x$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$.
