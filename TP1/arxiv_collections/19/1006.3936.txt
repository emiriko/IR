The three-dimensional band structure and superconducting gap of
Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 are studied with high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy. In contrast to previous results, we have identified three
hole-like Fermi surfaces near the zone center with sizable out-of-plane or kz
dispersion. The superconducting gap on certain Fermi surface shows significant
kz-dependence. Moreover, we found that the superconducting gap sizes are
different at the same Fermi momentum for two bands with different spatial
symmetries (one odd, one even). Our results provide further information on the
rich superconducting gap structure in iron pnictides, and a distinct test for
theories.
