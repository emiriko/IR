The shock response of two-dimensional model high explosive crystals with
various arrangements of circular voids is explored. We simulate a piston impact
using molecular dynamics simulations with a Reactive Empirical Bond Order
(REBO) model potential for a sub-micron, sub-ns exothermic reaction in a
diatomic molecular solid. In square lattices of voids (of equal size), reducing
the size of the voids or increasing the porosity while holding the other
parameter fixed causes the hotspots to consume the material more quickly and
detonation to occur sooner and at lower piston velocities. The early time
behavior is seen to follow a very simple ignition and growth model. The
hotspots are seen to collectively develop a broad pressure wave (a sonic,
diffuse deflagration front) that, upon merging with the lead shock, transforms
it into a detonation. The reaction yields produced by triangular lattices are
not significantly different. With random void arrangements, the mean time to
detonation is 15.5\% larger than with the square lattice; the standard
deviation of detonation delays is just 5.1%.
