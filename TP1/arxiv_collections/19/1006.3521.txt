We model a network economy with three sectors: downstream firms, upstream
firms, and banks. Agents are linked by productive and credit relationships so
that the behavior of one agent influences the behavior of the others through
network connections. Credit interlinkages among agents are a source of
bankruptcy diffusion: in fact, failure of fulfilling debt commitments would
lead to bankruptcy chains. All in all, the bankruptcy in one sector can diffuse
to other sectors through linkages creating a vicious cycle and bankruptcy
avalanches in the network economy. Our analysis show how the choices of credit
supply by both banks and firms are interrelated. While the initial impact of
monetary policy is on bank behaviour, we show the interactive play between the
choices made by banks, the choices made by firms in their role as providers of
credit, and the choices made by firms in their role as producers.
