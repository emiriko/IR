Solitary-particle quantum mechanics' inherent compatibility with special
relativity is implicit in Schroedinger's postulated wave-function rule for the
operator quantization of the particle's canonical three-momentum, taken
together with his famed time-dependent wave-function equation that analogously
treats the operator quantization of its Hamiltonian. The resulting formally
four-vector equation system assures proper relativistic covariance for any
solitary-particle Hamiltonian operator which, together with its canonical
three-momentum operator, is a Lorentz-covariant four-vector operator. This, of
course, is always the case for the quantization of the Hamiltonian of a
properly relativistic classical theory, so the strong correspondence principle
definitely remains valid in the relativistic domain. Klein-Gordon theory
impairs this four-vector equation by iterating and contracting it, thereby
injecting extraneous negative-energy solutions that are not orthogonal to their
positive-energy counterparts of the same momentum, thus destroying the basis of
the quantum probability interpretation. Klein-Gordon theory, which thus depends
on the square of the Hamiltonian operator, is as well thereby cut adrift from
Heisenberg's equations of motion. Dirac theory confuses the space-time symmetry
of the four-vector equation system with such symmetry for its time component
alone, which it fatuously imposes, thereby breaching the strong correspondence
principle for the free particle and imposing the starkly unphysical
momentum-independence of velocity. Physically sensible alternatives, with
external electromagnetic fields, to the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations are
derived, and the simple, elegant symmetry-based approach to antiparticles is
pointed out.
