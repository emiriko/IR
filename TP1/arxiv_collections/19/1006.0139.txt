We describe the implementation of the shearing box approximation for the
study of the dynamics of accretion disks in the Athena magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) code. Second-order Crank-Nicholson time differencing is used for the
Coriolis and tidal gravity source terms that appear in the momentum equation
for accuracy and stability. We show this approach conserves energy for
epicyclic oscillations in hydrodynamic flows to round-off error. In the energy
equation, the tidal gravity source terms are differenced as the gradient of an
effective potential in a way which guarantees that total energy (including the
gravitational potential energy) is also conserved to round-off error. We
introduce an orbital advection algorithm for MHD based on constrained transport
to preserve the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. This
algorithm removes the orbital velocity from the time step constraint, and makes
the truncation error more uniform in radial position. Modifications to the
shearing box boundary conditions applied at the radial boundaries are necessary
to conserve the total vertical magnetic flux. In principle similar corrections
are also required to conserve mass, momentum and energy, however in practice we
find the orbital advection method conserves these quantities to better than
0.03% over hundreds of orbits. The algorithms have been applied to studies of
the nonlinear regime of the MRI in very wide (up to 32 scale heights)
horizontal domains.
