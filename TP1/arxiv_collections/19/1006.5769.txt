Since graphene has no band gap, photoluminescence is not expected from
relaxed charge carriers. We have, however, observed significant light emission
from graphene under excitation by ultrashort (30-fs) laser pulses. Light
emission was found to occur across the visible spectral range (1.7 - 3.5 eV),
with emitted photon energies exceeding that of the excitation laser (1.5 eV).
The emission exhibits a nonlinear dependence on the laser fluence. In two-pulse
correlation measurements of the time-domain response, a dominant relaxation
time of tens of femtoseconds is observed. A two-temperature model describing
the electrons and their interaction with strongly coupled optical phonons can
account for the experimental observations.
