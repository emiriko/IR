A minimal representation of a simple non-compact Lie group is obtained by
``quantizing'' the minimal nilpotent coadjoint orbit of its Lie algebra. It
provides context for Roger Howe's notion of a reductive dual pair encountered
recently in the description of global gauge symmetry of a (4-dimensional)
conformal observable algebra. We give a pedagogical introduction to these
notions and point out that physicists have been using both minimal
representations and dual pairs without naming them and hence stand a chance to
understand their theory and to profit from it.
