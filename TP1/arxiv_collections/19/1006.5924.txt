In this paper a method for recognition of handwritten devanagari characters
is described. Here, feature vector is constituted by accumulated directional
gradient changes in different segments, number of intersections points for the
character, type of spine present and type of shirorekha present in the
character. One Multi-layer Perceptron with conjugate-gradient training is used
to classify these feature vectors. This method is applied to a database with
1000 sample characters and the recognition rate obtained is 88.12%
