We demonstrate a simple technique to measure the resonant frequency of the
398.9 nm 1S0 - 1P1 transition for the different Yb isotopes. The technique,
that works by observing and aligning fluorescence spots, has enabled us to
measure transition frequencies and isotope shifts with an accuracy of 60 MHz.
We provide wavelength measurements for the transition that differ from
previously published work. Our technique also allows for the determination of
Doppler shifted transition frequencies for photoionisation experiments when the
atomic beam and laser beam are not perpendicular and furthermore allows us to
determine the average velocity of the atoms along the direction of atomic beam.
