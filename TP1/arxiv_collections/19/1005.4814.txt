Current status of theoretical researches on the QCD phase diagram at finite
temperature and baryon chemical potential is reviewed with special emphasis on
the origin of various phases and their symmetry breaking patterns. Topics
include; quark deconfinement, chiral symmetry restoration, order of the phase
transitions, QCD critical point(s), colour superconductivity, various
inhomogeneous states and implications from QCD-like theories.
