We present 3D numerical simulations of the early evolution of long-duration
gamma-ray bursts in the collapsar scenario. Starting from the core-collapse of
a realistic progenitor model, we follow the formation and evolution of a
central black hole and centrifugally balanced disk. The dense, hot accretion
disk produces freely-escaping neutrinos and is hydrodynamically unstable to
clumping and to forming non-axisymmetric (m=1, 2) modes. We show that these
spiral structures, which form on dynamical timescales, can efficiently transfer
angular momentum outward and can drive the high required accretion rates
(>=0.1-1 M_sun) for producing a jet. We utilise the smoothed particle
hydrodynamics code, Gadget-2, modified to implement relevant microphysics, such
as cooling by neutrinos, a plausible treatment approximating the central object
and relativistic effects. Finally, we discuss implications of this scenario as
a source of energy to produce relativistically beamed gamma-ray jets.
