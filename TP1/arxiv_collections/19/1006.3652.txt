This research investigated the simulation model behaviour of a traditional
and combined discrete event as well as agent based simulation models when
modelling human reactive and proactive behaviour in human centric complex
systems. A departmental store was chosen as human centric complex case study
where the operation system of a fitting room in WomensWear department was
investigated. We have looked at ways to determine the efficiency of new
management policies for the fitting room operation through simulating the
reactive and proactive behaviour of staff towards customers. Once development
of the simulation models and their verification had been done, we carried out a
validation experiment in the form of a sensitivity analysis. Subsequently, we
executed a statistical analysis where the mixed reactive and proactive
behaviour experimental results were compared with some reactive experimental
results from previously published works. Generally, this case study discovered
that simple proactive individual behaviour could be modelled in both simulation
models. In addition, we found the traditional discrete event model performed
similar in the simulation model output compared to the combined discrete event
and agent based simulation when modelling similar human behaviour.
