We report finite-volume simulations of the phonon Boltzmann transport
equation (BTE) for heat conduction across the heterogeneous interfaces in SiGe
superlattices. The diffuse mismatch model incorporating phonon dispersion and
polarization is implemented over a wide range of Knudsen numbers. The results
indicate that the thermal conductivity of a Si/Ge superlattice is much lower
than that of the constitutive bulk materials for superlattice periods in the
submicron regime. We report results for effective thermal conductivity of
various material volume fractions and superlattice periods. Details of the
non-equilibrium energy exchange between optical and acoustic phonons that
originate from the mismatch of phonon spectra in silicon and germanium are
delineated for the first time. Conditions are identified for which this effect
can produce significantly more thermal resistance than that due to boundary
scattering of phonons.
