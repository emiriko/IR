We describe the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS) and the first data
obtained as part of the Science Demonstration Phase (SDP). The data cover a
central 4x4 sq deg region of the cluster. We use SPIRE and PACS photometry data
to produce 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500 micron luminosity functions (LFs) for
optically bright galaxies that are selected at 500 micron and detected in all
bands. We compare these LFs with those previously derived using IRAS, BLAST and
Herschel-ATLAS data. The Virgo Cluster LFs do not have the large numbers of
faint galaxies or examples of very luminous galaxies seen previously in surveys
covering less dense environments.
