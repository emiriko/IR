The hot and dense medium formed in high energy heavy ion collisions may
modify some hadronic properties. In particular, if hadron masses are shifted
in-medium, it was demonstrated that this could lead to back-to-back squeezed
correlations (BBC) of particle-antiparticle pairs. Although well-established
theoretically, the squeezed correlations have not yet been discovered
experimentally. A method has been suggested for the empirical search of this
effect, which was previously illustrated for phi-phi pairs. We apply here the
formalism and the suggested method to the case of K^+ K^- pairs, since they may
be easier to identify experimentally. The time distribution of the emission
process plays a crucial role in the survival of the BBC's. We analyze the cases
where the emission is supposed to occur suddenly or via a Lorentzian
distribution, and compare with the case of a Levy distribution in time. Effects
of squeezing on the correlation function of identical particles are also
analyzed.
