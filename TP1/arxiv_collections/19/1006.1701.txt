In order to get strategic positioning for competition in business
organization, the information system must be ahead in this information age
where the information as one of the weapons to win the competition and in the
right hand the information will become a right bullet. The information system
with the information technology support isn't enough if just only on internet
or implemented with internet technology. The growth of information technology
as tools for helping and making people easy to use must be accompanied by
wanting to make fun and happy when they make contact with the information
technology itself. Basically human like to play, since childhood human have
been playing, free and happy and when human grow up they can't play as much as
when human was in their childhood. We have to develop the information system
which is not perform information system itself but can help human to explore
their natural instinct for playing, making fun and happiness when they interact
with the information system. Virtual information system is the way to present
playing and having fun atmosphere on working area.
