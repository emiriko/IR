Let H be a fixed graph with h vertices. The graph removal lemma states that
every graph on n vertices with o(n^h) copies of H can be made H-free by
removing o(n^2) edges. We give a new proof which avoids Szemer\'edi's
regularity lemma and gives a better bound. This approach also works to give
improved bounds for the directed and multicolored analogues of the graph
removal lemma. This answers questions of Alon and Gowers.
