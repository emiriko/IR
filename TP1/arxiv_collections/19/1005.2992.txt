We find a class of open-system models in which individual quantum
trajectories may depend on parameters that are undetermined by the full
open-system evolution. This dependence is imprinted in the geometric phase
associated with such trajectories and persists after averaging. Our findings
indicate a potential source of ambiguity in the quantum trajectory approach to
open quantum systems.
