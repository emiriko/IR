Wind waves are considered as an intermediate small-scale dynamic process at
the air-sea interface,which modulates radically middle-scale dynamic processes
of the boundary layers in water and air. It is shown that with the aim of a
quantitative description of the impact said, one can use the numerical wind
wave models which are added with the blocks of the dynamic atmosphere boundary
layer (DABL) and the dynamic water upper layer (DWUL). A mathematical
formalization for the problem of energy and momentum transfer from the wind to
the upper ocean is given on the basis of the well known mathematical
representations for mechanisms of a wind wave spectrum evolution. The problem
is solved quantitatively by means of introducing special system parameters: the
relative rate of the wave energy input, IRE, and the relative rate of the wave
energy dissipation, DRE. For two simple wave-origin situations, the certain
estimations for values of IRE and DRE are found, and the examples of
calculating an impact of a wind sea on the characteristics of both the boundary
layer of atmosphere and the water upper layer are given. The results obtained
permit to state that the models of wind waves of the new (fifth) generation,
which are added with the blocks of the DABL and the DWUL, could be an essential
chain of the general model describing the ocean-atmosphere circulation.
