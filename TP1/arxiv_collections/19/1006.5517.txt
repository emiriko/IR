Quantum memories are essential elements in long-distance quantum networks and
quantum computation. Significant advances have been achieved in demonstrating
relative long-lived single-channel memory at single-photon level in cold atomic
media. However, the qubit memory corresponding to store two-channel spin-wave
excitations (SWEs) still faces challenges, including the limitations resulting
from Larmor procession, fluctuating ambient magnetic field, and
manipulation/measurement of the relative phase between the two channels. Here,
we demonstrate a two-channel memory scheme in an ideal tripod atomic system, in
which the total readout signal exhibits either constructive or destructive
interference when the two-channel SWEs are retrieved by two reading beams with
a controllable relative phase. Experimental result indicates quantum coherence
between the stored SWEs. Based on such phase-sensitive storage/retrieval
scheme, measurements of the relative phase between the two SWEs and Rabi
oscillation, as well as elimination of the collapse and revival of the readout
signal, are experimentally demonstrated.
