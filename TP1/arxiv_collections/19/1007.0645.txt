Experimental and theoretical studies are made of Brownian particles trapped
in a periodic potential, which is very slightly tilted due to gravity. In the
presence of fluctuations, these will trigger a measurable average drift along
the direction of the tilt. The magnitude of the drift varies with the ratio
between the bias force and the trapping potential. This can be closely compared
to a theoretical model system, based on a Fokker-Planck-equation formalism. We
show that the level of control and measurement precision we have in our system,
which is based on cold atoms trapped in a 3D dissipative optical lattice, makes
the experimental setup suitable as a testbed for fundamental statistical
physics. We simulate the system with a very simplified and general classical
model, as well as with an elaborate semi-classical Monte-Carlo simulation. In
both cases, we achieve good qualitative agreement with experimental data.
