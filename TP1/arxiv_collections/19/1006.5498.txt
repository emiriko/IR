The results of Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) studies of Most likely position
(MLP) and position vector (PV) methods in TOFPET system are presented. MCS
based on GEANT3.21 is carried out where the geometry of a real TOFPET system is
considered. Results not only manifest resolving powers (RP) of PV and MLP
methods ~114% and ~36% but also exhibit shifting of reconstructed images from
the original positions ~3% and ~63% respectively. Position conversion factors
play a crucial role to reinstate the image position in the PV method and
stipulate excellent images. A PV is a position reconstruction method of
positron-electron annihilation points developed afresh without iteration and
that makes its beauty by saving huge computational time and radiation dose of
the patient.
