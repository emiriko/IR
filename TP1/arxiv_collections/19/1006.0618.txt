We present a new measurement of the Z/gamma* transverse momentum distribution
in the range 0 - 330GeV, in proton-antiproton collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV.
The measurement uses 0.97 fb-1 of integrated luminosity recorded by the D0
experiment and is the first using the Z/gamma*->mu+mu- + X channel at this
center-of-mass energy. This is also the first measurement of the Z/gamma*
transverse momentum distribution that presents the result at the level of
particles entering the detector, minimizing dependence on theoretical models.
As any momentum of the Z/gamma* in the plane transverse to the incoming beams
must be balanced by some recoiling system, primarily the result of QCD
radiation in the initial state, this variable is an excellent probe of the
underlying process. Tests of the predictions of QCD calculations and current
event generators show they have varied success in describing the data. Using
this measurement as an input to theoretical predictions will allow for a better
description of hadron collider data and hence it will increase experimental
sensitivity to rare signals.
