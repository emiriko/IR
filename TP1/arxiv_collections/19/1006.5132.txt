The high reset current IR in unipolar resistance switching now poses major
obstacles to practical applications in memory devices. In particular, the first
IR-value after the forming process is so high that the capacitors sometimes do
not exhibit reliable unipolar resistance switching. We found that the
compliance current Icomp is a critical parameter for reducing IR-values. We
therefore introduced an improved, simple, easy to use Icomp-limiter that
stabilizes the forming process by drastically decreasing current overflow, in
order to precisely control the Icomp- and subsequent IR-values.
