In this paper we study the effect of the channeling of ions recoiling from
collisions with weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) in single crystal
detectors. In particular we investigate the possibility that channeling may
give rise to diurnal modulations of the counting rate as the Earth rotates
relative to the direction of the WIMP wind, and the effect that channeling has
on the "quenching factor" of a detector.
