We show a phase diagram of a two-flavored parity doublet model on top of the
nuclear matter ground state within the mean field approximation. An exotic
phase with unbroken center symmetry of chiral group is also discussed. When
crossing this phase boundary the baryon number susceptibility exhibits a
characteristic feature.
