We consider a (1+1)-dimensional ballistic deposition process with
next-nearest neighbor interaction, which belongs to the KPZ universality class,
and introduce for this discrete model a variational formulation similar to that
for the randomly forced continuous Burgers equation. This allows to identify
the characteristic structures in the bulk of a growing aggregate ("clusters"
and "crevices") with minimizers and shocks in the Burgers turbulence, and to
introduce a new kind of equipped Airy process for ballistic growth. We dub it
the "hairy Airy process" and investigate its statistics numerically. We also
identify scaling laws that characterize the ballistic deposition patterns in
the bulk: the law of "thinning" of the forest of clusters with increasing
height, the law of transversal fluctuations of cluster boundaries, and the size
distribution of clusters. The corresponding critical exponents are determined
exactly based on the analogy with the Burgers turbulence and simple scaling
considerations.
