We propose a direct test of the existence of gauge duals for
nonsupersymmetric asymptotically free gauge theories developing an infrared
fixed point by computing the S-parameter in the electric and dual magnetic
description. In particular we show that at the lower bound of the conformal
window the magnetic S-parameter, i.e. the one determined via the dual magnetic
gauge theory, assumes a simple expression in terms of the elementary magnetic
degrees of freedom. The results further support our recent conjecture of the
existence of a universal lower bound on the S parameter and indicates that it
is an ideal operator for counting the active physical degrees of freedom within
the conformal window. Our results can be directly used to unveil possible four
dimensional gauge duals and constitute the first explicit computation of a
nonperturbative quantity, in the electric variables, via nonsupersymmetric
gauge duality.
