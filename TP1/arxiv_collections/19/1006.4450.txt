Superfluid $^4$He at a finite temperature is described by the two-fluid model
with the normal fluid component and the superfluid component.We formulate the
two-fluid model for two-component BECs, namely two-superfluid model, starting
from the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations.The two-superfluid model well
corresponds to the two-fluid model in superfluid $^4$He.In a special condition,
the two sound modes in the two-superfluid model behave like first and second
sounds in the two-fluid model of superfluid $^4$He.
