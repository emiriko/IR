The surface alignment of lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs) can be
not only planar (tangential) but also homeotropic, with self-assembled
aggregates perpendicular to the substrate, as demonstrated by mapping optical
retardation and by three-dimensional imaging of the director field. With time,
the homeotropic nematic undergoes a transition into a tangential state. The
anchoring transition is discontinuous and can be described by a double-well
anchoring potential with two minima corresponding to tangential and homeotropic
orientation.
