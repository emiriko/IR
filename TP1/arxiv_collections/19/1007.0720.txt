We report a doping dependent electronic Raman scattering measurements on
iron-pnictide superconductor Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ single crystals. A
strongly anisotropic gap is found at optimal doping for x=0.065 with
$\Delta_{max}\sim 5\Delta_{min}$. Upon entering the coexistence region between
superconducting (SC) and spin-density-wave (SDW) orders, the effective pairing
energy scale is strongly reduced. Our results are interpreted in terms of a
competition between SC and SDW orders for electronic state at the Fermi level.
Our findings advocate for a strong connection between the SC and SDW gaps
anisotropies which are both linked to interband interactions.
