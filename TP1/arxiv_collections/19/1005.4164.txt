We present a study of the relaxation dynamics of the photoexcited
conductivity of the impurity states in the low-density electronic glass,
phosphorous-doped silicon Si:P. Using optical pump-terahertz probe spectroscopy
we find strongly temperature and fluence dependent glassy power-law relaxation
occurring over sub-ns time scales. Such behavior is in contrast to the much
longer time scales found in higher electron density glassy systems. We also
find evidence for both multi-particle relaxation mechanisms and/or coupling to
electronic collective modes and a low temperature quantum relaxational regime.
