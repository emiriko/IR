The first part of these lectures provides a brief introduction to the
concepts and techniques of effective field theory. The second part reviews
precision electroweak constraints using effective theory methods. Several
simple extensions of the Standard Model are considered as illustrations. The
appendix contains some new results on the one-loop contributions of electroweak
triplet scalars to the T parameter and contains a discussion of decoupling in
that case.
