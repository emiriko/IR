Graph transformation systems (GTS) and constraint handling rules (CHR) are
non-deterministic rule-based state transition systems. CHR is well-known for
its powerful confluence and program equivalence analyses, for which we provide
the basis in this work to apply them to GTS. We give a sound and complete
embedding of GTS in CHR, investigate confluence of an embedded GTS, and provide
a program equivalence analysis for GTS via the embedding. The results confirm
the suitability of CHR-based program analyses for other formalisms embedded in
CHR.
