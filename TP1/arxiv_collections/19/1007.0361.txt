The evolution of the electron density during electron cloud formation can be
reproduced using a bunch-to-bunch iterative map formalism. The reliability of
this formalism has been proved for RHIC [1] and LHC [2]. The linear coefficient
has a good theoretical framework, while quadratic coefficient has been proved
only by fitting the results of compute-intensive electron cloud simulations. In
this communication we derive an analytic expression for the quadratic map
coefficient. The comparison of the theoretical estimate with the simulations
results shows a good agreement for a wide range of bunch population.
