This paper presents a new approach on stretch processing for a fine range
estimation using MPM (Matrix Pencil Method). The conventional method utilizes
FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) with limited range resolution with its fixed
number of samples. Numerical simulation shows that the new method gives better
performance in the accuracy of the range resolution.
