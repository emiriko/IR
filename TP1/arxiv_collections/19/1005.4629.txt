We point out an interesting theoretical prediction for elliptical galaxies
residing inside galaxy clusters in the framework of modified Newtonian dynamics
(MOND), that could be used to test this paradigm. Apart from the central
brightest cluster galaxy, other galaxies close enough to the centre experience
a strong gravitational influence from the other galaxies of the cluster. This
influence manifests itself only as tides in standard Newtonian gravity, meaning
that the systematic acceleration of the centre of mass of the galaxy has no
consequence. However, in the context of MOND, a consequence of the breaking of
the strong equivalence principle is that the systematic acceleration changes
the own self-gravity of the galaxy. We show here that, in this framework,
initially axisymmetric elliptical galaxies become lopsided along the external
field's direction, and that the centroid of the galaxy, defined by the outer
density contours, is shifted by a few hundreds parsecs with respect to the
densest point.
