The doping and temperature dependent thermopower of SnTe is calculated from
the first principles band structure using Boltzmann transport theory. We find
that the $p$-type thermopower is inferior to PbTe consistent with experimental
observations, but that the $n$-type thermopower is substantially more
favorable.
