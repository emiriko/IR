We establish a novel mechanism of stripe formation in doped systems with
alternating $t_{2g}$ orbital order --- the stripe takes the form of a
ferro-orbitally ordered domain wall separating domains with staggered order and
allowing for deconfined motion of holes along the stripe. At a finite level of
hole concentration this gives rise to the stability of this solitonic type of
stripes, while we show that the phase change of the staggered order by $\pi$
plays a minor role in orbitally ordered systems. These results shed new light
on the physics of doped materials in which orbital degeneracy is present.
