The full counting statistics of the charge transport through an undoped
graphene sheet in the presence of smooth disorder is studied. At the Dirac
point both in clean and diffusive limits, transport properties of a graphene
sample are described by the universal Dorokhov distribution of transmission
probabilities. In the crossover regime, deviations from universality occur
which can be studied analytically both on ballistic and diffusive sides. In the
ballistic regime, we use a diagrammatic technique with matrix Green functions.
For a diffusive system, the sigma model is applied. Our results are in good
agreement with recent numerical simulations of electron transport in disordered
graphene.
