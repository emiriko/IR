On going good number of research works establish Modified Chaplygin Gas as
one one of the most favoured candidates of Dark Energy. In our present work,
new bound on the parameter space of associated model - parameter has been
worked out with new explanation. Moreover, the explicit relation between the
mysterious state parameter $w$ and scale factor $a(t)$ has been derived.
