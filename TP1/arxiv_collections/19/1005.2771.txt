After impact onto a smooth dry surface, a drop of viscous liquid initially
spreads in the form of a thick lamella. If the drop splashes, it first emits a
thin fluid sheet that can ultimately break up into droplets causing the splash.
Ambient gas is crucial for creating this thin sheet. The time for sheet
ejection, $t_{ejt}$, depends on impact velocity, liquid viscosity, gas pressure
and molecular weight. A central air bubble is trapped below the drop at
pressures even below that necessary for this sheet formation. In addition, air
bubbles are entrained underneath the spreading lamella when the ejected sheet
is present. Air entrainment ceases at a lamella velocity that is independent of
drop impact velocity as well as ambient gas pressure.
