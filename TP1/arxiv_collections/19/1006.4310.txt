The goal of this paper is to develop an adjusted plus-minus statistic for NHL
players that is independent of both teammates and opponents. We use data from
the shift reports on NHL.com in a weighted least squares regression to estimate
an NHL player's effect on his team's success in scoring and preventing goals at
even strength. Both offensive and defensive components of adjusted plus-minus
are given, estimates in terms of goals per 60 minutes and goals per season are
given, and estimates for forwards, defensemen, and goalies are given.
