Using terahertz time domain spectroscopy we demonstrate tunable polarization
rotation and circular dichroism in intrinsically nonchiral planar terahertz
metamaterials without twofold rotational symmetry. The observed effect is due
to extrinsic chirality arising from the mutual orientation of the metamaterial
plane and the propagation direction of the incident terahertz wave.
