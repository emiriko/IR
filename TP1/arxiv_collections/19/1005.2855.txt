Significant progress in understanding quarkonium production requires improved
polarization measurements, fully considering the intrinsic multidimensionality
of the problem. We propose a frame-invariant formalism which minimizes the
dependence of the measured result on the experimental acceptance, facilitates
the comparison with theoretical calculations, and provides a much needed
control over systematic effects due to detector limitations and analysis
biases. This formalism is a direct and generic consequence of the rotational
invariance of the dilepton decay distribution and is independent of any
assumptions specific to particular models of quarkonium production.
