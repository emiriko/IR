Steganography is the process of hiding secret information by embedding it in
an "innocent" message. We present protocols for hiding quantum information in a
codeword of a quantum error-correcting code passing through a channel. Using
either a shared classical secret key or shared entanglement the sender (Alice)
disguises her information as errors in the channel. The receiver (Bob) can
retrieve the hidden information, but an eavesdropper (Eve) with the power to
monitor the channel, but without the secret key, cannot distinguish the message
from channel noise. We analyze how difficult it is for Eve to detect the
presence of secret messages, and estimate rates of steganographic communication
and secret key consumption for certain protocols.
