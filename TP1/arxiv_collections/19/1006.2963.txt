We have recently interpreted the source MAGIC J0616+225 as a result of
delayed TeV emission of cosmic-rays diffusing from IC 443 and interacting with
a cloud in the foreground of the remnant. This model was used to make
predictions for future observations, especially those to be made with the Fermi
satellite. Just recently, AGILE, Fermi, and VERITAS have released new results
of their observations of IC 443. In this work, we compare them with the
predictions of our model, exploring the GeV to TeV connection in this region of
space. We use Fermi data to consider the possibility of constraining the
cosmic-ray diffusion features of the environment. We analyze the cosmic-ray
distributions, their interactions, and a possible detection of the SNR
environment in the neutrino channel.
