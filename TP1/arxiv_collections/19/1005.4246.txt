From a mathematical perspective, radiation hydrodynamics can be thought of as
a system of hyperbolic balance laws with dual multiscale behavior (multiscale
behavior associated with the hyperbolic wave speeds as well as multiscale
behavior associated with source term relaxation). With this outlook in mind,
this paper presents a hybrid Godunov method for one-dimensional radiation
hydrodynamics that is uniformly well behaved from the photon free streaming
(hyperbolic) limit through the weak equilibrium diffusion (parabolic) limit and
to the strong equilibrium diffusion (hyperbolic) limit. Moreover, one finds
that the technique preserves certain asymptotic limits. The method incorporates
a backward Euler upwinding scheme for the radiation energy density and flux as
well as a modified Godunov scheme for the material density, momentum density,
and energy density. The backward Euler upwinding scheme is first-order accurate
and uses an implicit HLLE flux function to temporally advance the radiation
components according to the material flow scale. The modified Godunov scheme is
second-order accurate and directly couples stiff source term effects to the
hyperbolic structure of the system of balance laws. This Godunov technique is
composed of a predictor step that is based on Duhamel's principle and a
corrector step that is based on Picard iteration. The Godunov scheme is
explicit on the material flow scale but is unsplit and fully couples matter and
radiation without invoking a diffusion-type approximation for radiation
hydrodynamics. This technique derives from earlier work by Miniati & Colella
2007. Numerical tests demonstrate that the method is stable, robust, and
accurate across various parameter regimes.
