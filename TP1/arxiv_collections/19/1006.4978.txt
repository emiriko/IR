We study the Keller-Segel model of chemotaxis and develop a composite
particle-grid numerical method with adaptive time stepping which allows us to
accurately resolve singular solutions. The numerical findings (in two
dimensions) are then compared with analytical predictions regarding formation
and interaction of singularities obtained via analysis of the stochastic
differential equations associated with the Keller-Segel model.
