The bias-dependent transport properties of short poly(G)-poly(C) A-DNA
strands attached to Au electrodes are investigated with first principles
electronic transport methods. By using the non- equilibrium Green's function
approach combined with self-interaction corrected density functional theory, we
calculate the fully self-consistent coherent I-V curve of various double-strand
polymeric DNA fragments. We show that electronic wave-function localization,
induced either by the native electrical dipole and/or by the electrostatic
disorder originating from the first few water solvation layers, drastically
suppresses the magnitude of the elastic conductance of A-DNA oligonucleotides.
We then argue that electron transport through DNA is the result of
sequence-specific short-range tunneling across a few bases combined with
general diffusive/inelastic processes.
