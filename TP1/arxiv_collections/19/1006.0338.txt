We explore some implications of the hypothesis that quantum mechanics (QM) is
universal, i.e., that QM does not merely describe information accessible to
observers, but that it also describes the observers themselves. From that point
of view, "free will" (FW) - the ability of experimentalists to make free
choices of initial conditions - is merely an illusion. As a consequence, by
entangling a part of brain (responsible for the illusion of FW) with a distant
particle, one may create nonlocal correlations that can be interpreted as
superluminal signals. In addition, if FW is an illusion, then QM on a closed
timelike curve can be made consistent even without the Deutch nonlinear
consistency constraint.
