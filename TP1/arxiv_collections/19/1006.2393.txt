Lithium-6 atoms in the three lowest hyperfine states display universal
properties when the S-wave scattering length between each pair of states is
large. Recent experiments reported four pronounced features arising from Efimov
physics in the atom-dimer relaxation rate, namely two resonances and two local
minima. We use the universal effective field theory to calculate the atom-dimer
relaxation rate at zero temperature. Our results describe the four features
qualitatively and imply there is a hidden local minimum. In the vicinity of the
resonance at 685 G, we perform a finite temperature calculation which improves
the agreement of theory and experiment. We conclude that finite temperature
effects cannot be neglected in the analysis of the experimental data.
