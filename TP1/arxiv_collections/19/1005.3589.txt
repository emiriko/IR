After Earth's origin, our host star, the Sun, was shining 20 to 25 percent
less brightly than today. Without greenhouse-like conditions to warm the
atmosphere, our early planet would have been an ice ball and life may never
have evolved. But life did evolve, which indicates that greenhouse gases must
have been present on early Earth to warm the planet. Evidence from the geologic
record indicates an abundance of the greenhouse gas CO2. CH4 was probably
present as well, and in this regard methanogenic bacteria, which belong to a
diverse group of anaerobic procaryotes that ferment CO 2 plus H2 to CH4, may
have contributed to modification of the early atmosphere. Molecular oxygen was
not present, as is indicated by the study of rocks from that era, which contain
iron carbonate rather than iron oxide. Multicellular organisms originated as
cells within colonies that became increasingly specialized. The development of
photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms.
The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and formed the ozone layer
in the upper atmosphere. Aided by the absorption of harmful UV radiation in the
ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface. Our own planet is a very good
example of how life forms modified the atmosphere over the planets' life time.
We show that these facts have to be taken into account when we discover and
characterize atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets. If life has originated and
evolved on a planet, then it should be expected that a strong co-evolution
occurred between life and the atmosphere, the result of which is the planets'
climate.
