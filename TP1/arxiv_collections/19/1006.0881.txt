In standard cosmology, with the evolution of the universe, the matter density
and thermodynamic pressure gradually decreases. Also in course of evolution,
the matter in the universe obeys (or violates) some restrictions or energy
conditions. If the matter distribution obeys strong energy condition (SEC), the
universe is in a decelerating phase while violation of SEC indicates an
accelerated expansion of the universe. In the period of accelerated expansion
the matter may be either of quintessence nature or of phantom nature depending
on the fulfilment of the weak energy condition (WEC) or violation of it. As
recent observational evidences demand that the universe is going through an
accelerated expansion so mater should be either quintessence or phantom in
nature. In the present work we study the evolution of the universe through the
phantom barrier (i.e. the dividing line between the quintessence and phantom
era) and examine how apparent and event horizon change across the barrier.
Finally, we investigate the possibility of occurrence of any singularity in
phantom era.
