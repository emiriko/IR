We present an efficient method for subrecoil cooling of neutral atoms by
applying Raman cooling in 2D to a four-level tripod-system. The atoms can be
cooled simultaneously in two directions using only three laser beams. We
describe the cooling process with a simple model showing that the momentum
distribution can be rapidly narrowed to velocity spread down to
$0.1v_\text{rec}$, corresponding to effective temperature equal to
$0.01T_\text{rec}$. This method opens new possibilities for cooling of neutral
atoms.
