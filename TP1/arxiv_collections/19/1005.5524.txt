The authors study the elastic deformation field in lattice-mismatched
core-shell nanowires with single and multiple shells. The authors consider
infinite wires with a hexagonal cross section under the assumption of
translational symmetry. The strain distributions are found by minimizing the
elastic energy per unit cell using the finite element method. The authors find
that the trace of the strain is discontinuous with a simple, almost piecewise
variation between core and shell, whereas the individual components of the
strain can exhibit complex variations.
