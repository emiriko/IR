Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) form an observationally uniform class of stellar
explosions, in that more luminous objects have smaller decline-rates. This
one-parameter behavior allows SNe Ia to be calibrated as cosmological `standard
candles', and led to the discovery of an accelerating Universe. Recent
investigations, however, have revealed that the true nature of SNe Ia is more
complicated. Theoretically, it has been suggested that the initial
thermonuclear sparks are ignited at an offset from the centre of the
white-dwarf (WD) progenitor, possibly as a result of convection before the
explosion. Observationally, the diversity seen in the spectral evolution of SNe
Ia beyond the luminosity decline-rate relation is an unresolved issue. Here we
report that the spectral diversity is a consequence of random directions from
which an asymmetric explosion is viewed. Our findings suggest that the spectral
evolution diversity is no longer a concern in using SNe Ia as cosmological
standard candles. Furthermore, this indicates that ignition at an offset from
the centre of is a generic feature of SNe Ia.
