We present a functional renormalization group scheme that allows us to
calculate frustrated magnetic systems of arbitrary lattice geometry beyond
O(200) sites from first principles. We study the magnetic susceptibility of the
antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-1/2 Heisenberg model ground state on the spatially
anisotropic triangular lattice, where J' denotes the coupling strength of the
intrachain bonds along one lattice direction and J the coupling strength of the
interchain bonds. We identify three distinct phases of the Heisenberg model.
Increasing xi=J'/J from the effective square lattice xi=0, we find an AFM Neel
order to spiral order transition at xi_{c1} = 0.6-0.7, with indication to be of
second order. In addition, above the isotropic point at xi_{c2} = 1.1, we find
a first order transition to a magnetically disordered phase with collinear AFM
stripe fluctuations.
