We investigate hydrodynamic noise in a dilute granular gas during the
homogeneous cooling state, by means of a proper application of the Direct
Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) algorithm. The DSMC includes a source of
randomization which is not present in Molecular Dynamics (MD) for inelastic
hard disks. Notwithstanding this difference, a fair quantitative agreement is
found, including a violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation for the
noise amplitude of the same order observed in MD. This study suggests that
deterministic collision dynamics is not an essential ingredient to reproduce,
up to a good degree of approximation, hydrodynamic fluctuations in dilute
granular gases.
