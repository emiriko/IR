We compare and contrast three different methods for the construction of the
differential relations satisfied by the fundamental Abelian functions
associated with an algebraic curve. We realize these Abelian functions as
logarithmic derivatives of the associated sigma function. In two of the
methods, the use of the tau function, expressed in terms of the sigma function,
is central to the construction of differential relations between the Abelian
functions.
