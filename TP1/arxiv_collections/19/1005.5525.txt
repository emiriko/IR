The Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) is a well-known
combinatorial optimization problem with a host of applications. It is an
extension of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) where the set of cities is
partitioned into so-called clusters, and the salesman has to visit every
cluster exactly once.
  While the GTSP is a very important combinatorial optimization problem and is
well studied in many aspects, the local search algorithms used in the
literature are mostly basic adaptations of simple TSP heuristics. Hence, a
thorough and deep research of the neighborhoods and local search algorithms
specific to the GTSP is required.
  We formalize the procedure of adaptation of a TSP neighborhood for the GTSP
and classify all other existing and some new GTSP neighborhoods. For every
neighborhood, we provide efficient exploration algorithms that are often
significantly faster than the ones known from the literature. Finally, we
compare different local search implementations empirically.
