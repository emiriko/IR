"Hopscotch" is a world-wide game for children to play since the times in the
ancient Roman Empire and China. Here we present a study mainly focused on the
research and discussion of the application on the children's well-know
edutainment via the physical interactive design to provide the sensing of the
times for the conventional hopscotch, which is a new type of experiment for the
technology aided edutainment. The innovated hopscotch music game involves the
sound samples of various animals and the characters of cartoon, and the
algorithmic composition via the development of the music technology based
interactive game, to gradually make the children perceive the world of digits,
sound, and music. It can guide the growing children's personality and character
from disorder into clarity. Furthermore, the traditional teaching materials can
be improved via the implementation of the electrical sensing devices,
electrical I/O module, and the computer music program Max/MSP, to integrate the
interactive computer music with the interactive and immersive soundscapes
composition, and the teaching tool with educational gaming is completely
accomplished eventually.
