We performed a search for neutron spin coupling to a Lorentz and
CPT-violating background field using a magnetometer with overlapping ensembles
of K and $^3$He atoms. The co-magnetometer is mounted on a rotary platform for
frequent reversal of its orientation. We measure sidereal oscillations in the
signal to search for anomalous spin coupling of extra-solar origin. We
determine the equatorial components of the background field interacting with
the neutron spin to be $\widetilde{b}^n_X = (0.1 \pm 1.6) \times 10^{-33}$ GeV
and $\widetilde{b}^n_Y = (2.5 \pm 1.6) \times 10^{-33}$ GeV, improving on the
previous limit by a factor of 30. This measurement represents the highest
energy resolution of any spin anisotropy experiment.
