In late 2008, the quasi-persistent neutron star X-ray transient and eclipsing
binary EXO 0748-676 started a transition from outburst to quiescence, after it
had been actively accreting for more than 24 years. In a previous work, we
discussed Chandra and Swift observations obtained during the first five months
after this transition. Here, we report on further X-ray observations of EXO
0748-676, extending the quiescent monitoring to 1.6 years. Chandra and
XMM-Newton data reveal quiescent X-ray spectra composed of a soft, thermal
component that is well-fitted by a neutron star atmosphere model. An additional
hard powerlaw tail is detected that changes non-monotonically over time,
contributing between 4 and 20 percent to the total unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux.
The combined set of Chandra, XMM-Newton and Swift data reveals that the thermal
bolometric luminosity fades from ~1E34 to 6E33 (D/7.4 kpc)^2 erg/s, whereas the
inferred neutron star effective temperature decreases from ~124 to 109 eV. We
interpret the observed decay as cooling of the neutron star crust and show that
the fractional quiescent temperature change of EXO 0748-676 is markedly smaller
than observed for three other neutron star X-ray binaries that underwent
prolonged accretion outbursts.
