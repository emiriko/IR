We consider a parameter estimation problem to determine the viscosity $\nu$
of a stochastically perturbed 2D Navier-Stokes system. We derive several
different classes of estimators based on the first $N$ Fourier modes of a
single sample path observed on a finite time interval. We study the consistency
and asymptotic normality of these estimators. Our analysis treats strong,
pathwise solutions for both the periodic and bounded domain cases in the
presence of an additive white (in time) noise.
