We derive the general formula giving the Berry phase for an arbitrary spin,
having both magnetic-dipole and electric-quadrupole couplings with external
time-dependent fields. We assume that the effective E and B fields remain
orthogonal during the quantum cycles. This mild restriction has many
advantages. It provides simple symmetries leading to selection rules and the
Hamiltonian-parameter and density-matrix spaces coincide for S=1. This implies
the identity of the Berry and Aharonov-Anandan phases, which is lost for S>1.
We have found that new features of Berry phases emerge for integer spins>2. We
provide explicit numerical results of Berry phases for S=2,3,4. We give a
precise analysis of the non-adiabatic corrections. The accuracy for satisfying
adiabaticity is greatly improved if one chooses for the time derivatives of the
parameters a time-dependence having a Blackman pulse shape. This has the effect
of taming the non-adiabatic oscillation corrections which could be generated by
a linear ramping. For realistic experimental conditions, the non-adibatic
corrections can be kept < 0.1%. For quantum cycles,involving as sole periodic
parameter the precession angle of E around B, the corrections odd upon the
reversal of the angular velocity can be cancelled exactly if the quadrupole to
dipole coupling ratio takes a "magic" value. The even ones are cancelled by
subtraction of the phases relative to opposite velocities. As a possible
application of the results of this paper we suggest a route to holonomic
entanglement of N non-correlated 1/2-spins by performing adiabatic cycles
governed by a Hamiltonian which is a non-linear function of the total spin
operator S defined as the sum of the N spin operators. The case N=4 and Sz=1 is
treated explicitly and maximum entanglement is achieved.
