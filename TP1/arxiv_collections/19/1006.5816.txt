We report on the computation of the $B_s$ meson decay constant in Heavy Quark
Effective Theory on the lattice. The next to leading order corrections in the
HQET expansion are included non-perturbatively. We estimate higher order
contributions to be very small. The results are extrapolated to the continuum
limit, the main systematic error affecting the computation is therefore the
quenched approximation used here. The Generalized Eigenvalue Problem and the
use of all-to-all propagators are important technical ingredients of our
approach that allow to keep statistical and systematic errors under control. We
also report on the decay constant $f_{B'_s}$ of the first radially excited
state in the $B_s$ sector, computed in the static limit.
