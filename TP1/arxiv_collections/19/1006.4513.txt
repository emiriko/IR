(abridged) Hard X-ray surveys performed by the INTEGRAL satellite have
discovered a conspicuous fraction (up to 30%) of unidentified objects among the
detected sources. Here we continue our identification program by selecting
probable optical candidates using positional cross-correlation with soft X-ray,
radio, and/or optical archives, and performing optical spectroscopy on them. As
a result, we identified or more accurately characterized 44 counterparts of
INTEGRAL sources: 32 active galactic nuclei, with redshift 0.019 < z < 0.6058,
6 cataclysmic variables (CVs), 5 high-mass X-ray binaries (2 of which in the
Small Magellanic Cloud), and 1 low-mass X-ray binary. This was achieved by
using 7 telescopes of various sizes and archival data from two online
spectroscopic surveys. The main physical parameters of these hard X-ray sources
were also determined using the available multiwavelength information. AGNs are
the most abundant population among hard X-ray objects, and our results confirm
this tendency when optical spectroscopy is used as an identification tool. The
deeper sensitivity of recent INTEGRAL surveys enables one to begin detecting
hard X-ray emission above 20 keV from sources such as LINER-type AGNs and
non-magnetic CVs.
