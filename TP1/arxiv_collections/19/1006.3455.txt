An external description for aperiodically sampled MIMO linear systems has
been developed. Emphasis is on the sampling period sequence, included among the
variables to be handled. The computational procedure is simple and no use of
polynomial matrix theory is required. This input/output description is believed
to be a basic formulation for its later application to the problem of optimal
control and/or identification of linear dynamical systems.
