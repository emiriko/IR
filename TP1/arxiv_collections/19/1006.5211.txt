We investigate a lema that excludes existence of the phase operator and
present a condition to avoid the lema. A method for construction of an analytic
function 'f' of the annihilation operator 'a' is given. f(z) is analytic on
some compact domain that does not separate the complex plane. Using these
results we obtain ln a. Since [N ,-i ln a]=i, we can use ln a to construct an
operator $\Phi$, which satisfies the definition of the phase operator.
