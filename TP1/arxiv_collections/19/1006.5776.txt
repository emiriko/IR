We describe the characteristics and evolution of the magnetic field and
chromospheric emission in an active region core observed by the Solar Optical
Telescope on Hinode. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the moss is
unipolar, the spatial distribution of magnetic flux evolves slowly, and the
magnetic field is only moderately inclined. We show that the field line
inclination and horizontal component are coherent, and that the magnetic field
is mostly sheared in the inter-moss regions where the highest magnetic flux
variability is seen. Using extrapolations from SP magnetograms we show that the
magnetic connectivity in the moss is different than in the quiet Sun because
most of the magnetic field extends to significant coronal heights. The magnetic
flux, field vector, and chromospheric emission in the moss also appear highly
dynamic, but actually show only small scale variations in magnitude on
time-scales longer than the cooling times for hydrodynamic loops computed from
our extrapolations, suggesting high-frequency (continuous) heating events. Some
evidence is found for flux (Ca 2 intensity) changes on the order of 100--200 G
(DN) on time-scales of 20--30 mins that could be taken as indicative of
low-frequency heating. We find, however, that only a small fraction (10%) of
our simulated loops would be expected to cool on these time-scales, and we find
no clear evidence that the flux changes consistently produce intensity changes
in the chromosphere. The magnetic flux and chromospheric intensity in most
individual SOT pixels in the moss vary by less than ~ 20% and ~ 10%,
respectively, on loop cooling time-scales. In view of the high energy
requirements of the chromosphere, we suggest that these variations could be
sufficient for the heating of `warm' EUV loops, but that the high basal levels
may be more important for powering the hot core loops rooted in the moss.
