We use Monte Carlo simulations to examine the simplest model of an ionic
liquid, called the restricted primitive model, at a metal surface. We find that
at moderately low temperatures the capacitance of the metal/ionic liquid
interface is so large that the effective thickness of the electrostatic
double-layer is up to 3 times smaller than the ion radius. To interpret these
results we suggest an approach which is based on the interaction between
discrete ions and their image charges in the metal surface and which therefore
goes beyond the mean-field approximation. When a voltage is applied across the
interface, the strong image attraction causes counterions to condense onto the
metal surface to form compact ion-image dipoles. These dipoles repel each other
to form a correlated liquid. When the surface density of these dipoles is low,
the insertion of an additional dipole does not require much energy. This leads
to a large capacitance $C$ that decreases monotonically with voltage $V$,
producing a "bell-shaped" curve $C(V)$. We also consider what happens when the
electrode is made from a semi-metal rather than a perfect metal. In this case,
the finite screening radius of the electrode shifts the reflection plane for
image charges to the interior of the electrode and we arrive at a
"camel-shaped" $C(V)$. These predictions seem to be in qualitative agreement
with experiment.
