We use the semi-analytic model GalICS to predict the Tully-Fisher relation in
the B, I and for the first time, in the K band, and its evolution with
redshift, up to z~1. We refined the determination of the disk galaxies rotation
velocity, with a dynamical recipe for the rotation curve, rather than a simple
conversion from the total mass to maximum velocity. The new recipe takes into
account the disk shape factor, and the angular momentum transfer occurring
during secular evolution leading to the formation of bulges. This produces
model rotation velocities that are lower by ~20-25% for the majority of the
spirals. We implemented stellar population models with a complete treatment of
the TP-AGB, which leads to a revision of the mass-to-light ratio in the
near-IR. I/K band luminosities increase by ~0.3/0.5 mags at redshift z=0 and by
~0.5/1 mags at z=3. With these two new recipes in place, the comparison between
the predicted Tully-Fisher relation with a series of datasets in the optical
and near-IR, at redshifts between 0 and 1, is used as a diagnostics of the
assembly and evolution of spiral galaxies in the model. At 0.4<z<1.2 the match
between the new model and data is remarkably good, especially for later-type
spirals (Sb/Sc). At z=0 the new model shows a net improvement in comparison
with its original version of 2003, and in accord with recent observations in
the K band, the model Tully-Fisher also shows a morphological differentiation.
However, in all bands the z=0 model Tully-Fisher is too bright. We argue that
this behaviour is caused by inadequate star formation histories in the model
galaxies at low redshifts. The star-formation rate declines too slowly, due to
continuous gas infall that is not efficiently suppressed. An analysis of the
model disk scale lengths, at odds with observations, hints to some missing
physics in the modeling of disk formation inside dark matter halos.
