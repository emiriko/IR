We report a general analysis of worldlines for theories with deformed
relativistic symmetries and momentum dependence of the speed of photons. Our
formalization is faithful to Einstein's program, with spacetime points viewed
as an abstraction of physical events. The emerging picture imposes the
renunciation of the idealization of absolutely coincident events, but is free
from some pathologies which had been previously conjectured.
