It is nowadays a quite diffuse idea that variations of electronic
polarisation, as introduced by Resta[1], in condensed matter theory are related
to a "Berry phase"[2], as shown by Vanderbilt. The derivation of the latter
geometric phase is correct and the periodic gauge[2] is used for its
derivation, aside not allowing for its calculations in finite electromagnetic
fields. Its derivation has not been demonstrated in the general case of an
external homogeneous electric field interacting with the electronic field. In
the present paper we give a brief derivation of the algorithm for the
calculations of polarisation differences in a general manner than in[2]
defining it even in the presence of an external electric field interacting with
the electronic field and writing equations in a way directly implementable in
modern first principles codes[1,2]
