We present a novel algorithm for segmentation of natural images that
harnesses the principle of minimum description length (MDL). Our method is
based on observations that a homogeneously textured region of a natural image
can be well modeled by a Gaussian distribution and the region boundary can be
effectively coded by an adaptive chain code. The optimal segmentation of an
image is the one that gives the shortest coding length for encoding all
textures and boundaries in the image, and is obtained via an agglomerative
clustering process applied to a hierarchy of decreasing window sizes as
multi-scale texture features. The optimal segmentation also provides an
accurate estimate of the overall coding length and hence the true entropy of
the image. We test our algorithm on the publicly available Berkeley
Segmentation Dataset. It achieves state-of-the-art segmentation results
compared to other existing methods.
