We study the behavior of hybrid stars using an extended hadronic and quark
SU(3) non-linear sigma model. The degrees of freedom change naturally, in this
model, from hadrons to quarks as the density/temperature increases. At zero
temperature, we reproduce massive neutron stars containing a core of hybrid
matter of 2 km for the non-rotating case and 1.18 km and 0.87 km, in the
equatorial and polar directions respectively, for stars rotating at the Kepler
frequency (physical cases lie in between). The cooling of such stars is also
analyzed.
