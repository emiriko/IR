We develop an analytical model for describing the dynamics of a donor-based
charge quantum bit (qubit). As a result, the quantum decoherence of the qubit
is analytically obtained and shown to reveal non-Markovian features: The
decoherence rate varies with time and even attains negative values, generating
a non-exponential decay of the electronic coherence and a later recoherence.
The resulting coherence time is inversely proportional to the temperature, thus
leading to low decoherence below a material dependent characteristic
temperature.
