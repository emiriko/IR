We propose an approach to analyze the dissipation properties of coupled
cavity arrays. Employing a kind of quasi-boson, it is shown that the coupling
to a bath renormalizes the localized mode and the interaction between cavities.
By virtue of without having to mention the coordinates of bath, this approach
would be great conceptual and, moreover, computation advantage. Based on the
result, a single-photon transport in the array is examined, and the total
transmission rate is presented. Besides, we also suggest a parameter to scale
quality of the array.
