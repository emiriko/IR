The carrier type and density in Bi2Se3 single crystals are systematically
tuned by introducing a calcium (Ca) dopant. A carrier density of ~1x1017 cm-3
which corresponds to ~25 meV in the Fermi energy is obtained in both n- and
p-type materials. Electrical transport properties show that the insulating
behavior is achieved in low carrier density crystals. In addition, both the
band gap and reduced effective mass of carriers are determined.
