Many quantum condensed matter systems are strongly correlated and strongly
interacting fermionic systems, which cannot be treated perturbatively. However,
topology allows us to determine generic features of their fermionic spectrum,
which are robust to perturbation and interaction. We discuss the nodeless 3D
system, such as superfluid $^3$He-B, vacuum of Dirac fermions, and relativistic
singlet and triplet supercondutors which may arise in quark matter. The
systems, which have nonzero value of topological invariant, have gapless
fermions on the boundary and in the core of quantized vortices. We discuss the
index theorem which relates fermion zero modes on vortices with the topological
invariants in combined momentum and coordinate space.
