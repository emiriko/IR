Effective dimension-5 operators which modify the gauge kinetic term in Grand
Unified Theories may arise as a consequence of quantum gravity or string
compactification. We exhaustively calculate the modification of the gauge
unification condition due to such operators for all viable rank-preserving
symmetry breakings of SO(10) and E(6) grand unified models.
