We study regular spacelike warped black holes in the three dimensional
general massive gravity model, which contains both the gravitational
Chern-Simons term and the linear combination of curvature squared terms
characterizing the new massive gravity besides the Einstein-Hilbert term. The
parameters of the metric are found by solving a quartic equation constrained by
an inequality that imposes the absence of closed timelike curves. Explicit
expressions for the central charges are suggested by exploiting the fact that
these black holes are discrete quotients of spacelike warped AdS(3) and a known
formula for the entropy. Previous results obtained separately in topological
massive gravity and in new massive gravity are recovered as special cases.
