We discuss experimental schemes to measure the Casimir force and short range
forces from hypothetical modified gravity with unprecedented sensitivity using
highly sensitive prototype gravitational wave detectors as displacement
sensors. The finite temperature effects of the Casimir force would be
detectable with a sensitivity of better than 1% for separation exceeding 30
microns. Constraints on short range modifications to gravity can be improved in
the distance range of 10-100 microns.
