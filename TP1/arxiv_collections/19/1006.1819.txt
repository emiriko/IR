When a planar shock wave interacts with a random pattern of pre-shock density
non-uniformities, it generates an anisotropic turbulent velocity/vorticity
field. This turbulence plays an important role at the early stages of the
mixing process in the compressed fluid. This situation emerges naturally in
shock interaction with weakly inhomogeneous deuterium-wicked foam targets in
Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) and with density clumps/clouds in
astrophysics. We present an exact small-amplitude linear theory describing such
interaction. It is based on the exact theory of time and space evolution of the
perturbed quantities behind a corrugated shock front for a single-mode
pre-shock non-uniformity. Appropriate mode averaging in 2D results in closed
analytical expressions for the turbulent kinetic energy, degree of anisotropy
of velocity and vorticity fields in the shocked fluid, shock amplification of
the density non-uniformity, and sonic energy flux radiated downstream. These
explicit formulas are further simplified in the important asymptotic limits of
weak/strong shocks and highly compressible fluids. A comparison with the
related problem of a shock interacting with a pre-shock isotropic vorticity
field is also presented.
