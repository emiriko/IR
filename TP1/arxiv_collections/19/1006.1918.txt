We present remote Operating System detection as an inference problem: given a
set of observations (the target host responses to a set of tests), we want to
infer the OS type which most probably generated these observations. Classical
techniques used to perform this analysis present several limitations. To
improve the analysis, we have developed tools using neural networks and
Statistics tools. We present two working modules: one which uses DCE-RPC
endpoints to distinguish Windows versions, and another which uses Nmap
signatures to distinguish different version of Windows, Linux, Solaris,
OpenBSD, FreeBSD and NetBSD systems. We explain the details of the topology and
inner workings of the neural networks used, and the fine tuning of their
parameters. Finally we show positive experimental results.
