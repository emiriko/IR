General properties of long wavelength triangular graphene superlattice are
studied. It is shown that Dirac points with and without gaps can arise at a
number of high symmetry points of the Brillouin Zone. The existence of gaps can
lead to insulating behavior at commensurate fillings. Strain and magnetic
superlattices are also discussed.
