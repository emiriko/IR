We present a class of 2D systems which shows a counterintuitive property that
contradicts a semi classical intuition: A 2D quantum particle "prefers"
tunneling through a barrier rather than traveling above it. Viewing the one
particle 2D system as the system of two 1D particles, it is demonstrated that
this effect occurs due to a specific symmetry of the barrier that forces
excitations of the interparticle degree of freedom that, in turn, leads to the
appearance of an effective potential barrier even though there is no "real"
barrier. This phenomenon cannot exist in 1D.
