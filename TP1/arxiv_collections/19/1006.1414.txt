We present a variant of ATL with distributed knowledge operators based on a
synchronous and perfect recall semantics. The coalition modalities in this
logic are based on partial observation of the full history, and incorporate a
form of cooperation between members of the coalition in which agents issue
their actions based on the distributed knowledge, for that coalition, of the
system history. We show that model-checking is decidable for this logic. The
technique utilizes two variants of games with imperfect information and
partially observable objectives, as well as a subset construction for
identifying states whose histories are indistinguishable to the considered
coalition.
