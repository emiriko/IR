It is standard to regard the intuitionistic restriction of a classical logic
as increasing the expressivity of the logic because the classical logic can be
adequately represented in the intuitionistic logic by double-negation, while
the other direction has no truth-preserving propositional encodings. We show
here that subexponential logic, which is a family of substructural refinements
of classical logic, each parametric over a preorder over the subexponential
connectives, does not suffer from this asymmetry if the preorder is
systematically modified as part of the encoding. Precisely, we show a bijection
between synthetic (i.e., focused) partial sequent derivations modulo a given
encoding. Particular instances of our encoding for particular subexponential
preorders give rise to both known and novel adequacy theorems for substructural
logics.
