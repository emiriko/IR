On Archimedean lattices, the Ising model exhibits spontaneous ordering. Three
examples of these lattices of the majority-vote model with noise are considered
and studied through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The order/disorder phase
transition is observed in this system. The calculated values of the critical
noise parameter are q_c=0.089(5), q_c=0.078(3), and q_c=0.114(2) for honeycomb,
Kagome and triangular lattices, respectively. The critical exponents beta/nu,
gamma/nu and 1/nu for this model are 0.15(5), 1.64(5), and 0.87(5); 0.14(3),
1.64(3), and 0.86(6); 0.12(4), 1.59(5), and 1.08(6) for honeycomb, Kagome and
triangular lattices, respectively. These results differs from the usual Ising
model results and the majority-vote model on so-far studied regular lattices or
complex networks. The effective dimensionalities of the system D_{eff}= 1.96(5)
(honeycomb), D_{eff} =1.92(4) (Kagome), and D_{eff}= 1.83(5) (triangular) for
these networks are just compatible to the embedding dimension two.
