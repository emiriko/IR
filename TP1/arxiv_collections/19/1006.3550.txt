We study the population dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a
double-well potential throughout the crossover from Josephson dynamics to
hydrodynamics. At barriers higher than the chemical potential, we observe slow
oscillations well described by a Josephson model. In the limit of low barriers,
the fundamental frequency agrees with a simple hydrodynamic model, but we also
observe a second, higher frequency. A full numerical simulation of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation giving the frequencies and amplitudes of the observed
modes between these two limits is compared to the data and is used to
understand the origin of the higher mode. Implications for trapped matter-wave
interferometers are discussed.
