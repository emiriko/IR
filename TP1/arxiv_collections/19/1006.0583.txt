Being homologue to the new, Fe-based type of high-temperature
superconductors, CeFePO exhibits magnetism, Kondo and heavy-fermion phenomena.
We experimentally studied the electronic structure of CeFePO by means of
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. In particular, contributions of the
Ce 4f-derived states and their hybridization to the Fe 3d bands were explored
using both symmetry selection rules for excitation and their photoionization
cross-section variations as a function of photon energy. It was experimentally
found - and later on confirmed by LDA as well as DMFT calculations - that the
Ce 4f states hybridize to the Fe 3d states of d_{3z^2-r^2} symmetry near the
Fermi level that discloses their participation in the occurring
electron-correlation phenomena and provides insight into mechanism of
superconductivity in oxopnictides.
