In a previous article, we have investigated the non-equilibrium two-level
Anderson model with a simple iterative perturbation theory. Here we use here a
more sophisticated perturbative method, the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX)
approximation. The great advantage of FLEX is its \textit{conserving} nature,
and that it can describe well the Kondo energy scale, the Kondo-temperature,
$T_{K}$. As it was expected from the results obtained with iterative
perturbation theory, the FLEX description can give back also the relevant
features of the spectral properties.
