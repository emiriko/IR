We study the evolution of an asymptotically free vectorial SU($N$) gauge
theory from the ultraviolet to the infrared and the resultant phase structure
in the general case in which the theory contains fermions transforming
according to several different representations of the gauge group. We discuss
the sequential fermion condensation and dynamical mass generation that occur,
and comment on the effect of bare fermion mass terms.
