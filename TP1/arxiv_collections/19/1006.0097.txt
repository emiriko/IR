In this contribution we discuss conceptual issues of current mass
measurements performed at the Tevatron. In addition we propose an alternative
method which is theoretically much cleaner and to a large extend free from the
problems encountered in current measurements. In detail we discuss the direct
determination of the top-quark's running mass from the cross section
measurements performed at the Tevatron.
