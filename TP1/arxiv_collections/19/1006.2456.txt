In this work we study a modified version of the Sznajd sociophysics model. In
particular we introduce reputation, a mechanism that limits the capacity of
persuasion of the agents. The reputation is introduced as a score which is
time-dependent, and its introduction avoid dictatorship (all spins parallel)
for a wide range of parameters. The relaxation time follows a log-normal-like
distribution. In addition, we show that the usual phase transition also occurs,
as in the standard model, and it depends on the initial concentration of
individuals following an opinion, occurring at a initial density of up spins
greater than $1/2$. The transition point is determined by means of a
finite-size scaling analysis.
