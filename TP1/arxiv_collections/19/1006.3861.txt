Rotational velocity, lithium abundance, and the mass depth of the outer
convective zone are key parameters in the study of the processes at work in the
stellar interior, in particular when examining the poorly understood processes
operating in the interior of solar-analog stars. We investigate whether the
large dispersion in the observed lithium abundances of solar-analog stars can
be explained by the depth behavior of the outer convective zone masses, within
the framework of the standard convection model based on the local mixing-length
theory. We also aims to analyze the link between rotation and lithium abundance
in solar-analog stars. We computed a new extensive grid of stellar evolutionary
models, applicable to solar-analog stars, for a finely discretized set of mass
and metallicity. From these models, the stellar mass, age, and mass depth of
the outer convective zone were estimated for 117 solar-analog stars, using Teff
and [Fe/H] available in the literature, and the new HIPPARCOS trigonometric
parallax measurements. We determine the age and mass of the outer convective
zone for a bona fide sample of 117 solar-analog stars. No significant on-to-one
correlation is found between the computed convection zone mass and published
lithium abundance, indicating that the large A(Li) dispersion in solar analogs
cannot be explained by the classical framework of envelope convective mixing
coupled with lithium depletion at the bottom of the convection zone. These
results illustrate the need for an extra-mixing process to explain lithium
behavior in solar-analog stars, such as, shear mixing caused by differential
rotation. To derive a more realistic definition of solar-analog stars, as well
as solar-twin, it seems important to consider the inner physical properties of
stars, such as convection, hence rotation and magnetic properties.
