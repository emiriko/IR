In this paper, we present a model for the effects of the tachocline on the
differential rotation in the solar convection zone. The mathematical technique
relies on the assumption that entropy is nearly constant ("well-mixed") in
isorotation surfaces both outside and within the tachocline. The resulting
solutions exhibit nontrivial features that strikingly resemble the true
tachocline isorotation contours in unexpected detail. This strengthens the
mathematical premises of the theory. The observed rotation pattern in the
tachocline shows strong quadrupolar structure, an important feature that is
explicitly used in constructing our solutions. The tachocline is treated
locally as an interior boundary layer of small but finite thickness, and an
explicit global solution is then constructed. A dynamical link can thus be
established between the internal jump in the angular velocity at the tachocline
and the spread of angular velocities observed near the solar surface. In
general, our results suggest that the bulk of the solar convection zone is in
thermal wind balance, and that simple quadrupolar stresses, local in radius,
mediate the tachocline transition from differential rotation to uniform
rotation in the radiative interior.
