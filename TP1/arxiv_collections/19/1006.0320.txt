The theoretical base of the research of occupational injuries is the idea of
the process as Markov chain of random variables. However the exact proof of
this position was not carried out whereas the experimental passing of the
hypothesis is connected always with the determined confidence limits and
consequently it gives the space for alternative assumptions. In this research
some databases of occupational injuries had been studied using spectral
analysis techniques and the presentation of the occupational injuries as the
temporal sequence of the cases ("telegraph wave" process type). Databases had
corresponding chapters such as "enterprise" with number of employees about
7000, "big enterprise" (the number of employees about 35000), "whole branch of
industry", "whole enterprises of industrial region" receiving during 10 years
from different countries having distinguish system of the work organization
(Russia and Italy). The behaviour of spectra on principal is not changed when
vary the length of realization, resolution, smoothing, upper boundary
frequency, country and year of datas. All spectra showed that the occupational
injuries process has a not Markov, but deterministic polyharmonic behaviour.
This phenomenon is characterized by the spectral lines with two frequencies
corresponding 24 hours (circadian rythm have main amplitude) and 7 days
(amplitude is two times smaller) exactly. Harmonics corresponding one month
(biorythms) were not founded. The task of the futher investigations is to find
the psychophysiological and biomedical processes determined and having high
level of correlation with the occupational injuries process.
