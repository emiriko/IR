We demonstrate the unique capabilities of Herschel to study very young
luminous extragalactic young stellar objects (YSOs) by analyzing a central
strip of the Large Magellanic Cloud obtained through the HERITAGE Science
Demonstration Program. We combine PACS 100 and 160, and SPIRE 250, 350, and 500
microns photometry with 2MASS (1.25-2.17 microns) and Spitzer IRAC and MIPS
(3.6-70 microns) to construct complete spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
compact sources. From these, we identify 207 candidate embedded YSOs in the
observed region, ~40% never-before identified. We discuss their position in
far-infrared color-magnitude space, comparing with previously studied,
spectroscopically confirmed YSOs and maser emission. All have red colors
indicating massive cool envelopes and great youth. We analyze four example
YSOs, determining their physical properties by fitting their SEDs with
radiative transfer models. Fitting full SEDs including the Herschel data
requires us to increase the size and mass of envelopes included in the models.
This implies higher accretion rates (greater than or equal to 0.0001 M_sun/yr),
in agreement with previous outflow studies of high-mass protostars. Our results
show that Herschel provides reliable longwave SEDs of large samples of
high-mass YSOs; discovers the youngest YSOs whose SEDs peak in Herschel bands;
and constrains the physical properties and evolutionary stages of YSOs more
precisely than was previously possible.
