Study of AC losses in superconducting wires and tapes is usually restricted
by consideration of applied sinusoidal currents and/or magnetic fields.
However, currents in electric power systems contain a wide variety of
harmonics. The currents become strongly non-sinusoidal at the operation of
converters, non-linear reactors, and during transient and overload conditions.
Recently it has been shown that the contribution of higher harmonics to AC
losses in superconducting bulk and thin film samples can be tens times larger
than in normal-metal samples of the same form and the 5% harmonic can increase
the losses by up to 20%. Here we report the results of the analysis of the
influence of higher harmonics of the current and magnetic field on AC losses in
coated conductors. Analytical expressions are obtained in the framework of the
critical state model neglecting response of the normal-metal substrate and
stabilization layers. Losses in the superconducting and normal-metal parts of a
coated conductor are compared for various designs of the conductor. It is also
shown that the 5% third current harmonic can increase the losses in the
normal-metal parts by up to 90%. This increase is caused by non-linear response
of superconducting layers and should be taken into account at determination of
the optimal operation regimes of superconducting devices.
