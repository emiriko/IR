Using the high granular CALICE analog hadron calorimeter (AHCal) a tracking
algorithm capable of identifying MIP-like tracks within hadronic showers is
presented. Such an algorithm provides excellent tools for detector calibration
and for studies of the substructure of hadronic showers. The properties of the
identified tracks are used as observables for a Monte-Carlo to data comparison.
