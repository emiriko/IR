In this paper, we report experimental results on the shape and motion of a
mercury droplet, placed in a horizontally rotating cylinder in the rpm range
8-93, so that the Reynolds number of the drop 2500<Re<26000 and its capillary
number 0.0002<Ca<0.0023. When contact angle variations can be neglected at low
speeds (Re<8150), the velocity of the drop is much lower than that predicted by
the Ho. Young Kim's [6] relation. This observed discrepancy is overcome by
modifying Kim's relation by substituting the dissipation estimated from a
boundary layer near the solid surface instead of bulk dissipation. Based on the
changes at the rear side of the mercury droplet, there are three distinct
regimes identified with varying speeds of rotation (i) oval or rounded regime
(ii) corner regime and (iii) cusping regime. The oval to corner transition
happens at a finite receding contact angle of 950. The ratio of critical
contact angle ({\theta}c) at which the transition occurs to the static receding
contact angle ({\theta}s) was found to be 0.657. The de Gennes model [4],
extended to high contact angle by substituting the dissipation for wedge flow,
predicts a critical contact angle ratio ({\theta}c/{\theta}s) that is in close
agreement with the experimental value. At higher Re, the dynamic contact angle
variation with velocity was compared with Cox-Voinov model [3]. Though the
trend of the variation of data is approximately represented by the model, the
fit coefficient according to experimental data is very high when compared to
theoretical value.
