We analyze the consequences resulting from the asymmetric boundary conditions
imposed by a non-uniform external magnetic field at the extremities of a planar
Josephson tunnel junction and predict a number of testable signatures. When the
junction length $L$ is smaller than its Josephson penetration depth
$\lambda_j$, static analytical calculations lead to a Fresnel-like magnetic
diffraction pattern, rather than a Fraunhofer-like one typical of a uniform
field. Numerical simulations allow to investigate intermediate length
($L\approx \lambda_j$) and long ($L>\lambda_j$) junctions. We consider both
uniform and $\delta$-shaped bias distributions. We also speculate on the
possibility of exploiting the unique static properties of this system for basic
experiments and devices.
