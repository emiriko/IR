The wavefunction of a massless fermion consists of two chiralities,
left-handed and right-handed, which are eigenstates of the chiral operator. The
theory of weak interactions of elementally particle physics is not symmetric
about the two chiralities, and such a symmetry breaking theory is referred to
as a chiral gauge theory. The chiral gauge theory can be applied to the
massless Dirac particles of graphene. In this paper we show within the
framework of the chiral gauge theory for graphene that a topological soliton
exists near the boundary of a graphene nanoribbon in the presence of a strain.
This soliton is a zero-energy state connecting two chiralities and is an
elementally excitation transporting a pseudospin. The soliton should be
observable by means of a scanning tunneling microscopy experiment.
