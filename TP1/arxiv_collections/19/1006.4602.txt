The Brorfelde Schmidt CCD Catalog (BSCC) contains about 13.7 million stars,
north of +49 deg Declination with precise positions and V, R photometry. The
catalog has been constructed from the reductions of 18,667 CCD frames observed
with the Brorfelde Schmidt Telescope between 2000 and 2007. The Tycho-2 catalog
was used for astrometric and photometric reference stars. Errors of individual
positions are about 20 to 200 mas for stars in the R = 10 to 18 mag range.
External comparisons with 2MASS and SDSS reveal possible small systematic
errors in the BSCC of up to about 30 mas. The catalog is supplemented with J,
H, and K_s magnitudes from the 2MASS catalog. The catalog data file (about 550
MB ASCII, compressed) will be made available at the Strasbourg Data Center
(CDS).
