Discrete symmetries employed to explain flavor mixing and mass hierarchies
can be associated with an enlarged scalar sector which might lead to exotic
Higgs decay modes. In this paper, we explore such a possibility in a scenario
with $S_3$ flavor symmetry which requires three scalar SU(2) doublets. The
spectrum is fixed by minimizing the scalar potential, and we observe that the
symmetry of the model leads to tantalizing Higgs decay modes potentially
observable at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
