The influence of electronic structure evolution upon pressure on the
temperature dependencies of electrical resistivity of pure Np, Pu, Am, and Cm
metals have been investigated within coherent potential approximation (CPA) for
many-bands conductivity model. Electronic structure of pure actinide metals was
calculated within the local density approximation with the Hubbard U and
spin-orbit coupling corrections (LDA+U+SO) method in various phases at normal
conditions and under pressure. They were compared with the corresponding cubic
(bcc or fcc) phases. The densities of states of the latter were used as a
starting point of model investigations of electrical resistivity. The obtained
results were found in good agreement with available experimental data. The
nature of large magnitude of resistivity of actinides was discussed in terms of
the proposed conductivity model using the ab initio calculated parameters.
