We report the discovery of an eclipsing companion to NLTT 41135, a nearby M5
dwarf that was already known to have a wider, slightly more massive common
proper motion companion, NLTT 41136, at 2.4 arcsec separation. Analysis of
combined-light and radial velocity curves of the system indicates that NLTT
41135B is a 31-34 +/- 3 MJup brown dwarf (where the range depends on the
unknown metallicity of the host star) on a circular orbit. The visual M-dwarf
pair appears to be physically bound, so the system forms a hierarchical triple,
with masses approximately in the ratio 8:6:1. The eclipses are grazing,
preventing an unambiguous measurement of the secondary radius, but follow-up
observations of the secondary eclipse (e.g. with the James Webb Space
Telescope) could permit measurements of the surface brightness ratio between
the two objects, and thus place constraints on models of brown dwarfs.
