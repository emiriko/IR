We study the family of Y-systems and T-systems associated with the
sine-Gordon models and the reduced sine-Gordon models for the parameter of
continued fractions with two terms. We formulate these systems by cluster
algebras, which turn out to be of finite type, and prove their periodicities
and the associated dilogarithm identities which have been conjectured earlier.
In particular, this provides new examples of periodicities of seeds.
