Nanoparticles introduced in living cells are capable of strongly promoting
the aggregation of peptides and proteins. We use here molecular dynamics
simulations to characterise in detail the process by which nanoparticle
surfaces catalyse the self- assembly of peptides into fibrillar structures. The
simulation of a system of hundreds of peptides over the millisecond timescale
enables us to show that the mechanism of aggregation involves a first phase in
which small structurally disordered oligomers assemble onto the nanoparticle
and a second phase in which they evolve into highly ordered beta-sheets as
their size increases.
