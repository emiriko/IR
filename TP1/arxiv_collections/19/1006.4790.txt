Vacuum fluctuations provide a fundamental source of dissipation for systems
coupled to quantum fields by radiation pressure. In the dynamical Casimir
effect, accelerating neutral bodies in free space give rise to the emission of
real photons while experiencing a damping force which plays the role of a
radiation reaction force. Analog models where non-stationary conditions for the
electromagnetic field simulate the presence of moving plates are currently
under experimental investigation. A dissipative force might also appear in the
case of uniform relative motion between two bodies, thus leading to a new kind
of friction mechanism without mechanical contact. In this paper, we review
recent advances on the dynamical Casimir and non-contact friction effects,
highlighting their common physical origin.
