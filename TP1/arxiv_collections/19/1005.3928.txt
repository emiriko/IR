The magnetic and magnetostructural properties of the polycrystalline
Ce(Fe0.975Ga0.025)2 have been investigated as a function of temperature and
magnetic field. In Ce(Fe0.975Ga0.025)2 the magnetic transition from
antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic state (FM) is accompanied by a
structural transformation from rhombohedral to cubic structure. Phase
coexistence is present during both the temperature and field driven
transformations from the AFM to FM phase.
