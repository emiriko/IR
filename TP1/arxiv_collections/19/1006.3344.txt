It has often been suggested that supernova remnants (SNRs) can trigger star
formation. To investigate the relationship between SNRs and star formation, we
have examined the known sample of 45 SNRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud to
search for associated young stellar objects (YSOs) and molecular clouds. We
find seven SNRs associated with both YSOs and molecular clouds, three SNRs
associated with YSOs but not molecular clouds, and eight SNRs near molecular
clouds but not associated with YSOs. Among the 10 SNRs associated with YSOs,
the association between the YSOs and SNRs can be either rejected or cannot be
convincingly established for eight cases. Only two SNRs have YSOs closely
aligned along their rims; however, the time elapsed since the SNR began to
interact with the YSOs' natal clouds is much shorter than the contraction
timescales of the YSOs, and thus we do not see any evidence of SNR-triggered
star formation in the LMC. The 15 SNRs that are near molecular clouds may
trigger star formation in the future when the SNR shocks have slowed down to
<45 km/s. We discuss how SNRs can alter the physical properties and abundances
of YSOs.
