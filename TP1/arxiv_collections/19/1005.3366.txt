Free space propagation and conventional optical systems such as lenses and
mirrors all perform spatial unitary transforms. However, the subset of
transforms available through these conventional systems is limited in scope. We
present here a unitary programmable mode converter (UPMC) capable of performing
any spatial unitary transform of the light field. It is based on a succession
of reflections on programmable deformable mirrors and free space propagation.
We first show theoretically that a UPMC without limitations on resources can
perform perfectly any transform. We then build an experimental implementation
of the UPMC and show that, even when limited to three reflections on an array
of 12 pixels, the UPMC is capable of performing single mode tranforms with an
efficiency greater than 80% for the first 4 modes of the TEM basis.
