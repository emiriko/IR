For contact manifolds $(M, \eta)$ a complexification $M^c$ is constructed to
which the contact form $\eta$ extends such that the exterior derivative of the
extended form is K\"ahlerian. In the case of a proper action of an extendable
Lie group this construction is realized in an equivariant way. In a
simultaneous stratification of $M$ and $M^c$ according to the istropy type, it
is shown that the K\"ahlerian reduction of the complexification can be seen as
the complexification of the contact reduction.
