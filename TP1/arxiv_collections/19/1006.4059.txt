We analyze a toy model describing an empty spacetime in which the motion of a
test mass (and the trajectories of photons) evidence the presence of a
continuous and homogeneous distribution of matter; however, since the
energy-momentum tensor vanishes, no real matter or energy distribution is
present at all. Thus, a hypothetical observer will conclude that he is immersed
in some sort of dark matter, even though he has no chance to directly detect
it. This suggests yet another possibility of explaining the elusive dark matter
as a purely dynamical effect due to the curvature of spacetime.
