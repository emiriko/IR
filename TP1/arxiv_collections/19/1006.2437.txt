We have performed high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
on TlBiSe2, which is a member of the ternary chalcogenides theoretically
proposed as candidates for a new class of three-dimensional topological
insulators. By measuring the energy band dispersions over the entire surface
Brillouin zone, we found a direct evidence for a non-trivial surface metallic
state showing a X-shaped energy dispersion within the bulk band gap. The
present result unambiguously establishes that TlBiSe2 is a strong topological
insulator with a single Dirac cone at the Brillouin-zone center. The observed
bulk band gap of 0.4 eV is the largest among known topological insulators,
making TlBiSe2 the most promising material for studying room-temperature
topological phenomena.
