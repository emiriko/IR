We develop atmosphere models of two of the three Kepler-field planets that
were known prior to the start of the Kepler mission (HAT-P-7b and TrES-2). We
find that published Kepler and Spitzer data for HAT-P-7b appear to require an
extremely hot upper atmosphere on the dayside, with a strong thermal inversion
and little day-night redistribution. The Spitzer data for TrES-2 suggest a mild
thermal inversion with moderate day-night redistribution. We examine the effect
of nonequilibrium chemistry on TrES-2 model atmospheres and find that methane
levels must be adjusted by extreme amounts in order to cause even mild changes
in atmospheric structure and emergent spectra. Our best-fit models to the
Spitzer data for TrES-2 lead us to predict a low secondary eclipse planet-star
flux ratio (~2 x 10^-5) in the Kepler bandpass, which is consistent with what
very recent observations have found. Finally, we consider how the Kepler-band
optical flux from a hot exoplanet depends on the strength of a possible extra
optical absorber in the upper atmosphere. We find that the optical flux is not
monotonic in optical opacity, and the non-monotonicity is greater for brighter,
hotter stars.
