Online popularity has enormous impact on opinions, culture, policy, and
profits. We provide a quantitative, large scale, temporal analysis of the
dynamics of online content popularity in two massive model systems, the
Wikipedia and an entire country's Web space. We find that the dynamics of
popularity are characterized by bursts, displaying characteristic features of
critical systems such as fat-tailed distributions of magnitude and inter-event
time. We propose a minimal model combining the classic preferential popularity
increase mechanism with the occurrence of random popularity shifts due to
exogenous factors. The model recovers the critical features observed in the
empirical analysis of the systems analyzed here, highlighting the key factors
needed in the description of popularity dynamics.
