Searches for planetary transits find many astrophysical false positives as a
by-product. There are four main types analyzed in the literature: a
grazing-incidence eclipsing binary star, an eclipsing binary star with a small
radius companion star, a blend of one or more stars with an unrelated eclipsing
binary star, and a physical triple star system. We present a list of 69
astrophysical false positives that had been identified as candidates of
transiting planets of the on-going XO survey. This list may be useful in order
to avoid redundant observation and characterization of these particular
candidates independently identified by other wide-field searches for transiting
planets. The list may be useful for those modeling the yield of the XO survey
and surveys similar to it. Subsequent observations of some of the listed stars
may improve mass-radius relations, especially for low-mass stars. From the
candidates exhibiting eclipses, we report three new spectroscopic double-line
binaries and give mass function estimations for 15 single lined spectroscopic
binaries.
