A diffuse-interface model for microstructure with an arbitrary number of
components and phases was developed from basic thermodynamic and kinetic
principles and formalized within a variational framework. The model includes a
composition gradient energy to capture solute trapping, and is therefore suited
for studying phenomena where the width of the interface plays an important
role. Derivation of the inhomogeneous free energy functional from a Taylor
expansion of homogeneous free energy reveals how the interfacial properties of
each component and phase may be specified under a mass constraint. A diffusion
potential for components was defined away from the dilute solution limit, and a
multi-obstacle barrier function was used to constrain phase fractions. The
model was used to simulate solidification via nucleation, premelting at phase
boundaries and triple junctions, the intrinsic instability of small particles,
and solutal melting resulting from differing diffusivities in solid and liquid.
The shape of metastable free energy surfaces is found to play an important role
in microstructure evolution and may explain why some systems premelt at phase
boundaries and phase triple junctions while others do not.
