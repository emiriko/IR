The jamming scenario of disordered media, formulated about 10 years ago, has
in recent years been advanced by analyzing model systems of granular media.
This has led to various new concepts that are increasingly being explored in in
a variety of systems. This chapter contains an introductory review of these
recent developments and provides an outlook on their applicability to different
physical systems and on future directions. The first part of the paper is
devoted to an overview of the findings for model systems of frictionless
spheres, focussing on the excess of low-frequency modes as the jamming point is
approached. Particular attention is paid to a discussion of the cross-over
frequency and length scales that govern this approach. We then discuss the
effects of particle asphericity and static friction, the applicability to
bubble models for wet foams in which the friction is dynamic, the dynamical
arrest in colloids, and the implications for molecular glasses.
