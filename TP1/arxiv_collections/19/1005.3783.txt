We explore geometric aspects of bubble convergence for harmonic maps. More
precisely, we show that the formation of bubbles is characterised by the local
excess of curvature on the target manifold. We give a universal estimate for
curvature concentration masses at each bubble point and show that there is no
curvature loss in the necks. Our principal hypothesis is that the target
manifold is Kaehler.
