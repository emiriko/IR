Long-range forces up to next-to-leading order are computed in the framework
of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton system by means of a semiclassical approach to
gravity. As has been recently shown, this approach is effective if one of the
masses under consideration is significantly greater than all the energies
involved in the system. Further, we obtain the condition for the equilibrium of
charged masses in the system.
