By direct numerical simulation of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii
equation using the split-step Fourier spectral method we study the
double-humped localization of a cigar-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in
a one-dimensional bichromatic quasi-periodic optical-lattice potential, as used
in a recent experiment on the localization of a BEC [Roati et al., Nature 453,
895 (2008)]. Such states are spatially antisymmetric and are excited modes of
Anderson localization. Where possible, we have compared the numerical results
with a variational analysis. We also demonstrate the stability of the localized
double-humped BEC states under small perturbation.
