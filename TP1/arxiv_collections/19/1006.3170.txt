Hot subdwarfs are evolved low--mass stars that have survived core helium
ignition and are now in (or recently finished with) the core helium burning
stage. At the hot end of the Horizontal Branch (HB), many of these stars are
multiperiodic pulsators. These pulsations have revealed details of their global
and internal structure, and provide important constraints on the origin of hot
HB stars. While many features of their structure deduced from seismic fits have
confirmed what we expected from evolutionary considerations, there have been
some surprises as well.
