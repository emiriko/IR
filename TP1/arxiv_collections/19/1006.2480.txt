The following properties are in the present literature associated with the
behavior of super-cooled glass-forming liquids: faster than exponential growth
of the relaxation time, dynamical heterogeneities, growing point-to-set
correlation length, crossover from mean field behavior to activated dynamics.
In this paper we argue that these properties are also present in a much simpler
situation, namely the melting of the bulk of an ordered phase beyond a first
order phase transition point. This is a promising path towards a better
theoretical, numerical and experimental understanding of the above phenomena
and of the physics of super-cooled liquids. We discuss in detail the analogies
and the differences between the glass and the bulk melting transitions.
