A new metaheuristic optimisation algorithm, called Cuckoo Search (CS), was
developed recently by Yang and Deb (2009). This paper presents a more extensive
comparison study using some standard test functions and newly designed
stochastic test functions. We then apply the CS algorithm to solve engineering
design optimisation problems, including the design of springs and welded beam
structures. The optimal solutions obtained by CS are far better than the best
solutions obtained by an efficient particle swarm optimiser. We will discuss
the unique search features used in CS and the implications for further
research.
