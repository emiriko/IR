Gluon radiation is an important mechanism for parton energy loss as the
parton traverses the quark gluon plasma (QGP) medium. We studied the gluon
emission in QGP using AMY formalism. In the present work, we obtained gluon
emission amplitude {\bf F}({\bf h},p,k) function, which is a solution of the
integral equations describing gluon radiation including
Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effects, using iterations method. We define a
new dynamical scale for gluon emission denoted by $x$. The gluon emission rate
is obtained by integrating these amplitude function over {\bf h}. We show that
these obey a simple scaling in terms of this dynamical variable $x$. We define
the gluon emission function $g(x)$ for gluon radiation for the three processes
$g\rightarrow gg$, $q\rightarrow gq$ and $g\rightarrow q\bar{q}$. In terms of
this $g(x)$ function, the parton energy loss calculations, due to medium
induced gluon radiation, may become simplified.
