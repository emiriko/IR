We propose a simple method to detect the antiferromagnetic (AF) state of
fermionic atoms in an optical lattice by combining a time-of-flight (TOF)
imaging method and a Feshbach resonance. In this scheme, the nontrivial
dynamics of fermionic atoms during the imaging process works as a probe with
respect to the breaking of the translational symmetry in the AF state. Precise
numerical simulations demonstrate that the characteristic oscillatory dynamics
induced by the scattering process that transfers an AF ordering vector appears
in TOF images, which can be easily observed experimentally.
