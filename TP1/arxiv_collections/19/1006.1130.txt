The chemistry of astronomical hydrocarbons, responsible for the well-known
infrared emission features detected in a wide variety of targets, remains
enigmatic. Here we focus on the group of young intermediate-mass Herbig Ae
stars. We have analyzed the aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
emission features in the infrared spectra of a sample of 53 Herbig Ae stars,
obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. We
confirm that the PAH-to-stellar luminosity ratio is higher in targets with a
flared dust disk. However, a few sources with a flattened dust disk still show
relatively strong PAH emission. Since PAH molecules trace the gas disk, this
indicates that gas disks may still be flared, while the dust disk has settled
due to grain growth. There are indications that the strength of the 11.3 um
feature also depends on dust disk structure, with flattened disks being less
bright in this feature. We confirm that the CC bond features at 6.2 and 7.8 um
shift to redder wavelengths with decreasing stellar effective temperature.
Moreover, we show that this redshift is accompanied by a relative increase of
aliphatic CH emission and a decrease of the aromatic 8.6 um CH feature
strength. Cool stars in our sample are surrounded by hydrocarbons with a high
aliphatic/aromatic CH ratio and a low aromatic CH/CC ratio, and vice versa for
the hot stars. We conclude that, while the overall hydrocarbon emission
strength depends on the dust disk's geometry, the relative differences seen in
the IR emission features in disks around Herbig Ae stars are mainly due to
chemical differences of the hydrocarbon molecules induced by the stellar UV
field. Strong UV flux reduces the aliphatic component and emphasizes the
spectral signature of the aromatic molecules in the IR spectra.
