This work addresses linear transport in turbulent media, with emphasis on
neutral particle (atoms, molecules) transport in magnetized fusion plasmas. A
stochastic model for turbulent plasmas, based upon a multivariate Gamma
distribution, is presented. The geometry is a 2D slab and turbulence is assumed
to be statistically homogeneous. The average neutral density and ionization
source, which are the quantities relevant for integrated simulations and
diagnostic applications, are calculated analytically in the scattering free
case. The boundary conditions and the ratio of the turbulence correlation
length to the neutral mean free path are identified as the main control
parameters in the problem. The non trivial relationship between the average
neutral density and the ionization source is investigated. Monte Carlo
calculations including scattering are then presented, and the main trends
obtained in the scattering free case are shown to be conserved.
