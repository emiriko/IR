We discuss neutrino fluxes and energy dependent flavor ratios of cosmic
accelerators as a function of the size of the acceleration region and the
magnetic field, which are the parameters of the Hillas plot. We assume that
photohadronic interactions between Fermi accelerated protons and synchrotron
photons from co-accelerated electrons (or positrons) lead to charged pion
production. We include synchrotron cooling of the charged pions and
successively produced muons, which then further decay into neutrinos, as well
as the helicity dependence of the muon decays. Our photohadronic interaction
model includes direct production, higher resonances, and high energy processes
in order to model the neutrino flavor and neutrino-antineutrino ratios with
sufficient accuracy. Since we assume that the sources are optically thin to
neutron interactions, we include the neutrino fluxes from neutron decays. We
classify the Hillas plot into regions with different characteristic flavor
ratios over 20x24 orders of magnitude in R and B. In some examples with sizable
magnetic fields, we recover neutron beam, pion beam, and muon damped beam as a
function of energy. However, we also find anomalous or new sources, such as
muon beam sources with a flavor ratio nu_e:nu_mu:nu_tau of 1:1:0 in energy
regions where the synchrotron-damped muons pile up. We also discuss the use of
the Glashow resonance to identify pgamma optically thin sources with a strong
imbalance between pi^+ and pi^- production. We find that these can, in
principle, be identified in most cases in spite of the pi^- contamination from
high energy photohadronic processes and the mixing parameter uncertainties.
