In a recent paper \cite{1}, we have studied the vacuum solutions of Bianchi
types I and V spacetimes in the framework of metric f(R) gravity. Here we
extend this work to perfect fluid solutions. For this purpose, we take stiff
matter to find energy density and pressure of the universe. In particular, we
find two exact solutions in each case which correspond to two models of the
universe. The first solution gives a singular model while the second solution
provides a non-singular model. The physical behavior of these models has been
discussed using some physical quantities. Also, the function of the Ricci
scalar is evaluated.
