Massive evolved stars can produce large amounts of dust, and far-infrared
(IR) data are essential for determining the contribution of cold dust to the
total dust mass. Using Herschel, we search for cold dust in three very dusty
massive evolved stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud: R71 is a Luminous Blue
Variable, HD36402 is a Wolf-Rayet triple system, and IRAS05280-6910 is a red
supergiant. We model the spectral energy distributions using radiative transfer
codes and find that these three stars have mass-loss rates up to 10^-3 solar
masses/year, suggesting that high-mass stars are important contributors to the
life-cycle of dust. We found far-IR excesses in two objects, but these excesses
appear to be associated with ISM and star-forming regions. Cold dust (T < 100
K) may thus not be an important contributor to the dust masses of evolved
stars.
