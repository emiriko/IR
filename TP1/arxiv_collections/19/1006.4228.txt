With the rapid proliferation of broadband wireless services, it is of
paramount importance to understand how fast data can be sent through a wireless
local area network (WLAN). Thanks to a large body of research following the
seminal work of Bianchi, WLAN throughput under saturated traffic condition has
been well understood. By contrast, prior investigations on throughput
performance under unsaturated traffic condition was largely based on
phenomenological observations, which lead to a common misconception that WLAN
can support a traffic load as high as saturation throughput, if not higher,
under non-saturation condition. In this paper, we show through rigorous
analysis that this misconception may result in unacceptable quality of service:
mean packet delay and delay jitter may approach infinity even when the traffic
load is far below the saturation throughput. Hence, saturation throughput is
not a sound measure of WLAN capacity under non-saturation condition. To bridge
the gap, we define safe-bounded-mean-delay (SBMD) throughput and
safe-bounded-delay-jitter (SBDJ) throughput that reflect the actual network
capacity users can enjoy when they require finite mean delay and delay jitter,
respectively.
  Our earlier work proved that in a WLAN with multi-packet reception (MPR)
capability, saturation throughput scales super-linearly with the MPR capability
of the network. This paper extends the investigation to the non-saturation case
and shows that super-linear scaling also holds for SBMD and SBDJ throughputs.
Our results here complete the demonstration of MPR as a powerful
capacity-enhancement technique for WLAN under both saturation and
non-saturation conditions.
