The hidden conformal symmetry of extreme and non-extreme
Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) black holes is addressed in this paper.
For the non-extreme one, employing the wave equation of massless scalars, the
conformal symmetry with left temperature $T_{L}=\frac{M}{2\pi a}$ and right
temperature $T_{R}=\frac{\sqrt{M^{2}-a^{2}}}{2\pi a}$ in the near region is
found. The conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the periodicity of
the azimuthal angle. The microscopic entropy is derived by the Cardy formula
and is fully in consistence with the Bekenstein-Hawking area-entropy law. The
absorption cross section in the near region is calculated and exactly equals
that in a 2D CFT. For the extreme case, by redefining the conformal
coordinates, the duality between the solution space and CFT is studied. The
microscopic entropy is found to exactly agree with the area-entropy law.
