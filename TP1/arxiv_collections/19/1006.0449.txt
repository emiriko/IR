We investigate low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the M31 globular cluster
(GC) system using data from the 2XMMi catalogue. These X-ray data are based on
all publicly available XMM-Newton observations of the galaxy. This new survey
provides the most complete and homogeneous X-ray survey of M31's GCs to date,
covering >80% of the confirmed old clusters in the galaxy. We associate 41
X-ray sources with confirmed old clusters in the M31 cluster catalogue of
Peacock et al. (2010). Comparing these data with previous surveys of M31, it is
found that three of these clusters are newly identified, including a bright
transient source in the cluster B128. Four additional clusters, that are not
detected in these 2XMMi data, have previously been associated with X-ray
sources from Chandra or ROSAT observations. Including these clusters, we
identify 45 clusters in M31 which are associated with X-ray emission. By
considering the latest optical GC catalogues, we identify that three of the
previously proposed X-ray clusters are likely to be background galaxies and two
have stellar profiles. We consider the properties of LMXB-hosting clusters and
confirm significant trends between the presence of an LMXB and the metallicity,
luminosity and stellar collision rate of a cluster. We consider the
relationship between the luminosity and stellar collision rate of a cluster and
note that LMXB hosting clusters have higher than average stellar collision
rates for their mass. Our findings strongly suggest that the stellar collision
rate is the dominant parameter related to the presence of LMXBs. This is
consistent with the formation of LMXBs in GCs through dynamical interactions.
