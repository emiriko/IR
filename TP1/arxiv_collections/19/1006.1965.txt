A new algorithm for reconstructing a two dimensional object from a set of one
dimensional projected views is presented that is both computationally exact and
experimentally practical. The algorithm has a computational complexity of O(n
log2 n) with n = N^2 for an NxN image, is robust in the presence of noise and
produces no artefacts in the reconstruction process, as is the case with
conventional tomographic methods. The reconstruction process is approximation
free because the object is assumed to be discrete and utilizes fully discrete
Radon transforms. Noise in the projection data can be suppressed further by
introducing redundancy in the reconstruction. The number of projections
required for exact reconstruction and the response to noise can be controlled
without comprising the digital nature of the algorithm. The digital projections
are those of the Mojette Transform, a form of discrete linogram. A simple
analytical mapping is developed that compacts these projections exactly into
symmetric periodic slices within the Discrete Fourier Transform. A new digital
angle set is constructed that allows the periodic slices to completely fill all
of the objects Discrete Fourier space. Techniques are proposed to acquire these
digital projections experimentally to enable fast and robust two dimensional
reconstructions.
