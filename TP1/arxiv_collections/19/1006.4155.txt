A method of proving local continuity of concave functions on convex set
possessing the $\mu$-compactness property is presented. This method is based on
a special approximation of these functions.
  The class of $\mu$-compact sets can be considered as a natural extension of
the class of compact metrizable subsets of locally convex spaces, to which
particular results well known for compact sets can be generalized.
  Applications of the obtained continuity conditions to analysis of different
entropic characteristics of quantum systems and channels are considered.
