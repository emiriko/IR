The local minima of a quadratic functional depending on binary variables are
discussed. An arbitrary connection matrix can be presented in the form of
quasi-Hebbian expansion where each pattern is supplied with its own individual
weight. For such matrices statistical physics methods allow one to derive an
equation describing local minima of the functional. A model where only one
weight differs from other ones is discussed in details. In this case the
above-mention equation can be solved analytically. Obtained results are
confirmed by computer simulations.
