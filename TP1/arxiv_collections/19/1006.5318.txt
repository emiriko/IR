We show that every tripartite quantum correlation generated with a Schmidt
state (in particular every correlation generated with the GHZ state) can be
simulated with the sending of two bits of classical communication from Alice to
Bob and Charlie plus the sending of two bits of classical communication from
Bob to Charlie. This extends recent results which showed that the maximal
violation of Bell inequalities attainable by these correlations is uniformly
bounded. For simplicity, we state and prove the result for three parties, but
the generalization to the case of $n$ parties follows easily.
  We also show that every $n$-partite probability distribution generated with
local resources plus $c$-bits of local communication can violate a Bell
inequality by at most a factor of $2^c$.
