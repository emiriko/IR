Proposals to determine biomolecular structures from diffraction experiments
using femtosecond X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) pulses involve a conflict
between the incident brightness required to achieve diffraction-limited atomic
resolution and the electronic and structural damage induced by the
illumination. Here we show that previous estimates of the conditions under
which biomolecular structures may be obtained in this manner are unduly
restrictive, because they are based on a coherent diffraction model that is not
appropriate to the proposed interaction conditions. A more detailed imaging
model derived from optical coherence theory and quantum electrodynamics is
shown to be far more tolerant of electronic damage. The nuclear density is
employed as the principal descriptor of molecular structure. The foundations of
the approach may also be used to characterize electrodynamical processes by
performing scattering experiments on complex molecules of known structure.
