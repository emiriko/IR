Solar supergranulation remains a mystery in spite of decades of intensive
studies. Most of the papers about supergranulation deal with its surface
properties. Local helioseismology provides an opportunity to look below the
surface and see the vertical structure of this convective structure. We present
a concept of a (3+1)-D segmentation algorithm capable of recognising individual
supergranules in a sequence of helioseismic 3-D flow maps. As an example, we
applied this method to the state-of-the-art data and derived descriptive
statistical properties of segmented supergranules -- typical size of 20--30 Mm,
characteristic lifetime of 18.7 hours, and estimated depth of 15--20 Mm. We
present preliminary results obtained on the topic of the three-dimensional
structure and evolution of supergranulation. The method has a great potential
in analysing the better data expected from the helioseismic inversions, which
are being developed.
