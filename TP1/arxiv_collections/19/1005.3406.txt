In high temperature copper oxides superconductors, a novel magnetic order
associated with the pseudogap phase has been identified in two different
cuprate families over a wide region of temperature and doping. We here report
the observation below 120 K of a similar magnetic ordering in the archetypal
cuprate ${\rm La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4}$ (LSCO) system for x=0.085. In contrast to the
previous reports, the magnetic ordering in LSCO is {\it\bf only} short range
with an in-plane correlation length of $\sim$ 10 \AA\ and is bidimensional
(2D). Such a less pronounced order suggests an interaction with other
electronic instabilities. In particular, LSCO also exhibits a strong tendency
towards stripes ordering at the expense of the superconducting state.
