We calculate the total electronic Raman scattering spectrum for a system with
a charge density wave on an infinite-dimensional hypercubic lattice. The
problem is solved exactly for the spinless Falicov-Kimball model with dynamical
mean-field theory. We include the nonresonant, mixed, and resonant
contributions in three common experimental polarizations, and analyze the
response functions for representative values of the energy of the incident
photons. The complicated scattering response can be understood from the
significant temperature dependence of the many-body density of states, and
includes a huge enhancement for photon frequencies near the charge-density-wave
gap energy.
