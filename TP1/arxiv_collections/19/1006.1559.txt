Quantum phase transitions in metals are often accompanied by violations of
Fermi liquid behavior in the quantum critical regime. Particularly fascinating
are transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson concept of a local order
parameter. The breakdown of the Kondo effect in heavy-fermion metals
constitutes a prime example of such a transition. Here, the strongly correlated
f electrons become localized and disappear from the Fermi surface, implying
that the transition is equivalent to an orbital-selective Mott transition, as
has been discussed for multi-band transition-metal oxides. In this article,
available theoretical descriptions for orbital-selective Mott transitions will
be reviewed, with an emphasis on conceptual aspects like the distinction
between different low-temperature phases and the structure of the global phase
diagram. Selected results for quantum critical properties will be listed as
well. Finally, a brief overview is given on experiments which have been
interpreted in terms of orbital-selective Mott physics.
