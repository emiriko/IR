We consider how does the introduction of a Polyakov loop affects the
spatially inhomogeneous quark condensate. The primary result of our work is
that the existence of the spatially non-uniform chiral phase is confirmed
within the Polyakov NJL model in a chiral limit. These findings are obtained
both in a 3d-cutoff and in a Schwinger (proper time) regularization schemes.
