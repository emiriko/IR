The existence of local thermal equilibrium (LTE) states for quantum field
theory in the sense of Buchholz, Ojima and Roos is discussed in a
model-independent setting. It is shown that for spaces of finitely many
independent thermal observables there always exist states which are in LTE in
any compact region of Minkowski spacetime. Furthermore, LTE states in curved
spacetime are discussed and it is observed that the original definition of LTE
on curved backgrounds given by Buchholz and Schlemmer needs to be modified.
Under an assumption related to certain unboundedness properties of the
pointlike thermal observables, existence of states which are in LTE at a given
point in curved spacetime is established. The assumption is discussed for the
sets of thermal observables for the free scalar field considered by Schlemmer
and Verch.
