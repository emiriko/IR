Cichorek et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 107002 (2005)] reported enhancements of
the lower critical field Hc1(T) and critical current in superconducting
PrOs4Sb12 below a transition temperature Tc3 ~ 0.6 K, and speculated that this
reflects a transition between superconducting phases. Features have been
observed near Tc3 in other properties, but not in the specific heat. We report
muon spin rotation measurements of the penetration depth in the vortex state of
PrOs4Sb12 near Hc1(T), that to high accuracy exhibit no anomaly Tc3 and
therefore cast doubt on the putative phase transition.
