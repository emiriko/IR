The indirect prediction of shrinkage induced solidification defects is
considered in this study. The previously suggested criterion function methods,
in particular the Pellini and Niyama criteria are analyzed in details, and
their shortcomings are shown as a result of our analysis (e.g. the
scale/shape-dependency of critical values and the inability to distinguish
between cold- and hot-spots). To moderate limitations related to criterion
function methods, a new method is introduced to predict the location of
centerline shrinkage in metal castings. Unlike the alternative methods which
are derived more empirically based on the result of experimental observations,
the suggested method in this study is derived theoretically based on a
heuristic two-scale, macro-meso-scale, approach. The application of the
suggested method is limited to low freezing range alloys. The feasibility of
the presented method is studied by comparing numerical results against the
available experimental data.
