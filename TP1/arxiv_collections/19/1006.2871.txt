In many engineering and scientific applications, prediction variables are
grouped, for example, in biological applications where assayed genes or
proteins can be grouped by biological roles or biological pathways. Common
statistical analysis methods such as ANOVA, factor analysis, and functional
modeling with basis sets also exhibit natural variable groupings. Existing
successful group variable selection methods such as Antoniadis and Fan (2001),
Yuan and Lin (2006) and Zhao, Rocha and Yu (2009) have the limitation of
selecting variables in an "all-in-all-out" fashion, i.e., when one variable in
a group is selected, all other variables in the same group are also selected.
In many real problems, however, we may want to keep the flexibility of
selecting variables within a group, such as in gene-set selection. In this
paper, we develop a new group variable selection method that not only removes
unimportant groups effectively, but also keeps the flexibility of selecting
variables within a group. We also show that the new method offers the potential
for achieving the theoretical "oracle" property as in Fan and Li (2001) and Fan
and Peng (2004).
