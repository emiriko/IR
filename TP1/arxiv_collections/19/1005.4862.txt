The magnetization dynamics in diluted magnetic semiconductor heterostructures
based on (Zn,Mn)Se and (Cd,Mn)Te has been studied experimentally by optical
methods and simulated numerically. In the samples with nonhomogeneous magnetic
ion distribution this dynamics is contributed by spin-lattice relaxation and
spin diffusion in the Mn spin system. The spin diffusion coefficient of
7x10^(-8) cm^2/s has been evaluated for Zn(0.99)Mn(0.01)Se from comparison of
experimental and numerical results. Calculations of the giant Zeeman splitting
of the exciton states and the magnetization dynamics in the ordered alloys and
parabolic quantum wells fabricated by the digital growth technique show perfect
agreement with the experimental data. In both structure types the spin
diffusion has an essential contribution to the magnetization dynamics.
