We examine the effect of decoherence and intermolecular interactions (chiral
discrimination energies) on the chiral stability and the distinguishability of
initially pure versus mixed states in an open chiral system. Under a two-level
approximation for a system, intermolecular interactions are introduced by a
mean-field theory, and interaction between a system and an environment is
modeled by a continuous measurement of a population difference between the two
chiral states. The resultant equations are explored for various parameters,
with emphasis on the combined effects of the initial condition of the system,
the chiral discrimination energy and the decoherence. We focus on factors
affecting the distinguishability as measured by population difference between
the initially pure and mixed states and on the chiral stability as measured by
the purity decay.
