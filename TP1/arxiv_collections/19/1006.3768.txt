We study the topology of cosmic large-scale structure through the genus
statistics, using galaxy catalogues generated from the Millennium Simulation
and observational data from the latest Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release
(SDSS DR7). We introduce a new method for constructing galaxy density fields
and for measuring the genus statistics of its isodensity surfaces. It is based
on a Delaunay tessellation field estimation (DTFE) technique that allows the
definition of a piece-wise continuous density field and the exact computation
of the topology of its polygonal isodensity contours, without introducing any
free numerical parameter. Besides this new approach, we also employ the
traditional approaches of smoothing the galaxy distribution with a Gaussian of
fixed width, or by adaptively smoothing with a kernel that encloses a constant
number of neighboring galaxies. Our results show that the Delaunay-based method
extracts the largest amount of topological information. Unlike the traditional
approach for genus statistics, it is able to discriminate between the different
theoretical galaxy catalogues analyzed here, both in real space and in redshift
space, even though they are based on the same underlying simulation model. In
particular, the DTFE approach detects with high confidence a discrepancy of one
of the semi-analytic models studied here compared with the SDSS data, while the
other models are found to be consistent.
