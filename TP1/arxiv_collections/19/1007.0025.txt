5D UED is not automatically minimally flavor violating. This is due to flavor
asymmetric counter-terms required on the branes. Additionally, there are likely
to be higher dimensional operators which directly contribute to flavor
observables. We document a mostly unsuccessful attempt at utilizing
localization in a flat extra dimension to resolve these flavor constraints
while maintaining KK-parity as a good quantum number. It is unsuccessful
insofar as we seem to be forced to add brane operators in such a way as to
precisely mimic the effects of a double throat warped extra dimension. In the
course of our efforts, we encounter and present solutions to a problem common
to many extra dimensional models in which fields are "doubly localized:"
ultra-light modes. Under scrutiny, this issue seems tied to an intrinsic
tension between maintaining Kaluza-Klein parity and resolving mass hierarchies
via localization.
