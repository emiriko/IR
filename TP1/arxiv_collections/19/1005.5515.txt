The optimization of the light scattered by photonic cluster made of small
particles is studied with the help of the local perturbation method and special
optimization algorithm. It was shown that photonic cluster can be optimized in
a such a way that its reflectivity will be increased or decreased by several
orders of magnitude for selected wavelength and direction.
