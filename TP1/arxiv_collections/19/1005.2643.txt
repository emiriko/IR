Scientists today collect, analyze, and generate TeraBytes and PetaBytes of
data. These data are often shared and further processed and analyzed among
collaborators. In order to facilitate sharing and data interpretations, data
need to carry with it metadata about how the data was collected or generated,
and provenance information about how the data was processed. This chapter
describes metadata and provenance in the context of the data lifecycle. It also
gives an overview of the approaches to metadata and provenance management,
followed by examples of how applications use metadata and provenance in their
scientific processes.
