In this article, we review the progress made on the statistical mechanics of
liquids and fluids embedded in curved space. Our main focus will be on
two-dimensional manifolds of constant nonzero curvature and on the influence of
the latter on the phase behavior, thermodynamics and structure of simple
liquids. Reference will also be made to existing work on three-dimensional
curved space and two-dimensional manifolds with varying curvature.
