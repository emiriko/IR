In this paper we indicate a general method to calculate the power law that
governs how electronic LDOS oscillations decay far away from a surface step
edge (or any local linear barrier), in the energy range when only 2D surface
states are relevant. We identify the critical aspects of the 2D surface state
band structure that contribute to these decaying oscillations and illustrate
our derived formula with actual examples.
