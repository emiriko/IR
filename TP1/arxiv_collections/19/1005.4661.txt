This article introduces yet another representation of rotations in 3-space.
The rotations form a 3-dimensional projective space, which fact has not been
exploited in Computer Science. We use the four affine patches of this
projective space to parametrize the rotations. This affine patch representation
is more compact than quaternions (which require 4 components for calculations),
encompasses the entire rotation group without singularities (unlike the Euler
angles and rotation vector approaches), and requires only ratios of linear or
quadratic polynomials for basic computations (unlike the Euler angles and
rotation vector approaches which require transcendental functions).
  As an example, we derive the differential equation for the integration of
angular velocity using this affine patch representation of rotations. We remark
that the complexity of this equation is the same as the corresponding
quaternion equation, but has advantages over the quaternion approach e.g.
renormalization to unit length is not required, and state space has no dead
directions.
