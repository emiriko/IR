In a recent paper, the authors introduced a lattice invariant called "Secrecy
Gain" which measures the confusion experienced by a passive eavesdropper on the
Gaussian Wiretap Channel. We study, here, the behavior of this invariant for
unimodular lattices by using tools from Modular Forms and show that, for some
families of unimodular lattices, indexed by the dimension, the secrecy gain
exponentially goes to infinity with the dimension.
