We report new O isotopic data on 41 presolar oxide grains, 38 MgAl2O4
(spinel) and 3 Al2O3 from the CM2 meteorite Murray, identified with a recently
developed automated measurement system for the NanoSIMS. We have also obtained
Mg-Al isotopic results on 29 of the same grains (26 spinel and 3 Al2O3). The
majority of the grains have O isotopic compositions typical of most presolar
oxides, fall well into the four previously defined groups, and are most likely
condensates from either red giant branch or asymptotic giant branch stars. We
have also discovered several grains with more unusual O and Mg compositions
suggesting formation in extreme astrophysical environments, such as novae and
supernovae. One of these grains has massive enrichments in 17O, 25Mg, and 26Mg,
which are isotopic signatures indicative of condensation from nova ejecta. Two
grains of supernova origin were also discovered: one has a large 18O/16O ratio
typical of Group 4 presolar oxides; another grain is substantially enriched in
16O, and also contains radiogenic 44Ca from the decay of 44Ti, a likely
condensate from material originating in the O-rich inner zones of a Type II
supernova. In addition, several Group 2 presolar spinel grains also have large
25Mg and 26Mg isotopic anomalies that are difficult to explain by standard
nucleosynthesis in low-mass stars. Auger elemental spectral analyses were
performed on the grains and qualitatively suggest that presolar spinel may not
have higher-than- stoichiometric Al/Mg ratios, in contrast to SIMS results
obtained here and reported previously.
