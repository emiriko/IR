The potential of the LHC for investigation of anomalous top quark
interactions with gluon ($tug,tcg$) through the production of $tW$-channel of
single top quark is studied. In the Standard Model, the single top quarks in
the $tW$-channel mode are charge symmetric meaning that $\sigma(pp\to t+W^{-})
= \sigma(pp\to \bar{t}+W^{+})$. However, the presence of anomalous FCNC
couplings leads to charge asymmetry. In this paper a method is proposed in
which this charge asymmetry may be used to constrain anomalous FCNC couplings.
The strength of resulting constraints is estimated for the LHC for the center
of mass energies of 7 and 14 TeV.
