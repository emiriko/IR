In the context of teleparallel equivalent to General Relativity, we study
energy and its relevant quantities for some well-known black hole solutions.
For this purpose, we use the Hamiltonian approach which gives reasonable and
interesting results. We find that our results of energy exactly coincide with
several prescriptions in General Relativity. This supports the claim that
different energy-momentum prescriptions can give identical results for a given
spacetime. We also evaluate energy-momentum flux of these solutions.
