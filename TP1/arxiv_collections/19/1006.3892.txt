Recently it was demonstrated that long-lived quantum coherence exists during
excitation energy transport in photosynthesis. It is a valid question up to
which length, time and mass scales quantum coherence may extend, how to one may
detect this coherence and what if any role it plays for the dynamics of the
system. Here we suggest that the selectivity filter of ion channels may exhibit
quantum coherence which might be relevant for the process of ion selectivity
and conduction. We show that quantum resonances could provide an alternative
approch to ultrafast 2D spectroscopy to probe these quantum coherences. We
demonstrate that the emergence of resonances in the conduction of ion channels
that are modulated periodicallly by time dependent external electric fields can
serve as signitures of quantum coherence in such a system. Assessments of
experimental feasibility and specific paths towards the experimental
realization of such experiments are presented. We show that this may be probed
by direct 2-D spectroscopy or through the emergence of resonances in the
conduction of ion channels that are modulated periodically by time dependent
external electric fields.
