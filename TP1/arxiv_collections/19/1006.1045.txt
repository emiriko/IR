The angular, spectral and temporal features of the highest energy protons and
accompanying them secondary neutrinos and synchrotron gamma-rays propagating
through the intergalactic magnetic and radiation fields are studied using the
analytical solutions of the Boltzmann transport equation obtained in the limit
of the small-angle and continuous-energy-loss approximation.
