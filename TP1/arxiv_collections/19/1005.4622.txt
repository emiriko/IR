We investigate the origins of the widely-observed "en passant" crack pattern
which forms through interactions between two approaching cracks. A rectangular
elastic plate is notched on each long side and then subjected to quasistatic
uniaxial strain from the short side. The two cracks propagate along
approximately straight paths until they pass each other, after which they curve
and release a lenticular fragment. We find that for materials with diverse
mechanical properties, the shape of this fragment has an aspect ratio of 2:1,
with the length scale set by the initial crack offset $s$ and the time scale
set by the ratio of $s$ to the pulling velocity. The cracks have a universal
square root shape which we understand using a simple geometric model of the
crack-crack interaction.
