An algorithm to compute the six distances between particles of a planar
Four-Body central configuration is presented according to the following schema.
An orthocentric tetrahedron is computed as a function of given masses. Each
mass is placed at the corresponding vertex of the tetrahedron. The center of
mass (and orthocenter) of the tetrahedron is at the origin of coordinates. The
tetrahedron is orientated in a particular position function of the masses: with
one of the particles placed on axis 3. The tetrahedron is rotated by two angles
(to be tuned variables) around the center of mass until a direction orthogonal
to the plane of configuration coincides with axis 3. The four coordinates of
the vertices of the tetrahedron along this direction are identified with the
weighted directed areas of the central configuration. The central configuration
corresponding to these weighted directed areas is computed giving rise to four
masses and corresponding distances. The given masses are compared with the
computed ones. The two angles of the rotation are tuned until the given masses
coincide with the computed. The corresponding distances of this last
computation determine the central configuration. The case with two equal masses
also is considered.
