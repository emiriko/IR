Hyperbolic Programming (HP) --minimizing a linear functional over an affine
subspace of a finite-dimensional real vector space intersected with the
so-called hyperbolicity cone-- is a class of convex optimization problems that
contains well-known Linear Programming (LP). In particular, for any LP one can
readily provide a sequence of HP relaxations. Based on these hyperbolic
relaxations, a new Shrink-Wrapping approach to solve LP has been proposed by
Renegar. The resulting Shrink-Wrapping trajectories, in a sense, generalize the
notion of central path in interior-point methods.
  We study the geometry of Shrink-Wrapping trajectories for Linear Programming.
In particular, we analyze the geometry of these trajectories in the proximity
of the so-called central line, and contrast the behavior of these trajectories
with that of the central path for some pathological LP instances.
  In addition, we provide an elementary proof of convexity of hyperbolicity
cones over reals.
