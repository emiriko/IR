Double-exchange mechanisms in RE$_{1-x}$AE$_{x}$MnO$_{3}$ manganites (where
RE is a trivalent rare-earth ion and AE is a divalent alkali-earth ion) relies
on the strong exchange interaction between two Mn$^{3+}$ and Mn$^{4+}$ ions
through interfiling oxygen 2p states. Nevertheless, the role of RE and AE ions
has ever been considered "silent" with respect to the DE conducting mechanisms.
Here we show that a new path for DE-mechanism is indeed possible by partially
replacing the RE-AE elements by Mn$^{2+}$-ions, in La-deficient
La$_{x}$MnO$_{3-\delta}$ thin films. X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated
the relevant presence of Mn$^{2+}$ ions, which is unambiguously proved to be
substituted at La-site by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering. Mn$^{2+}$ is
proved to be directly correlated to the enhanced magneto-transport properties
because of an additional hopping mechanism trough interfiling Mn$^{2+}$-ions,
theoretically confirmed by calculations within the effective single band model.
The very idea to use Mn$^{2+}$ both as a doping element and an ions
electronically involved in the conduction mechanism, has never been foreseen,
revealing a new phenomena in transport properties of manganites. More
important, such a strategy might be also pursed in other strongly correlated
materials.
