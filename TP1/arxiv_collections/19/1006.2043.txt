Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have Fe II emission from the broad line region
(BLR) that differs greatly in strength from object to object. We examine the
role of the total and gas-phase iron abundance in determining Fe II strength.
Using AGN spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in the redshift
range of 0.2 < z < 0.35, we measure the Fe/Ne abundance of the narrow line
region (NLR) using the [Fe VII]/[Ne V] line intensity ratio. We find no
significant difference in the abundance of Fe relative to Ne in the NLR as a
function of Fe II/Hbeta. However, the N II/S II ratio increases a by a factor
of 2 with increasing Fe II strength. This indicates a trend in N/S abundance
ratio, and by implication in the overall metallicity of the NLR gas, with
increasing Fe II strength. We propose that the wide range of Fe II strength in
AGN largely results from the selective depletion of Fe into grains in the low
ionization portion of the BLR. Photoionization models show that the strength of
the optical Fe II lines varies almost linearly with gas-phase Fe abundance,
while the ultraviolet Fe II strength varies more weakly. Interstellar depletion
of Fe can be as large as two orders of magnitude, sufficient to explain the
wide range of optical Fe II strength in AGN. This picture is consistent with
the similarity of the BLR radius to the dust sublimation radius and with
indications of Fe II emitting gas flowing inwards from the dusty torus.
