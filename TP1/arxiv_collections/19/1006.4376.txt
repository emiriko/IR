Temperature dependent magneto-transport measurements in magnetic fields of up
to 12 Tesla were performed on thin film vanadium dioxide (VO2) across the
metal-insulator transition (MIT). The Hall carrier density increases by 4
orders of magnitude at the MIT and accounts almost entirely for the resistance
change. The Hall mobility varies little across the MIT and remains low,
~0.1cm2/V sec. Electrons are found to be the major carriers on both sides of
the MIT. Small positive magnetoresistance in the semiconducting phase is
measured.
