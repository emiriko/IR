We present new measurements of the coherent motion of galaxies based on
observations of the large-scale redshift-space distortions seen in the
two-dimensional two-point correlation function of Luminous Red Galaxies in Data
Release Seven of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We have developed a new
methodology for estimating these coherent motions, which is less dependent on
the details of galaxy bias and of the cosmological model to explain the
late-time acceleration of the expansion of the Universe. We measure a
one-dimensional velocity dispersion of galaxies on large-scales of
\sigma_v=3.01^{+0.45}_{-0.46} Mpc/h and \sigma_v=3.69^{+0.47}_{-0.47} \mpcoh$
at a mean redshift of z=0.25 and 0.38 respectively. These values are fully
consistent with predictions for a WMAP7-normalised LCDM Universe and
inconsistent at confidence of 3.8\sigma with a Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP)
model for the Universe. We can convert the units of these $\sigma_v$
measurements to 270^{+40}_{-41} km/s and 320^{+41}_{-41} km/s respectively
(assuming a $\Lambda$CDM universe), which are lower that expected based on
recent low redshift (z<0.2) measurements of the peculiar velocity field (or
"bulk flows"). It is difficult to directly compare these measurements as they
cover different redshift ranges and different areas of the sky. However, one
possible cosmological explanation for this discrepancy is that our Galaxy is
located in unusually over, or under, dense region of the Universe.
