According to Wen's theory, a universal behavior of the fractional quantum
Hall edge is expected at sufficiently low energies, where the dispersion of the
elementary edge excitation is linear. A microscopic calculation shows that the
actual dispersion is indeed linear at low energies, but deviates from linearity
beyond certain energy, and also exhibits an "edge roton minimum." We determine
the edge exponent from a microscopic approach, and find that the nonlinearity
of the dispersion makes a surprisingly small correction to the edge exponent
even at energies higher than the roton energy. We explain this insensitivity as
arising from the fact that the energy at maximum spectral weight continues to
show an almost linear behavior up to fairly high energies. We also formulate an
effective field theory to describe the behavior of a reconstructed edge, taking
into account multiple edge modes. Experimental consequences are discussed.
