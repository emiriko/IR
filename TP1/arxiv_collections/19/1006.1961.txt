We report on K*0 production at mid-rapidity in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at
\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 62.4 and 200 GeV collected by the Solenoid Tracker at RHIC
(STAR) detector. The K*0 is reconstructed via the hadronic decays K*0 \to K+
pi- and \bar{K*0} \to K-pi+. Transverse momentum, pT, spectra are measured over
a range of pT extending from 0.2 GeV/c to 5 GeV/c. The center of mass energy
and system size dependence of the rapidity density, dN/dy, and the average
transverse momentum, <pT>, are presented. The measured N(K*0)/N(K) and
N(\phi)/N(K*0) ratios favor the dominance of re-scattering of decay daughters
of K*0 over the hadronic regeneration for the K*0 production. In the
intermediate pT region (2.0 < pT < 4.0 GeV/c), the elliptic flow parameter, v2,
and the nuclear modification factor, RCP, agree with the expectations from the
quark coalescence model of particle production.
