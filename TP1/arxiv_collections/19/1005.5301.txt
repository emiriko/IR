A high-order scheme for direct numerical simulations of turbulent combustion
is discussed. Its implementation in the massively parallel and publicly
available Pencil Code is validated with the focus on hydrogen combustion.
Ignition delay times (0D) and laminar flame velocities (1D) are calculated and
compared with results from the commercially available Chemkin code. The scheme
is verified to be fifth order in space. Upon doubling the resolution, a 32-fold
increase in the accuracy of the flame front is demonstrated. Finally, also
turbulent and spherical flame front velocities are calculated and the
implementation of the non-reflecting so-called Navier-Stokes Characteristic
Boundary Condition is validated in all three directions.
