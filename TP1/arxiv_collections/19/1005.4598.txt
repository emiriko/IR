We study the low-momentum behaviour of Yang-Mills propagators obtained from
Landau-gauge Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSE) in the PT-BFM scheme. We compare
the ghost propagator numerical results with the analytical ones obtained by
analyzing the low-momentum behaviour of the ghost propagator DSE in Landau
gauge, assuming for the truncation a constant ghost-gluon vertex and a simple
model for a massive gluon propagator. The asymptotic expression obtained for
the regular or decoupling ghost dressing function up to the order ${\cal
O}(q^2)$ is proven to fit pretty well the numerical PT-BFM results.
Furthermore, when the size of the coupling renormalized at some scale
approaches some critical value, the numerical PT-BFM propagators tend to behave
as the scaling ones. We also show that the scaling solution, implying a
diverging ghost dressing function, cannot be a DSE solution in the PT-BFM
scheme but an unattainable limiting case.
