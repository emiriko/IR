We discuss the conclusions that can be drawn on a recent experimental
micro-macro entanglement test [F. De Martini, F. Sciarrino, and C. Vitelli,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 253601 (2008). The system under investigation is
generated through optical parametric amplification of one photon belonging to
an entangled pair. The adopted entanglement criterion makes it possible to
infer the presence of entanglement before losses, that occur on the macrostate,
under a specific assumption. In particular, an a priori knowledge of the system
that generates the micro-macro pair is necessary to exclude a class of
separable states that can reproduce the obtained experimental results. Finally,
we discuss the feasibility of a micro-macro "genuine" entanglement test on the
analyzed system by considering different strategies, which show that in
principle a fraction epsilon, proportional to the number of photons that
survive the lossy process, of the original entanglement persists in any losses
regime.
