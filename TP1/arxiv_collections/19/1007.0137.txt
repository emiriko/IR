Charged particles $p_T$ spectra and elliptic flow in 0-60% Au+Au collisions
at RHIC are analyzed in a hydrodynamic model with hot, hadronic resonance gas
in the initial state. Physically conceivable hadronic resonance gas,
thermalized in the time scale $\tau_i$=1 fm, at a (central) temperature
$T_i$=220 MeV, with viscosity to entropy ratio $\eta/s$=0.24, reasonably well
explains $p_T$ spectra in all the collision centralities. Centrality dependence
of elliptic flow however demands continual increase of viscosity to entropy
ratio with centrality.
