Solid state ionic conductors are good candidates for the next generation of
nonvolatile computer memory elements. Such devices have to show reproducible
resistance switching at reasonable voltage and current values even if scaled
down to the nanometer sizes. Here we study the switching characteristics of
nanoscale junctions created between a tungsten tip and a silver film covered by
a thin ionic conductor layer. Atomic-sized junctions show spectacular current
induced switching characteristics, but both the magnitude of the switching
voltage and the direction of the switching vary randomly for different
junctions. In contrast, for somewhat larger junctions with diameters of a few
nanometers a well defined, reproducible switching behavior is observed which is
associated with the formation and destruction of nanoscale channels in the
ionic conductor surface layer. Our results define a low size limit of 3 nm for
reliable ionic nano-switches, which is well below the resolution of recent
lithographic techniques.
