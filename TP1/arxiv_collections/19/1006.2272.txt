First we consider a unidirectional flux \omega_bar of vehicles each of which
is characterized by its `natural' velocity v drawn from a distribution P(v).
The traffic flow is modeled as a collection of straight `world lines' in the
time-space plane, with overtaking events represented by a fixed queuing time
tau imposed on the overtaking vehicle. This geometrical model exhibits platoon
formation and allows, among many other things, for the calculation of the
effective average velocity w=\phi(v) of a vehicle of natural velocity v.
Secondly, we extend the model to two opposite lanes, A and B. We argue that the
queuing time \tau in one lane is determined by the traffic density in the
opposite lane. On the basis of reasonable additional assumptions we establish a
set of equations that couple the two lanes and can be solved numerically. It
appears that above a critical value \omega_bar_c of the control parameter
\omega_bar the symmetry between the lanes is spontaneously broken: there is a
slow lane where long platoons form behind the slowest vehicles, and a fast lane
where overtaking is easy due to the wide spacing between the platoons in the
opposite direction. A variant of the model is studied in which the spatial
vehicle density \rho_bar rather than the flux \omega_bar is the control
parameter. Unequal fluxes \omega_bar_A and \omega_bar_B in the two lanes are
also considered. The symmetry breaking phenomenon exhibited by this model, even
though no doubt hard to observe in pure form in real-life traffic, nevertheless
indicates a tendency of such traffic.
