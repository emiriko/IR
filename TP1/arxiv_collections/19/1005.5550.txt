Absolute cross sections for the $e-$N$_{2}$ and $p-$N$_{2}$ collisions for
the first negative B$^{2}\Sigma_{u}^{+}-$X$^{2}\Sigma_{g}^{+}$ and Meinel A%
$^{2}\Pi_{u}-$X$^{2}\Sigma_{g}^{+}$ bands have been measured in the energy
region of 400-1500 eV for electrons and 0.4-10 keV for protons, respectively.
Measurements are performed in the visible spectral region of 400-800 nm by an
optical spectroscopy method. The ratio of the cross sections of the Meinel band
system to the cross section of the first negative band system (0,0) does not
depend on the incident electron energy. The population of vibrational levels
corresponding to A$^{2}\Pi_{u}$ states are consistent with Franck-Condon
principle. The ratio of the cross sections of (4,1) to (3,0) bands, and (5,2)
to (3,0) bands exhibits slight dependence on the proton energy. The theoretical
estimation within the quasimolecular approximation provides a reasonable
description of the total cross section for the first negative band.
