We present high resolution images of the bipolar outflow from W51e2, which
are produced from the Submillimeter Array archival data observed for CO(3-2)
and HCN(4-3) lines with angular resolutions of 0.8" x 0.6" and 0.3" x 0.2",
respectively. The images show that the powerful outflow originates from the
protostellar core W51e2-E rather than from the ultracompact HII region W51e2-W.
The kinematic timescale of the outflow from W51e2-E is about 1000 yr, younger
than the age (~5000 yr) of the ultracompact HII region W51e2-W. A large mass
loss rate of ~1 x 10^{-3} M_sun yr^{-1} and a high mechanical power of 120
L_sun are inferred, suggesting that an O star or a cluster of B stars are
forming in W51e2-E. The observed outflow activity along with the inferred large
accretion rate indicates that at present W51e2-E is in a rapid phase of star
formation.
