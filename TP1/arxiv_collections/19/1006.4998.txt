We derive a kinematic variable that is sensitive to the mass of the Standard
Model Higgs boson (M_H) in the H->WW*->l l nu nu-bar channel using symbolic
regression method. Explicit mass reconstruction is not possible in this channel
due to the presence of two neutrinos which escape detection. Mass determination
problem is that of finding a mass-sensitive function that depends on the
measured observables. We use symbolic regression, which is an analytical
approach to the problem of non-linear regression, to derive an analytic formula
sensitive to M_H from the two lepton momenta and the missing transverse
momentum. Using the newly-derived mass-sensitive variable, we expect Higgs mass
resolutions between 1 to 4 GeV for M_H between 130 and 190 GeV at the LHC with
10 fb^-1 of data. This is the first time symbolic regression method has been
applied to a particle physics problem.
