We present a three-dimensional simulation of the corona of an FK Com-type
rapidly rotating G giant using a magnetohydrodynamic model that was originally
developed for the solar corona in order to capture the more realistic,
non-potential coronal structure. We drive the simulation with surface maps for
the radial magnetic field obtained from a stellar dynamo model of the FK Com
system. This enables us to obtain the coronal structure for different field
topologies representing different periods of time. We find that the corona of
such an FK Com-like star, including the large scale coronal loops, is dominated
by a strong toroidal component of the magnetic field. This is a result of part
of the field being dragged by the radial outflow, while the other part remains
attached to the rapidly rotating stellar surface. This tangling of the magnetic
field,in addition to a reduction in the radial flow component, leads to a
flattening of the gas density profile with distance in the inner part of the
corona. The three-dimensional simulation provides a global view of the coronal
structure. Some aspects of the results, such as the toroidal wrapping of the
magnetic field, should also be applicable to coronae on fast rotators in
general, which our study shows can be considerably different from the
well-studied and well-observed solar corona. Studying the global structure of
such coronae should also lead to a better understanding of their related
stellar processes, such as flares and coronal mass ejections, and in
particular, should lead to an improved understanding of mass and angular
momentum loss from such systems.
