A simple method for improving cache efficiency of serial and parallel
explicit finite procedure with application to casting solidification simulation
over three-dimensional complex geometries is presented. The method is based on
division of the global data to smaller blocks and treating each block
independently from others at each time step. A novel parallel finite element
algorithm for non-overlapped element-base decomposed domain is presented for
implementation of serial and parallel version of the presented method. Effect
of mesh reordering on the efficiency is also investigated. A simple algorithm
is presented for high quality decomposition of decoupled global mesh. Our
result shows 10-20 \% performance improvement by mesh reordering and 1.2-2.2
speedup with application of the presented cache efficient algorithm (for serial
and parallel versions). Also the presented parallel solver (without
cache-efficient feature) shows nearly linear speedup on the traditional
Ethernet networked Linux cluster.
