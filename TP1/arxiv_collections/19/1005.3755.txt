We analysed the XMM-Newton archival observations of 16 neutron star (NS)
low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) to study the Fe K emission in these objects.
The sample includes all the observations of NS LMXBs performed in EPIC pn
Timing mode with XMM-Newton publicly available until September 30, 2009. We
performed a detailed data analysis considering pile-up and background effects.
The properties of the iron lines differed from previous published analyses due
to either incorrect pile-up corrections or different continuum
parameterization. 80% of the observations for which a spectrum can be extracted
showed significant Fe line emission. We found an average line centroid of 6.67
$\pm$ 0.02 keV and a finite width, $\sigma$, of 0.33 $\pm$ 0.02 keV. The
equivalent width of the lines varied between 17 and 189 eV, with an average
weighted value of 42 $\pm$ eV. For sources where several observations were
available the Fe line parameters changed between observations whenever the
continuum changed significantly. The line parameters did not show any
correlation with luminosity. Most important, we could fit the Fe line with a
simple Gaussian component for all the sources. The lines did not show the
asymmetric profiles that were interpreted as an indication of relativistic
effects in previous analyses of these LMXBs.
