Motivated by MIMO broad-band fading channel model, in this section a
comparative study is presented regarding various uncoded adaptive and
non-adaptive MIMO detection algorithms with respect to BER/PER performance, and
hardware complexity. All the simulations are conducted within MIMO-OFDM
framework and with a packet structure similar to that of IEEE 802.11a/g
standard. As the comparison results show, the RLS algorithm appears to be an
affordable solution for wideband MIMO system targeting at Giga-bit wireless
transmission. So MIMO can overcome huge processing power required for MIMO
detection by using optimizing channel coding and MIMO detection.
