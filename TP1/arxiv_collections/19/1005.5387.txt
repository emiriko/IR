Many of the anomalous properties of water are amplified in the deeply
supercooled region. Here we present neutron scattering measurements of the
density of heavy water confined in a nanoporous silica matrix MCM-41-S
(\approx15 {\AA} pore diameter), namely, the equation of state {\rho}(T,P), in
a temperature-pressure range, from 300 K to 130 K and from 1 bar to 2900 bar,
where bulk water will crystalize. A sudden change of slope in the otherwise
continuous density profile (a "kink") is observed below a certain pressure Pc;
however, this feature is absent above Pc. Instead, a hysteresis phenomenon in
the density profiles between the warming and cooling scans becomes prominent
above Pc. Hence, the data can be interpreted as a line of apparent 2nd-order
phase transition at low pressures evolving into a line of 1st-order phase
transition at high pressures. If so, the existence of a "tricritical point" at
Pc \approx 1500 bar, Tc \approx 210 K becomes another possible scenario to
explain the exceptionally rich phase behavior of low-temperature confined
water.
