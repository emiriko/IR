We investigate class field towers of number fields obtained as fixed fields
of modular representations of the absolute Galois group of the rational
numbers. First, for each $k\in\{12,16,18,20,22,26\}$, we give explicit rational
primes $\l$ such that the fixed field of the mod-$\l$ representation attached
to the unique normalized cusp eigenforms of weight $k$ on $\Sl_2(\Z)$ has an
infinite class field tower. Under a conjecture of Hardy and Littlewood, we
further prove that there exist infinitely many such primes for each $k$ (in the
above list). Second, given a non-CM curve $E/\Q$, we show that there exists an
integer $M_E$ such that the fixed field of the representation attached to the
$n$-division points of $E$ has an infinite class field tower for a set of
integers $n$ of density one among integers coprime to $M_E$.
