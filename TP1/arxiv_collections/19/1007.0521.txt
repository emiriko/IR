We introduce a new Forward-Flux Sampling in Time (FFST) algorithm to
efficiently measure transition times in rare-event processes in non-equilibrium
systems, and apply it to study the first-order (discontinuous) kinetic
transition in the Ziff-Gulari-Barshad model of catalytic surface reaction. The
average time for the transition to take place, as well as both the spinodal and
transition points, are clearly found by this method.
