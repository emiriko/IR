We study the $\eta$NN coupling constant using the method of QCD sum rules
starting from the vacuum-to-eta correlation function of the interpolating
fields of two nucleons. The matrix element of this correlation has been taken
with respect to nucleon spinors to avoid unwanted pole contribution. The
SU(3)-flavor symmetry breaking effects have been accounted for via the
$\eta$-mass, s-quark mass and eta decay constant to leading order. Out of the
four sum rules obtained by taking the ratios of the two sum rules in
conjunction with the two sum rules in nucleon mass, three are found to give
mutually consistent results. We find the SU(3) breaking effects significant, as
large as 50% of the SU(3) symmetric part.
