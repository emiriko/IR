Consider the day when an invariant mass peak, roughly compatible with "the
Higgs", begins to emerge, say at the LHC, ... and may you see that day. There
will be a difference between discovery and scrutiny. The latter would involve
an effort to ascertain what it is, or is not, that has been found. It turns out
that the two concepts are linked: Scrutiny will naturally result in deeper
knowledge - is this what you were all looking for? - but may also speed up
discovery.
