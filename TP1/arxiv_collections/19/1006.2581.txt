We investigate the formation process of planetesimals from the dust layer by
the gravitational instability in the gas disk using local $N$-body simulations.
The gas is modeled as a background laminar flow. We study the formation process
of planetesimals and its dependence on the strength of the gas drag. Our
simulation results show that the formation process is divided into three stages
qualitatively: the formation of wake-like density structures, the creation of
planetesimal seeds, and their collisional growth. The linear analysis of the
dissipative gravitational instability shows that the dust layer is secularly
unstable although Toomre's $Q$ value is larger than unity. However, in the
initial stage, the growth time of the gravitational instability is longer than
that of the dust sedimentation and the decrease in the velocity dispersion.
Thus, the velocity dispersion decreases and the disk shrinks vertically. As the
velocity dispersion becomes sufficiently small, the gravitational instability
finally becomes dominant. Then wake-like density structures are formed by the
gravitational instability. These structures fragment into planetesimal seeds.
The seeds grow rapidly owing to mutual collisions.
