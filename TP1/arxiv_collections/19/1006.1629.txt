A recent measurement by the D0 collaboration finds a like-sign di-muon charge
asymmetry in the B system that is roughly 3 sigma larger than the value
predicated by the Standard Model. This suggests new physics contributing to
B-Bbar mixing. For the current central value of the CP asymmetry, the required
size of Gamma_{12}^s is larger than Standard Model estimates of this quantity.
In this paper, we will explore the constraints on new physics contributions to
Gamma_{12}^s. We show that there are two dimension six operators of Standard
Model fields in the electroweak Hamiltonian whose coefficients are not
constrained enough to rule out possible contributions from new physics. We
argue that a more precise measurement of tau(B_s)/tau(B_d), which is possible
with currently available data, could either support or strongly constrain the
existence of new physics in Gamma_{12}^s.
