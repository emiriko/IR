The necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence of arbitrary
n-qubit pure quantum states under Local Unitary (LU) operations derived in [B.
Kraus Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 020504 (2010)] are used to determine the different
LU-equivalence classes of up to five-qubit states. Due to this classification
new parameters characterizing multipartite entanglement are found and their
physical interpretation is given. Moreover, the method is used to derive
examples of two n-qubit states (with n>2 arbitrary) which have the properties
that all the entropies of any subsystem coincide, however, the states are
neither LU-equivalent nor can be mapped into each other by general local
operations and classical communication.
