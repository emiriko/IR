This paper explain the existence of a particular formal model (drew from
Theoretical Astrophysics) whose thermodynamical phenomenology shows a possible
second order phase transition (according to Landau's Thermodynamical Theory)
that seems does not verify the (Birman-Goldrich-Jaric) "chain subduction
criterion" and the (Ascher's) "maximality criterion" of Landau's
Phenomenological Theory. Therefore, it follows that Landau's Phenomenological
Theory is more restrictive than the Landau's Thermodynamical Theory.
