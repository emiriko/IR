A singularity is said to be weakly--exceptional if it has a unique purely log
terminal blow up. In dimension $2$, V. Shokurov proved that weakly--exceptional
quotient singularities are exactly those of types $D_{n}$, $E_{6}$, $E_{7}$,
$E_{8}$. This paper classifies the weakly--exceptional quotient singularities
in dimensions $3$ and $4$.
