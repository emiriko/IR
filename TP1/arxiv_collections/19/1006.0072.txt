The effect of Co on the structural, magnetic and magnetocaloric effect (MCE)
of Ni50-xCoxMn38Sb12 (x=0,2,3,4,5) Heusler alloys was studied. Using x-ray
diffraction, we show the evolution of the martensitic phase from the austenite
phase. The martensitic transition temperature is found to decrease
monotonically with Co concentration. Remarkable enhancement of MCE is observed
near room temperature upon Co substitution. The maximum magnetic entropy change
of 34 Jkg-1K-1 was achieved in x=5 at 262 K in a field of 50 kOe and a value of
29 Jkg-1K-1 found near room temperature. The significant increase in the
magnetization associated with the reverse martensitic transition is responsible
for the giant MCE in these compounds.
