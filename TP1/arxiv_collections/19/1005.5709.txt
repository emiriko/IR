The light CP even Higgs boson mass, Mh, is calculated to three-loop accuracy
within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The result is
expressed in terms of DRbar parameters and implemented in the computer program
H3m. The calculation is based on the proper approximations and their
combination in various regions of the parameter space. The three-loop effects
to Mh are typically of the order of a few hundred MeV and opposite in sign to
the two-loop corrections. The remaining theory uncertainty due to higher order
perturbative corrections is estimated to be less than 1 GeV.
