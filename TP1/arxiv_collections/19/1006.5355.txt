Realizing a gravitational wave (GW) astronomy in next years is a great
challenge for the scientific community. By giving a significant amount of new
information, GWs will be a cornerstone for a better understanding of
gravitational physics. In this paper we re-discuss that the GW astronomy will
permit to solve a captivating issue of gravitation. In fact, it will be the
definitive test for Einstein's general relativity (GR), or, alternatively, a
strong endorsement for extended theories of gravity (ETG).
