We report the systematic detection of magnetic fields in massive (M > 5
M$_\odot$) late-type supergiants, using spectropolarimetric observations
obtained with ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Our observations
reveal detectable Stokes V Zeeman signatures in Least-Squares Deconvolved mean
line profiles in one-third of the observed sample of more than 30 stars. The
signatures are sometimes complex, revealing multiple reversals across the line.
The corresponding longitudinal magnetic field is seldom detected, although our
longitudinal field error bars are typically 0.3 G ($1\sigma$). These
characteristics suggest topologically complex magnetic fields, presumably
generated by dynamo action. The Stokes V signatures of some targets show clear
time variability, indicating either rotational modulation or intrinsic
evolution of the magnetic field. We also observe a weak correlation between the
unsigned longitudinal magnetic field and the CaII K core emission equivalent
width of the active G2Iab supergiant $\beta$~Dra and the G8Ib supergiant
$\epsilon$~Gem.
