Centre of mass momentum for strings is an important ingredient in the
calculation of the spectrum of string theories. It is calculated by the
N\"other prescription for two types of conformally invariant effective string
theories of the Polchinski-Strominger type. One is the so called
Polyakov-Liouville theory \cite{liouville} and the other an extension of the
original Polchinski-Strominger action analysed upto order $R^{-3}$ where $2\pi
R$ is the length of the string. In the first case analysis is carried out to
order $R^{-2}$ and in the second case to order $R^{-3}$. In both cases the
correction to the free bosonic theory result is shown to be of the {\em
improvement} type so that the correction to the total string momentum, obtained
by integrating over the spatial coordinate of the string world sheet, vanishes.
