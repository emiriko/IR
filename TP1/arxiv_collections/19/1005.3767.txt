We elaborate on a new interpretation of quantum mechanics which we introduced
recently. The main hypothesis of this new interpretation is that quantum
particles are entities interacting with matter conceptually, which means that
pieces of matter function as interfaces for the conceptual content carried by
the quantum particles. We explain how our interpretation was inspired by our
earlier analysis of non-locality as non-spatiality and a specific
interpretation of quantum potentiality, which we illustrate by means of the
example of two interconnected vessels of water. We show by means of this
example that philosophical realism is not in contradiction with the recent
findings with respect to Leggett's inequalities and their violations. We
explain our recent work on using the quantum formalism to model human concepts
and their combinations and how this has given rise to the foundational ideas of
our new quantum interpretation. We analyze the equivalence of meaning in the
realm of human concepts and coherence in the realm of quantum particles, and
how the duality of abstract and concrete leads naturally to a Heisenberg
uncertainty relation. We illustrate the role played by interference and
entanglement and show how the new interpretation explains the problems related
to identity and individuality in quantum mechanics. We put forward a possible
scenario for the emergence of the reality of macroscopic objects.
