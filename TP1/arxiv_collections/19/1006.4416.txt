Using the Hyperz code and a template spectral library which consists of 4
observed galaxy spectra from Coleman, Wu & Weedman (CWW, 1980) and 8 spectral
families built with evolutionary population synthesis models, we present
photometric redshift estimates (photo-z) for a spectroscopic sample of 6,531
galaxies, and morphologies for a morphological sample of 1,502 bright galaxies.
All galaxies are matched with the SDSS DR7 and GALEX DR4.
  The inclusion of Fuv or Nuv or both photometry decreases the number of
catastrophic identifications (CIs, |z_phot -z_spec| > 1.0). If CIs are removed,
the inclusion of both Fuv and Nuv photometry mainly increases the number of
non-CIs in the low redshift, g-r < 0.8 and fainter r-magnitude regions. The
inclusion of binary interactions (BIs) mainly increases the number of non-CIs
and decreases the deviations in the 0.3 < g-r < 0.8 region in the case of only
using optical photometry.
  The inclusion of UV photometry would decrease and increase the probability
that early types are classified as Burst and E types, respectively, and
increase that late types are classified as CWW-Sbc and CWW-Scd types. If CIs
are excluded, the inclusion of UV data mainly raises the identifications of
late types in all redshift, bluer g-r and r > 14 regions. Moreover, BIs mainly
affect the determinations of E and S0 types.
  Nuv -u = 1.94 and 5.77-1.47(u-r) = Fuv discriminators can be used as
morphology selection indicators. These two criteria have comparable reliability
and completeness for selecting early- and late-type galaxies to C=2.6 criterion
and higher completeness for early-type selection than u-r=2.22 criterion.
