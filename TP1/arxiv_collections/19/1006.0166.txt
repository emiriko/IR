Let $Q$ be an acyclic quiver. We introduce the notion of generic variables
for the coefficient-free acyclic cluster algebra $\mathcal A(Q)$. We prove that
the set $\mathcal G(Q)$ of generic variables contains naturally the set
$\mathcal M(Q)$ of cluster monomials in $\mathcal A(Q)$ and that these two sets
coincide if and only if $Q$ is a Dynkin quiver. We establish multiplicative
properties of these generic variables analogous to multiplicative properties of
Lusztig's dual semicanonical basis. This allows to compute explicitly the
generic variables when $Q$ is a quiver of affine type. When $Q$ is the
Kronecker quiver, the set $\mathcal G(Q)$ is a $\mathbb Z$-basis of $\mathcal
A(Q)$ and this basis is compared to Sherman-Zelevinsky and Caldero-Zelevinsky
bases.
