This study investigates the effect of competition between individuals on
population dynamics when they compete for different resources during different
seasons or during different growth stages. Individuals are assumed to compete
for a single resource during each of these periods according to one of the
following competition types: scramble, contest, or an intermediate between the
two. The effect of two successive competition periods is determined to be
expressed by simple relations on products of two "transition matrices" for
various sets of competition types for the two periods. In particular, for the
scramble and contest competition combination, results vary widely depending on
the order of the two competition types. Furthermore, the stability properties
of derived population models as well as the effect of more than two successive
competition periods are discussed.
