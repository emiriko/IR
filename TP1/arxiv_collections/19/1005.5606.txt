Cloud Data Servers is the novel approach for providing secure service to
e-business .Millions of users are surfing the Cloud for various purposes,
therefore they need highly safe and persistent services. Usually hackers target
particular Operating Systems or a Particular Controller. Inspiteof several
ongoing researches Conventional Web Servers and its Intrusion Detection System
might not be able to detect such attacks. So we implement a Cloud Data Server
with Session Controller Architecture using Redundancy and Disconnected Data
Access Mechanism. In this paper, we generate the hash code using MD5 algorithm.
With the help of which we can circumvent even the attacks, which are undefined
by traditional Systems .we implement Cloud Data Sever using Java and Hash Code
backup Management using My SQL. Here we Implement AES Algorithm for providing
more Security for the hash Code. The CDS using the Virtual Controller controls
and monitors the Connections and modifications of the page so as to prevent
malicious users from hacking the website. In the proposed approach an activity
analyzer takes care of intimating the administrator about possible intrusions
and the counter measures required to tackle them. The efficiency ratio of our
approach is 98.21% compared with similar approaches.
