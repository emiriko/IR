Long needle-shaped single crystals of Zn1-xCoxO were grown at low
temperatures using a molten salt solvent technique, up to x=0.10. The
conduction process at low temperatures is determined to be by Mott variable
range hopping. Both pristine and cobalt doped crystals clearly exhibit a
crossover from negative to positive magnetoresistance as the temperature is
decreased. The positive magnetoresistance of the Zn1-xCoxO single crystals
increases with increased Co concentration and reaches up to 20% at low
temperatures (2.5 K) and high fields (>1 T). SQUID magnetometry confirms that
the Zn1-xCoxO crystals are predominantly paramagnetic in nature and the
magnetic response is independent of Co concentration. The results indicate that
cobalt doping of single crystalline ZnO introduces localized electronic states
and isolated Co2+ ions into the host matrix, but that the magnetotransport and
magnetic properties are decoupled.
