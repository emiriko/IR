We have shown theoretically that efficient multiple exciton generation (MEG)
by a single photon can be observed in small nanocrystals (NCs). Our quantum
simulations that include hundreds of thousands of exciton and multi-exciton
states demonstrate that the complex time-dependent dynamics of these states in
a closed electronic system yields a saturated MEG effect on a picosecond
timescale. Including phonon relaxation confirms that efficient MEG requires the
exciton--biexciton coupling time to be faster than exciton relaxation time.
