To a complex symplectic manifold X we associate a canonical quantization
algebroid. Our construction is similar to that of Polesello-Schapira's
deformation-quantization algebroid, but the deformation parameter is no longer
central. If X is compact, the triangulated category of regular holonomic
quantization modules is a linear complex Calabi-Yau category of dimension 1 +
dim X.
