A one dimensional XX spin chain of finite length coupled to reservoirs at
both ends is solved exactly in terms of a matrix product state ansatz. An
explicit representation of matrices of fixed dimension 4 independent of the
chain length is found. Expectations of all observables are evaluated, showing
that all connected correlations, apart from nearest neighbor z-z, are zero.
