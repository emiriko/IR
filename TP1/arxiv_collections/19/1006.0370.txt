Representations of quantum state vectors by complex phase space amplitudes,
complementing the description of the density operator by the Wigner function,
have been defined by applying the Weyl-Wigner transform to dyadic operators,
linear in the state vector and anti-linear in a fixed `window state vector'.
Here aspects of this construction are explored, with emphasis on the connection
with Gabor's `windowed Fourier transform'. The amplitudes that arise for simple
quantum states from various choices of window are presented as illustrations.
Generalized Bargmann representations of the state vector appear as special
cases, associated with Gaussian windows. For every choice of window, amplitudes
lie in a corresponding linear subspace of square-integrable functions on phase
space. A generalized Born interpretation of amplitudes is described, with both
the Wigner function and a generalized Husimi function appearing as quantities
linear in an amplitude and anti-linear in its complex conjugate.
Schr\"odinger's time-dependent and time-independent equations are represented
on phase space amplitudes, and their solutions described in simple cases.
