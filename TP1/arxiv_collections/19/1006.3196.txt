The linear response of non-equilibrium systems with Markovian dynamics
satisfies a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation derived from time
symmetry and antisymmetry properties of the fluctuations. The relation involves
the sum of two correlation functions of the observable of interest: one with
the entropy excess and the second with the excess of dynamical activity with
respect to the unperturbed process, without recourse to anything but the
dynamics of the system. We illustrate this approach in the experimental
determination of the linear response of the potential energy of a Brownian
particle in a toroidal optical trap. The overdamped particle motion is
effectively confined to a circle, undergoing a periodic potential and driven
out of equilibrium by a non-conservative force. Independent direct and indirect
measurements of the linear response around a non-equilibrium steady state are
performed in this simple experimental system. The same ideas are applicable to
the measurement of the response of more general non-equilibrium micron-sized
systems immersed in Newtonian fluids either in stationary or non-stationary
states and possibly including inertial degrees of freedom.
