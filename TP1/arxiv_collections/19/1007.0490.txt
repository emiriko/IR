We consider a class of minimal extensions of the Standard Model with an extra
massive neutral gauge boson Z'. They include both family-universal models,
where the extra U(1) is associated with (B-L), and non-universal models where
the Z' is coupled to a non-trivial linear combination of B and the lepton
flavours. After giving an estimate of the range of parameters compatible with a
Grand Unified Theory, we present the current experimental bounds, discussing
the interplay between electroweak precision tests and direct searches at the
Tevatron. Finally, we assess the discovery potential of the early LHC.
