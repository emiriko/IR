We study the case when the triple-Pomeron vertex is assumed to have a
vectorial form, that is, the amplitude of high-mass diffractive dissociation
vanishes as $V \propto \vec q_t \cdot \vec e$ as $q_t \to 0$. We find that the
available data in the triple-Reggeon region may be well described in such a
`weak' coupling scenario, providing that absorptive effects are taken into
account. We compare this weak (vector) coupling scenario with the strong and
weak (scalar) coupling scenarios. Corresponding predictions are presented for
an LHC energy of 14 TeV.
