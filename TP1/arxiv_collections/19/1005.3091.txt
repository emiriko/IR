In this paper, we have considered gravity in a 5-dimensional warped product
space-time with a time-dependent warp factor, time-dependent extra dimension
and a bulk cosmological constant. The braneworld is described by a spatially
flat FRW-type metric. The five-dimensional field equations have been
constructed and solved for various cases of the warp factor and the
extra-dimensional scale factor, starting from very general type of the metric
and then reducing down to specific cases. In the low energy regime, a
stabilized bulk with constant curvature has been considered, from which the
cosmological behavior of the corresponding observed universe has been
interpreted. In the high energy regime, the bulk is assumed to be sourced by an
ordinary massless scalar field and thereafter the type of the scalar field
source and the different scale factors have been investigated.
