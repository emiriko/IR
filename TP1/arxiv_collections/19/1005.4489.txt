By observing mergers of compact objects, future gravity wave experiments
would measure the luminosity distance to a large number of sources to a high
precision but not their redshifts. Given the directional sensitivity of an
experiment, a fraction of such sources (gold plated -- GP) can be identified
optically as single objects in the direction of the source. We show that if an
approximate distance-redshift relation is known then it is possible to
statistically resolve those sources that have multiple galaxies in the beam. We
study the feasibility of using gold plated sources to iteratively resolve the
unresolved sources, obtain the self-calibrated best possible distance-redshift
relation and provide an analytical expression for the accuracy achievable. We
derive lower limit on the total number of sources that is needed to achieve
this accuracy through self-calibration. We show that this limit depends
exponentially on the beam width and give estimates for various experimental
parameters representative of future gravitational wave experiments DECIGO and
BBO.
