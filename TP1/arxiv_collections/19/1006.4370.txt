We investigate triphoton signals of the Randall-Sundram model at the Large
Hadron Collider. Such a signal can be an important probe to the RS model as
these are relatively cleaner from the hadronic activity and bear significant
rate. The corresponding standard model background has also been studied in
detail. We also show that a clear graviton reconstruction is possible in such
signal.
