To improve on existing models of interaction with a proof assistant (PA), in
particular for storage and replay of proofs, we in- troduce three related
concepts, those of: a proof movie, consisting of frames which record both user
input and the corresponding PA response; a camera, which films a user's
interactive session with a PA as a movie; and a proviola, which replays a movie
frame-by-frame to a third party. In this paper we describe the movie data
structure and we discuss a proto- type implementation of the camera and
proviola based on the ProofWeb system. ProofWeb uncouples the interaction with
a PA via a web- interface (the client) from the actual PA that resides on the
server. Our camera films a movie by "listening" to the ProofWeb communication.
The first reason for developing movies is to uncouple the reviewing of a formal
proof from the PA used to develop it: the movie concept enables users to
discuss small code fragments without the need to install the PA or to load a
whole library into it. Other advantages include the possibility to develop a
separate com- mentary track to discuss or explain the PA interaction. We assert
that a combined camera+proviola provides a generic layer between a client
(user) and a server (PA). Finally we claim that movies are the right type of
data to be stored in an encyclopedia of formalized mathematics, based on our
experience in filming the Coq standard library.
