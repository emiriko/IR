Comparison results are obtained for the inclusion probabilities in some
unequal probability sampling plans without replacement. For either successive
sampling or H\'{a}jek's rejective sampling, the larger the sample size, the
more uniform the inclusion probabilities in the sense of majorization. In
particular, the inclusion probabilities are more uniform than the drawing
probabilities. For the same sample size, and given the same set of drawing
probabilities, the inclusion probabilities are more uniform for rejective
sampling than for successive sampling. This last result confirms a conjecture
of H\'{a}jek (Sampling from a Finite Population (1981) Dekker). Results are
also presented in terms of the Kullback--Leibler divergence, showing that the
inclusion probabilities for successive sampling are more proportional to the
drawing probabilities.
