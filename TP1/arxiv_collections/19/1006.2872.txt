Using the wave nature of the electrons, we demonstrate that a transverse spin
current can be generated simply by the diffraction through a single slit in the
spin-orbital coupling system of the two-dimensional electron gas. The
diffracted electron picks up the transverse momentum. The up spin electron goes
one way and the down spin electron goes the other, producing the coherent spin
current. In the system of spin-orbital coupling $\sim10^{-13}$ eV$\cdot$m, the
\emph{out-of-plane} component of the spin of the electron can be generated up
to 0.42 $\hbar$. Based on this effect, a novel device of grating to distill
spin is designed. Two first diffraction peaks of electron carry different
spins, duplicating the non-magnetic version of Stern-Gerlach experiment. The
direction of the spin current can be controlled by the gate voltage with low
energy cost.
