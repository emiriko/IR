We study the effect of interaction on the temperature change in the process
of adiabatic mixing two components of fermi gases by the real-space
Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) method. We find that in the process of adiabatic
mixing, the competition of the adiabatic expansion and the attractive
interaction make it possible to cool or heal the system depending on strength
of interactions and the initial temperature. The change of temperature in a
bulk system and a trapped system have been investigated respectively.
