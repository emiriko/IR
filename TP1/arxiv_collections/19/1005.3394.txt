We introduce a new string-inspired approach to the subject of grand
unification which allows the GUT scale to be small, \lesssim 200 TeV, so that
it is within the reach of {\em conceivable} laboratory accelerated colliding
beam devices. The key ingredient is a novel use of the heterotic string
symmetry group physics ideas to render baryon number violating effects small
enough to have escaped detection to date. This part of the approach involves
new unknown parameters to be tested experimentally. A possible hint at the
existence of these new parameters may already exist in the EW precision data
comparisons with the SM expectations.
