Context. Understood to be a microquasar in the Galactic center region, GRS
1758-258 has not yet been unambiguously identified to have an
optical/near-infrared counterpart, mainly because of the high absorption and
the historic lack of suitable astrometric stars, which led to the use of
secondary astrometric solutions. Although it is considered with 1E 1740.7-2942
as the prototypical microquasar in the Galactic center region, the Galactic
origin of both sources has not yet been confirmed. Aims. We attempt to improve
previous astrometry to identify a candidate counterpart to GRS 1758-258. We
present observations with the Gran Telescopio de Canarias (GTC), in which we
try to detect any powerful emission lines that would infer an extragalactic
origin of this source. Methods. We use modern star catalogues to reanalyze
archival images of the GRS 1758-258 field in the optical and near-infrared
wavelengths, and compute a new astrometric solution. We also reanalyzed
archival radio data of GRS 1758-258 to determine a new and more accurate radio
position. Results. Our improved astrometric solution for the GRS 1758-258 field
represents a significant advancement on previous works and allows us to
identify a single optical/near-infrared source, which we propose as the
counterpart of GRS 1758-258. The GTC spectrum of this source is however of low
signal-to-noise ratio and does not rule out a Galactic origin. Hence, new
spectral observations are required to confirm or discard a Galactic nature.
