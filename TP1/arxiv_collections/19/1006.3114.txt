The spin of a free electron is stable but its position is not. Recent quantum
information research by G. Svetlichny, J. Tolar, and G. Chadzitaskos have shown
that the Feynman \emph{position} path integral can be mathematically defined as
a product of incompatible states; that is, as a product of mutually unbiased
bases (MUBs). Since the more common use of MUBs is in finite dimensional
Hilbert spaces, this raises the question "what happens when \emph{spin} path
integrals are computed over products of MUBs?" Such an assumption makes spin no
longer stable. We show that the usual spin-1/2 is obtained in the long-time
limit in three orthogonal solutions that we associate with the three elementary
particle generations. We give applications to the masses of the elementary
leptons.
