This paper emphasizes a determinant aim of identifying different approaches,
as comparing to the education and democracy ways specific to e-government
system. Introducing the information technology should offer the possibility by
which reform processes of the government should become more efficient,
transparent and much more public for the citizens; in this way, their ability
of participating directly to government activities should prove the carrying
out of a democratic and free frame. One of the essential issues of such
phenomenon is that of proving that adopting the information and communication
technology programs to government process or electronic government depends upon
a series of external factors, such as the level of state's development, the
cultural level, the frame of developing the structures of central and local
public authority, criteria that differentiate the applicability of such system,
to various countries. This difference is especially seen as comparing to the
East states of European Union. Information systems can be applied in order to
allow the citizens to monitor and coordinate the providing of local services;
such exchanges have created trust and the feeling of influence, encouraging the
participation to political life. Carrying into effect the new informational
technologies, aiming to issuing, informing and to participation of citizens to
political life, will model the concept of democracy within a new frame.
