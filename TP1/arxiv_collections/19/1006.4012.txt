We propose a scheme for testing high-dimensional Bell inequalities in phase
space. High-dimensional Bell inequalities can be recast into the forms of a
phase-space version using quasiprobability functions with the complex-valued
order parameter. We investigate their violations for two-mode squeezed states
while increasing the dimension of measurement outcomes, and finally show the
robustness of high-dimensional tests to detection inefficiency.
