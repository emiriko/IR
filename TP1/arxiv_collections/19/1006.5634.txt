We show there is a non-null probability to produce neutrinos of the ``wrong''
type in general decays, within the SM augmented by the known three massive
neutrinos and nontrivial mixing. Such effect is equivalent to an intrinsic
flavor violation (lepton flavor violation) at creation without requiring
neutrino propagation. The exact amount of flavor violation depends on the
neutrino flavor state to be detected. For realistic conditions, the violation
is tiny but much larger than other indirect lepton flavor violation processes
not involving neutrinos as final states. For neutrinos produced in a continuous
spectrum, we show the effect is larger, in relative terms, for neutrinos
produced in the low-energy portion of the spectrum. For muon decay, if the
usual neutrino flavor state is assumed a flavor violation as large as 1\% is
possible in the channel $\mu^+\to\bnu_\tau e^+ \nu_e$. We also discuss the
relation between flavor violation and flavor indefiniteness for neutrino flavor
states.
