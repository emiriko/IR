This work deals with the simulation of Wishart processes and affine
diffusions on positive semidefinite matrices. To do so, we focus on the
splitting of the infinitesimal generator, in order to use composition
techniques as Ninomiya and Victoir or Alfonsi. Doing so, we have found a
remarkable splitting for Wishart processes that enables us to sample exactly
Wishart distributions, without any restriction on the parameters. It is related
but extends existing exact simulation methods based on Bartlett's
decomposition. Moreover, we can construct high-order discretization schemes for
Wishart processes and second-order schemes for general affine diffusions. These
schemes are in practice faster than the exact simulation to sample entire
paths. Numerical results on their convergence are given.
