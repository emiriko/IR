Using the results of the UK's research assessment exercise, we show that the
size or mass of research groups, rather than individual caliber or prestige of
the institution, is the dominant factor which drives the quality of research
teams. There are two critical masses in research: a lower one, below which
teams are vulnerable and an upper one, above which average dependency of
research quality on team size reduces. This leveling off refutes arguments
which advocate ever increasing concentration of research support into a few
large institutions. We also show that to increase research quality, policies
which nourish two-way communication links between researchers are paramount.
