We present a measurement of the electric charge of the top quark using
$\ppbar$ collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.7~fb$^{-1}$
at the CDF II detector. We reconstruct $\ttbar$ events in the lepton+jets final
state and use kinematic information to determine which $b$-jet is associated
with the leptonically- or hadronically-decaying $t$-quark. Soft lepton taggers
are used to determine the $b$-jet flavor. Along with the charge of the $W$
boson decay lepton, this information permits the reconstruction of the top
quark's electric charge. Out of 45 reconstructed events with $2.4\pm0.8$
expected background events, 29 are reconstructed as $\ttbar$ with the standard
model $+$2/3 charge, whereas 16 are reconstructed as $\ttbar$ with an exotic
$-4/3$ charge. This is consistent with the standard model and excludes the
exotic scenario at 95\% confidence level. This is the strongest exclusion of
the exotic charge scenario and the first to use soft leptons for this purpose.
