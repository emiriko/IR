We perform a quantum simulation of the Ising model with a transverse field
using a collection of three trapped atomic ion spins. By adiabatically
manipulating the Hamiltonian, we directly probe the ground state for a wide
range of fields and form of the Ising couplings, leading to a phase diagram of
magnetic order in this microscopic system. The technique is scalable to much
larger numbers of trapped ion spins, where phase transitions approaching the
thermodynamic limit can be studied in cases where theory becomes intractable.
