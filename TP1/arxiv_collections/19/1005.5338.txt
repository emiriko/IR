We discuss the phenomenology of doubly and singly charged Higgs bosons (of
SU(2)_L-triplet fields) in the simplest A_4-symmetric version of the Higgs
Triplet Model. Mass eigenstates of these Higgs bosons are obtained explicitly
from the Higgs potential. It is shown that their decays into a pair of leptons
have unique flavor structures which can be tested at the LHC if some of their
masses are below the TeV scale. Sizable decay rates for tau to bar(mu) e e and
tau to bar(e) mu mu can be obtained naturally while other tau to l l' l'', mu
to bar(e) e e, and l to l' gamma are almost forbidden in this model.
Contributions of these Higgs bosons to the non-standard interactions of
neutrinos are also considered.
