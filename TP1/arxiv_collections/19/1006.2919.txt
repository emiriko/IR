We show that the a_1-rho-pi Lagrangian is a decisive element for obtaining a
good phenomenological description of the three-pion decays of the tau lepton.
We choose it in a two-component form with a flexible mixing parameter
sin(theta). In addition to the dominant a_1-> pho pi intermediate states, the
a_1->pi sigma ones are included. When fitting the three-pion mass spectra,
three data sets are explored: (1) ALEPH 2005 pi-pi-pi+ data, (2) ALEPH 2005
pi-pi0pi0 data, and (3) previous two sets combined and supplemented with the
ARGUS 1993, OPAL 1997, and CLEO 2000 data. The corresponding confidence levels
are (1) 28.3%, (2) 100%, and (3) 7.7%. After the inclusion of the a_1(1640)
resonance, the agreement of the model with data greatly improves and the
confidence level reaches 100% for each of the three data sets. From the fit to
all five experiments [data set (3)] the following parameters of the a_1(1260)
are obtained m_{a_1}=(1233+/-18) MeV, Gamma_{a_1}=(431+/-20) MeV. The optimal
value of the Lagrangian mixing parameter sin(theta)= 0.459+/-0.004 agrees with
the value obtained recently from the e+e- annihilation into four pions.
