Given an order-$d$ tensor $\tensor A \in \R^{n \times n \times...\times n}$,
we present a simple, element-wise sparsification algorithm that zeroes out all
sufficiently small elements of $\tensor A$, keeps all sufficiently large
elements of $\tensor A$, and retains some of the remaining elements with
probabilities proportional to the square of their magnitudes. We analyze the
approximation accuracy of the proposed algorithm using a powerful inequality
that we derive. This inequality bounds the spectral norm of a random tensor and
is of independent interest. As a result, we obtain novel bounds for the tensor
sparsification problem.
