We report high resolution single crystal x-ray diffraction measurements of
the frustrated pyrochlore magnet Tb2Ti2O7, collected using a novel low
temperature pulsed magnet system. This instrument allows characterization of
structural degrees of freedom to temperatures as low as 4.4 K, and in applied
magnetic fields as large as 30 Tesla. We show that Tb2Ti2O7 manifests
intriguing structural effects under the application of magnetic fields,
including strongly anisotropic giant magnetostriction, a restoration of perfect
pyrochlore symmetry in low magnetic fields, and ultimately a structural phase
transition in high magnetic fields. It is suggested that the magnetoelastic
coupling thus revealed plays a significant role in the spin liquid physics of
Tb2Ti2O7 at low temperatures.
