We study recently introduced Desargues maps, which provide simple geometric
interpretation of the non-commutative Hirota--Miwa system. We characterize them
as maps of the A-type root lattice into a projective space such that images of
vertices of any basic regular N-simplex are collinear. Such a characterization
is manifestly invariant with respect to the corresponding affine Weyl group
action, which leads to related symmetries of the Hirota--Miwa system.
