We report on the observation of modulation instability induced by cross-phase
modulation in a dual-wavelength operation dispersion-managed soliton fiber ring
laser with net negative cavity dispersion. The passively mode-locked operation
is achieved by using nonlinear polarization rotation technique. A new type of
dual-wavelength operation, where one is femtosecond pulse and the other is
picosecond pulse operation, is obtained by properly rotating the polarization
controllers. When the dual-wavelength pulses are simultaneously circulating in
the laser ring cavity, a series of stable modulation sidebands appears in the
picosecond pulse spectrum at longer wavelength with lower peak power due to
modulation instability induced by cross-phase modulation between the two lasing
wavelengths. Moreover, the intensities and wavelength shifts of the modulation
sidebands can be tuned by varying the power of the femtosecond pulse or the
lasing central wavelengths of the dual-wavelength pulses. The theoretical
analysis of the modulation instability induced by cross-phase modulation in our
fiber laser is also presented.
