The prospects for making a direct measurement of the W production charge
asymmetry at the LHC are discussed. A modification to the method used at the
Tevatron is proposed for measurements at the LHC. The expected sensitivity for
such a measurement to parton distribution functions is compared to that for a
measurement of the lepton charge asymmetry. The direct measurement approach is
found to be less useful for placing constraints on parton distribution
functions at the LHC than a measurement of the lepton charge asymmetry.
