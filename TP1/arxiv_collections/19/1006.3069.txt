Binomial coefficients and central trinomial coefficients play important roles
in combinatorics. Let $p>3$ be a prime. We show that $$T_{p-1}\equiv\left(\frac
p3\right)3^{p-1}\ \pmod{p^2},$$ where the central trinomial coefficient $T_n$
is the constant term in the expansion of $(1+x+x^{-1})^n$. We also prove three
congruences modulo $p^3$ conjectured by Sun, one of which is
$$\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\binom{p-1}k\binom{2k}k((-1)^k-(-3)^{-k})\equiv \left(\frac
p3\right)(3^{p-1}-1)\ \pmod{p^3}.$$ In addition, we get some new combinatorial
identities.
