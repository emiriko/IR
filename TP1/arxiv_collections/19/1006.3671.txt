In this brief note is discussed application of continuous quantum history
("trash") variable for simplification of scheme of programmable quantum
processor. Similar scheme may be tested also in other models of the theory of
quantum algorithms and complexity, because provides modification of a standard
operation: quantum function evaluation.
