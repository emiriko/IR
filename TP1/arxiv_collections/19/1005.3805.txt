We prove a finite torsion-free associative conformal algebra to have a finite
faithful conformal representation. As a corollary, it is shown that one may
join a conformal unit to such an algebra. Some examples are stated to
demonstrate that a conformal unit can not be joined to any torsion-free
associative conformal algebra. In particular, there exist associative conformal
algebras of linear growth and even locally finite ones that have no finite
faithful representation. We also consider the problem of existence of a finite
faithful representation for a torsion-free finite Lie conformal algebra (the
analogue of Ado's Theorem). It turns out that the conformal analogue of the
Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem would imply the Ado Theorem for finite Lie
conformal algebras. We prove that every torsion-free finite solvable Lie
conformal algebra has a finite faithful representation.
