We present a quantitative confocal-microscopy study of the transient and
final microstructure of particle-stabilised emulsions formed via demixing in a
binary liquid. To this end, we have developed an image-analysis method that
relies on structure factors obtained from discrete Fourier transforms of
individual frames in confocal image sequences. Radially averaging the squared
modulus of these Fourier transforms before peak fitting allows extraction of
dominant length scales over the entire temperature range of the quench. Our
procedure even yields information just after droplet nucleation, when the
(fluorescence) contrast between the two separating phases is scarcely
discernable in the images. We find that our emulsions are stabilised on
experimental time scales by interfacial particles and that they are likely to
have bimodal droplet-size distributions. We attribute the latter to coalescence
together with creaming being the main coarsening mechanism during the late
stages of emulsification and we support this claim with (direct)
confocal-microscopy observations. In addition, our results imply that the
observed droplets emerge from particle-promoted nucleation, possibly followed
by a free-growth regime. Finally, we argue that creaming strongly affects
droplet growth during the early stages of emulsification. Future investigations
could clarify the link between quench conditions and resulting microstructure,
paving the way for tailor-made particle-stabilised emulsions from binary
liquids.
