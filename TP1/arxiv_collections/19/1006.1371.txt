Particle beams are important tools for probing atomic and molecular
interactions. Here we demonstrate that particle beams also offer a unique
opportunity to investigate interactions in macroscopic systems, such as
granular media. Motivated by recent experiments on streams of grains that
exhibit liquid-like breakup into droplets, we use molecular dynamics
simulations to investigate the evolution of a dense stream of macroscopic
spheres accelerating out of an opening at the bottom of a reservoir. We show
how nanoscale details associated with energy dissipation during collisions
modify the stream's macroscopic behavior. We find that inelastic collisions
collimate the stream, while the presence of short-range attractive interactions
drives structure formation. Parameterizing the collision dynamics by the
coefficient of restitution (i.e., the ratio of relative velocities before and
after impact) and the strength of the cohesive interaction, we map out a
spectrum of behaviors that ranges from gas-like jets in which all grains drift
apart to liquid-like streams that break into large droplets containing hundreds
of grains. We also find a new, intermediate regime in which small aggregates
form by capture from the gas phase, similar to what can be observed in
molecular beams. Our results show that nearly all aspects of stream behavior
are closely related to the velocity gradient associated with vertical free
fall. Led by this observation, we propose a simple energy balance model to
explain the droplet formation process. The qualitative as well as many
quantitative features of the simulations and the model compare well with
available experimental data and provide a first quantitative measure of the
role of attractions in freely cooling granular streams.
