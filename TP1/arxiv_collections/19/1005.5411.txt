By means of ab initio calculations and spin-polarized scanning tunneling
microscopy experiments we show how to manipulate the local spin-polarization of
a ferromagnetic surface by creating a complex energy dependent magnetic
structure. We demonstrate this novel effect by adsorbing organic molecules
containing pi(pz)-electrons onto a ferromagnetic surface, in which the
hybridization of the out-of-plane pz atomic type orbitals with the d-states of
the metal leads to the inversion of the spin-polarization at the organic site
due to a pz - d Zener exchange type mechanism. As a key result, we demonstrate
that it is possible to selectively inject spin-up and spin-down electrons from
the same ferromagnetic surface, an effect which can be exploited in future
spintronic devices.
