This paper presents a survey of human action recognition approaches based on
visual data recorded from a single video camera. We propose an organizing
framework which puts in evidence the evolution of the area, with techniques
moving from heavily constrained motion capture scenarios towards more
challenging, realistic, "in the wild" videos. The proposed organization is
based on the representation used as input for the recognition task, emphasizing
the hypothesis assumed and thus, the constraints imposed on the type of video
that each technique is able to address. Expliciting the hypothesis and
constraints makes the framework particularly useful to select a method, given
an application. Another advantage of the proposed organization is that it
allows categorizing newest approaches seamlessly with traditional ones, while
providing an insightful perspective of the evolution of the action recognition
task up to now. That perspective is the basis for the discussion in the end of
the paper, where we also present the main open issues in the area.
