The coalescent revolutionised theoretical population genetics, simplifying,
or making possible for the first time, many analyses, proofs, and derivations,
and offering crucial insights about the way in which the structure of data in
samples from populations depends on the demographic history of the population.
However statistical inference under the coalescent model is extremely
challenging, effectively because no explicit expressions are available for key
sampling probabilities. This led initially to approximation of these
probabilities by ingenious application of modern computationally-intensive
statistical methods. A key breakthrough occurred when Li and Stephens
introduced a different model, similar in spirit to the coalescent, for which
efficient calculations are feasible. In turn, the Li and Stephens model has
changed statistical inference for the wealth of data now available which
documents molecular genetic variation within populations. We briefly review the
coalescent and associated measure-valued diffusions, describe the Li and
Stephens model, and introduce and apply a generalisation of it for inference of
population structure in the presence of linkage disequilibrium.
