Naive dimensional analysis based on chiral effective theory, when adapted to
nuclear energy density functionals, prescribes natural units and a hierarchy of
contributions that could be used to constrain fits of generalized functionals.
By applying these units, a large sample of Skyrme parametrizations is examined
for naturalness, which is signaled by dimensionless coupling constants of order
one. The bulk of the parameters are found to be natural, with an underlying
scale consistent with other determinations. Significant deviations from unity
are associated with deficiencies in the corresponding terms of particular
functionals or with an incomplete optimization procedure.
