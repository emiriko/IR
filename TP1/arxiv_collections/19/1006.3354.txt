We find a surprising connection between asymptotically flat space-times and
non-relativistic conformal systems in one lower dimension. The BMS group is the
group of asymptotic isometries of flat Minkowski space at null infinity. This
is known to be infinite dimensional in three and four dimensions. We show that
the BMS algebra in 3 dimensions is the same as the 2D Galilean Conformal
Algebra which is of relevance to non-relativistic conformal symmetries. We
further justify our proposal by looking at a Penrose limit of a radially
infalling null ray inspired by non-relativistic scaling and obtain a flat
metric. The 4D BMS algebra is also discussed and found to be the same as
another class of GCA, called the semi-GCA, in three dimensions. We propose a
general BMS/GCA correspondence. Some consequences are discussed.
