Anisotropic Alfv\'{e}nic fluctuations with $k_{\parallel}/k_{\perp}\ll 1$
remain at frequencies much smaller than the ion cyclotron frequency in the
presence of a strong background magnetic field. Based on the simplest
truncation of the electromagnetic gyrofluid equations in a homogeneous plasma,
a model for the energy cascade produced by Alfv\'{e}nic turbulence is
constructed, which smoothly connect the large magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) scales
and the small "kinetic" scales. Scaling relations are obtained for the
electromagnetic fluctuations, as a function of $k_{\perp}$ and $k_{\parallel}$.
Moreover, a particular attention is paid to the spectral structure of the
parallel electric field which is produced by Alfv\'{e}nic turbulence. The
reason is the potential implication of this parallel electric field in
turbulent acceleration and transport of particles. For electromagnetic
turbulence, this issue was raised some time ago in [A. Hasegawa, K. Mima, J.
Geophys. Res. {\bf 83} 1117 (1978)].
