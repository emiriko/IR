The short-lived radioisotope $^{60}$Fe requires production in a core collapse
supernova or AGB star immediately before its incorporation into the earliest
solar system solids. Shock waves from a somewhat distant supernova, or a
relatively nearby AGB star, have the right speeds to simultaneously trigger the
collapse of a dense molecular cloud core and to inject shock wave material into
the resulting protostar. A new set of FLASH2.5 adaptive mesh refinement
hydrodynamical models shows that the injection efficiency depends sensitively
on the assumed shock thickness and density. Supernova shock waves appear to be
thin enough to inject the amount of shock wave material necessary to match the
short-lived radioisotope abundances measured for primitive meteorites.
Planetary nebula shock waves from AGB stars, however, appear to be too thick to
achieve the required injection efficiencies. These models imply that a
supernova pulled the trigger that led to the formation of our solar system.
