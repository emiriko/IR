Research shows, that the major issue in development of quality software is
precise estimation. Further this estimation depends upon the degree of
intricacy inherent in the software i.e. complexity. This paper attempts to
empirically demonstrate the proposed complexity which is based on IEEE
Requirement Engineering document. It is said that a high quality SRS is pre
requisite for high quality software. Requirement Engineering document (SRS) is
a specification for a particular software product, program or set of program
that performs some certain functions for a specific environment. The various
complexity measure given so far are based on Code and Cognitive metrics value
of software, which are code based. So these metrics provide no leverage to the
developer of the code. Considering the shortcoming of code based approaches,
the proposed approach identifies complexity of software immediately after
freezing the requirement in SDLC process. The proposed complexity measure
compares well with established complexity measures. Finally the trend can be
validated with the result of proposed measure. Ultimately, Requirement based
complexity measure can be used to understand the complexity of proposed
software much before the actual implementation of design thus saving on cost
and manpower wastage.
