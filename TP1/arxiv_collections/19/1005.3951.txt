The emission of neutrinos within a wide energy range is predicted from
very-high-energy phenomena in the Universe. Even the current or next-generation
Cherenkov neutrino telescopes might be too small to detect the faint fluxes
expected for cosmic neutrinos with energies exceeding the EeV scale. The
acoustic detection method is a promising option to enlarge the discovery
potential in this highest-energy regime. In a possible future deep-sea
detector, the pressure waves produced in a neutrino interaction could be
detected by a 100 km\^3-sized array of acoustic sensors, even if it is sparsely
instrumented with about 100 sensors/km\^3. This article focuses on the AMADEUS
set-up of acoustic sensors, which is an integral part of the ANTARES detector.
The main aim of the project is a feasibility study towards a future acoustic
neutrino detector. However, the experience gained with the ANTARES-AMADEUS
hybrid opto-acoustic set-up can also be transferred to future very large volume
optical neutrino telescopes, especially for the position calibration of the
detector structures using acoustic sensors.
