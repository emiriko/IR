The Local Lemma is a fundamental tool of probabilistic combinatorics and
theoretical computer science, yet there are hardly any natural problems known
where it provides an asymptotically tight answer. The main theme of our paper
is to identify several of these problems, among them a couple of widely studied
extremal functions related to certain restricted versions of the k-SAT problem,
where the Local Lemma does give essentially optimal answers.
  As our main contribution, we construct unsatisfiable k-CNF formulas where
every clause has k distinct literals and every variable appears in at most (2/e
+ o(1))*2^k/k clauses. The Lopsided Local Lemma shows that this is
asymptotically best possible. The determination of this extremal function is
particularly important as it represents the value where the corresponding k-SAT
problem exhibits a complexity hardness jump: from having every instance being a
YES-instance it becomes NP-hard just by allowing each variable to occur in one
more clause.
  The construction of our unsatisfiable CNF-formulas is based on the binary
tree approach of [16] and thus the constructed formulas are in the class MU(1)
of minimal unsatisfiable formulas having one more clauses than variables. The
main novelty of our approach here comes in setting up an appropriate continuous
approximation of the problem. This leads us to a differential equation, the
solution of which we are able to estimate. The asymptotically optimal binary
trees are then obtained through a discretization of this solution.
  The importance of the binary trees constructed is also underlined by their
appearance in many other scenarios. In particular, they give asymptotically
precise answers for seemingly unrelated problems like the European Tenure Game
introduced by Doerr [9] and a search problem allowing a limited number of
consecutive lies.
