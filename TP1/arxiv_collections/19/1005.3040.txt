Using density functional theory in a time dependent approach we determine the
frequencies of the compressional modes of the normal phase of a Fermi gas at
unitarity as a function of its polarization. Our energy functional accounts for
the typical elastic deformations exhibited by Landau theory of Fermi liquids.
The comparison with the available experiments is biased by important
collisional effects affecting both the {\it in phase} and the {\it out of
phase} oscillations even at the lowest temperatures. New experiments in the
collisionless regime would provide a crucial test of the applicability of
Landau theory to the dynamics of these strongly interacting normal Fermi gases.
