We report CCD photometry of the cataclysmic variable V1113 Cygni. During two
campaigns, lasting from May to August 2003 and from March to June 2005, we
recorded two superoutburst. In the obtained light curves we detected clear
superhumps with a mean period 0.07891(3) days (113.63(4) min). That fact
confirms that the star is a member of SU UMa class of dwarf novae. During the
first observed superoutburst the superhump period was decreasing with an
enormous rate of $\dot P = -4.5(8)\times 10^{-4}$ which is one of the highest
values ever observed in SU UMa systems.
