We discuss universal properties of axisymmetric and stationary configurations
consisting of a central black hole and surrounding matter in Einstein-Maxwell
theory. In particular, we find that certain physical equations and inequalities
(involving angular momentum, electric charge and horizon area) are not
restricted to the Kerr-Newman solution but can be generalized to the situation
where the black hole is distorted by an arbitrary axisymmetric and stationary
surrounding matter distribution.
