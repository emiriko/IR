The dynamics of quasicrystals is more complicated than the dynamics of
periodic solids and difficult to study in experiments. Here, we investigate a
decagonal and a dodecagonal quasicrystal using molecular dynamics simulations
of the Lennard-Jones-Gauss interaction system. We observe that the short time
dynamics is dominated by stochastic particle motion, so-called phason flips,
which can be either single-particle jumps or correlated ring-like
multi-particle moves. Over long times, the flip mechanism is efficient in
reordering the quasicrystals and can generate diffusion. The temperature
dependence of diffusion is described by an Arrhenius law. We also study the
spatial distribution and correlation of mobile particles by analyzing the
dynamic propensity.
