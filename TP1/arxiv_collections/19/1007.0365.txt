Methods of analysis of nucleon-nucleus scattering data have progressed
markedly over the past 50 years, yet many analyses of scattering data still use
prescriptions specified at various stages of that progress. But the assumptions
made or inherent in those analyses are poorly justified and most are no longer
necessary to facilitate evaluations. We investigate some of those assumptions
and highlight deficiencies and the uncertainties they may make in data
analyses.
