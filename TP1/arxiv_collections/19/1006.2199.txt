A modest in-plane magnetic field \Bpar\ is sufficient to destroy the
fractional quantized Hall states at $\nu = 5/2$ and 7/2 and replace them with
anisotropic compressible phases. Remarkably, we find that at larger \Bpar\
these anisotropic phases can themselves be replaced by isotropic compressible
phases reminiscent of the composite fermion fluid at $\nu = 1/2$. We present
strong evidence that this transition is a consequence of the mixing of Landau
levels from different electric subbands. We also report surprising dependences
of the energy gaps at $\nu = 5/2$ and 7/3 on the width of the confinement
potential.
