The structure of Wigner-Seitz cells in the inner crust of neutron stars is
investigated using a microcospic Hartree-Fock-BCS approach with finite range
D1S and M3Y-P4 interactions. Large effects on the densities are found compared
to previous predictions using Skyrme interactions. Pairing effects are found to
be small, and they are attenuated by the use of finite range interactions in
the mean field.
