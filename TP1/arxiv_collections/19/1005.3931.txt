For the first time, we find that the dynamic antiferromagnetic phase present
in CeFe2 gets stabilized with Ga and Si substitutions. We find that phenomena
such as strain-induced first order jumps in the magnetization curves, asymmetry
between the M-H curves during the increasing and decreasing field cycles, the
envelope curve being inside the virgin curve, occur in these compounds.
Temperature and time dependences of magnetization show that the compounds
possess glassy behavior at low temperatures. Multi-step magnetization behavior,
unusual relaxation effect, thermal and magnetic history dependence, which are
signatures of the martensitic scenario due to the strong magneto-structural
coupling, are found to be present in this system. We also show that one can
induce the magnetization steps with the help of appropriate measurement
protocol. Detailed magnetization relaxation studies have been carried out to
understand the dynamics of magnetic phase transition.
