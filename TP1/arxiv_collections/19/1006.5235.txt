We study the use of sampling for efficiently mining the top-K frequent
itemsets of cardinality at most w. To this purpose, we define an approximation
to the top-K frequent itemsets to be a family of itemsets which includes
(resp., excludes) all very frequent (resp., very infrequent) itemsets, together
with an estimate of these itemsets' frequencies with a bounded error. Our first
result is an upper bound on the sample size which guarantees that the top-K
frequent itemsets mined from a random sample of that size approximate the
actual top-K frequent itemsets, with probability larger than a specified value.
We show that the upper bound is asymptotically tight when w is constant. Our
main algorithmic contribution is a progressive sampling approach, combined with
suitable stopping conditions, which on appropriate inputs is able to extract
approximate top-K frequent itemsets from samples whose sizes are smaller than
the general upper bound. In order to test the stopping conditions, this
approach maintains the frequency of all itemsets encountered, which is
practical only for small w. However, we show how this problem can be mitigated
by using a variation of Bloom filters. A number of experiments conducted on
both synthetic and real bench- mark datasets show that using samples
substantially smaller than the original dataset (i.e., of size defined by the
upper bound or reached through the progressive sampling approach) enable to
approximate the actual top-K frequent itemsets with accuracy much higher than
what analytically proved.
