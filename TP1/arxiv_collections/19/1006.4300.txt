In many frustrated Ising models, a single-spin flip dynamics is frozen out at
low temperatures compared to the dominant interaction energy scale because of
the discrete "multiple valley" structure of degenerate ground-state manifold.
This makes it difficult to study low-temperature physics of these frustrated
systems by using Monte Carlo simulation with the standard single-spin flip
algorithm. A typical example is the so-called spin ice model, frustrated
ferromagnets on the pyrochlore lattice. The difficulty can be avoided by a
global-flip algorithm, the loop algorithm, that enables to sample over the
entire discrete manifold and to investigate low-temperature properties. We
extend the loop algorithm to Heisenberg spin systems with strong easy-axis
anisotropy in which the ground-state manifold is continuous but still retains
the spin-ice type degeneracy. We examine different ways of loop flips and
compare their efficiency. The extended loop algorithm is applied to the
following two models, a Heisenberg antiferromagnet with easy-axis anisotropy
along the z axis, and a Heisenberg spin ice model with the local <111>
easy-axis anisotropy. For both models, we demonstrate high efficiency of our
loop algorithm by revealing the low-temperature properties which were hard to
access by the standard single-spin flip algorithm. For the former model, we
examine the possibility of order-from-disorder and critically check its
absence. For the latter model, we elucidate a gas-liquid-solid transition,
namely, crossover or phase transition among paramagnet, spin-ice liquid, and
ferromagnetically-ordered ice-rule state.
