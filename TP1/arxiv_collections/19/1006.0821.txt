Aims: We employ archival Spitzer slit-scan observations of the HH211 outflow
in order to investigate its warm gas content, assess the jet mass flux in the
form of H2 and probe for the existence of an embedded atomic jet. Methods:
Detected molecular and atomic lines are interpreted by means of emission line
diagnostics and an existing grid of molecular shock models. The physical
properties of the warm gas are compared against other molecular jet tracers and
to the results of a similar study towards the L1448-C outflow. Results: We have
detected and mapped the v=0-0 S(0) - S(7) H2 lines and fine-structure lines of
S, Fe+, and Si+. H2 is detected down to 5" from the source and is characterized
by a "cool" T~300K and a "warm" T~1000 K component, with an extinction Av ~ 8
mag. The amount of cool H2 towards the jet agrees with that estimated from CO
assuming fully molecular gas. The warm component is well fitted by C-type
shocks with a low beam filling factor ~ 0.01-0.04 and a mass-flux similar to
the cool H2. The fine-structure line emission arises from dense gas with
ionization fraction ~0.5 - 5 x 10e-3, suggestive of dissociative shocks. Line
ratios to sulfur indicate that iron and silicon are depleted compared to solar
abundances by a factor ~10-50. Conclusions: Spitzer spectral mapping
observations reveal for the first time a cool H$_2$ component towards the CO
jet of HH211 consistent with the CO material being fully molecular and warm at
~ 300 K. The maps also reveal for the first time the existence of an embedded
atomic jet in the HH211 outflow that can be traced down to the central source
position. Its significant iron and silicon depletion excludes an origin from
within the dust sublimation zone around the protostar. The momentum-flux seems
insufficient to entrain the CO jet, although current uncertainties on jet speed
and shock conditions are too large for a definite conclusion.
