In this paper we survey some recent advances in the analysis of marginally
outer trapped surfaces (MOTS). We begin with a systematic review of results by
Schoen and Yau on Jang's equation and its relationship with MOTS. We then
explain recent work on the existence, regularity, and properties of MOTS and
discuss the consequences for the trapped region. We include an outlook with
some directions for future research.
