An external magnetic field exerts a Lorentz force on drifting electric
charges inside a silicon strip sensor and thus shifts the cluster position of
the collected charge. The shift can be related to the Lorentz angle which is
typically a few degrees for holes and a few tens of degrees for electrons in a
4 T magnetic field. The Lorentz angle depends upon magnetic field, electric
field inside the sensor and temperature. In this study the sensitivity to
radiation for fluences up to 10^16 n/cm^2 has been studied. The Lorentz shift
has been measured by inducing ionization with 670 nm red or 1070 nm infrared
laser beams injected into the back side of the irradiated silicon sensor
operated in magnetic fields up to 8 T. For holes the shift as a function of
radiation is increasing, while for electrons it is decreasing and even changes
sign. The fact that for irradiated sensors the Lorentz shift for electrons is
smaller than for holes, in contrast to the observations in non-irradiated
sensors, can be qualitatively explained by the structure of the electric field
in irradiated sensors.
