Spectroscopy has shown the presence of the CN band dicothomy and the Na-O
anticorrelations for 50--70% of the investigated samples in the cluster 47 Tuc,
otherwise considered a "normal" prototype of high metallicity clusters from the
photometric analysis. Very recently, the re-analysis of a large number of
archival HST data of the cluster core has been able to put into evidence the
presence of structures in the Sub Giant Branch: it has a brighter component
with a spread in magnitude by $\sim$0.06 mag and a second one, made of about
10% of stars, a little fainter (by $\sim$0.05 mag). These data also show that
the Main Sequence of the cluster has an intrinsic spread in color which, if
interpreted as due to a small spread in helium abundance, suggests
$\Delta$Y$\sim$0.027. In this work we examine in detail whether the Horizontal
Branch morphology and the Sub Giant structure provide further independent
indications that a real --although very small-helium spread is present in the
cluster. We re--analyze the HST archival data for the Horizontal Branch of 47
Tuc, obtaining a sample of $\sim$500 stars with very small photometric errors,
and build population synthesis based on new models to show that its particular
morphology can be better explained by taking into account a spread in helium
abundance of 2% in mass. The same variation in helium is able to explain the
spread in luminosity of the Sub Giant Branch, while a small part of the second
generation is characterized by a small C+N+O increase and provides an
explanation for the fainter Sub Giant Branch. We conclude that three
photometric features concur to form the paradigm that a small but real helium
spread is present in a cluster that has no spectacular evidence for multiple
populations like those shown by other massive clusters.
