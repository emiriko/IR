A technique for on-line estimation of spot volatility for high-frequency data
is developed. The algorithm works directly on the transaction data and updates
the volatility estimate immediately after the occurrence of a new transaction.
Furthermore, a nonlinear market microstructure noise model is proposed that
reproduces several stylized facts of high-frequency data. A computationally
efficient particle filter is used that allows for the approximation of the
unknown efficient prices and, in combination with a recursive EM algorithm, for
the estimation of the volatility curve. We neither assume that the transaction
times are equidistant nor do we use interpolated prices. We also make a
distinction between volatility per time unit and volatility per transaction and
provide estimators for both. More precisely we use a model with random time
change where spot volatility is decomposed into spot volatility per transaction
times the trading intensity - thus highlighting the influence of trading
intensity on volatility.
