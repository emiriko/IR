A theoretical model of shape-anisometric particles embedded in a cubic
lattice is formulated for binary mixtures combining rod-like, plate-like and
spherical particles. The model aims at providing a tool for the prediction and
interpretation of complex phase behavior in a variety of liquid crystalline
colloids, biological and macromolecular systems. Introducing just repulsive
interactions among the particles, a rich variety of phase structures and
multiphasic equilibria is obtained, including isotropic, nematic, lamellar and
columnar phases, demixing into phases of the same or different symmetries and
structural microsegregation of the different species of the mixture within the
same phase.
