We study the environmental dependence of local luminous infrared galaxies
(LIRGs) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) found in the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) data. The LIRG and ULIRG samples are constructed by
cross-correlating spectroscopic catalogs of galaxies of the SDSS Data Release 7
and the Infrared Astronomical Satellite Faint Source Catalog. We examine the
effects of the large-scale background density (Sigma_5), galaxy clusters, and
the nearest neighbor galaxy on the properties of infrared galaxies (IRGs). We
find that the fraction of LIRGs plus ULIRGs among IRGs (f_(U)LIRGs) and the
infrared luminosity (L_IR) of IRGs strongly depend on the morphology of and the
distance to the nearest neighbor galaxy: the probability for an IRG to be a
(U)LIRG (f_(U)LIRGs) and its L_IR both increase as it approaches a late-type
galaxy, but decrease as it approaches an early-type galaxy (within half the
virial radius of its neighbor). We find no dependence of f_(U)LIRGs on the
background density (surface galaxy number density) at fixed stellar mass of
galaxies. The dependence of f_(U)LIRGs on the distance to galaxy clusters is
also found to be very weak, but in highest-density regions such as the center
of galaxy clusters, few (U)LIRGs are found. These environmental dependence of
LIRGs and ULIRGs and the evolution of star formation rate (SFR)-environment
relation from high redshifts to low redshifts seem to support the idea that
galaxy-galaxy interactions/merging play a critical role in triggering the star
formation activity of LIRGs and ULIRGs.
