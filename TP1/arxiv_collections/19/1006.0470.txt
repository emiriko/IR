The alignment in flavour space of the Yukawa matrices of a general
two-Higgs-doublet model results in the absence of tree-level flavour-changing
neutral currents. In addition to the usual fermion masses and mixings, the
aligned Yukawa structure only contains three complex parameters, which are
potential new sources of CP violation. For particular values of these three
parameters all known specific implementations of the model based on discrete
Z_2 symmetries are recovered. One of the most distinctive features of the
two-Higgs-doublet model is the presence of a charged scalar. In this work, we
discuss its main phenomenological consequences in flavour-changing processes at
low energies and derive the corresponding constraints on the parameters of the
aligned two-Higgs-doublet model.
