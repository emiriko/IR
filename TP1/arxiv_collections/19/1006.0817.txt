We apply a data assimilation techniques, inspired from meteorological
applications, to perform an optimal reconstruction of the neutronic activity
field in a nuclear core. Both measurements, and information coming from a
numerical model, are used. We first study the robustness of the method when the
amount of measured information decreases. We then study the influence of the
nature of the instruments and their spatial repartition on the efficiency of
the field reconstruction.
