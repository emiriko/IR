"The term 'Linked Data' refers to a set of best practices for publishing and
connecting structured data on the web". Linked Data make the Semantic Web work
practically, which means that information can be retrieved without complicated
lookup mechanisms, that a lightweight semantics enables scalable reasoning, and
that the decentral nature of the Web is respected. OpenMath Content
Dictionaries (CDs) have the same characteristics - in principle, but not yet in
practice. The Linking Open Data movement has made a considerable practical
impact: Governments, broadcasting stations, scientific publishers, and many
more actors are already contributing to the "Web of Data". Queries can be
answered in a distributed way, and services aggregating data from different
sources are replacing hard-coded mashups. However, these services are currently
entirely lacking mathematical functionality. I will discuss real-world
scenarios, where today's RDF-based Linked Data do not quite get their job done,
but where an integration of OpenMath would help - were it not for certain
conceptual and practical restrictions. I will point out conceptual shortcomings
in the OpenMath 2 specification and common bad practices in publishing CDs and
then propose concrete steps to overcome them and to contribute OpenMath CDs to
the Web of Data.
