In this paper, we investigate the validity of the generalized second law of
thermodynamics (GSLT) in the DGP brane world when universe is filled with
interacting two fluid system: one in the form of cold dark matter and other is
holographic dark energy. The boundary of the universe is assumed to be enclosed
by the dynamical apparent horizon or the event horizon. The universe is chosen
to be homogeneous and isotropic FRW model and the validity of the first law has
been assumed here.
