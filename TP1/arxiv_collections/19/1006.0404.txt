The exact computation of orbits of discrete dynamical systems on the interval
is considered. Therefore, a multiple-precision floating point approach based on
error analysis is chosen and a general algorithm is presented. The correctness
of the algorithm is shown and the computational complexity is analyzed. As a
main result, the computational complexity measure considered here is related to
the Ljapunow exponent of the dynamical system under consideration.
