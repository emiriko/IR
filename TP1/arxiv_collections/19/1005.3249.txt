The fundamental properties of brown dwarfs evolve with age. Models describing
the evolution of luminosities and effective temperatures, among other physical
parameters, can be empirically constrained using brown dwarfs of various masses
in star clusters of well determined age and metallicity. We aim to carry out a
spectroscopic and photometric characterization of low-mass brown dwarfs of the
~120 Myr old Pleiades open cluster. We obtained low-resolution near-infrared
spectra of the J=17.4-18.8 mag candidate L-type brown dwarfs PLIZ 28 and 35,
BRB 17, 21, 23, and 29, which are Pleiades members by photometry and proper
motion. We also obtained spectra of the well-known J=15.4-16.1 mag late M-type
cluster members PPl 1, Teide 1, and Calar 3. We find that the former six
objects have early- to mid-L spectral types and confirm previously reported
M-types for the other three objects. The spectra of the L0-type BRB 17 and PLIZ
28 present a triangular H-band continuum shape, indicating that this peculiar
spectral feature persists until at least the age of the Pleiades. We add to our
sample 36 reported M5-L0-type cluster members, collecting their I_c - and
UKIDSS ZYJHK-band photometry. We confirm a possible interleaving of the
Pleiades and field L-type sequences in the JHK absolute magnitude versus
spectral type diagrams, and quantify marginally redder Pleiades J-K colours, by
0.12+-0.20 mag, possibly related to both reddening and youth. Using field dwarf
bolometric correction - and effective temperature - spectral type relations, we
obtain the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the Pleiades sample. Theoretical
models reproduce well the spectral sequence at M5.5-9, but appear to
overestimate the luminosity or underestimate the effective temperature at L0-5.
For the Pleiades early- to mid L-type brown dwarfs, we estimate theoretical
masses to be in the range 0.025-0.035 M_Sol.
