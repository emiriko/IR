We provide precise J2000, epoch 2000 coordinates and cross-identifications to
sources in the 2MASS point source catalog for nearly all stars in the Gliese,
Gliese and Jahreiss, and Woolley catalogs of nearby stars. The only Gliese
objects where we were not successful are two Gliese sources that are actually
QSOs, two proposed companions to brighter stars which we believe do not exist,
four stars included in one of the catalogs but identified there as only optical
companions, one probable plate flaw, and two stars which simply remain
un-recovered. For the 4251 recovered stars, 2693 have coordinates based on
Hipparcos positions, 1549 have coordinates based on 2MASS data, and 9 have
positions from other astrometric sources. All positions have been calculated at
epoch 2000 using proper motions from the literature, which are also given here.
