We address the problem of finding patterns from multi-neuronal spike trains
that give us insights into the multi-neuronal codes used in the brain and help
us design better brain computer interfaces. We focus on the synchronous firings
of groups of neurons as these have been shown to play a major role in coding
and communication. With large electrode arrays, it is now possible to
simultaneously record the spiking activity of hundreds of neurons over large
periods of time. Recently, techniques have been developed to efficiently count
the frequency of synchronous firing patterns. However, when the number of
neurons being observed grows they suffer from the combinatorial explosion in
the number of possible patterns and do not scale well. In this paper, we
present a temporal data mining scheme that overcomes many of these problems. It
generates a set of candidate patterns from frequent patterns of smaller size;
all possible patterns are not counted. Also we count only a certain well
defined subset of occurrences and this makes the process more efficient. We
highlight the computational advantage that this approach offers over the
existing methods through simulations.
  We also propose methods for assessing the statistical significance of the
discovered patterns. We detect only those patterns that repeat often enough to
be significant and thus be able to automatically fix the threshold for the
data-mining application. Finally we discuss the usefulness of these methods for
brain computer interfaces.
