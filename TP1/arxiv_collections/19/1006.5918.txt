We present a phenomenological study of Drell-Yan pair production at hadron
colliders based on the NNLO fixed order calculation and on NNLL resummation of
threshold logarithms. We give an argument to prove that resummation effects are
relevant also for values of x=M^2/s far from threshold. We compare different
prescriptions for the calculation of resummed quantities, emphasizing the
differences coming from subleading terms, which are important when x is small.
We present phenomenological predictions for Drell-Yan rapidity distributions at
the LHC, we study the ambiguity related to the resummation prescription, and we
compare it to that coming from scale variation.
