One of the major advances needed to realize all-optical information
processing of light is the ability to delay or coherently store and retrieve
optical information in a rapidly tunable manner. In the classical domain, this
optical buffering is expected to be a key ingredient to managing the flow of
information over complex optical networks. Such a system also has profound
implications for quantum information processing, serving as a long-term memory
that can store the full quantum information contained in an optical pulse. Here
we suggest a novel approach to light storage involving an optical waveguide
coupled to an optomechanical crystal array, where light in the waveguide can be
dynamically and coherently transferred into long-lived mechanical vibrations of
the array. Under realistic conditions, this system is capable of achieving
large bandwidths and storage/delay times in a compact, on-chip platform.
