Several firing patterns experimentally observed in neural populations have
been successfully correlated to animal behavior. Population bursting, hereby
regarded as a period of high firing rate followed by a period of quiescence, is
typically observed in groups of neurons during behavior. Biophysical
membrane-potential models of single cell bursting involve at least three
equations. Extending such models to study the collective behavior of neural
populations involves thousands of equations and can be very expensive
computationally. For this reason, low dimensional population models that
capture biophysical aspects of networks are needed.
  \noindent The present paper uses a firing-rate model to study mechanisms that
trigger and stop transitions between tonic and phasic population firing. These
mechanisms are captured through a two-dimensional system, which can potentially
be extended to include interactions between different areas of the nervous
system with a small number of equations. The typical behavior of midbrain
dopaminergic neurons in the rodent is used as an example to illustrate and
interpret our results.
  \noindent The model presented here can be used as a building block to study
interactions between networks of neurons. This theoretical approach may help
contextualize and understand the factors involved in regulating burst firing in
populations and how it may modulate distinct aspects of behavior.
