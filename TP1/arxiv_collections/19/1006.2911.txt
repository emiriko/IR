Assuming there is a new gauge group in a Hidden Valley, and a new type of
radiation, can we observe it through its effect on the kinematic distributions
of recoiling visible particles? Specifically, what are the collider signatures
of radiation in a hidden sector? We address these questions using a generic
SU(N)-like Hidden Valley model that we implement in Pythia. We find that in
both the e+e- and the LHC cases the kinematic distributions of the visible
particles can be significantly affected by the valley radiation. Without a
proper understanding of such effects, inferred masses of "communicators" and of
invisible particles can be substantially off.
