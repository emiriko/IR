{\sc Combine} is an add-on to {\sc SigSpec} and {\sc Cinderella}. A {\sc
SigSpec} result file or a file generated by {\sc Cinderella} contains the
significant sinusoidal signal components in a time series. In this file, {\sc
Combine} checks one frequency after the other for being a linear combination of
previously examined frequencies. If this attempt fails, the corresponding
frequency is considered ``genuine''. Only genuine frequencies are used to form
linear combinations subsequently. A purely heuristic model is employed to
assign a reliability to each linear combination and to justify whether to
consider a frequency genuine or a linear combination.
