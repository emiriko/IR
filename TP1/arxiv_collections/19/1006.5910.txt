The dynamical parton distributions of the nucleon are generated radiatively
from positive definite (valencelike) input distributions at an optimally chosen
low resolution scale (Q_0^2 < 1 GeV^2). For the strange distribution in
particular, it has been assumed that vanishing strange input distributions at
this low scale is an appropriate choice. By confronting predictions derived
from our (GJR08) NLO dynamical parton distributions with recent neutrino dimuon
production measurement from NuTeV we show that this is indeed the case, and
that little improvement is achieved by using a more general ansatz.
Nevertheless, the data induce an asymmetry in the strange sea which is found to
be small and positive in agreement with previous results.
