In this article, we parameterize the vertexes $\Omega^*_Q\Omega_Q^*\phi$,
$\Omega^*_Q\Xi_Q^*K^*$,
  $\Xi_Q^*\Sigma^*_QK^*$ and $\Sigma_Q^*\Sigma^*_Q \rho$ with four tensor
structures due to Lorentz invariance, and study the corresponding four strong
coupling constants with the light-cone QCD sum rules.
