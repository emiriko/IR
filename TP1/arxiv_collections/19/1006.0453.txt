We show that non-abelian potentials acting on ultracold gases with two
hyperfine levels can give rise to ground states with non-abelian excitations.
We consider a realistic gauge potential for which the Landau levels can be
exactly determined: the non-abelian part of the vector potential makes the
Landau levels non-degenerate. In the presence of strong repulsive interactions,
deformed Laughlin ground states occur in general. However, at the degeneracy
points of the Landau levels, non-abelian quantum Hall states appear: these
ground states, including deformed Moore-Read states (characterized by Ising
anyons as quasi-holes), are studied for both fermionic and bosonic gases.
