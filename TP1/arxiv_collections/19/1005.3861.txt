The expectation value of Wilson loop operators in three-dimensional SO(N)
Chern-Simons gauge theory gives a known knot invariant: the Kauffman
polynomial. Here this result is derived, at the first order, via a simple
variational method. With the same procedure the skein relation for Sp(N) are
also obtained. Jones polynomial arises as special cases: Sp(2), SO(-2) and
SL(2,R). These results are confirmed and extended up to the second order, by
means of perturbation theory, which moreover let us establish a duality
relation between SO(+/-N) and Sp(-/+N) invariants. A correspondence between the
firsts orders in perturbation theory of SO(-2), Sp(2) or SU(2) Chern-Simons
quantum holonomies and the partition function of the Q=4 Potts Model is built.
