We are constructing the broadband SED catalog of the MOJAVE sample from the
radio to the gamma-ray band using MOJAVE, Swift UVOT/XRT/BAT, and Fermi/LAT
data, in order to understand the emission mechanism of extragalactic outflows
and to investigate the site of high-energy emission in AGN. Since the launch of
Fermi gamma-ray Space Telescope in August 2008, two thirds of the MOJAVE
sources have been detected by Fermi/LAT. Combining the results of
high-resolution VLBI, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations of the jet-dominated
AGN sample, we want to pin down the origin of high-energy emission in
relativistic jets. Here we present our overall project and preliminary results
for 6 selected sources.
