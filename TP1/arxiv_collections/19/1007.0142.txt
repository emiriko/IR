The fundamental higher-order Landau plasma modes are known to be generally
heavily damped. We show that these modes for the ion component in a weakly
ionized plasma can be substantially modified by ion-neutral collisions and a dc
electric field driving ion flow so that some of them can become unstable. This
instability is expected to naturally occur in presheaths of gas discharges at
sufficiently small pressures and thus affect sheaths and discharge structures.
