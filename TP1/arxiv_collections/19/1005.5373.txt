We demonstrate a scheme, based on a cascade of lithium niobate intensity and
phase modulators driven by specially tailored radio frequency waveforms to
generate an optical frequency comb with very high spectral flatness. In this
work we demonstrate a 10 GHz comb with ~40 lines with spectral power variation
below 1-dB and ~60 lines in total. The number of lines that can be generated is
limited by the power handling capability of the phase modulator, and this can
be scaled without compromising the spectral flatness. Furthermore, the spectral
phase of the generated combs in our scheme is almost purely quadratic which, as
we will demonstrate, allows for very high quality pulse compression using only
single mode fiber.
