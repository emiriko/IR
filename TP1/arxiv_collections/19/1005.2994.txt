Violations of Lorentz boost symmetry in the electron and photon sectors can
be constrained by studying several different high-energy phenomenon. Although
they may not lead to the strongest bounds numerically, measurements made in
terrestrial laboratories produce the most reliable results. Laboratory bounds
can be based on observations of synchrotron radiation, as well as the observed
absences of vacuum Cerenkov radiation. Using measurements of synchrotron energy
losses at LEP and the survival of TeV photons, we place new bounds on the three
electron Lorentz violation coefficients c_(TJ), at the 3 x 10^(-13) to 6 x
10^(-15) levels.
