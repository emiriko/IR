The approach to the critical state -- the transition from partially elastic
to perfectly plastic behavior -- is considered the most characteristic of
granular phenomena in soil mechanics. By identifying the critical state as the
steady-state solution of the elastic strain, and presenting the main results as
transparent, analytic expressions, the physics of this important phenomenon is
clarified.
