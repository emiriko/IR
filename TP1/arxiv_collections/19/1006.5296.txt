The evolutionary stage of a powerful radio source originated by an AGN is
related to its linear size. In this context, compact symmetric objects (CSOs),
which are powerful and intrinsically small (< 1 kpc) radio sources with a
convex synchrotron radio spectrum that peaks around the GHz regime, should
represent a young stage in the individual radio source life. Their radio jets
expand within the dense and inhomogeneous interstellar medium of the host
galaxy, which may influence the source growth. The radio emission is expected
to evolve as a consequence of adiabatic expansion and radiative and inverse
Compton losses. The role played by the different mechanisms in the radio and
gamma regimes is discussed.
