By demanding a compact spectrum for the right-handed neutrinos and an
approximate quark-lepton symmetry inspired from SO(10) gauge unification
(assuming a Dirac neutrino mass matrix close to the up quark mass matrix), we
construct a {\it fine tuning} scenario for baryogenesis via leptogenesis. We
find two solutions with a normal hierarchy, with the lightest neutrino mass
$m_1$ different from zero, providing an absolute scale for the spectrum. In the
approximations of the model, there are three independent CP phases : $\delta_L$
(that we take of the order of the quark Kobayashi-Maskawa phase) and the two
light neutrino Majorana phases $\alpha$ and $\beta$. A main conclusion is that,
although this general scheme is rather flexible, in some regions of parameter
space we find that the necessary baryogenesis with its sign is given in terms
of the $\delta_L$ phase alone. The light Majorana phases can also be computed
and turn out to be close of $\pi/2$ or small. Moreover, SO(10) breaks down to
the Pati-Salam group $SU(4) \times SU(2) \times SU(2)$ at the expected natural
intermediate scale of about $10^{10}-10^{11}\ GeV$. A prediction is done for
the effective mass in $(\beta \beta)_{0\nu}$ decay, the $\nu_e$ mass and the
sum of all light neutrino masses.
