We introduce the notion of \textit{star cluster} of a simplex in a simplicial
complex. This concept provides a general tool to study the topology of
independence complexes of graphs. We use star clusters to answer a question
arisen from works of Engstr\"om and Jonsson on the homotopy type of
independence complexes of triangle-free graphs and to investigate a large
number of examples which appear in the literature. We present an alternative
way to study the chromatic number of a graph from a homotopical point of view
and obtain new results regarding the connectivity of independence complexes.
