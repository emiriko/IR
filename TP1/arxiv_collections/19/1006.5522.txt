This paper deals with a notion of Sobolev space $W^{1,p}$ introduced by
J.Bourgain, H.Brezis and P.Mironescu by means of a seminorm involving local
averages of finite differences. This seminorm was subsequently used by A.Ponce
to obtain a Poincar\'e-type inequality. The main results that we present are a
generalization of these two works to a non-Euclidean setting, namely that of
Carnot groups. We show that the seminorm expressd in terms of the intrinsic
distance is equivalent to the $L^p$ norm of the intrinsic gradient, and provide
a Poincar\'e-type inequality on Carnot groups by means of a constructive
approach which relies on one-dimensional estimates. Self-improving properties
are also studied for some cases of interest.
