We show that the nonequilibrium entropy production for a driven quantum
system is larger than the Bures length, the geometric distance between its
actual state and the corresponding equilibrium state. This universal lower
bound generalizes the Clausius inequality to arbitrary nonequilibrium processes
beyond linear response. We further derive a fundamental upper bound for the
quantum entropy production rate and discuss its connection to the
Bremermann-Bekenstein bound.
