The conformal index counts the number of exactly marginal deformations. In 4d
the index is given by the number of chiral primary operators of dimension 3
moded out by the complexified global group, where the quotient is defined as
usual by imposing a D-term. Here we show its consistency with the
Leigh-Strassler method for weakly coupled theories, and we test it against
known examples. In several examples this method discovers extra exactly
marginal deformations beyond those of Leigh-Strassler. [This is an unpublished
