Biometrics deals with identity verification of an individual by using certain
physiological or behavioral features associated with a person. Biometric
identification systems using fingerprints patterns are called AFIS (Automatic
Fingerprint Identification System). In this paper a composite method for
Fingerprint recognition is considered using a combination of Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) and Sobel Filters for improvement of a poor quality fingerprint
image. Steganography hides messages inside other messages in such a way that an
"adversary" would not even know a secret message were present. The objective of
our paper is to make a bio-secure system. In this paper bio-authentication has
been implemented in terms of finger print recognition and the second part of
the paper is an interactive steganographic system hides the user's data by two
options- creating a songs list or hiding the data in an image.
