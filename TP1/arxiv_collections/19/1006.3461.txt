The mean field fluctuations of large atomic ensembles can behave like bosonic
modes, i.e. they induce a state on an appropriate system of bosonic modes. The
most prominent example is that, if the atomic ensemble is in a homogenous
product state, then the mean-field fluctuations are inducing a Gaussian state
on a system of bosonic modes. In the present paper we show that for atomic
ensemble states with exponentially decaying correlations (e.g. with respect to
the distance of atoms) the mean-field fluctuations are inducing (possibly
non-Gaussian) states on the on a system of bosonic modes. This result is true
for a general lattice of atomic systems that is equipped with a reasonable
distance function.
