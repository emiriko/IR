In this paper, we present the first snap-stabilizing message forwarding
protocol that uses a number of buffers per node being inde- pendent of any
global parameter, that is 4 buffers per link. The protocol works on a linear
chain of nodes, that is possibly an overlay on a large- scale and dynamic
system, e.g., Peer-to-Peer systems, Grids. . . Provided that the topology
remains a linear chain and that nodes join and leave "neatly", the protocol
tolerates topology changes. We expect that this protocol will be the base to
get similar results on more general topologies.
