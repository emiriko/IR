We obtain an analytic expression for the vacuum polarization on the horizon
of the Schwarzschild black hole threaded by an infinite cosmic string. This
calculation relies on a generalized Heine identity for Legendre functions which
we derive without using specific properties of the Legendre functions
themselves.
