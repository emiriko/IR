Little Higgs models provide a natural explanation of the little hierarchy
between the electroweak scale and a few TeV scale, where new physics is
expected. Under the same inspiring naturalness arguments, this work completes a
previous study on lepton flavor-changing processes in the Littlest Higgs model
with T-parity exploring the channel that will eventually turn out to be the
most sensitive, \mu-e conversion in nuclei. All one-loop contributions are
carefully taken into account, results for the most relevant nuclei are provided
and a discussion of the influence of the quark mixing is included. The results
for the Ti nucleus are in good agreement with earlier work by Blanke et al.,
where a degenerate mirror quark sector was assumed. The conclusion is that,
although this particular model reduces the tension with electroweak precision
tests, if the restrictions on the parameter space derived from lepton flavor
violation are taken seriously, the degree of fine tuning necessary to meet
these constraints also disfavors this model.
