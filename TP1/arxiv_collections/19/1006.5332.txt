The discreteness of permitted state spectrum postulated on atomic level can
be macroscopic in nanostructures and larger structures because of macroscopic
quantum phenomena such as superconductivity. The change by jump of measured
parameters because of the macroscopic discreteness may be used for some
applications. A device is proposed measured parameters of which can change by
jump at a weak change of external parameters. The devise consists of two
superconductor loop connected with two Josephson junctions. The macroscopic
parameter - maximum value of the super-current through the two Josephson
junctions - can change with the quantum number determining macroscopic angular
momentum of superconducting pairs in one of the two loops.
