We perform a quantum mechanical study of the peptides that are part of the
LH2 complex from Rhodopseudomonas acidophila, a non-sulfur purple bacteria that
has the ability of producing chemical energy from photosynthesis. The
electronic structure calculations indicate that the transmembrane helices of
these peptides are characterized by dipole moments with a magnitude of ~150 D.
When the full nonamer assembly made of eighteen peptides is considered, then a
macrodipole of magnitude 704 D is built up from the vector sum of each monomer
dipole. The macrodipole is oriented normal to the membrane plane and with the
positive tip toward the cytoplasm thereby indicating that the electronic charge
of the protein scaffold is polarized toward the periplasm. The results obtained
here suggest that the asymmetric charge distribution of the protein scaffold
contributes an anisotropic electrostatic environment which differentiates the
absorption properties of the bacteriochlorophyll pigments, B800 and B850,
embedded in the LH2 complex.
