A non-universal axigluon in generalized chiral color models leads to flavor
changing neutral currents (FCNCs) at tree level. We analyze phenomenologically
the new contributions to $B_{q}$ (q=d, s) mixing and the related CP asymmetries
(CPAs) that are generated by axigluon exchange. We find that although $\Delta
m_{B_q}$ can give a strict constraint on the parameters of $b\to q$ transition,
the precise measurement of $\sin2\beta_{J/\Psi K^0}$ can further exclude the
parameter space of $b\to d$ transition. The axigluon-mediated effects can
enhance the like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry ${\cal A}^{b}_{s\ell}$ by one
order of magnitude larger than the standard model prediction. Accordingly,
large CPA $\sin2\beta^{J/\Psi \phi}_s$ and CPA difference $\sin2\beta_{J\Psi
K^0}-\sin2\beta_{\phi K^0}$ are achieved.
