We present a fully differential chemical abundance analysis using very
high-resolution (R >~ 85,000) and very high signal-to-noise (S/N~800 on
average) HARPS and UVES spectra of 7 solar twins and 95 solar analogs, 24 are
planet hosts and 71 are stars without detected planets. The whole sample of
solar analogs provide very accurate Galactic chemical evolution trends in the
metalliciy range -0.3<[Fe/H]<0.5. Solar twins with and without planets show
similar mean abundance ratios. We have also analysed a sub-sample of 28 solar
analogs, 14 planet hosts and 14 stars without known planets, with spectra at
S/N~850 on average, in the metallicity range 0.14<[Fe/H]<0.36 and find the same
abundance pattern for both samples of stars with and without planets. This
result does not depend on either the planet mass, from 7 Earth masses to 17.4
Jupiter masses, or the orbital period of the planets, from 3 to 4300 days. In
addition, we have derived the slope of the abundance ratios as a function of
the condensation temperature for each star and again find similar distributions
of the slopes for both stars with and without planets. In particular, the peaks
of these two distributions are placed at a similar value but with opposite sign
as that expected from a possible signature of terrestial planets. In
particular, two of the planetary systems in this sample, containing each of
them a Super-Earth like planet, show slope values very close to these peaks
which may suggest that these abundance patterns are not related to the presence
of terrestial planets.
