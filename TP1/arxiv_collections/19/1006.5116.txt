We study broadband polarization entangled states generated within the line
width of type-II Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC). Applying a
complete quantum polarization tomography protocol at arbitrary combination of
frequency and angular sideband modes we reveal a complex structure of
non-degenerate non-collinear polarization entangled states generated within the
SPDC line width. It is demonstrated that simultaneous compensation of
longitudinal and transverse walk off leads to homogenizing the structure of
polarization entanglement.
