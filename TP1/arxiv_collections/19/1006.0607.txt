In this paper, we extend our geometrical derivation of expansion coefficients
of mirror maps by localization computation to the case of toric manifolds with
two K\"ahler forms. Especially, we take Hirzebruch surfaces F_{0}, F_{3} and
Calabi-Yau hypersurface in weighted projective space P(1,1,2,2,2) as examples.
We expect that our results can be easily generalized to arbitrary toric
manifold.
