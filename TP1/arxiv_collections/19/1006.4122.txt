We observe a bilinear magnetic field-induced electric polarization of 50 $\mu
C/m^2$ in single crystals of NiCl$_2$-4SC(NH$_2$)$_2$ (DTN). DTN forms a
tetragonal structure that breaks inversion symmetry, with the highly polar
thiourea molecules all tilted in the same direction along the c-axis.
Application of a magnetic field between 2 and 12 T induces canted
antiferromagnetism of the Ni spins and the resulting magnetization closely
tracks the electric polarization. We speculate that the Ni magnetic forces
acting on the soft organic lattice can create significant distortions and
modify the angles of the thiourea molecules, thereby creating a magnetoelectric
effect. This is an example of how magnetoelectric effects can be constructed in
organo-metallic single crystals by combining magnetic ions with electrically
polar organic elements.
