This paper reports the results on methods of comparing the memory retrieval
capacity of the Hebbian neural network which implements the B-Matrix approach,
by using the Widrow-Hoff rule of learning. We then, extend the recently
proposed Active Sites model by developing a delta rule to increase memory
capacity. Also, this paper extends the binary neural network to a multi-level
(non-binary) neural network.
