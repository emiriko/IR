We investigate systematically the impacts of heat bath used in molecular
dynamics simulations on heat conduction in nanostructures exemplified by
Silicon Nanowires (SiNWs) and Silicon/Germanium nano junction. It is found that
multiple layers of Nos\'e-Hoover heat bath are required to reduce the
temperature jump at the boundary, while only a single layer of Langevin heat
bath is sufficient to generate a linear temperature profile with small boundary
temperature jump. Moreover, an intermediate value of heat bath parameter is
recommended for both Nos\'e-Hoover and Langevin heat bath in order to achieve
correct temperature profile and thermal conductivity in homogeneous materials.
Furthermore, the thermal rectification ratio in Si/Ge thermal diode depends on
the choice of Nos\'e-Hoover heat bath parameter remarkably, which may lead to
non-physical results. In contrast, Langevin heat bath is recommended because it
can produce consistent results with experiment in large heat bath parameter
range.
