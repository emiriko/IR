The development of ultra-light pixelated ladders is motivated by the
requirements of the ILD vertex detector at ILC. This paper summarizes three
projects related to system integration. The PLUME project tackles the issue of
assembling double-sided ladders. The SERWIETE project deals with a more
innovative concept and consists in making single-sided unsupported ladders
embedded in an extra thin plastic enveloppe. AIDA, the last project, aims at
building a framework reproducing the experimental running conditions where sets
of ladders could be tested.
