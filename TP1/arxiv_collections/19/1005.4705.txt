Preliminary results on the discovery and follow-up observations of a new
$\delta$ Scuti pulsator in the Cygnus field are presented. The variability of
the star HD 207331 was detected while testing a Str\"omgren spectrophotometer
attached to the H.L. Johnson 1.5-m telescope at the San Pedro M\'artir
observatory, M\'exico. CCD photometric data acquired soon after confirmed its
variability. A few hours of $uvby$ differential photoelectric photometry during
three nights revealed at least two beating periods. A two-site observational
campaign carried out during one week in 2009 confirms the multi-periodic nature
of this new $\delta$ Scuti pulsator.
