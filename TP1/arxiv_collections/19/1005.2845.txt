The discovery of a historical bug in the s-post-process AGB code obtained so
far by the Torino group forced us to reconsider the role of primary 16O in the
13C-pocket, produced by the 13C(a, n)16O reaction, as important neutron poison
for the build up of the s-elements at Halo metallicities. The effect is
noticeable only for the highest 13C-pocket efficiencies (cases ST*2 and ST).
For Galactic disc metallicities, the bug effect is negligible. A comparative
analysis of the neutron poison effect of other primary isotopes (12C, 22Ne and
its progenies) is presented. The effect of proton captures, by 14N(n, p)14C,
boosts a primary production of Fluorine in Halo AGB stars, with [F/Fe]
comparable to [C/Fe], without affecting the s-elements production.
