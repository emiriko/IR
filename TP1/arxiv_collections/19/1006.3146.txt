In this work it is investigated general models with interactions between two
canonical scalar fields and between one non-canonical (tachyon-type) and one
canonical scalar field. The potentials and couplings to the gravity are
selected through the Noether symmetry approach. These general models are
employed to describe interactions between dark energy and dark matter, with the
fields being constrained by the astronomical data. The cosmological solutions
of some cases are compared with the observed evolution of the late Universe.
