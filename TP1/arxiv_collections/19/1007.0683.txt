We study the problem of scheduling periodic real-time tasks so as to meet
their individual minimum reward requirements. A task generates jobs that can be
given arbitrary service times before their deadlines. A task then obtains
rewards based on the service times received by its jobs. We show that this
model is compatible to the imprecise computation models and the increasing
reward with increasing service models. In contrast to previous work on these
models, which mainly focus on maximize the total reward in the system, we aim
to fulfill different reward requirements by different tasks, which offers
better fairness and allows fine-grained tradeoff between tasks. We first derive
a necessary and sufficient condition for a system, along with reward
requirements of tasks, to be feasible. We also obtain an off-line feasibility
optimal scheduling policy. We then studies a sufficient condition for a policy
to be feasibility optimal or achieves some approximation bound. This condition
can serve as a guideline for designing on-line scheduling policy and we obtains
a greedy policy based on it. We prove that the on-line policy is feasibility
optimal when all tasks have the same periods and also obtain an approximation
bound for the policy under general cases.
