We propose a simple scaling procedure for the normal-state magnetization Mn
data collected as functions of temperature T in different magnetic fields H. As
a result, the Mn(T) curves collected in different fields collapse on to a
single Msc(T) line. In this representation, the onset of superconducting
diamagnetism manifests itself by a sharp divergence of the Msc(T) curves for
different H values. As will be demonstrated, this allows for a reliable
determination of temperature Tonset, at which superconducting diamagnetism
become observable.
