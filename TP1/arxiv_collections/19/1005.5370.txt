We investigate a notion of Azumaya algebras in the context of structured ring
spectra and give a definition of Brauer groups. We investigate their Galois
theoretic properties, and discuss examples of Azumaya algebras arising from
Galois descent and cyclic algebras. We construct examples that are related to
topological Hochschild cohomology of group ring spectra and we present a
K(n)-local variant of the notion of Brauer groups.
