We consider the interplay of linear double-well-potential (DWP) structures
and nonlinear longrange interactions of different types, motivated by
applications to nonlinear optics and matter waves. We find that, while the
basic spontaneous-symmetry-breaking (SSB) bifurcation structure in the DWP
persists in the presence of the long-range interactions, the critical points at
which the SSB emerges are sensitive to the range of the nonlocal interaction.
We quantify the dynamics by developing a few-mode approximation corresponding
to the DWP structure, and analyze the resulting system of ordinary differential
equations and its bifurcations in detail. We compare results of this analysis
with those produced by the full partial differential equation, finding good
agreement between the two approaches. Effects of the competition between the
local self-attraction and nonlocal repulsion on the SSB are studied too. A far
more complex bifurcation structure involving the possibility for not only
supercritical but also subcritical bifurcations and even bifurcation loops is
identified in that case.
