The elastic and alpha-production channels for the 6He+208Pb reaction are
investigated at energies around the Coulomb barrier (E_{lab}=14, 16, 18, 22,
and 27 MeV). The effect of the two-neutron transfer channels on the elastic
scattering has been studied within the Coupled-Reaction-Channels (CRC) method.
We find that the explicit inclusion of these channels allows a simultaneous
description of the elastic data and the inclusive alpha cross sections at
backward angles. Three-body Continuum-Discretized Coupled-Channels (CDCC)
calculations are found to reproduce the elastic data, but not the
transfer/breakup data. The trivially-equivalent local polarization potential
(TELP) derived from the CRC and CDCC calculations are found to explain the
features found in previous phenomenological optical model calculations for this
system.
