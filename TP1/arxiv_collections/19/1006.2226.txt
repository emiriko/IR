The present work considers interaction between DBI-essence and other
candidates of dark energies like modified Chaplygin gas, hessence, tachyonic
field, and new agegraphic dark energy. The potentials of the fields have been
reconstructed under interaction and their evolutions have been viewed against
cosmic time $t$ and scalar field $\phi$. Equation of state parameters have also
been obtained. The nature of potentials and the equation of state parameters of
the dark energies have been found graphically in presence of interaction (both
small and large interaction).
