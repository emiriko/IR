Time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and Brillouin light
scattering (BLS) spectroscopy are important techniques for the investigation of
magnetization dynamics. Within this article, we calculate analytically the MOKE
and BLS signals from prototypical spin-wave modes in the ferromagnetic layer.
The reliability of the analytical expressions is confirmed by optically exact
numerical calculations. Finally, we discuss the dependence of the MOKE and BLS
signals on the ferromagnetic layer thickness.
