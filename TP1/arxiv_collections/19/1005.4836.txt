Hwang in [Phys. Rev. E 80, 042103 (2009)] suggested that the two transitions
of the six-state clock model on the square lattice are not of the
Kosterlitz-Thouless type. Here we show from simulations thatat the upper
transition, the helicity modulus does make a discontinuous jump to zero. This
gives strong evidence for a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.
