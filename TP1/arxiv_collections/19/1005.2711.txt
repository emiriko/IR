We examine mobility and saturation velocity in graphene on SiO2 above room
temperature (300-500 K) and at high fields (~1 V/um). Data are analyzed with
practical models including gated carriers, thermal generation, "puddle" charge,
and Joule heating. Both mobility and saturation velocity decrease with rising
temperature above 300 K, and with rising carrier density above 2x10^12 cm^-2.
Saturation velocity is >3x10^7 cm/s at low carrier density, and remains greater
than in Si up to 1.2x10^13 cm^-2. Transport appears primarily limited by the
SiO2 substrate, but results suggest intrinsic graphene saturation velocity
could be more than twice that observed here.
