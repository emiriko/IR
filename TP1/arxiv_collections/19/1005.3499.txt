A brief overview of the latest status of jet physics studies at the Tevatron
in proton-antiproton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$~TeV is presented. In
particular, measurements of the inclusive jet production cross-section, dijet
production and searches for new physics, the ratio of the 3-jet to 2-jet
production cross-sections, and the three-jet mass are discussed.
