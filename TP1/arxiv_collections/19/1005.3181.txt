Using Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM) to manipulate nano-objects is an actual
challenge for surface scientists. Basic haptic interfacesbetween the AFM and
experimentalists have already been implemented. Themulti-sensory renderings
(seeing, hearing and feeling) studied from acognitive point of view increase
the efficiency of the actual interfaces. Toallow the experimentalist to feel
and touch the nano-world, we add mixedrealities between an AFM and a force
feedback device, enriching thus thedirect connection by a modeling engine. We
present in this paper the firstresults from a real-time remote-control handling
of an AFM by our ForceFeedback Gestural Device through the example of the
approach-retract curve.
