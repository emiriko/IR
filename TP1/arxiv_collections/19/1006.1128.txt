Scientific education and divulgation not only amplify people's vocabulary and
repertory of scientific concepts but, at the same time, promote the diffusion
of certain conceptual and cognitive metaphors. Here we make some hypothesis
about this process, proposing a classification in terms of visible, invisible,
basic and derived metaphors. We focus our attention in contemporary and
classical physics metaphors applied to psychological and socio-economical
phenomena, and we study two exemplar cases through an exhaustive exam of the
online content of large Brazilian journalistic portals. Finally, we present
implications and suggestions from the cognitive metaphor theory for the
scientific education and divulgation process.
