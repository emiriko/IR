We present clumps of dust emission from Herschel observations of the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and their physical and statistical properties. We
catalog cloud features seen in the dust emission from Herschel observations of
the LMC, the Magellanic type irregular galaxy closest to the Milky Way, and
compare these features with HI catalogs from the ATCA+Parkes HI survey. Using
an automated cloud-finding algorithm, we identify clouds and clumps of dust
emission and examine the cumulative mass distribution of the detected dust
clouds. The mass of cold dust is determined from physical parameters that we
derive by performing spectral energy distribution fits to 250, 350, and 500
micronm emission from SPIRE observations using DUSTY and GRASIL radiative
transfer calculation with dust grain size distributions for graphite/silicate
in low-metallicity extragalactic environments. The dust cloud mass spectrum
follows a power law distribution with an exponent of gamma=-1.8 for clumps
larger than 400 solar mass and is similar to the HI mass distribution. This is
expected from the theory of ISM structure in the vicinity of star formation.
