We report full-dimensionality quantum and classical calculations for double
ionization of laser-driven helium at 390 nm. Good qualitative agreement is
observed. We show that the classical double ionization trajectories can be
divided into two distinct pathways: direct and delayed. The direct pathway,
with an almost simultaneous ejection of both electrons, emerges from small
laser intensities. With increasing intensity its relative importance, compared
to the delayed ionization pathway, increases until it becomes the predominant
pathway for total electron escape energy below around 5.25 $U_{p}$. However the
delayed pathway is the predominant one for double ionization above a certain
cut-off energy at all laser intensities.
