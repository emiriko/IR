We present multiphase Period-Color/Amplitude-Color/Period-Luminosity
relations using OGLE III and Galactic Cepheid data and compare with state of
the art theoretical pulsation models. Using this new way to compare models and
observations, we find convincing evidence that both Period-Color and
Period-Luminosity Relations as a function of phase are dynamic and highly
nonlinear at certain pulsation phases. We extend this to a multiphase Wesenheit
function and find the same result. Hence our results cannot be due to reddening
errors. We present statistical tests and the urls of movies depicting the
Period-Color/Period Luminosity and Wesenheit relations as a function of phase
for the LMC OGLE III Cepheid data: these tests and movies clearly demonstrate
nonlinearity as a function of phase and offer a new window toward a deeper
understanding of stellar pulsation. When comparing with models, we find that
the models also predict this nonlinearity in both Period-Color and
Period-Luminosity planes. The models with (Z=0.004, Y=0.25) fare better in
mimicking the LMC Cepheid relations, particularly at longer periods, though the
models predict systematically higher amplitudes than the observations.
