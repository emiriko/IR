We calculate the optical Hall conductivity within the Kubo formalism for
systems with gapped spectral nodes, where the latter have a power-law
dispersion with exponent n. The optical conductivity is proportional to n and
there is a characteristic logarithmic singularity as the frequency approaches
the gap energy. The optical Hall conductivity is almost unaffected by thermal
fluctuations and disorder for n=1, whereas disorder has a stronger effect on
transport properties if n=2.
