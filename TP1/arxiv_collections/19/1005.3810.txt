Dark energy is an important science driver of many upcoming large-scale
surveys. With small, stable seeing and low thermal infrared background, Dome A,
Antarctica, offers a unique opportunity for shedding light on fundamental
questions about the universe. We show that a deep, high-resolution imaging
survey of 10,000 square degrees in \emph{ugrizyJH} bands can provide
competitive constraints on dark energy equation of state parameters using type
Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and weak lensing techniques. Such
a survey may be partially achieved with a coordinated effort of the Kunlun Dark
Universe Survey Telescope (KDUST) in \emph{yJH} bands over 5000--10,000 deg$^2$
and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in \emph{ugrizy} bands over the same
area. Moreover, the joint survey can take advantage of the high-resolution
imaging at Dome A to further tighten the constraints on dark energy and to
measure dark matter properties with strong lensing as well as galaxy--galaxy
weak lensing.
