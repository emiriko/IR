We present investigations on single Ni/Si related color centers produced via
ion implantation into single crystalline type IIa CVD diamond. Testing
different ion dose combinations we show that there is an upper limit for both
the Ni and the Si dose 10^12/cm^2 and 10^10/cm^2 resp.) due to creation of
excess fluorescent background. We demonstrate creation of Ni/Si related centers
showing emission in the spectral range between 767nm and 775nm and narrow
line-widths of 2nm FWHM at room temperature. Measurements of the intensity
auto-correlation functions prove single-photon emission. The investigated color
centers can be coarsely divided into two groups: Drawing from photon statistics
and the degree of polarization in excitation and emission we find that some
color centers behave as two-level, single-dipole systems whereas other centers
exhibit three levels and contributions from two orthogonal dipoles. In
addition, some color centers feature stable and bright emission with saturation
count rates up to 78kcounts/s whereas others show fluctuating count rates and
three-level blinking.
