We find sharp absolute constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ with the following property:
every well-rounded lattice of rank 3 in a Euclidean space has a minimal basis
so that the solid angle spanned by these basis vectors lies in the interval
$[C_1,C_2]$. In fact, we show that these absolute bounds hold for a larger
class of lattices than just well-rounded, and the upper bound holds for all. We
state a technical condition on the lattice that may prevent it from satisfying
the absolute lower bound on the solid angle, in which case we derive a lower
bound in terms of the ratios of successive minima of the lattice. We use this
result to show that among all spherical triangles on the unit sphere in
$\mathbb R^N$ with vertices on the minimal vectors of a lattice, the smallest
possible area is achieved by a configuration of minimal vectors of the
(normalized) face centered cubic lattice in $\mathbb R^3$. Such spherical
configurations come up in connection with the kissing number problem.
