The formation of graphene on any desirable substrate is extremely essential
for the successful replacement of Si with graphene in all technological
applications in the beyond-CMOS era. Recently, we observed that a Ti layer
formed on epitaxial graphene by electron-beam evaporation has the sufficiently
large area of contact with the surface of epitaxial graphene for the
exfoliation process to take place. We also observed that the exfoliated FLG on
the Ti layer can be easily transferred onto a SiO2/Si substrate. In this paper,
we have proposed a new technique for transferring graphene having a large area
of several square mm from the graphitized vicinal SiC substrate. Raman
scattering spectroscopy and low-energy electron microscopy analysis have
revealed that we can transfer mono-layer and bi-layer graphene onto the SiO2/Si
substrate by using the proposed transfer process. The initial size of epitaxial
graphene formed on the SiC substrate is the only limitation of the new transfer
process. The transfer process is expected to become an extremely important
technology that will mark the beginning of a new era in the field of graphene
electronics.
