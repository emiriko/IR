The most general two Higgs doublet model contains new sources of flavour
violation that are usually in conflict with the experimental constraints. One
possibility to suppress the exotic contribution to the flavour changing neutral
currents consists on imposing the alignment of the Yukawa couplings. This
condition presumably holds at a high-energy scale and is spoiled by the
radiative corrections. We compute in this letter the size of the radiatively
induced flavour violating Higgs couplings at the electroweak scale. These also
yield the absolute lower bound on the size of the exotic contributions to the
flavour changing neutral currents in any two Higgs doublet model, barring
cancellations and the existence of discrete symmetries. We show that these
contributions are well below the experimental bounds in large regions of the
parameter space.
