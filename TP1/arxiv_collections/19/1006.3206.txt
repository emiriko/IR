We present a kinetic theory of two-dimensional decaying turbulence in the
context of two-body and three-body vortex merging processes. By introducing the
equations of motion for two or three vortices in the effective noise due to all
the other vortices, we demonstrate analytically that a two-body mechanism
becomes inefficient at low vortex density $n\ll 1$. When the more efficient
three-body vortex mergings are considered {(involving vortices of different
signs)}, we show that $n\sim t^{-\xi}$, with $\xi=1$. We generalize this
argument to three-dimensional geostrophic turbulence, finding $\xi=5/4$, in
excellent agreement with direct Navier-Stokes simulations [J.\,C. McWilliams
\emph{et al.}, J. Fluid Mech. {\bf 401}, 1 (1999)].
