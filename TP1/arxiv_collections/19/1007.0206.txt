We review the result of SUSY parameter fits based on frequentist analyses of
experimental constraints from electroweak precision data, (g-2)_mu, B-physics
and cosmological data. We investigate the parameters of the constrained MSSM
(CMSSM) with universal soft supersymmetry-breaking mass parameters, and a model
with common non-universal Higgs mass parameters in the superpotential (NUHM1).
Shown are the results for the SUSY and Higgs spectrum of the models. Many
sparticle masses are highly correlated in both the CMSSM and NUHM1, and parts
of the regions preferred at the 68% C.L. are accessible to early LHC running.
The best-fit points could be tested even with 1/fb at sqrt[s] = 7 Tev.
