We analyze the four-dimensional Hamiltonian proposed to describe the band
structure of the single-Dirac-cone family of topological insulators in the
presence of a uniform perpendicular magnetic field. Surface Landau level(LL)
states appear, decoupled from the bulk levels and following the quantized
energy dispersion of a purely two-dimensional surface Dirac Hamiltonian. A
small hybridization gap splits the degeneracy of the central n=0 LL with
dependence on the film thickness and the field strength that can be obtained
analytically. Explicit calculation of the spin and charge densities show that
surface LL states are localized within approximately one quintuple layer from
the surface termination. Some new surface-bound LLs are shown to exist at a
higher Landau level index.
