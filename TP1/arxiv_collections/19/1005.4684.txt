The discrete symmetry D_12 at the electroweak scale is used to fix the quark
and lepton mixing angles. At the leading order, the Cabbibo angle theta_C is
15^o, and the PMNS matrix is of a bi-dodeca-mixing form giving the
Solar-neutrino angle theta_sol=30^o. Thus, there results the relation
theta_sol+theta_C ~ 45^o. Out of discrete vacua, a certain vacuum is chosen for
this assignment to be consistent with the dodeca-symmetry. A shift of theta_C
from 15^o to 13.14^o might arise from a small breaking of the dodeca-symmetry.
The spontaneous breaking leading to the required electroweak vacuum is made
possible by introducing an additional parity in an effective field approach or
by realizing the electroweak dodeca-symmetry explicitly at a high energy scale.
At the vacuum we chose Arg.Det.M_q is nonzero, and hence a solution of the
strong CP problem invites a very light axion at a high energy scale. We also
comment how the next level corrections can fit the mixing angles to the
observed values.
