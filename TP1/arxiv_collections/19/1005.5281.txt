We investigate about the possibility of knowing the thermal history of each
snow crystal through the analysis of its individual habitus. Supposition, based
on experimental observations, that prevailing growth mechanisms of basal and
prismatic surfaces are helicoidal and 2D nucleation-spread, respectively, make
possible to establish the relation temperature-habitus for all the different
kinds of crystals, with the exception of plates in the interval -3^\circ C < T
< 0^\circ C, where probably the surface melting plays an important role on the
habitus development.
