New developments in Thin Gap Chambers (TGC) detectors to provide fast trigger
and high precision muon tracking under sLHC conditions are presented. The
modified detectors are shown to stand a high total irradiation dose equivalent
to 6 Coulomb/cm of wire, without showing any deterioration in their
performance. Two large (1.2 x 0.8 m^2) prototypes containing four gaps, each
gap providing pad, strips and wires readout, with a total thickness of 50 mm,
have been constructed. Their local spatial resolution has been measured in a
100 GeV/c muon test beam at CERN. At perpendicular incidence angle, single gap
position resolution better than 60 microns has been obtained. For incidence
angle of 20 degrees resolution of less than 100 micron was achieved. TGC
prototypes were also tested under a flux of 10^5 Hz/cm^2 of 5.5-6.5 MeV
neutrons, showing a high efficiency for cosmic muons detection.
