A simple formula is derived that describes how the Coulomb interaction
affects the proton radius in nuclei. It determines the difference between
neutron and proton radii in nuclei with N approx Z. It also provides an
estimate for the difference between the radii of the Z core neutrons and the
protons in nuclei with a large neutron excess. The results obtained from the
derived formula are compared with radii calculated in a Skyrme Hartree-Fock
calculation.
