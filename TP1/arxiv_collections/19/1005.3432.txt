We study the potential of the exclusive $pp\to p\ell^-\ell^+p$ process to
probe excited leptons at the LHC which is known to be one of the most clean
channel at the hadron colliders. The sensitivity of the model parameters is
obtained 95% confidence level by considering three forward detector
acceptances; $0.0015< \xi < 0.5$, $0.0015< \xi <0.15$ and $0.1< \xi < 0.5$.
