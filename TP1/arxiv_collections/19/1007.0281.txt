We study the phase-fluctuating condensate regime of ultra-cold atoms trapped
in a ring-shaped trap geometry, which has been realized in recent experiments.
We first consider a simplified box geometry, in which we identify the
conditions to create a state that is dominated by thermal phase-fluctuations,
and then explore the experimental ring geometry. In both cases we demonstrate
that the requirement for strong phase fluctuations can be expressed in terms of
the total number of atoms and the geometric length scales of the trap only. For
the ring-shaped trap we discuss the zero temperature limit in which a
condensate is realized where the phase is fluctuating due to interactions and
quantum fluctuations. We also address possible ways of detecting the phase
fluctuating regime in ring condensates.
