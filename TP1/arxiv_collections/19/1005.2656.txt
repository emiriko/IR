Warped convolutions of operators were recently introduced in the algebraic
framework of quantum physics as a new constructive tool. It is shown here that
these convolutions provide isometric representations of Rieffel's strict
deformations of C*-dynamical systems with automorphic actions of R^n, whenever
the latter are presented in a covariant representation. Moreover, the device
can be used for the deformation of relativistic quantum field theories by
adjusting the convolutions to the geometry of Minkowski space. The resulting
deformed theories still comply with pertinent physical principles and their
Tomita-Takesaki modular data coincide with those of the undeformed theory; but
they are in general inequivalent to the undeformed theory and exhibit different
physical interpretations.
