We consider the large deviations of the smallest eigenvalue of the
Wishart-Laguerre Ensemble. Using the Coulomb gas picture we obtain rate
functions for the large fluctuations to the left and the right of the hard
edge. Our findings are compared with known exact results for $\beta=1$ finding
good agreement. We also consider the case of almost square matrices finding new
universal rate functions describing large fluctuations.
