We prove a multiplication theorem for quantum cluster algebras of acyclic
quivers. The theorem generalizes the multiplication formula for quantum cluster
variables in \cite{fanqin}. We apply the formula to construct some
$\mathbb{ZP}$-bases in quantum cluster algebras of finite and affine types.
Under the specialization $q$ and coefficients to $1$, these bases are the
integral bases of cluster algebra of finite and affine types (see \cite{CK1}
and \cite{DXX}).
