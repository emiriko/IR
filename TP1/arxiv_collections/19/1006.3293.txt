In supergravity where the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle
(LSP), the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) decays to the
gravitino with a naturally long lifetime (10^4 - 10^8). However, cosmological
constraints favour charged sleptons with lifetimes below a year as the natural
NLSP candidate. For this scenario we report a method to accurately determine
the slepton lifetime and SUSY cross-section from observation of the decays of
sleptons trapped in the material comprising the main detector (ATLAS, CMS). A
measurement of the lifetime to 5% is possible after 3 years at nominal
luminosity and running conditions. This method is sensitive to the
cosmologically preferred stau lifetime of ~37 days and does not require the use
of ancillary trapping volumes.
