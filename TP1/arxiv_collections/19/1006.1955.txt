Distribution of software development is becoming more and more common in
order to save the production cost and reduce the time to market. Large
geographical distance, different time zones and cultural differences in
distributed software development (DSD) leads to weak communication which
adversely affects the project. Using agile practices for distributed
development is also gaining momentum in various organizations to increase the
quality and performance of the project. This paper explores the intersection of
these two significant trends for software development i.e. DSD and agile. We
discuss the challenges faced by geographically distributed agile teams and
proven practices to address these issues, which will help in building a
successful distributed team.
