A fundamental result in representation theory is Kostant's theorem which
describes the algebra of polynomials on a reductive Lie algebra as a module
over its invariants. We prove a quantum analogue of this theorem for the
general linear group, and from this deduce the analogous result for reflection
equation algebras.
