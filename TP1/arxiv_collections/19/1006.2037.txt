We investigate wave-particle duality in a symmetric two-way interferometer
with a which-way detector. We find that it is important to state wether the
interfering object or the which-way detector is read out first. In case that
the interfering object is read out first, we discover that it is possible to
use the information about its state to increase the distinguishability to a
value which violates the widely accepted bounds set by an inequality introduced
by Jaeger et al. (PRA 51, 54) and Englert (PRL 77, 2154).
