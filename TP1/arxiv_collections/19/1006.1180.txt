From the explicit solutions of Maxwell's equations under the coordinate
transformation, the conditions for non-reflecting boundaries for the
two-dimensionally propagating light waves, in a finite-embedded coordinate
transformation metamaterial slab are derived in cases of extended
two-dimensional. By exploring several examples, including some reported in the
literatures and some novel developed in this study, we show that our approach
can be used to efficiently determine the condition in which a finite-embedded
coordinate transformed metamaterial slab is non-reflecting.
