We show that for a certain low frequency limit the wave equation of a generic
massive scalar field in the background of the spacelike warped AdS_3 black hole
can be written as the Casimir of an SL(2,R) symmetry. Two sets of SL(2,R)
generators are found which uncover the hidden SL(2,R)\times SL(2,R) symmetry of
the solution. This symmetry is only locally defined and is spontaneously broken
to U(1)\times U(1) by a periodic identification of the \phi coordinate. By
using the generator of the identification we read the left and right
temperatures (T_L,T_R) of the proposed dual conformal field theory which are in
complete agreement with the WAdS/CFT conjecture. Moreover, under the above
condition of the scalar wave frequency, absorption cross section of the scalar
field is consistent with the two-point function of the dual CFT.
