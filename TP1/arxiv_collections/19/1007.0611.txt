Springer varieties appear in both geometric representation theory and knot
theory. Motivated by knot theory and categorification Khovanov provides a
topological construction of $(n/2, n/2)$ Springer varieties. We extend
Khovanov's construction to all two-row Springer varieties. Using the
combinatorial and diagrammatic properties of this construction we provide a
particularly useful homology basis and construct the Springer representation
using this basis. We also provide a skein-theoretic formulation of the
representation in this case.
