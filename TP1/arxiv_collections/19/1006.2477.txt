The features of electromagnetic field of relativistic electrons passing
through a hole in an absorbing screen as a function of the distance from the
screen in range of radiation formation length were investigated. The analysis
of obtained results allows approving the existence of an unstable state of
electron with a particularly deprived its coulomb field, which turns into a
stable state of usual electron at a distance of a radiation formation length.
