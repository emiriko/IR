We present two new adaptive quadrature routines. Both routines differ from
previously published algorithms in many aspects, most significantly in how they
represent the integrand, how they treat non-numerical values of the integrand,
how they deal with improper divergent integrals and how they estimate the
integration error. The main focus of these improvements is to increase the
reliability of the algorithms without significantly impacting their efficiency.
Both algorithms are implemented in Matlab and tested using both the "families"
suggested by Lyness and Kaganove and the battery test used by Gander and
Gautschi and Kahaner. They are shown to be more reliable, albeit in some cases
less efficient, than other commonly-used adaptive integrators.
