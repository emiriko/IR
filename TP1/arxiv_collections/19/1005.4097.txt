This manuscript introduces a new analytical approach for studying the time
evolution of disease spread on a finite size network. Our methodology can
accommodate any disease with a general infectivity profile. This new approach
is able to incorporate the impact of a general intervention - at the population
level - in a number of different ways. Below, we discuss the details of the
equations involved and compare the outcomes of analytical calculation against
simulation results. We conclude with a discussion of possible extensions of
this methodology.
