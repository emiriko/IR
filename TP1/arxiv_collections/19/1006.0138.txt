The scientific objectives of the Lisa Technology Package (LTP) experiment, on
board of the LISA Pathfinder mission, demand for an accurate calibration and
validation of the data analysis tools in advance of the mission launch. The
levels of confidence required on the mission outcomes can be reached only with
an intense activity on synthetically generated data. A flexible procedure
allowing the generation of cross-correlated stationary noise time series was
set-up. Multi-channel time series with the desired cross correlation behavior
can be generated once a model for a multichannel cross-spectral matrix is
provided. The core of the procedure is the synthesis of a noise coloring
multichannel filter through a frequency-by-frequency eigendecomposition of the
model cross-spectral matrix and a Z-domain fit. The common problem of initial
transients in noise time series is solved with a proper initialization of the
filter recursive equations. The noise generator performances were tested in a
two dimensional case study of the LTP dynamics along the two principal channels
of the sensing interferometer.
