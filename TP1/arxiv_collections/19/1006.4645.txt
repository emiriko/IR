The sequential parameter optimization (SPOT) package for R is a toolbox for
tuning and understanding simulation and optimization algorithms. Model-based
investigations are common approaches in simulation and optimization. Sequential
parameter optimization has been developed, because there is a strong need for
sound statistical analysis of simulation and optimization algorithms. SPOT
includes methods for tuning based on classical regression and analysis of
variance techniques; tree-based models such as CART and random forest; Gaussian
process models (Kriging), and combinations of different meta-modeling
approaches. This article exemplifies how SPOT can be used for automatic and
interactive tuning.
