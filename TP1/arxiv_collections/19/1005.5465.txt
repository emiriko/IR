Hydroxyapatite (HAp) [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2] nanorods were synthesized using a
surfactant templating method, with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)
micelles acting as template for HAp growth. The effects of the sintering
temperature on the morphological and crystallographic characteristics and on
chemical composition of the "as-prepared" structures are discussed. The
experimental results show that low heat-treatment temperatures are preferred in
order to obtain high quality nanorods, with diameters ranging between 20 nm and
50 nm. High heat-treatment temperatures enhance the thermal decomposition of
HAp into other calcium phosphate compounds, and the sintering of particles into
micrometer ball-like structures. The stability of aqueous suspensions of HAp
nanorods is also discussed.
