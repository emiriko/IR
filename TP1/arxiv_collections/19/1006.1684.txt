Direct atomically resolved observation of dynamics deep in the glassy regime
has proved elusive for atomic and molecular glasses. Studies below the glass
transition temperature Tg are especially rare due to long waiting times
required to observe dynamics. Here we directly visualize surface glass dynamics
deep in the glassy regime. We analyze scanning tunneling microscopy movies of
the surface of metallic glasses with time resolution as fast as 1 minute and
extending up to 1,000 minutes. Rearrangements of surface cluster occur almost
exclusively by two-state hopping (P(3-state) ~ 0.06). All clusters are compact
structures with a width of 2-8 atomic spacings along the surface plane. The
two-state dynamics is both spatially and temporally heterogeneous. We estimate
an average activation free energy of 14 kBT for surface clusters.
