Authoring documents in MKM formats like OMDoc is a very tedious task. After
years of working on a semantically annotated corpus of sTeX documents (GenCS),
we identified a set of common, time-consuming subtasks, which can be supported
in an integrated authoring environment. We have adapted the modular Eclipse IDE
into sTeXIDE, an authoring solution for enhancing productivity in contributing
to sTeX based corpora. sTeXIDE supports context-aware command completion,
module management, semantic macro retrieval, and theory graph navigation.
