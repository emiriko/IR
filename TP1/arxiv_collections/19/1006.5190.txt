The graphite conductivity is evaluated for frequencies between
  0.1 eV, the energy of the order of the electron-hole overlap, and 1.5 eV, the
electron nearest hopping energy. The in-plane conductivity per single atomic
sheet is close to the universal graphene conductivity $e^2/4\hbar$ and,
however, contains a singularity conditioned by peculiarities of the electron
dispersion. The conductivity is less in the $c-$direction by the factor of the
order of 0.01 governed by electron hopping in this direction.
