We propose an unexplored quantization method. It is based on the assumption
of dynamical space-time intrinsic periodicities for relativistic fields, which
in turn can be regarded as dual to extra-dimensional fields. As a consequence
we obtain a unified and consistent interpretation of Special Relativity and
Quantum Mechanics in terms of Deterministic Geometrodynamics.
