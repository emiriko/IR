To study discrete dynamical systems of different types --- deterministic,
statistical and quantum --- we develop various approaches. We introduce the
concept of a system of discrete relations on an abstract simplicial complex and
develop algorithms for analysis of compatibility and construction of canonical
decompositions of such systems. To illustrate these techniques we describe
their application to some cellular automata. Much attention is paid to study
symmetries of the systems. In the case of deterministic systems, we reveale
some important relations between symmetries and dynamics. We demonstrate that
moving soliton-like structures arise inevitably in deterministic dynamical
system whose symmetry group splits the set of states into a finite number of
group orbits. We develop algorithms and programs exploiting discrete symmetries
to study microcanonical ensembles and search phase transitions in mesoscopic
lattice models. We propose an approach to quantization of discrete systems
based on introduction of gauge connection with values in unitary
representations of finite groups --- the elements of the connection are
interpreted as amplitudes of quantum transitions. We discuss properties of a
quantum description of finite systems. In particular, we demonstrate that a
finite quantum system can be embedded into a larger classical system. Computer
algebra and computational group theory methods were useful tools in our study.
