In previous work, we showed that the solution of certain systems of discrete
integrable equations, notably $Q$ and $T$-systems, is given in terms of
partition functions of positively weighted paths, thereby proving the positive
Laurent phenomenon of Fomin and Zelevinsky for these cases. This method of
solution is amenable to generalization to non-commutative weighted paths. Under
certain circumstances, these describe solutions of discrete evolution equations
in non-commutative variables: Examples are the corresponding quantum cluster
algebras [BZ], the Kontsevich evolution [DFK09b] and the $T$-systems themselves
[DFK09a]. In this paper, we formulate certain non-commutative integrable
evolutions by considering paths with non-commutative weights, together with an
evolution of the weights that reduces to cluster algebra mutations in the
commutative limit. The general weights are expressed as Laurent monomials of
quasi-determinants of path partition functions, allowing for a non-commutative
version of the positive Laurent phenomenon. We apply this construction to the
known systems, and obtain Laurent positivity results for their solutions in
terms of initial data.
