We present an adaptation, based on program extraction in elementary linear
logic, of Krivine & Leivant's system FA_2. This system allows to write
higher-order equations in order to specify the computational content of
extracted programs. The user can then prove a generic formula, using these
equations as axioms, whose proof can be extracted into programs that normalize
in elementary time and satisfy the specifications. Finally, we show that every
elementary recursive functions can be implemented in this system.
