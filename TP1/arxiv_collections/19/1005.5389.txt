Noticeable deviations from the prediction of the fiducial LCDM cosmology are
found in the angular power spectrum of the CMB. Besides large-angle anomalies,
the WMAP 1st year data revealed a dip in the power spectrum at l \sim 200,
which seemed to disappear in the 3rd year and subsequent angular power spectra.
Using the WMAP 1st, 3rd, and 5th year data as well as the 5 year coadded data,
we study the intensity and spatial distribution of this feature in order to
unveil its origin and its implications for the cosmological parameters. We show
that in all WMAP data releases there is a substantial suppression of the first
Doppler peak in a region near the north ecliptic pole.
