This paper describes the low temperature nuclear and magnetic structures of
La2O2Se2.Fe2O by analysis of X-ray and neutron diffraction data. The material
has been demonstrated to order antiferromagnetically at low temperatures, with
TN \approx 90 K a propagation vector of k = (1/2 0 1/2), resulting in a spin
arrangement similar to that in FeTe, despite there being no apparent lowering
in symmetry of the nuclear structure.
