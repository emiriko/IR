In a recent paper, Street et al. [Phys. Rev. B 81, 205307 (2010)] propose
first order recombination due to interface states to be the dominant loss
mechanism in organic bulk heterojunction solar cells, based on steady-state
current--voltage characteristics. By applying macroscopic simulations, we found
that under typical solar cell conditions, monomolecular or bimolecular
recombination cannot be inferred from the slope of the light intensity
dependent photocurrent. In addition, we discuss the validity of calculating a
mobility--lifetime product from steady-state measurements. We conclude that the
experimental technique applied by Street et al. is not sufficient to
unambiguously determine the loss mechanism.
