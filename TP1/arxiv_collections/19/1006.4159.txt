This paper presents applications of weighted meshless scheme for conservation
laws to the Euler equations and the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics.
The divergence constraint of the latter is maintained to the truncation error
by a new meshless divergence cleaning procedure. The physics of the interaction
between the particles is described by an one-dimensional Riemann problem in a
moving frame. As a result, necessary diffusion which is required to treat
dissipative processes is added automatically. As a result, our scheme has no
free parameters that controls the physics of inter-particle interaction, with
the exception of the number of the interacting neighbours which control the
resolution and accuracy. The resulting equations have the form similar to SPH
equations, and therefore existing SPH codes can be used to implement the
weighed particle scheme. The scheme is validated in several hydrodynamic and
MHD test cases. In particular, we demonstrate for the first time the ability of
a meshless MHD scheme to model magneto-rotational instability in accretion
disks.
