The perturbations of chirped dissipative solitons are analyzed in the
spectral domain. It is shown, that the structure of the perturbed chirped
dissipative soliton is highly nontrivial and has a tendency to an enhancement
of the spectral perturbations especially at the spectrum edges, where the
irregularities develop. Even spectrally localized perturbations spread over a
whole soliton spectrum. As a result of spectral irregularity, the chaotic
dynamics develops due to the spectral loss action. In particular, the
dissipative soliton can become fragmented though remains localized.
