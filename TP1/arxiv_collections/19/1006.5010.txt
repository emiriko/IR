We investigate the conductivity of graphene sheet deformed over a gate. The
effect of the deformation on the conductivity is twofold: The lattice
distortion can be represented as pseudovector potential in the Dirac equation
formalism, whereas the gate causes inhomogeneous density redistribution. We use
the elasticity theory to find the profile of the graphene sheet and then
evaluate the conductivity by means of the transfer matrix approach. We find
that the two effects provide functionally different contributions to the
conductivity. For small deformations and not too high residual stress the
correction due to the charge redistribution dominates and leads to the
enhancement of the conductivity. For stronger deformations, the effect of the
lattice distortion becomes more important and eventually leads to the
suppression of the conductivity. We consider homogeneous as well as local
deformation. We also suggest that the effect of the charge redistribution can
be best measured in a setup containing two gates, one fixing the overall charge
density and another one deforming graphene locally.
