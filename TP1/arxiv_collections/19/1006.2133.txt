Detailed schemes are investigated for experimental verification of Quantum
Zeno effect with a superconducting qubit. A superconducting qubit is affected
by a dephasing noise whose spectrum is 1/f, and so the decay process of a
superconducting qubit shows a naturally non-exponential behavior due to an
infinite correlation time of 1/f noise. Since projective measurements can
easily influence the decay dynamics having such non-exponential feature, a
superconducting qubit is a promising system to observe Quantum Zeno effect. We
have studied how a sequence of projective measurements can change the dephasing
process and also we have suggested experimental ways to observe Quantum Zeno
effect with a superconducting qubit. It would be possible to demonstrate our
prediction in the current technology.
