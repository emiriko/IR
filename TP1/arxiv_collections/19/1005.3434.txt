Let $f_1, ..., f_h$ be $h\ge 2$ germs of biholomorphisms of $\C^n$ fixing the
origin. We investigate the shape a (formal) simultaneous linearization of the
given germs can have, and we prove that if $f_1, ..., f_h$ commute and their
linear parts are almost simultaneously Jordanizable then they are
simultaneously formally linearizable. We next introduce a simultaneous
Brjuno-type condition and prove that, in case the linear terms of the germs are
diagonalizable, if the germs commutes and our Brjuno-type condition holds, then
they are holomorphically simultaneously linerizable. This answers to a
multi-dimensional version of a problem raised by Moser.
