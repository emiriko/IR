Extra vector-like matter with both electroweak-singlet masses and large
Yukawa couplings can significantly raise the lightest Higgs boson mass in
supersymmetry through radiative corrections. I consider models of this type
that involve a large Yukawa coupling between weak isotriplet and isodoublet
chiral supermultiplets. The particle content can be completed to provide
perturbative gauge coupling unification, in several different ways. The impact
on precision electroweak observables is shown to be acceptably small, even if
the new particles are as light as the current experimental bounds of order 100
GeV. I study the corrections to the lightest Higgs boson mass, and discuss the
general features of the collider signatures for the new fermions in these
models.
