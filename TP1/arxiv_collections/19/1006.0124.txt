Hall effect was studied on the single crystals of antiferromagnets PrB$_6$
and NdB$_6$ at temperatures 2K$<$T$<300$K in magnetic fields up to 8T using the
sample rotation technique. At low magnetic fields $\mu_0$H$\leq1$T Hall
coefficient R$_\mathrm{H}$, which is practically temperature independent in
paramagnetic state at 8K$\leq$T$\leq70$K, is characterized by the values of
R$_H$(PrB$_6$)$\sim-(4.2\pm0.1)\cdot10^{-4}$ cm$^3$/C and
R$_H$(NdB$_6$)$\sim-(4.1\pm0.1)\cdot10^{-4}$ cm$^3$/C. Rather different
behaviour of R$_H$ is observed in antiferromagnetic (AF) phases of these
hexaborides. For PrB$_6$ the decrease of temperature below T$_N\approx6.7$K is
accompanied by a noticeable ($\Delta R_H/R_H\sim10%$) elevation of
R$_H$($\mu_0$H$=1$T) to the values of $-(3.8\pm0.1)\cdot10^{-4}$ cm$^3$/C. On
the contrary, the low field Hall coefficient in NdB$_6$ diminishes by about 15%
reaching the value R$_H\approx-(4.7\pm0.1)\cdot10^{-4}$ cm$^3$/C in AF state at
2.5K. The increase of magnetic field inducing magnetic transition in the
commensurate magnetic phase of PrB$_6$ results in essential R$_H$ changes (up
to 10%) at liquid helium temperatures. The anomalous behaviour of the charge
transport parameters for RB$_6$ (R=Pr, Nd) found in vicinity of Neel
temperature suggests the possible effect of $5d$-states spin density
polarization of both in AF and paramagnetic states of the compounds under
investigation.
