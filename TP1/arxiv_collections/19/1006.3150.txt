We solved the equilibrium meanfield equation of state of Ising ferromagnet
(obtained from Bragg-Williams theory) by Newton-Raphson method. The number of
iterations required to get a convergent solution (within a specified accuracy)
of equilibrium magnetisation, at any particular temperature, is observed to
diverge in a power law fashion as the temperature approaches the critical
value. This was identified as the critical slowing down. The exponent is also
estimated. This value of the exponent is compared with that obtained from
analytic solution. Besides this, the numerical results are also compared with
some experimental results exhibiting satisfactory degree of agreement. It is
observed from this study that the information of the invariance of time scale
at the critical point is present in the meanfield equilibrium equation of state
of Ising ferromagnet.
