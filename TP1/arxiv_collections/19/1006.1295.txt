We report the first experimental observations of strong suppression of
matter-wave superradiance using blue-detuned pump light and demonstrate a
pump-laser detuning asymmetry in the collective atomic recoil motion. In
contrast to all previous theoretical frameworks, which predict that the process
should be symmetric with respect to the sign of the pump-laser detuning, we
find that for condensates the symmetry is broken. With high condensate
densities and red-detuned light, the familiar distinctive multi-order,
matter-wave scattering pattern is clearly visible, whereas with blue-detuned
light superradiance is strongly suppressed. In the limit of a dilute atomic
gas, however, symmetry is restored.
