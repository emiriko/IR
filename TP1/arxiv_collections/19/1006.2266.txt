GAW (Gamma Air Watch) is a pathfinder experiment in the TeV range to test the
feasibility of a new generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes
(IACT). It combines high flux sensitivity with large field-of-view (FoV=24deg x
24deg) using Fresnel lenses, stereoscopic observational approach and
single-photon counting mode. This particular counting mode, in comparison with
the usual charge integration one, allows the triggering of events with a
smaller number of collected Cherenkov photons keeping a good signal/background
separation. GAW is conceived as an array of three identical imaging telescopes
with 2.13 m diameter placed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle of 80 m
side. The telescope will be built at the Calar Alto Observatory site (Sierra de
Los Filabres - Almeria Spain, 2168 m a.s.l.) and is a joint effort of research
institutes in Italy, Portugal and Spain. The main characteristics of the
experiment will be reported.
