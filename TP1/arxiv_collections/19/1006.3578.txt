We report what we believe is the first experimental limit placed on plant
biomagnetism. Measurements with a sensitive atomic magnetometer were performed
on the Titan arum (Amorphophallus titanum) inflorescence, known for its fast
bio-chemical processes while blooming. We find that the surface magnetic field
from these processes, projected along the Earth's magnetic field, and measured
at the surface of the plant, is less then ~0.6uG.
