We find two involutions on partitions that lead to partition identities for
Ramanujan's third order mock theta functions $\phi(-q)$ and $\psi(-q)$. We also
give an involution for Fine's partition identity on the mock theta function
f(q). The two classical identities of Ramanujan on third order mock theta
functions are consequences of these partition identities. Our combinatorial
constructions also apply to Andrews' generalizations of Ramanujan's identities.
