(abridged) We study the hydrodynamic evolution of a non-spherical
core-collapse supernova in two spatial dimensions. We find that our model
displays a strong tendency to expand toward the pole. We demonstrate that this
expansion is a physical property of the low-mode, SASI instability. The SASI
leaves behind a large lateral velocity gradient in the post shock layer which
affects the evolution for minutes and hours later. This results in a prolate
deformation of the ejecta and a fast advection of Ni-rich material from
moderate latitudes to the polar regions. This effect might actually be
responsible for the global asymmetry of the nickel lines in SN 1987A. The
simulations demonstrate that significant radial and lateral motions in the
post-shock region, produced by convective overturn and the SASI during the
early explosion phase, contribute to the evolution for minutes and hours after
shock revival. They lead to both later clump formation, and a significant
prolate deformation of the ejecta which are observed even as late as one week
after the explosion. As pointed out recently by Kjaer et al., such an ejecta
morphology is in good agreement with the observational data of SN 1987A.
Systematic future studies are needed to investigate how the SASI-induced
late-time lateral expansion depends on the dominant mode of the SASI, and to
which extent it is affected by the dimensionality of the simulations. The
impact on and importance of the SASI for the distribution of iron group nuclei
and the morphology of the young SNR argues for future three-dimensional
explosion and post-explosion studies on singularity-free grids that cover the
entire sphere. Given the results of our 2D resolution study, present 3D
simulations must be regarded as underresolved, and their conclusions must be
verified by a proper numerical convergence analysis in three dimensions.
