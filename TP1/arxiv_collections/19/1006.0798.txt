We investigate the self-similar evolution of the transient energy spectrum
which precedes the establishment of the Kolmogorov spectrum in homogeneous
isotropic turbulence in three dimensions using the EDQNM closure model. The
transient evolution exhibits self-similarity of the second kind and has a
non-trivial dynamical scaling exponent which results in the transient spectrum
having a scaling which is steeper than the Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum.
Attempts to detect a similar phenomenon in DNS data are inconclusive owing to
the limited range of scales available.
