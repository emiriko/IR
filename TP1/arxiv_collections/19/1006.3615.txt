Half-life number sequences collected from nuclear data charts are found to
obey the Newcomb-Benford law. Based on this fact, it has been suggested
recently, that this law should be used to test the quality of nuclear decay
models. In this paper we briefly recall how, when and why the Newcomb-Benford
law can be observed in a set of numbers with a given probability distribution.
We investigate the special case of nuclear half-lives, and show that the law
provides no additional clue in understanding decay half-lives. Thus, it can
play no significant role in testing nuclear decay theories.
