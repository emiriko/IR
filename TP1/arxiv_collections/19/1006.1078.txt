We introduce a method to discover the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) through its decay to W^+W^-, where one boson decays to leptons,
and the other decays to c+jet. This mechanism is complementary to the decay
into dileptons, but has the potential to measure the invariant mass peak of the
Higgs boson, and to avoid large recently discovered QCD backgrounds from heavy
flavor decays. In addition, this mechanism motivates the study and creation of
a dedicated charm jet tagger at LHC experiments. Existing charm jet tagging, in
the form of fakes to bottom jet tagging, provides sensitivity to a standard
model Higgs boson that is comparable to WW fusion. A 50% charm tagging
efficiency in the relevant kinematic range could allow an independent 5-sigma
discovery of a 165 GeV Higgs boson in 7 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity at a 14
TeV machine, or exclusion with a 7 TeV collider.
