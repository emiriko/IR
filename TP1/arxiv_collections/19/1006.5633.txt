We present MCdevelop, a universal computer framework for developing and
exploiting the wide class of Stochastic Simulations (SS) software. This
powerful universal SS software development tool has been derived from a series
of scientific projects for precision calculations in high energy physics (HEP),
which feature a wide range of functionality in the SS software needed for
advanced precision Quantum Field Theory calculations for the past LEP
experiments and for the ongoing LHC experiments at CERN, Geneva. MCdevelop is a
"spin-off" product of HEP to be exploited in other areas, while it will still
serve to develop new SS software for HEP experiments. Typically SS involve
independent generation of large sets of random "events", often requiring
considerable CPU power. Since SS jobs usually do not share memory it makes them
easy to parallelize. The efficient development, testing and running in parallel
SS software requires a convenient framework to develop software source code,
deploy and monitor batch jobs, merge and analyse results from multiple parallel
jobs, even before the production runs are terminated. Throughout the years of
development of stochastic simulations for HEP, a sophisticated framework
featuring all the above mentioned functionality has been implemented. MCdevelop
represents its latest version, written mostly in C++ (GNU compiler gcc). It
uses Autotools to build binaries (optionally managed within the KDevelop 3.5.3
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) ). It uses the open-source ROOT
package for histogramming, graphics and the mechanism of persistency for the
C++ objects. MCdevelop helps to run multiple parallel jobs on any computer
cluster with NQS-type batch system.
