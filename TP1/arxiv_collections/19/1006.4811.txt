Assuming the lightest neutralino solely composes the cosmic dark matter, we
examine the constraints of the CDMS-II and XENON100 dark matter direct searches
on the parameter space of the MSSM Higgs sector. We find that the current
CDMS-II/XENON100 limits can exclude some of the parameter space which survive
the constraints from the dark matter relic density and various collider
experiments. We also find that in the currently allowed parameter space, the
charged Higgs boson is hardly accessible at the LHC for an integrated
luminosity of 30 fb^{-1}, while the neutral non-SM Higgs bosons (H,A) may be
accessible in some allowed region characterized by a large \mu. The future
XENON100 (6000 kg-days exposure) will significantly tighten the parameter space
in case of nonobservation of dark matter, further shrinking the likelihood of
discovering the non-SM Higgs bosons at the LHC.
