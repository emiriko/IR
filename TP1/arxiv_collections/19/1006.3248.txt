In the context of the local gauge group $SU(3)_c\otimes SU(3)_L\otimes
U(1)_X$, we look for possible four family models, where all the particles carry
ordinary electric charges. Thirteen different anomaly-free fermion structures
emerge, out of which only two are realistic. For the simplest physical
structure, we calculate the charged and neutral weak currents and the
tree-level Fermion masses. We also look for new sources of flavor changing
neutral currents in the quark sector, in connection with the upcoming
experimental results at the Large Hadron Collider.
