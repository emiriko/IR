We study the potential to use measurements of extra neutral gauge bosons (Z')
properties in pp collisions at the Large Hadron Collider to unravel the
underlying physics. We focus on the usefulness of third generation final states
(tau, b, t) in distinguishing between models with non-universal Z'-fermion
couplings. We present an update of discovery limits of Z's including the
2010-2011 LHC run and include models with non-universal couplings. We show how
ratios of sigma(pp -> Z' -> ttbar), sigma(pp -> Z' -> bbbar), and sigma(pp ->
Z' -> tau^+tau^-) to sigma(pp -> Z' -> mu^+mu^-) can be used to distinguish
between models and measure parameters of the models. Of specific interest are
models with preferential couplings, such as models with generation dependent
couplings. We also find that forward-backward asymmetry measurements with third
generation fermions in the final state could provide important input to
understanding the nature of the Z'. Understanding detector resolution and
efficiencies will be crucial for extracting results.
