We demonstrate that intensity correlations of second order in the
fluorescence light of N > 2 single- photon emitters may violate locality while
the visibility of the signal remains below 71%. For this, we derive a
homogeneous Bell-Wigner-type inequality, which can be applied to a broad class
of experimental setups. We trace the violation of this inequality back to path
entanglement created by the process of detection.
