Using a ladder-rainbow kernel previously established for the soft scale of
light quark hadrons, we explore, within a Dyson-Schwinger approach, phenomena
that mix soft and hard scales of QCD. The difference between vector and axial
vector current correlators is examined to estimate the four quark chiral
condensate and the leading distance scale for the onset of non-perturbative
phenomena in QCD. The valence quark distributions, in the pion and kaon,
defined in deep inelastic scattering, and measured in the Drell Yan process,
are investigated with the same ladder-rainbow truncation of the Dyson-Schwinger
and Bethe-Salpeter equations.
