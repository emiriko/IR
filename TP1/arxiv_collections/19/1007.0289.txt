Organometallic complexes have potential applications as the optically active
components of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics
(OPV). Development of more effective complexes may be aided by understanding
their excited state properties. Here we discuss two key theoretical approaches
to investigate these complexes: first principles atomistic models and effective
Hamiltonian models. We review applications of these methods, such as,
determining the nature of the emitting state, predicting the fraction of
injected charges that form triplet excitations, and explaining the sensitivity
of device performance to small changes in the molecular structure of the
organometallic complexes.
