We use quantum diffusive trajectories to prove that the time evolution of
two-qubit entanglement under spontaneous emission can be fully characterized by
optimal continuous monitoring. We analytically determine this optimal
unraveling and derive a deterministic evolution equation for the system's
concurrence. Furthermore, we propose an experiment to monitor the entanglement
dynamics in bipartite two-level systems and to determine the disentanglement
time from a single trajectory.
