Rectified diameters and albedo estimates of 1517 main belt asteroid selected
from the IRAS and MSX asteroid photometry catalogues are derived from updated
infrared thermal models, the Standard Thermal Model (STM) and the Near Earth
Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM), and Monte Carlo simulations, using new Minor
Planet Center (MPC) compilations of absolute magnitudes (H-values) constrained
by occultation and radar derived parameters. The NEATM approach produces a more
robust estimate of albedos and diameters, yielding albedos of $p_{v}$(NEATM
mean)$=0.081 \pm 0.064$. The asteroid beaming parameter ($\eta$) for the
selected asteroids has a mean value of $1.07 \pm 0.27$, and the smooth
distribution of $\eta$ suggests that this parameter is independent of asteroid
properties such as composition. No trends in $\eta$ due to size-dependent
rotation rates are evident. Comparison of derived $\eta$'s as a function of
taxonomic type indicates the beaming parameter values for S-type and C-type
asteroids are identical within the standard deviation of the population of
beaming parameters.
