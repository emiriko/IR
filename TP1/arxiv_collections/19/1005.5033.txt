The subject of this study is the long-time equilibration dynamics of a
strongly disordered one-dimensional chain of coupled weakly anharmonic
classical oscillators. It is argued that chaos in this system has a very
particular spatial structure: it can be viewed as a dilute gas of chaotic
spots. Each chaotic spot corresponds to a stochastic pump which drives the
Arnold diffusion of the oscillators surrounding it, thus leading to their
relaxation and thermalization. The most important mechanism of relaxation at
long distances is provided by random migration of the chaotic spots along the
chain, which bears analogy with variable-range hopping of electrons in strongly
disordered solids. The cor- resonding macroscopic transport equations are
obtained.
