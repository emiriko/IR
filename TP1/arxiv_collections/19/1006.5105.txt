Let E/Q be a real quadratic field and pi_0 a cuspidal, irreducible,
automorphic representation of GL(2,A_E) with trivial central character and
infinity type (2,2n+2) for some non-negative integer n. We show that there
exists a non-zero Siegel paramodular newform F with weight, level, Hecke
eigenvalues, epsilon factor and L-function determined explicitly by pi_0. We
tabulate these invariants in terms of those of pi_0 for every rational prime p.
