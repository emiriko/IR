In this paper,a new design of wireless sensor network (WSN)node is discussed
which is based on components with ultra low power.We ha e de eloped a Low cost
and low power WSN Node using MSP430 and nRF24L01.The architectural circuit
details are presented.This architecture fulfils the requirements like low
cost,low power,compact size and self organization.Various tests are carried out
to test the performance of the nRF24L01 module.The packet loss,free Space loss
(FSL)and battery lifetime calculations are described.These test results will
help the researchers to build new applications using abo e node and to work
efficiently with nRF24L01.
