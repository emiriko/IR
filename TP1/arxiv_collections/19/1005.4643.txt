We investigate the relativistic equation of state of hadronic matter and
quark-gluon plasma at finite temperature and baryon density in the framework of
the nonextensive statistical mechanics, characterized by power-law quantum
distributions. We study the phase transition from hadronic matter to
quark-gluon plasma by requiring the Gibbs conditions on the global conservation
of baryon number and electric charge fraction. We show that nonextensive
statistical effects play a crucial role in the equation of state and in the
formation of mixed phase also for small deviations from the standard
Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics.
