The ever-increasing complexity of software systems makes them hard to
comprehend, predict and tune due to emergent properties and non-deterministic
behaviour. Complexity arises from the size of software systems and the wide
variety of possible operating environments: the increasing choice of platforms
and communication policies leads to ever more complex performance
characteristics. In addition, software systems exhibit different behaviour
under different workloads. Many software systems are designed to be
configurable so that policies can be chosen to meet the needs of various
stakeholders. For complex software systems it can be difficult to accurately
predict the effects of a change and to know which configuration is most
appropriate. This thesis demonstrates that it is useful to run automated
experiments that measure a selection of system configurations. Experiments can
find configurations that meet the stakeholders' needs, find interesting
behavioural characteristics, and help produce predictive models of the system's
behaviour. The design and use of ACT (Automated Configuration Tool) for running
such experiments is described, in combination a number of search strategies for
deciding on the configurations to measure. Design Of Experiments (DOE) is
discussed, with emphasis on Taguchi Methods. These statistical methods have
been used extensively in manufacturing, but have not previously been used for
configuring software systems. The novel contribution here is an industrial case
study, applying the combination of ACT and Taguchi Methods to DC-Directory, a
product from Data Connection Ltd (DCL). The case study investigated the
applicability of Taguchi Methods for configuring complex software systems.
Taguchi Methods were found to be useful for modelling and configuring DC-
Directory, making them a valuable addition to the techniques available to
system administrators and developers.
