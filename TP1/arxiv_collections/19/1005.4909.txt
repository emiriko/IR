The state-dependence of the enhancement of the electron-positron momentum
density is investigated for some transition and simple metals (Cr, V, Ag and
Al). Quantitative comparison with linearized muffin-tin orbital calculations of
the corresponding quantity in the first Brillouin zone is shown to yield a
measurement of the enhancement of the s, p and d states, independent of any
parameterizations in terms of the electron density local to the positron. An
empirical correction that can be applied to a first-principles state-dependent
model is proposed that reproduces the measured state-dependence very well,
yielding a general, predictive model for the enhancement of the momentum
distribution of positron annihilation measurements, including those of angular
correlation and coincidence Doppler broadening techniques.
