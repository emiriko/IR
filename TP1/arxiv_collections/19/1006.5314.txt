The general formalism of the multipolar expansion of electrostatic
interactions is applied to the calculation the potential energy between an
excited atom (without fine structure) and a ground state diatomic molecule at
large separations. Both partners exhibit a permanent quadrupole moment, so that
their mutual quadrupole-quadrupole long-range interaction is attractive enough
to bind trimers. Numerical results are given for an excited Cs(6P) atom and a
ground state Cs2 molecule. The prospects for achieving photoassociation of a
cold atom/dimer pair is thus discussed and found promising. The formalism can
be easily generalized to the long-range interaction between molecules to
investigate the formation of cold tetramers.
