We reply to Jacek Dziarmaga, Piotr Deuar, and Krzysztof Sacha's comment,
arXiv:1001.1045, supporting the authors' simulations but differentiating
between near-mean-field and strongly quantum regimes. We clarify that we have
three lines of evidence on decay of dark solitons and connect our work to
Lieb's Type-II excitations and the true meaning of a quantum dark soliton.
