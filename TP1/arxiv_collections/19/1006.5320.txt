I consider some of the challenges and opportunities facing helio- and
asteroseismology, which reflect major themes of presentation and discussion
from the HELAS IV international conference "Seismological Challenges for
Stellar Structure". I concentrate in particular on the exciting prospects for
asteroseismology, now that the field is being provided with data of
unprecedented quality and in unprecedented volumes.
