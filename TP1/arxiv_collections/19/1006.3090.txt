We discuss the impact of anomalous WW$\gamma$ and WWZ couplings on WZ+jet
production at next-to-leading order QCD, including full leptonic decays of the
electroweak gauge bosons. While the inclusive hadronic cross sections do not
exhibit any particular sensitivity to anomalous couplings once the residual QCD
scale uncertainties are taken into account, the transverse momentum
distributions show substantial deviations from the Standard Model, provided
that the anomalous vertices are probed at large enough momentum transfers.
