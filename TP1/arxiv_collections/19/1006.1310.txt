We have considered linear kinetic theory including the electron spin
properties in a magnetized plasma. The starting point is a mean field
Vlasov-like equation, derived from a fully quantum mechanical treatment, where
effects from the electron spin precession and the magnetic dipole force is
taken into account. The general conductivity tensor is derived, including both
the free current contribution, as well as the magnetization current associated
with the spin contribution. We conclude the paper with an extensive discussion
of the quantum-mechanical boundary where we list parameter conditions that must
be satisfied for various quantum effects to be influential.
