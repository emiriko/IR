Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we find a
strong position and thickness dependence of the formation energy of oxygen
vacancies in LaAlO3|SrTiO3 (LAO|STO) multilayers and interpret this with an
analytical capacitor model. Oxygen vacancies are preferentially formed at
p-type SrO|AlO2 rather than at n-type LaO|TiO2 interfaces; the excess electrons
introduced by the oxygen vacancies reduce their energy by moving to the n-type
interface. This asymmetric behavior makes an important contribution to the
conducting (insulating) nature of n-type (p-type) interfaces while providing a
natural explanation for the failure to detect evidence for the polar
catastrophe in the form of core level shifts.
