Influenza Pandemic of 1957-1958, also called Asian Flu Pandemic, was one of
the most widespread pandemics in history. In this paper, we model the pandemic,
considering the effect of the Cold War. There were some restrictions between
Western and Eastern nations due to the Cold War during the pandemic. We expect
that such restrictions influenced the spread of the pandemic. We propose a
hybrid model to determine how the pandemic spread through the world. The model
combines the SEIR-based model for local areas and the network model for global
connection between countries. First, we reproduce the situation in 19
countries. Then, we run another experiment to find the influence of the war in
the spread of the pandemic; simulation considering international relationships
in different years. The simulation results show that the impact of the pandemic
in each country was much influenced by international relationships. This study
indicates that if there was less effect of the Cold War, Western nations would
have larger number of death cases, Eastern nations would have smaller number of
death cases, and the world impact would be increased somewhat.
