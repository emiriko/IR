One-matrix model in $p$-critical point on torus is considered. The generating
function of correlation numbers in genus one is evaluated and used for
computation correlation numbers in KdV and CFT frames. It is shown that the
correlation numbers in KdV frame in genus one satisfy the Witten topological
gravity recurrence relations.
