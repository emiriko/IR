The detector contains four or more layers of natural Boron absorbing thermal
neutrons. Thickness of a layer is 0.4 - 1.2 mg/cm2. The layers are deposited on
one or on both sides of a metal surface used as contacts. Between the absorbing
layers there are gas-filled gaps 3 - 6 mm thick. Electric field of 100 - 200
V/cm is applied to the gas-filled gaps. Natural Boron contains almost 20% of
10B isotope. When atoms of 10B capture a thermal neutron, nuclear reaction
occurs, as a result of which two heavy particles - alpha particle and ion 7Li -
from the thin absorber layer are emitted in opposing sides. One of the two
particles penetrates into gas-filled gap between Boron layers and ionizes the
gas. An impulse of electric current is created in the gas-filled gap actuated
by the applied electric field. The impulse is registered by an electronic
circuit. We have made and tested detectors containing from two to sixteen
layers of natural Boron with an efficiency of thermal neutron registration from
2.9% to 12.5% accordingly.
