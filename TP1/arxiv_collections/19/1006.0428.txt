We consider in this paper travelling wave solutions to stochastic partial
differential equations and corresponding wave speed. As a particular example we
consider the Nagumo equation with multiplicative noise which we mainly consider
in the Stratonovich sense. A standard approach to determine the position and
hence speed of a wave is to compute the evolution of a level set. We compare
this approach against an alternative where the wave position is found by
minimizing the $L^2$ norm against a fixed profile. This approach can also be
used to stop (or freeze) the wave and obtain a stochastic partial differential
algebraic equation that we then discretize and solve. Although attractive as it
leads to a smaller domain size it can be numerically unstable due to large
convection terms. We compare numerically the different approaches for
estimating the wave speed. Minimization against a fixed profile works well
provided the support of the reference function is not too narrow. We then use
these techniques to investigate the effect of both \Ito and Stratonovich noise
on the Nagumo equation as correlation length and noise intensity increases.
