We present a study of the motion of compact jet components in quasar B3
1633+382. Through analyzing 14 epochs of VLBI observations of three components
(B1, B2, and B3) at 22 GHz, we find two different possibilities of component
classification. Thus two corresponding kinematical models can be adopted to
explain the evolutionary track of components. One is a linear motion, while
another is a helical model. Future observations are needed to provide new
kinematical constraints for the motion of these components in this source.
