Pandemics have the potential to cause immense disruption and damage to
communities and societies. In this paper, we model the Influenza Pandemic of
2009. We propose a hybrid model to determine how the pandemic spreads through
the world. The model considers both the SEIR-based model for local areas and
the network model for global connection between countries referring to data on
international travelers. Our interest is to reproduce the situation using the
data of early stage of pandemic and to predict the future transition by
extending the simulation cycle. Without considering the tendency of seasonal
flu, the simulation does not predict the second peak of the pandemic in the
real world. However, considering the seasonal tendency, the simulation result
predicts the next peak in winter. Thus we consider the seasonal tendency is an
important factor for the spreading of the pandemic.
