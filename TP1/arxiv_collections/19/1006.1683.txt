Unified modelling language (UML) 2.0 introduced in 2002 has been developing
and influencing object-oriented software engineering and has become a standard
and reference for information system analysis and design modelling. There are
many concepts and theories to model the information system or software
application with UML 2.0, which can make ambiguities and inconsistencies for a
novice to learn to how to model the system with UML especially with UML 2.0.
This article will discuss how to model the simple software application by using
some of the diagrams of UML 2.0 and not by using the whole diagrams as
suggested by agile methodology. Agile methodology is considered as convenient
for novices because it can deliver the information technology environment to
the end-user quickly and adaptively with minimal documentation. It also has the
ability to deliver best performance software application according to the
customer's needs. Agile methodology will make simple model with simple
documentation, simple team and simple tools.
