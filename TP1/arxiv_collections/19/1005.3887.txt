The electronic structure of charybdotoxin (ChTX), a scorpion venom peptide
that is known to act as a potassium channel blocker, is investigated with the
aid of quantum mechanical calculations. The dipole moment vector (145 D) of
ChTX can be stirred by the full length KcsA potassium channel's macrodipole
(403 D) thereby assuming the proper orientation before binding the ion channel
on the cell surface. The localization of the frontier orbitals of ChTX has been
revealed for the first time. HOMO is localized on Trp14 while the three
lowest-energy MOs (LUMO, LUMO+1, and LUMO+2) are localized on the three
disulfide bonds that characterize this pepetide. An effective way to engineer
the HOMO-LUMO (H-L) gap of ChTX is that of replacing its Trp14 residue with
Ala14 whereas deletion of the LUMO-associated disulfide bond with the insertion
of a pair of L-alpha-aminobutyric acid residues does not affect the H-L energy
gap.
