Let G be a general linear group over a p-adic field and let D^* be an
anisotropic inner form of G. The Jacquet-Langlands correspondence between
irreducible complex representations of D^* and discrete series of G does not
behave well with respect to reduction modulo l\neq p. However we show that the
Langlands-Jacquet transfer, from the Grothendieck group of admissible l-adic
representations of G to that of D^* is compatible with congruences and reduces
modulo l to a similar transfer for l-modular representations, which moreover
can be characterized by some Brauer characters identities. Studying more
carefully this transfer, we deduce a bijection between irreducible l-modular
representations of D^* and "super-Speh" l-modular representations of G. Via
reduction mod l, this latter bijection is compatible with the classical
Jacquet-Langlands correspondence composed with the Zelevinsky involution. Our
arguments rely on Vigneras' classification of representations of G. Finally we
discuss the question whether our Langlands-Jacquet transfer sends irreducibles
to effective virtual representations up to a sign. This presumably boils down
to some unknown properties of parabolic affine Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.
