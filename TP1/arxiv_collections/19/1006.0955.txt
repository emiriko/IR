A common model invoked to describe the X-ray spectra of active galaxies
includes a relativistically blurred reflection component, which in some cases
can be the dominant contributor to the received flux. Alternative
interpretations are often based around complex absorption, and to date it has
proven difficult to determine between these two viable models. Recent works on
SUZAKU observations of the active nuclei in NGC 1365, 1H 0419-577 and PDS 456
have found the presence of strong X-ray emission at high (~10-50 keV) energies,
referred to as 'hard excesses', and it has been claimed this emission cannot be
explained with simple disc reflection models. Here we investigate the high
energy emission in these sources by constructing disc reflection models and
show that they can successfully reproduce the observed spectra. In addition, we
find the behaviour of NGC 1365 and 1H 0419-577 in these observations to be
broadly consistent with previous work on disc reflection interpretations.
