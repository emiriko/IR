We have studied selected rare earth doped and transition metal doped CeFe2
compounds by examining their structural, magnetic and magneto-thermal
properties. With substitution of Ce by 5 and 10% Gd and 10% Ho, the Curie
temperature can be tuned to the range of 267-318 K. Localization of Ce 4f
electronic state with rare earth substitutions is attributed for the
enhancement of Curie temperature. On the other hand, with Ga and Al
substitution at the Fe site, system undergoes paramagnetic to ferromagnetic
transition and then to an antiferromagnetic phase on cooling. The
magnetocaloric effect across the transitions has been studied from both
magnetization isotherms and heat capacity data. It is shown that by choosing
the appropriate dopant and its concentration, the magnetocaloric effect around
room temperature can be tuned.
