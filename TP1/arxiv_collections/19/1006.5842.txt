We demonstrate fast initialization of a single hole spin captured in an
InGaAs quantum dot with a fidelity F>99% by applying a magnetic field parallel
to the growth direction. We show that the fidelity of the hole spin, prepared
by ionization of a photo-generated electron-hole pair, is limited by the
precession of the exciton spin due to the anisotropic exchange interaction.
