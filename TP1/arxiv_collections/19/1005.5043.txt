We investigate electronic transport in a three-terminal hybrid system,
composed by an interacting quantum dot tunnel coupled to one superconducting,
one ferromagnetic, and one normal lead. Despite the tendency of the charging
energy to suppress the superconducting proximity effect when the quantum dot is
in equilibrium, the non-equilibrium proximity effect can give rise to a large
Andreev current. The presence of the ferromagnet can lead to a finite spin
accumulation on the dot. We find that the interplay of the Andreev current and
spin accumulation can generate a pure spin current, with no associated charge
transport, in the normal lead. This situation is realised by tuning the
quantum-dot spectrum by means of a gate voltage.
