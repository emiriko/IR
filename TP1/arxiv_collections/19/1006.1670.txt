Much of modern string theory research concerns AdS/CFT duality, or more
generally, gauge/gravity duality. The main subjects are a) Testing and
understanding such dualities by exploring how they work for systems with a lot
of supersymmetry b) Constructing and exploring approximate string theory duals
of QCD c) Applying gauge/gravity duality to other areas of physics such as
condensed matter and nuclear physics. I will briefly discuss the first topic.
