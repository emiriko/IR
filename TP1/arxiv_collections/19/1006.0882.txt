Not much is known about the dynamics outside the support of the maximal
entropy measure $\mu$ for holomorphic endomorphisms of $\mathbb{CP}^k$. In this
article we study the structure of the dynamics on the Julia set, which is
typically larger than $Supp(\mu)$. The Julia set is the support of the
so-called Green current $T$, so it admits a natural filtration by the supports
of the exterior powers of $T$. For $1\leq q \leq k$, let $J_q= Supp(T^q)$. We
show that for a generic point of $J_q\setminus J_{q+1}$ there are at least
$(k-q)$ "Fatou directions" in the tangent space. We also give estimates for the
rate of expansion in directions transverse to the Fatou directions.
