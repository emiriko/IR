We report two analytical bounds for quantum error-correcting codes that do
not have preexisting classical counterparts. Firstly the quantum Hamming and
Singleton bounds are combined into a single tighter bound, and then the
combined bound is further strengthened via the well-known Lloyd's theorem in
classical coding theory, which claims that perfect codes, codes attaining the
Hamming bound, do not exist if the Lloyd's polynomial has some non-integer
zeros. Our bound characterizes quantitatively the improvement over the Hamming
bound via the non-integerness of the zeros of the Lloyd's polynomial. In the
case of 1-error correcting codes our bound holds true for impure codes as well,
which we conjecture to be always true, and for stabilizer codes there is a
1-logical-qudit improvement for an infinite family of lengths.
