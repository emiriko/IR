Recently, a new quantization method for gauge theories was proposed, in which
no gauge fixing is required but the constraints are kept. Here we successfully
applied this formalism to Nambu-Goto action in any dimensions. The result of
our theoretical calculation have shown striking agreement with the spectrum of
the light-quark mesons.
