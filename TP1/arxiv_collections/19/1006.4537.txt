The increasing demand for reliable Web applications gives a central role to
Web testing. Most of the existing works are focused on the definition of novel
testing techniques, specifically tailored to the Web. However, no attempt was
carried out so far to understand the specific nature of Web faults. This paper
presents a user session based testing technique that clusters user sessions
based on the service profile and selects a set of representative user sessions
from each cluster and tailored by augmentation with additional requests to
cover the dependence relationships between web pages. The created suite not
only can significantly reduce the size of the collected user sessions, also
viable to exercise fault sensitive paths. The results demonstrate that our
approach consistently detected the majority of known faults using a relatively
small number of test cases and will be a powerful system when more and more
user sessions are being clustered.
