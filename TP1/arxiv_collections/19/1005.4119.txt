Both explicit analysis and FEM numerical simulation are used to analyze the
field distribution of a line current in the so-called Maxwell's fish eye lens,
which has been claimed recently to be able to achieve perfect imaging. We show
that such a Maxwell's fish eye lens cannot give perfect imaging due to the fact
that high order modes of the object field can hardly reach the image point in
the Maxwell's fish eye. If only zero order mode is excited, a subwavelength
image can be achieved, however, its spot-size is larger than the spot size of
the source field. The image resolution is determined by the field spot size of
the image corresponding to the zeroth order component of the object field. Our
explicit analysis consists very well with the FEM results for a modified fish
eye bounded with perfectly electrical conductor (PEC). Explicit condition is
given for achieving a subwavelength image. When this condition is not
satisfied, a single line current source may give multiple image spots.
