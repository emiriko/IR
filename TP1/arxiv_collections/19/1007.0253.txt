Given a rational monomial map, we consider the question of finding a toric
variety on which it is algebraically stable. We give conditions for when such
variety does or does not exist. We also obtain several precise estimates of the
degree sequences of monomial maps on $\P^n$. Finally, we characterize
polynomial maps which are algebraically stable on $(\P^1)^n$.
