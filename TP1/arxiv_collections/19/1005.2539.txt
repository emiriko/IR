Let $K$ be a global field of positive characteristic. Let $\infty$ be a fixed
place of $K$. This paper gives an explicit isomorphism between the space of
automorphic forms (resp. cusp forms) for $GL_{n+1}(K)$ that transform like the
special representations and certain spaces of harmonic cochains (resp. those
with finite support) defined on the Bruhat-Tits building of
$GL_{n+1}(K_\infty)$.
