We present and analyse integral-field observations of six type-II QSOs with
z=0.3-0.4, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Two of our sample
are found to be surrounded by a nebula of warm ionized gas, with the largest
nebula extending across 8" (40 kpc). Some regions of the extended nebulae show
kinematics that are consistent with gravitational motion, while other regions
show relatively perturbed kinematics: velocity shifts and line widths too large
to be readily explained by gravitational motion. We propose that a ~20 kpc x20
kpc outflow is present in one of the galaxies. Possible mechanisms for
triggering the outflow are discussed. In this object, we also find evidence for
ionization both by shocks and the radiation field of the AGN.
