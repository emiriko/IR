Non-local field theories which arise from p-adic string theories have vacuum
soliton solutions. We find the soliton solutions at finite temperature. These
solutions become important for the partition function when the temperature
exceeds m_s/g_o^2 where m_s is the string mass scale and g_o is the open string
coupling.
