Non-trivial toplogical properties of string world-sheets with three
boundaries can give rise to superpotentials which preserve supersymmetry but
violate R-symmetry by two units. This results in four point functions which
permit s-wave annihilation of two neutralinos into gauge bosons. If the
topological partition function is such as to allow saturation of the WMAP dark
matter density for low string scales (M_s ~ 2 TeV), the annihilation into
monochromatic gamma rays is predicted to lie about a factor of 2 below the
current H.E.S.S. measurement of gamma ray flux from the galactic center. Thus,
it may be detectable in the next round of gamma ray observations.
