The hairs of a painting brush withdrawn from a wetting liquid self-assemble
into clumps whose sizes rely on a balance between liquid surface tension and
hairs bending rigidity. Here we study the situation of an immersed carpet in an
evaporating liquid bath : the free extremities of the hairs are forced to
pierce the liquid interface. The compressive capillary force on the tip of
flexible hairs leads to buckling and collapse. However we find that the
spontaneous association of hairs into stronger bundles may allow them to resist
capillary buckling. We explore in detail the different structures obtained and
compare them with similar patterns observed in micro-structured surfaces such
as carbon nanotubes "forests".
