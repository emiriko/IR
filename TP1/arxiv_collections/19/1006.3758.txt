The sensitivity of the stellar moment of inertia to the neutron-star matter
equation of state is examined using accurately-calibrated relativistic
mean-field models. We probe this sensitivity by tuning both the density
dependence of the symmetry energy and the high density component of the
equation of state, properties that are at present poorly constrained by
existing laboratory data. Particularly attractive is the study of the fraction
of the moment of inertia contained in the solid crust. Analytic treatments of
the crustal moment of inertia reveal a high sensitivity to the transition
pressure at the core-crust interface. This may suggest the existence of a
strong correlation between the density dependence of the symmetry energy and
the crustal moment of inertia. However, no correlation was found. We conclude
that constraining the density dependence of the symmetry energy - through, for
example, the measurement of the neutron skin thickness in 208Pb - will place no
significant bound on either the transition pressure or the crustal moment of
inertia.
