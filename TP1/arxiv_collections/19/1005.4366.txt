We provide an explicit combinatorial expansion for the ground state energy of
the massless spin-Boson model as a power series in the coupling parameter. Our
method uses the technique of cluster expansion in constructive quantum field
theory and takes as a starting point the functional integral representation and
its reduction to an Ising model on the real line with long range interactions.
We prove the analyticity of our expansion and provide an explicit lower bound
on the radius of convergence. We do not need multiscale nor renormalization
group analysis. A connection to the loop-erased random walk is indicated.
