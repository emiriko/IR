Suppose that $\Omega$ is the open region in $\mathbb{R}^n$ above a Lipschitz
graph and let $d$ denote the exterior derivative on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We
construct a convolution operator $T $ which preserves support in
$\bar{\Omega$}, is smoothing of order 1 on the homogeneous function spaces, and
is a potential map in the sense that $dT$ is the identity on spaces of exact
forms with support in $\bar\Omega$. Thus if $f$ is exact and supported in
$\bar\Omega$, then there is a potential $u$, given by $u=Tf$, of optimal
regularity and supported in $\bar\Omega$, such that $du=f$. This has
implications for the regularity in homogeneous function spaces of the de Rham
complex on $\Omega$ with or without boundary conditions. The operator $T$ is
used to obtain an atomic characterisation of Hardy spaces $H^p$ of exact forms
with support in $\bar\Omega$ when $n/(n+1)<p\leq1$. This is done via an atomic
decomposition of functions in the tent spaces $\mathcal
T^p(\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^+)$ with support in a tent $T(\Omega)$ as a
sum of atoms with support away from the boundary of $\Omega$. This new
decomposition of tent spaces is useful, even for scalar valued functions.
