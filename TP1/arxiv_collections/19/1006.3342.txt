We propose a method for incorporating variable selection into local
polynomial regression. This can improve the accuracy of the regression by
extending the bandwidth in directions corresponding to those variables judged
to be are unimportant. It also increases our understanding of the dataset by
highlighting areas where these variables are redundant. The approach has the
potential to effect complete variable removal as well as perform partial
removal when a variable redundancy applies only to particular regions of the
data. We define a nonparametric oracle property and show that this is more than
satisfied by our approach under asymptotic analysis. The usefulness of the
method is demonstrated through simulated and real data numerical examples.
