We present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of the hot DB white dwarf
PG 0112+104. Our analysis relies on newly-acquired FUSE observations, on
medium-resolution FOS and GHRS data, on archival high-resolution GHRS
observations, on optical spectrophotometry both in the blue and around Halpha,
as well as on time-resolved photometry. From the optical data, we derive a
self-consistent effective temperature of 31,300+-500 K, a surface gravity of
log g = 7.8 +- 0.1 (M=0.52 Msun), and a hydrogen abundance of log N(H)/N(He) <
-4.0. The FUSE spectra reveal the presence of CII and CIII lines that
complement the previous detection of CII transitions with the GHRS. The
improved carbon abundance in this hot object is log N(C)/N(He) = -6.15 +- 0.23.
No photospheric features associated with other heavy elements are detected. We
reconsider the role of PG 0112+104 in the definition of the blue edge of the
V777 Her instability strip in light of our high-speed photometry, and contrast
our results with those of previous observations carried out at the McDonald
Observatory.
