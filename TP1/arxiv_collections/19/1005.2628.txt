A method for measuring the pair interaction potential between colloidal
particles by extrapolation measurement of collective structure to infinite
dilution is presented and explored using simulation and experiment. The method
is particularly well suited to systems in which the colloid is fluorescent and
refractive index matched with the solvent. The method involves characterizing
the potential of mean force between colloidal particles in suspension by
measurement of the radial distribution function using 3D direct visualization.
The potentials of mean force are extrapolated to infinite dilution to yield an
estimate of the pair interaction potential, $U(r)$. We use Monte Carlo (MC)
simulation to test and establish our methodology as well as to explore the
effects of polydispersity on the accuracy. We use poly-12-hydroxystearic
acid-stabilized poly(methyl methacrylate) (PHSA-PMMA) particles dispersed in
the solvent dioctyl phthalate (DOP) to test the method and assess its accuracy
for three different repulsive systems for which the range has been manipulated
by addition of electrolyte.
