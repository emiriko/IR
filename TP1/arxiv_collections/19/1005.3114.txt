We show that a massive black hole binary might resonantly trap a small third
body (e.g. a neutron star) down to a stage when the binary becomes relativistic
due to its orbital decay by gravitational radiation. The final fate of the
third body would be quite interesting for relativistic astrophysics. For
example, the parent binary could expel the third body with a velocity more than
10% of the speed of light. We also discuss the implications of this three-body
system for direct gravitational wave observation.
