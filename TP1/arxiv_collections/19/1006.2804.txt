This paper presents an effective method for fingerprint verification based on
a data mining technique called minutiae clustering and a graph-theoretic
approach to analyze the process of fingerprint comparison to give a feature
space representation of minutiae and to produce a lower bound on the number of
detectably distinct fingerprints. The method also proving the invariance of
each individual fingerprint by using both the topological behavior of the
minutiae graph and also using a distance measure called Hausdorff distance.The
method provides a graph based index generation mechanism of fingerprint
biometric data. The self-organizing map neural network is also used for
classifying the fingerprints.
