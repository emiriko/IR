We present several entanglement conditions in order to detect bound entangled
states in continuous variable systems. Specifically, Werner and Wolf [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 86, 3658 (2001)] and Horodecki and Lewenstein [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85,
2657 (2000)] have proposed examples of bound entangled Gaussian state and bound
entangled non-Gaussian state, respectively, of which entanglement can be
detected by using our entanglement conditions.
