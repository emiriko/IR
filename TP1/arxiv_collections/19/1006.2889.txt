Electronic structure and dielectric property in an electronic
ferroelectricty, where electric polarization is driven by an electronic charge
order without inversion symmetry, are studied. Motivated from layered iron
oxides, roles of quantum fluctuation on ferroelectricity in a paired-triangular
lattice are focused on. Three types of the extended V-t model are examined by
the variational Monte-Carlo method with the Gutzwiller-type correlation factor.
It is shown that electron transfer between the triangular layers corresponding
to the inter-layer polarization fluctuation promotes the three-fold charge
order associated with an electric polarization. This result is in highly
contrast to the usual manner of quantum fluctuation in the hydrogen-bond type
ferroelectricities and the quantum paraelectric oxides. Spin degree of freedom
of electron and a realistic crystal structure for the layered iron oxides
further stabilize the polar charge ordered state. Implications of the numerical
results for layered iron oxides are discussed.
