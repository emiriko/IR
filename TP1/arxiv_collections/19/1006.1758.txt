We study phonon-mediated temporary trapping of an electron in
polarization-induced external surface states (image states) of a dielectric
surface. Our approach is based on a quantum-kinetic equation for the occupancy
of the image states. It allows us to distinguish between prompt and kinetic
sticking. Because the depth of the image potential is much larger than the
Debye energy multi-phonon processes are important. Taking two-phonon processes
into account in cases where one-phonon processes yield a vanishing transition
probability, as it is applicable, for instance, to graphite, we analyze the
adsorption scenario as a function of potential depth and surface temperature
and calculate prompt and kinetic sticking coefficients. We find rather small
sticking coefficients, at most of the order of $10^{-3}$, and a significant
suppression of the kinetic sticking coefficient due to a relaxation bottleneck
inhibiting thermalization of the electron with the surface at short timescales.
