The Nikolaevskiy model for pattern formation with continuous symmetry
exhibits spatiotemporal chaos with strong scale separation. Extensive numerical
investigations of the chaotic attractor reveal unexpected scaling behavior of
the long-wave modes. Surprisingly, the computed amplitude and correlation time
scalings are found to differ from the values obtained by asymptotically
consistent multiple-scale analysis. However, when higher-order corrections are
added to the leading-order theory of Matthews and Cox, the anomalous scaling is
recovered.
