Dynamic friction force, diffusion tensor, flux density in velocity space, and
Coulomb collision term are expressed in curvilinear coordinates via Trubnikov
potential functions corresponding to each species of background plasma. For
comparison, explicit formulas are given for dynamic friction force, diffusion
tensor and collisional flux density in velocity space in curvilinear
coordinates via Rosenbluth potential functions summed over all species of
background plasma.
