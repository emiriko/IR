We have thoroughly investigated the entire magnetic states of under doped
ferromagnetic insulating manganite Nd0.8Sr0.2MnO3 through temperature dependent
linear and non linear complex ac magnetic susceptibility measurements. This
ferromagnetic insulating manganite is found to have frequency independent
ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition temperature at around 140 K. At around
90 K (\approx T_f) the sample shows a second frequency dependent re - entrant
magnetic transition as explored through complex ac susceptibility measurements.
Non linear ac susceptibility measurements (higher harmonics of ac
susceptibility) have also been performed (with and without the superposition of
a dc magnetic field) to further investigate the origin of this frequency
dependence (dynamic behavior at this re-entrant magnetic transition).
Divergence of 3rd order susceptibility in the limit of zero exciting field
indicates a spin glass like freezing phenomena. However, large value of spin
relaxation time (?0= 10-8 s) and small value of coercivity (~22 Oe) obtained at
low temperature (below T_f) from critical slowing down model and dc magnetic
measurements, respectively, are in contrast with what generally observed in a
canonical spin glass (?0 = 10-12 - 10-14 s and very large value of coercivity
below freezing temperature). We have attributed our observation to the
formation of finite size ferromagnetic clusters which are formed as consequence
of intrinsic separation and undergo cluster glass like freezing below certain
temperature in this under doped manganite. The results are supported by the
electronic - and magneto - transport data.
