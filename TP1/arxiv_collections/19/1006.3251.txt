By extrapolating the energies of non-relativistic atoms and their ions with
up to 3000 electrons within Kohn-Sham density functional theory, we find that
the ionization potential remains finite and increases across a row, even as
$Z\rightarrow\infty$. The local density approximation becomes chemically
accurate (and possibly exact) in some cases. Extended Thomas-Fermi theory
matches the shell-average of both the ionization potential and density change.
Exact results are given in the limit of weak electron-electron repulsion.
