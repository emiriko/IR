The MUSIC algorithm, with its extension for imaging sparse {\em extended}
objects, is analyzed by compressed sensing (CS) techniques. The notion of
restricted isometry property (RIP) and an upper bound on the restricted
isometry constant (RIC) are employed to establish sufficient conditions for the
exact localization by MUSIC with or without the presence of noise. In the
noiseless case, the sufficient condition gives an upper bound on the numbers of
random sampling and incident directions necessary for exact localization. In
the noisy case, the sufficient condition assumes additionally an upper bound
for the noise-to-object ratio in terms of the RIC and the condition number of
objects. Rigorous comparison of performance between MUSIC and the CS
minimization principle, Lasso, is given. In general, the MUSIC algorithm
guarantees to recover, with high probability, $s$ scatterers with $n=\cO(s^2)$
random sampling and incident directions and sufficiently high frequency. For
the favorable imaging geometry where the scatterers are distributed on a
transverse plane MUSIC guarantees to recover, with high probability, $s$
scatterers with a median frequency and $n=\cO(s)$ random sampling/incident
directions. Numerical results confirm that the Lasso outperforms MUSIC in the
well-resolved case while the opposite is true for the under-resolved case. The
latter effect indicates the superresolution capability of the MUSIC algorithm.
Another advantage of MUSIC over the Lasso as applied to imaging is the former's
flexibility with grid spacing and guarantee of {\em approximate} localization
of sufficiently separated objects in an arbitrarily fine grid. The error can be
bounded from above by $\cO(\lambda s)$ for general configurations and
$\cO(\lambda)$ for objects distributed in a transverse plane.
