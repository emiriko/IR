Dark matter (DM) is currently searched for with a variety of detection
strategies. Accelerator searches are particularly promising, but even if Weakly
Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are found at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC), it will be difficult to prove that they constitute the bulk of the DM in
the Universe. We show that a significantly better reconstruction of the DM
properties can be obtained with a combined analysis of LHC and direct detection
(DD) data, by making a simple Ansatz on the WIMP local density, i.e. by
assuming that the local density scales with the cosmological relic abundance.
We demonstrate this method in an explicit example in the context of a
24-parameter supersymmetric model, with a neutralino LSP in the stau
co-annihilation region. Our results show that future ton-scale DD experiments
will allow to break degeneracies in the SUSY parameter space and achieve a
significantly better reconstruction of the neutralino composition and its relic
density than with LHC data alone.
