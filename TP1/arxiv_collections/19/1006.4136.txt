We study the extremal competitive ratio of Boolean function evaluation. We
provide the first non-trivial lower and upper bounds for classes of Boolean
functions which are not included in the class of monotone Boolean functions.
For the particular case of symmetric functions our bounds are matching and we
exactly characterize the best possible competitiveness achievable by a
deterministic algorithm. Our upper bound is obtained by a simple polynomial
time algorithm.
