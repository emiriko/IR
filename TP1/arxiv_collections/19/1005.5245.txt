The quantum Hall transition is one of the simplest and most studied quantum
phase transitions. Nevertheless, the experimental observation of a new phase in
this regime, the quantum Hall insulator, still remains a puzzle since the first
report more than a decade ago, as it is in contradiction with all theoretical
studies based on microscopically coherent quantum calculations. In this work we
introduce into the coherent quantum theory a new ingredient - rare incoherent
events, in a controlled manner. Using both direct numerical solutions and
real-space renormalization, we demonstrate that these decoherence events
stabilize the elusive quantum Hall insulator phase, which becomes even more
stable with increasing temperature and voltage bias, in agreement with
experiments.
