Among the most fundamental observables of nucleon structure, electromagnetic
form factors are a crucial benchmark for modern calculations describing the
strong interaction dynamics of the nucleon's quark constituents; indeed, recent
proton data have attracted intense theoretical interest. In this letter, we
report new measurements of the proton electromagnetic form factor ratio using
the recoil polarization method, at momentum transfers Q2=5.2, 6.7, and 8.5
GeV2. By extending the range of Q2 for which GEp is accurately determined by
more than 50%, these measurements will provide significant constraints on
models of nucleon structure in the non-perturbative regime.
