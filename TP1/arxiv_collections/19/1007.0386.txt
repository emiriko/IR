The analysis of experimental production cross-sections of intermediate-mass
fragments (IMF) of several nuclear reactions at relativistic energy, measured
at the FRS, GSI Darmstadt, revealed a very strong and complex even-odd
staggering. The origin of this effect is related to the condensation process of
hot nuclei while cooling down by evaporation. The characteristics of the
staggering correlate strongly with the lowest particle separation energy of the
final experimentally observed nuclei, but not with the binding energy. The
study confirms the important role of the de-excitation process in
multifragmentation reactions, and indicates that sequential decay strongly
influences the yields of IMF, which are often used to extract information on
the nature of nuclear reactions at high energies.
