We consider the cross section of electron-positron pair production by a
high-energy photon in a strong Coulomb field close to the end of electron or
positron spectrum. We show that the cross section essentially differs from the
result obtained in the Born approximation as well as form the result which
takes into account the Coulomb corrections under assumption that both electron
and positron are ultrarelativistic. The cross section of bremsstrahlung in a
strong Coulomb field by a high-energy electron is also obtained in the region
where the final electron is not ultrarelativistic.
