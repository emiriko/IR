We offer a simple parameterization of the rate of star formation in galaxies.
In this new approach, we make explicit and decouple the timescales associated
(a) with disruptive effects the star formation event itself, from (b) the
timescales associated with the cloud assembly and collapse mechanisms leading
up to star formation. The star formation law in near-by galaxies, as measured
on sub-kiloparsec scales, has recently been shown by Bigiel et al. to be
distinctly non-linear in its dependence on total gas density. Our
parameterization of the spatially resolved Schmidt-Sanduleak relation naturally
accommodates that dependence. The parameterized form of the relation is rho_* ~
epsilon x rho_g/(tau_s + rho_g ^{-n}), where rho_g is the gas density, epsilon
is the efficiency of converting gas into stars, and rho_g^{-n} captures the
physics of cloud collapse. Accordingly at high gas densities quiescent star
formation is predicted to progress as rho_* ~ rho_g, while at low gas densities
rho_* ~ rho_g^{1+n}, as is now generally observed. A variable efficiency in
locally converting gas into stars as well as the unknown plane thickness
variations from galaxy to galaxy, and radially within a given galaxy, can
readily account for the empirical scatter in the observed (surface density
rather than volume density) relations, and also plausibly account for the noted
upturn in the relation at very high apparent projected column densities.
