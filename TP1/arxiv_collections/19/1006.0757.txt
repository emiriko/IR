We present a search for a low-mass standard model Higgs boson produced in
association with a $Z$ boson decaying to charged leptons at a center-of-mass
energy of $\sqrt{s}=$1.96 TeV with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron
collider. The search is performed in a large data set of events containing two
opposite-sign leptons (electron, muon, tau) and one or two b-tagged jets.
Recent improvements to the sensitivity, from increased lepton acceptance to
optimized signal-to-background discrimination, will be discussed.
