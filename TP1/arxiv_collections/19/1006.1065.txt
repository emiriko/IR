In the context of a strongly coupled Electroweak Symmetry Breaking, composite
triplet of heavy vectors degenerate in mass belonging to the $SU(2)_{L+R}$
adjoint representation may arise from a new strong interaction invariant under
the global $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ symmetry, which is spontaneously broken down
to $SU(2)_{L+R}$. Assuming that the interactions among these heavy vector
states and with the Standard Model gauge bosons are described by a
$SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R/SU(2)_{L+R}$ Effective Chiral Lagrangian, the heavy
vector pair production at the LHC by Vector Boson Fusion and Drell-Yan
annihilation is studied in this framework. The expected rates of same sign
di-lepton and tri-lepton events from the decay of the composite vectors into
Standard Model gauge bosons are computed.
