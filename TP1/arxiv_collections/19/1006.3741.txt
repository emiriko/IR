We consider the generic problem of suddenly changing the geometry of an
integrable, one-dimensional many-body quantum system. We show how the physics
of an initial quantum state released into a bigger system can be completely
described within the framework of the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz, by providing an
exact decomposition of the initial state into the eigenstate basis of the
system after such a geometric quench. Our results, applicable to a large class
of models including the Lieb-Liniger gas and Heisenberg spin chains, thus offer
a reliable framework for the calculation of time-dependent expectation values
and correlations in this nonequilibrium situation.
