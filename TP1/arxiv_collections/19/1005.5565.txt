The loop quantum cosmology "improved dynamics" of the Bianchi type IX model
are studied. The action of the Hamiltonian constraint operator is obtained via
techniques developed for the Bianchi type I and type II models, no new input is
required. It is shown that the big bang and big crunch singularities are
resolved by quantum gravity effects. We also present the effective equations
which provide modifications to the classical equations of motion due to quantum
geometry effects.
