We investigate a minimal model for non-crystalline water, defined on a Husimi
lattice. The peculiar random-regular nature of the lattice is meant to account
for the formation of a random 4-coordinated hydrogen-bond network. The model
turns out to be consistent with most thermodynamic anomalies observed in liquid
and supercooled-liquid water. Furthermore, the model exhibits two glassy phases
with different densities, which can coexist at a first-order transition. The
onset of a complex free-energy landscape, characterized by an exponentially
large number of metastable minima, is pointed out by the cavity method, at the
level of 1-step replica symmetry breaking.
