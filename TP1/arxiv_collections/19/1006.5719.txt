How the fundamental and purely quantum mechanical concept of space
quantization and intrinsic spin led to totally unanticipated practical
improvements to the Quality of Life such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging, atomic
clocks, etc. This is just one example of the importance of discoveries in
fundamental science that are necessary in order achieve future progress via
revolutionary practical applications which improve the quality of life. The
importance educating the general populace with a broad knowledge of science is
emphasized, as well as the need for specialized education for future
scientists.
