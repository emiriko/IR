This paper describes the design of a web based multi agent design for a
collision avoidance auto navigation biomimetic submarine for submarine
hydroelectricity. The paper describes the nature of the map - topology
interface for river bodies and the design of interactive agents for the control
of the robotic submarine. The agents are migratory on the web and are designed
in XML/html interface with both interactive capabilities and visibility on a
map. The paper describes mathematically the user interface and the map
definition languages used for the multi agent description
