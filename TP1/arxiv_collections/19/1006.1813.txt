Experimental studies of meson production through two-photon fusion in
inelastic electron-nucleus scattering is now under way. A high-energy photon
radiated by the incident electron is fused with a soft photon radiated by the
nucleus. The process takes place in the small-angle-Coulomb region of nuclear
scattering. We expound the theory for this production process as well as its
interference with coherent-radiative-meson production. In particular, we
investigate the distortion of the electron wave function due to
multiple-Coulomb scattering.
