While quantum computers promise significant advantages, the complexity of
quantum algorithms remains a major technological obstacle. We have developed
and demonstrated an architecture-independent technique that simplifies adding
control qubits to arbitrary quantum operations-a requirement in many quantum
algorithms, simulations and metrology. The technique is independent of how the
operation is done, does not require knowledge of what the operation is, and
largely separates the problems of how to implement a quantum operation in the
laboratory and how to add a control. We demonstrate an entanglement-based
version in a photonic system, realizing a range of different two-qubit gates
with high fidelity.
