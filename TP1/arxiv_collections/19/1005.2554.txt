Using full-potential linear augmented plane wave method (FP-LAPW) and the
density functional theory, we have carried out a systematic investigation of
the electronic, magnetic, and cohesive properties of the chalcogenide CrTe in
three competing structures: rock-salt (RS), zinc blende (ZB) and the NiAs-type
(NA) hexagonal. Although the ground state is of NA structure, RS and ZB are
interesting in that these fcc-based structures, which can possibly be grown on
many semiconductor substrates, exhibit half-metallic phases above some critical
values of the lattice parameter. We find that the NA structure is not
half-metallic at its equilibrium volume, while both ZB and RS structures are.
The RS structure is more stable than the ZB, with an energy that is lower by
0.25 eV/atom. While confirming previous results on the half-metallic phase in
ZB structure, we provide hitherto unreported results on the half-metallic RS
phase, with a gap in the minority channel and a magnetic moment of 4.0
$\mu_{B}$ per formula unit. A comparison of total energies for the
ferromagnetic (FM), non-magnetic (NM), and antiferromagnetic (AFM)
configurations shows the lowest energy configuration to be FM for CrTe in all
the three structures. The FP-LAPW calculations are supplemented by linear
muffin-tin orbital (LMTO) calculations using both local density approximation
(LDA) and LDA+U method. The exchange interactions and the Curie temperatures
calculated via the linear response method in ZB and RS CrTe are compared over a
wide range of the lattice parameter. The calculated Curie temperatures for the
RS phase are consistently higher than those for the ZB phase.
