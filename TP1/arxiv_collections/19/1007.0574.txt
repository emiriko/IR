Only a few years ago, it was realized that the zero-area Sagnac
interferometer topology is able to perform quantum nondemolition measurements
of position changes of a mechanical oscillator. Here, we experimentally show
that such an interferometer can also be efficiently enhanced by squeezed light.
We achieved a nonclassical sensitivity improvement of up to 8.2 dB, limited by
optical loss inside our interferometer. Measurements performed directly on our
squeezed-light laser output revealed squeezing of 12.7 dB. We show that the
sensitivity of a squeezed-light enhanced Sagnac interferometer can surpass the
standard quantum limit for a broad spectrum of signal frequencies without the
need for filter cavities as required for Michelson interferometers. The Sagnac
topology is therefore a powerful option for future gravitational-wave
detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, whose design is currently being
studied.
