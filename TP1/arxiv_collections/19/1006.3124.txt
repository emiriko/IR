We report on investigations of the superconducting energy gap of the A15
superconductor Nb_3Sn by point-contact spectroscopy of breakjunctions. The
voltage-dependent differential conductance dI/dV reveals features of a second
energy gap besides the energy gap known from previous tunnel measurements with
maxima at \Delta_1=3.92 +/- 0.16 meV and \Delta_2=0.85 +/- 0.17 meV as derived
from a histogram summarizing the data of more than 60 contacts. These findings
are the first spectroscopic evidence that Nb_3Sn belongs to the class of
two-band superconductors and they are in line with low-temperature
specific-heat measurements on Nb_3Sn.
