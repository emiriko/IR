DK Cha is an intermediate-mass star in transition from an embedded
configuration to a star plus disk stage. We aim to study the composition and
energetics of the circumstellar material during this pivotal stage. Using the
Range Scan mode of PACS on the Herschel Space Observatory, we obtained a
spectrum of DK Cha from 55 to 210 micron as part of the DIGIT Key Program.
Almost 50 molecular and atomic lines were detected, many more than the 7 lines
detected in ISO-LWS. Nearly the entire ladder of CO from J=14-13 to 38-37
(E_u/k = 4080 K), water from levels as excited as E_u/k = 843 K, and OH lines
up to E_u/k = 290 K were detected. The continuum emission in our PACS SED scan
matches the flux expected from a model consisting of a star, a surrounding disk
of 0.03 Solar mass, and an envelope of a similar mass, supporting the
suggestion that the object is emerging from its main accretion stage.
Molecular, atomic, and ionic emission lines in the far-infrared reveal the
outflow's influence on the envelope. The inferred hot gas can be photon-heated,
but some emission could be due to C-shocks in the walls of the outflow cavity.
