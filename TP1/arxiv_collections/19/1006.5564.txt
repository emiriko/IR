The magnetic properties of matter under extreme conditions are of particular
importance to understanding the neutron star interior. One contributing factor
to the magnetic field of a neutron star could be the ferromagnetic phase of
nuclear matter. In this letter we present a self-consistent, relativistic
description of ferromagnetism in dense matter, within which the ferromagnetic
phase diagram for neutron matter is calculated.
