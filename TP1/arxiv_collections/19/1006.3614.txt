By studying the minimum resources required to perform a unitary
transformation, families of metrics and pseudo-metrics on unitary matrices that
are closely related to a recently reported quantum speed limit by the author
are found. Interestingly, this family of metrics can be naturally converted
into useful indicators of the degree of non-commutativity between two unitary
matrices.
