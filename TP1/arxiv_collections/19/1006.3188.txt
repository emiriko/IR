Direct observation of vortices by the scanning SQUID microscopy was made on
large mesoscopic disks of an amorphous MoGe thin film. Owing to the weak
pinning nature of the amorphous film, vortices are able to form geometry
induced, (quasi-)symmetric configurations of polygons and concentric shells in
the large disks. Systematic measurements made on selected disks allow us to
trace not only how the vortex pattern evolves with magnetic field, but also how
the vortex polygons change in size and rotate with respect to the disk center.
The results are in good agreement with theoretical considerations for
mesoscopic disks with sufficiently large diameter. A series of vortex images
obtained in a disk with a pinning site reveals a unique line symmetry in vortex
configurations, resulting in modifications of the shell filling rule and the
magic number.
