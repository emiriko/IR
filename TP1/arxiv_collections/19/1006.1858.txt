To perform Quantum Key Distribution, the mastering of the extremely weak
signals carried by the quantum channel is required. Transporting these signals
without disturbance is customarily done by isolating the quantum channel from
any noise sources using a dedicated physical channel. However, to really profit
from this technology, a full integration with conventional network technologies
would be highly desirable. Trying to use single photon signals with others that
carry an average power many orders of magnitude bigger while sharing as much
infrastructure with a conventional network as possible brings obvious problems.
The purpose of the present paper is to report our efforts in researching the
limits of the integration of QKD in modern optical networks scenarios. We have
built a full metropolitan area network testbed comprising a backbone and an
access network. The emphasis is put in using as much as possible the same
industrial grade technology that is actually used in already installed
networks, in order to understand the throughput, limits and cost of deploying
QKD in a real network.
