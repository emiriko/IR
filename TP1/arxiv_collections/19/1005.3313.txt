We present a scalable method for the tomography of large multiqubit quantum
registers. It acquires information about the permutationally invariant part of
the density operator, which is a good approximation to the true state in many,
relevant cases. Our method gives the best measurement strategy to minimize the
experimental effort as well as the uncertainties of the reconstructed density
matrix. We apply our method to the experimental tomography of a photonic
four-qubit symmetric Dicke state.
