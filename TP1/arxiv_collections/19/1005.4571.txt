Using simulations we identify three dynamic regimes in supersaturated
isotropic fluid states of short hard rods: (i) for moderate supersaturations we
observe nucleation of multi-layered crystalline clusters; (ii) at higher
supersaturation, we find nucleation of small crystallites which arrange into
long-lived locally favored structures that get kinetically arrested, while
(iii) at even higher supersaturation the dynamic arrest is due to the
conventional cage-trapping glass transition. For longer rods we find that the
formation of the (stable) smectic phase out of a supersaturated isotropic state
is strongly suppressed by an isotropic-nematic spinodal instability that causes
huge spinodal-like orientation fluctuations with nematic clusters diverging in
size. Our results show that glassy dynamics and spinodal instabilities set
kinetic limits to nucleation in a highly supersaturated hard-rod fluids.
