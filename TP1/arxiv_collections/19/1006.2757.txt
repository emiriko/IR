We demonstrate a scalable approach to addressing multiple atomic qubits for
use in quantum information processing. Individually trapped 87Rb atoms in a
linear array are selectively manipulated with a single laser guided by a MEMS
beam steering system. Single qubit oscillations are shown on multiple sites at
frequencies of ~3.5 MHz with negligible crosstalk to neighboring sites.
Switching times between the central atom and its closest neighbor were measured
to be 6-7 us while moving between the central atom and an atom two trap sites
away took 10-14 us.
