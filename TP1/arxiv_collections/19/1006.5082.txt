{\sc Cinderella} is a software solution for the quantitative comparison of
time series in the frequency domain. It assigns probabilities to coincident
peaks in the DFT amplidude spectra of the datasets under consideration. Two
different modes are available. In conditional mode, {\sc Cinderella} examines
target and comparison datasets on the assumption that the latter contain
artifacts only, returning the conditional probability of a target signal,
although there is a coincident signal in the comparison data within the
frequency resolution. In composed mode, the probability of coincident signal
components in both target and comparison data is evaluated. {\sc Cinderella}
permits to examine multiple target and comparison datasets at once.
