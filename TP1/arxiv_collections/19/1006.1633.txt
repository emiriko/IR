In this paper we consider Grassmannians in arbitrary characteristic.
Generalizing Kapranov's well-known characteristic-zero results we construct
dual exceptional collections on them (which are however not strong) as well as
a tilting bundle. We show that this tilting bundle has a quasi-hereditary
endomorphism ring and we identify the standard, costandard, projective and
simple modules of the latter.
