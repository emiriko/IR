The electronic structure of LaOFeAs, a parent compound of iron-arsenic
superconductors, is studied by angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. By
examining its dependence on photon energy, polarization, sodium dosing and the
counting of Fermi surface volume, both the bulk and the surface contributions
are identified. We find that a bulk band moves toward high binding energies
below structural transition, and shifts smoothly across the spin density wave
transition by about 25 meV. Our data suggest the band reconstruction may play a
crucial role in the spin density wave transition, and the structural transition
is driven by the short range magnetic order. For the surface states, both the
LaO-terminated and FeAs-terminated components are revealed. Certain small band
shifts are verified for the FeAs-terminated surface states in the spin density
wave state, which is a reflection of the bulk electronic structure
reconstruction. Moreover, sharp quasiparticle peaks quickly rise at low
temperatures, indicating of drastic reduction of the scattering rate. A kink
structure in one of the surface band is shown to be possibly related to the
electron-phonon interactions.
