It is shown that quantum fluctuation theorems remain unaffected if
measurements of any kind and number of observables are performed during the
action of a force protocol. That is, although the backward and forward
probabilities entering the fluctuation theorems are both altered by these
measurements, their ratio remains unchanged. This observation allows to
describe the measurement of fluxes through interfaces and, in this way, to
bridge the gap between the current theory, based on only two measurements
performed at the beginning and end of the protocol, and experiments that are
based on continuous monitoring.
