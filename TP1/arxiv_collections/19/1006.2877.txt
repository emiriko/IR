From first-principles density functional calculations, we study the
structural and electronic properties of a stable hydrogenated BN sheet, having
formula unit BHNH. In the optimized BHNH structure, the H atoms stabilize on
the B and N sites, alternating themselves on both sides of the BN-plane in
specific periodic manner, giving rise to different BHNH conformers, viz. chair,
boat and stirrup. The chair and boat conformers resemble in structure to those
of graphane (CH). We propose a new conformer, called 'stirrup' conformer, that
turns out to be the most stable, albeit marginally with respect to the boat
conformer. All these BHNH conformers are insulator, with band gap varying
between ~ 3.0 eV to 4.5 eV.
