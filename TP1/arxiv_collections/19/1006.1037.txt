The HyperCP experiment reported the observation of three events for the
$\Sigma^+ \rightarrow p \mu^+\mu^-$ decay. The dimuon masses of the observed
events are clustered within the detector resolution of 1 MeV/$c^2$. These
decays might be interpreted as a two-body decay, $\Sigma^+ \rightarrow pX^0$,
$X^0 \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$, where $X^0$ is a new particle with mass (214.3
$\pm$ 0.5) MeV/$c^2$. We report on a search for the $X^0$ particle in $\bzkx$
and $\bzrhox$ decays using 656 million $B$ meson pairs collected with the Belle
detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy $e^+e^-$ collider.
