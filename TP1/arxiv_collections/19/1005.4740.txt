The infinite disorder fixed point of the random transverse-field Ising model
is expected to control the critical behavior of a large class of random quantum
and stochastic systems having an order parameter with discrete symmetry. Here
we study the model on the square lattice with a very efficient numerical
implementation of the strong disorder renormalization group method, which makes
us possible to treat finite samples of linear size up to $L=2048$. We have
calculated sample dependent pseudo-critical points and studied their
distribution, which is found to be characterized by the same shift and width
exponent: $\nu=1.24(2)$. For different types of disorder the infinite disorder
fixed point is shown to be characterized by the same set of critical exponents,
for which we have obtained improved estimates: $x=0.982(15)$ and
$\psi=0.48(2)$. We have also studied the scaling behavior of the magnetization
in the vicinity of the critical point as well as dynamical scaling in the
ordered and disordered Griffiths phases.
