We report the result of the analysis of the light curve of the microlensing
event MOA-2009-BLG-016. The light curve is characterized by a short-duration
anomaly near the peak and an overall asymmetry. We find that the peak anomaly
is due to a binary companion to the primary lens and the asymmetry of the light
curve is explained by the parallax effect caused by the acceleration of the
observer over the course of the event due to the orbital motion of the Earth
around the Sun. In addition, we detect evidence for the effect of the finite
size of the source near the peak of the event, which allows us to measure the
angular Einstein radius of the lens system. The Einstein radius combined with
the microlens parallax allows us to determine the total mass of the lens and
the distance to the lens. We identify three distinct classes of degenerate
solutions for the binary lens parameters, where two are manifestations of the
previously identified degeneracies of close/wide binaries and positive/negative
impact parameters, while the third class is caused by the symmetric cycloid
shape of the caustic. We find that, for the best-fit solution, the estimated
mass of the lower-mass component of the binary is (0.04 +- 0.01) M_sun,
implying a brown-dwarf companion. However, there exists a solution that is
worse only by \Delta\chi^2 ~ 3 for which the mass of the secondary is above the
hydrogen-burning limit. Unfortunately, resolving these two degenerate solutions
will be difficult as the relative lens-source proper motions for both are
similar and small (~ 1 mas/yr) and thus the lens will remain blended with the
source for the next several decades.
