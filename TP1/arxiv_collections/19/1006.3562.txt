We analyze the potential of the CERN Large Hadron Collider running at 7 TeV
to search for deviations from the Standard Model predictions for the triple
gauge boson coupling ZW+W- assuming an integrated luminosity of 1 fb^{-1}. We
show that the study of W+W- and W^\pm Z productions, followed by the leptonic
decay of the weak gauge bosons can improve the present sensitivity on the
anomalous couplings \Delta g_1^Z, \Delta \kappa_Z, \lambda_Z, g_4^Z, and
\tilde{\lambda}_Z at the 2\sigma level.
