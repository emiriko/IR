We theoretically demonstrate features of Anderson localization in the
Tonks-Girardeau gas confined in one-dimensional (1D) potentials with controlled
disorder. That is, we investigate the evolution of the single particle density
and correlations of a Tonks-Girardeau wave packet in such disordered
potentials. The wave packet is initially trapped, the trap is suddenly turned
off, and after some time the system evolves into a localized steady state due
to Anderson localization. The density tails of the steady state decay
exponentially, while the coherence in these tails increases. The latter
phenomenon corresponds to the same effect found in incoherent optical solitons.
