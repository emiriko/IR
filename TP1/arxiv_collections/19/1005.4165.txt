We report measurements of the phonon density of states as measured with
inelastic x-ray scattering in SmFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_y$ powders. An unexpected
strong renormalization of phonon branches around 23 meV is observed as fluorine
is substituted for oxygen. Phonon dispersion measurements on
SmFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_y$ single crystals allow us to identify the 21 meV A$_{1g}$
in-phase (Sm,As) and the 26 meV B$_{1g}$ (Fe,O) modes to be responsible for
this renormalization, and may reveal unusual electron-phonon coupling through
the spin channel in iron-based superconductors.
