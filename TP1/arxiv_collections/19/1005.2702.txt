Bose-Einstein condensation of W bosons in the early universe is studied. It
is shown that, in the broken phase of the standard electroweak theory,
condensed W bosons form a ferromagnetic state with aligned spins. In this case
the primeval plasma may be spontaneously magnetized inside macroscopically
large domains and form magnetic fields which may be seeds for the observed
today galactic and intergalactic fields. However, in a modified theory, e.g. in
a theory without quartic self interactions of gauge bosons or for a smaller
value of the weak mixing angle, antiferromagnetic condensation is possible. In
the latter case W bosons form scalar condensate with macroscopically large
electric charge density i.e. with a large average value of the bilinear product
of W-vector fields but with microscopically small average value of the field
itself.
