We present a quantization of the hydrodynamic model to describe the
excitation of plasmons in a single-walled carbon nanotube by a fast point
charge moving near its surface at an arbitrary angle of incidence. Using a
two-dimensional electron gas represented by two interacting fluids, which takes
into account the different nature of the sigma and pi electrons, we obtain
plasmon energies in near-quantitative agreement with experiment. Further, the
implemented quantization procedure allows us to study the probability of
exciting various plasmon modes, as well as the stopping force and energy loss
spectra of the incident particle.
