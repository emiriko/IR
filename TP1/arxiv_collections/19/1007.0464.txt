In the framework of the topcolor-assisted technicolor (TC2) models, we study
the productions of a single top or bottom quark associated with a scalar in
\gamma-p collision, which proceed via the subprocesses c\gamma -> t\pi_t^0,
c\gamma -> t h_t^0 and c\gamma -> b\pi^+_t mediated by the anomalous top or
bottom coupling tc\pi_t^0, tch_t^0 and bc\pi_t^+. These productions, while
extremely suppressed in the Standard Model, are found to be significantly
enhanced in the large part of the TC2 parameter space, especially the
production via c\gamma -> b\pi^+ can have a cross section of 100 fb, which may
be accessible and allow for a test of the TC2 models.
