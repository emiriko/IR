We show a simple relation connecting entangling power and local invariants of
two-qubit gates. From the relation, a general condition under which gates have
same entangling power is arrived. The relation also helps in finding the lower
bound of entangling power for perfect entanglers, from which the classification
of gates as perfect and nonperfect entanglers is obtained in terms of local
invariants.
