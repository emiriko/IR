The 2009 run provided the first proton-proton collisions from the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) at center of mass energies of 900 GeV and 2.36 TeV. The
Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment has recorded a large sample of minimum
bias events from these collisions. We present results from the all silicon
tracking detectors from this run. The performance of the tracker and track
reconstruction algorithms are considered including signal-to-noise,
efficiencies and comparisons to simulation for track parameter and resonance
reconstruction performance.
