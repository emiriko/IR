We experimentally demonstrate the first metamaterial "illusion optics" device
- an "invisible gateway" by using a transmission-line medium. The device
contains an open channel that can block electromagnetic waves at a particular
frequency range. We also demonstrate that such a device can work in a broad
frequency range.
