The mysterious relation between the large scale structure of the universe and
the tiny (Planck) scale structure of the particle physics, e.g. the observed
mysterious relation between the (dark) energy density (and the dark matter) of
the universe and the origin of the tiny neutrino mass (and the SUSY breaking
mass scale) of the particle physics may be explained simply by the nonlinear
supersymmmetric general relativity theory (NLSUSY GR).
