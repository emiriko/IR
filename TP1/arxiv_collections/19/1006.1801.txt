In cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), the interaction between an atomic
transition and the cavity field is measured by the vacuum Rabi frequency
$\Omega_0$. The analogous term "circuit QED" has been introduced for Josephson
junctions, because superconducting circuits behave as artificial atoms coupled
to the bosonic field of a resonator. In the regime with $\Omega_0$ comparable
to the two-level transition frequency, "superradiant" quantum phase transitions
for the cavity vacuum have been predicted, e.g. within the Dicke model. Here,
we prove that if the time-independent light-matter Hamiltonian is considered, a
superradiant quantum critical point is forbidden for electric dipole atomic
transitions due to the oscillator strength sum rule. In circuit QED, the
capacitive coupling is analogous to the electric dipole one: yet, such no-go
property can be circumvented by Cooper pair boxes capacitively coupled to a
resonator, due to their peculiar Hilbert space topology and a violation of the
corresponding sum rule.
