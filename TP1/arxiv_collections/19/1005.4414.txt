Composite Higgs models provide a natural, non-supersymmetric solution to the
hierarchy problem. In these models, one or more sets of heavy top-partners are
typically introduced. Some of these new quarks can be relatively light, with a
mass of a few hundred GeV, and could be observed with the early LHC collision
data expected to be collected during 2010. We analyse in detail the collider
signatures that these new quarks can produce. We show that final states with
two (same-sign) or three leptons are the most promising discovery channels.
They can yield a 5 sigma excess over the Standard Model expectation already
with the 2010 LHC collision data. Exotic quarks of charge 5/3 are a distinctive
feature of this model. We present a new method to reconstruct their masses from
their leptonic decay without relying on jets in the final state.
