We consider the prospect of lightest neutralino (${\tilde \chi}_1^0$) as a
dark matter candidate in the light of recent interesting observations from the
XENON100 and CDMS-II experiments in minimal supergravity framework with large
$\tan\beta$ and non-vanishing $A_0$. Within the WMAP satisfied zone, there is a
large direct detection reach of lighter ${\tilde \chi}_1^0$ in the lighter
Higgs boson mediated resonance annihilation domain of the above scenario. It is
seen that the heavier Higgs boson plays a dominating role in the ${\tilde
\chi}_1^0-p$ cross-section in the associated zone of parameter space in spite
of having a larger mass. Possible LHC signatures are discussed.
