We study the dynamics and decoherence of a system of two strongly driven
qubits in a dissipative cavity. The two qubits have no direct interaction and
are individually off-resonantly coupled to a single mode of quantized
radiation. We derive analytical solutions to the Lindblad-type master equation
and study the evolution of the entanglement of this system. We show that with
non-zero detuning between the quantum and classical fields, the initial decay
of the entanglement is followed by its revival periodic in time. We show that
different Bell states follow evolutions with different rates.
