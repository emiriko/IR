A novel concept of optical signal recording in two-phase avalanche detectors,
with Geiger-mode Avalanche Photodiodes (G-APD) is described.
Avalanche-scintillation photons were measured in a thick Gas Electron
Multiplier (THGEM) in view of potential applications in rare-event experiments.
The effective detection of avalanche scintillations in THGEM holes has been
demonstrated in two-phase Ar with a bare G-APD without wavelength shifter, i.e.
insensitive to VUV emission of Ar. At gas-avalanche gain of 400 and under \pm
70^\circ viewing-angle, the G-APD yielded 640 photoelectrons (pe) per 60 keV
X-ray converted in liquid Ar; this corresponds to 0.7 pe per initial (prior to
multiplication) electron. The avalanche-scintillation light yield measured by
the G-APD was about 0.7 pe per avalanche electron, extrapolated to 4pi
acceptance. The avalanche scintillations observed occurred presumably in the
near infrared (NIR) where G-APDs may have high sensitivity. The measured
scintillation yield is similar to that observed by others in the VUV. Other
related topics discussed in this work are the G-APD's single-pixel and
quenching resistor characteristics at cryogenic temperatures.
