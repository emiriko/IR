We present NICMOS J110 (rest-frame 1200-2100 A) observations of the three
z=5.7 Lyman Alpha emitters discovered in the blind multislit spectroscopic
survey by Martin et al. (2008). These images confirm the presence of the two
sources which were previously only seen in spectroscopic observations. The
third source, which is undetected in our J110 observations has been detected in
narrowband imaging of the Cosmic Origins Survey (COSMOS), so our nondetection
implies a rest frame equivalent width >146 Angstroms (3 sigma). The two J110--
detected sources have more modest rest frame equivalent widths of 30-40
Angstroms, but all three are typical of high-redshift LAEs. In addition, the
J110- detected sources have UV luminosities that are within a factor of two of
L*_{UV}, and sizes that appear compact (r_{hl} ~ 0."15) in our NIC2 images --
consistent with a redshift of 5.7. We use these UV-continuum and Lyman Alpha
measurements to estimate the i-z colors of these galaxies, and show that at
least one, and possibly all three would be missed by the i-dropout LBG
selection. These observations help demonstrate the utility of multislit
narrowband spectroscopy as a technique for finding faint emission line
galaxies.
