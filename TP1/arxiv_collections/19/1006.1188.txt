We study a general problem how the gap in a nonmagnetic band insulator closes
by tuning a parameter. We review our recent results on the classification of
all the possible gap closing in two and three dimensions. We show that they
accompany the change of Z_2 topological numbers, and that the gap closings
correspond to phase transitions between the quantum spin Hall and the insulator
phases. Interestingly, in inversion-asymmetric three-dimensional systems there
appears a gapless phase between the quantum spin Hall and insulator phases.
This gapless phase is due to a topological nature of gap-closing points in
three dimensions, but not in two dimensions.
