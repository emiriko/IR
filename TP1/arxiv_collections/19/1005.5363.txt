A recent observation of the nearby (z=0.042) narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy RE
J1034+396 on 2007 May 31 showed strong quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in
the 0.3-10 keV X-ray flux. We present phase-resolved spectroscopy of this
observation, using data obtained by the EPIC PN detector onboard XMM. The "low"
phase spectrum, associated with the troughs in the light curve, shows (at >4
sigma confidence level) an absorption edge at 0.86+/-0.05 keV with an
absorption depth of 0.3+/-0.1. Ionized oxygen edges are hallmarks of X-ray warm
absorbers in Seyfert active galactic nuclei (AGN); the observed edge is
consistent with H-like O VIII and implies a column density of
N_{OVIII}~3x10^{18} cm^{-2}. The edge is not seen in the "high" phase spectrum
associated with the crests in the light curve, suggesting the presence of a
warm absorber in the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole which
periodically obscures the continuum emission. If the QPO arises due to
Keplerian orbital motion around the central black hole, the periodic appearance
of the O VIII edge would imply a radius of ~9.4(M/[4x10^6 Msun])^{-2/3}(P/[1
hr])^{2/3} r_g for the size of the warm absorber.
