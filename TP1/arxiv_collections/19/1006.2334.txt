Cybersusy is a new mechanism for SUSY breaking. When the auxiliary fields are
integrated in any theory like the SSM, certain special new composite
superfields arise. Spontaneous breaking of internal symmetry, like SU(2) X U(1)
to U(1), gives rise to a new realization of SUSY for these new superfields.
This realization mixes elementary and composite states. In the resulting
effective action, if the new superfield has mass, then there are SUSY
anomalies. Since there are no massless supermultiplets, the SUSY anomalies must
be present. They generate a spectrum for SUSY breaking that is consistent with
the known particles. Supergravity does not couple to the anomalies because it
does not couple to composite states. So unitarity is not violated. There is no
cosmological constant generated, because SUSY is not spontaneously broken.
