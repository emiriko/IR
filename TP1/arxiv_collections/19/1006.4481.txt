The dynamic feature of monochromatic bi-modal chaotic optical field, enriched
with orthogonally-polarized basis-modes propagating collinearly and undergoing
Degenerate Parametric Amplification, is investigated to demonstrate Squeezing
in Hidden Optical-Polarization states. The Variance (Noise) of Hidden
Optical-Polarization Parameters showing squeezing therein is numerically
studied by identifying a Squeezing - Function. This squeezing in HOPS is seen
to depend critically on interaction time and an Onset-time responsible for the
same is demarcated.
