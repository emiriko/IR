Topological vector currents have gained interest recently with their possible
verification at RHIC through the Charge Separation Effect and the Chiral
Magnetic Effect. Much work has been done in understanding the role of
topological vector currents in astrophysics, specifically in the interiors of
neutron stars and quark stars. We will discuss a recent aspect of this work
regarding pulsar kicks. A significant percentage of the pulsar population is
known to have velocities above 1000 km/s, but a suitable explanation for these
velocities does not exist. We will detail how topological currents may be
responsible for these large kicks and discuss why the mechanism is successful
where others fail.
