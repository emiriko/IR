Recently, we have discovered an error in our Monte-Carlo spectral fitting
routine, more specifically where the errors on the fluxes were rescaled to get
a reduced chi2 of 1. The rescaled errors were too big, resulting in too wide a
range of good fits in our 100 step Monte-Carlo routine. This problem affects
Figs. 7-9 and Tables A.1, A.2 in Gielen et al. (2008), Table 3 in Gielen et al.
(2009a), and Table 4 in Gielen et al. (2009b). We corrected for this error and
present the new values and errors in the tables below. The new values and
errors nearly all fall within the old error range. Our best chi2 values and
overall former scientific results are not affected. With these new errors some
possible new trends in the dust parameters might be observed. These will be
discussed in an upcoming paper where we extend the sample presented in Gielen
et al. (2008) with newly obtained SPITZER-IRS data.
