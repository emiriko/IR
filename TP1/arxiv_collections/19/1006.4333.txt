This paper develops an algorithm that identifies and decomposes a median
graph of a triangulation of a 2-dimensional (2D) oriented bordered surface and
in addition restores all corresponding triangulation whenever they exist. The
algorithm is based on the consecutive simplification of the given graph by
reducing degrees of its nodes. From the paper \cite{FST1}, it is known that
such graphs can not have nodes of degrees above 8. Neighborhood of nodes of
degrees 8,7,6,5, and 4 are consecutively simplified. Then, a criterion is
provided to identify median graphs with nodes of degrees at most 3. As a
byproduct, we produce an algorithm that is more effective than previous known
to determine quivers of finite mutation type of size greater than 10.
