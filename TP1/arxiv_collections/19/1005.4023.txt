The notion of an ad hoc network is a new paradigm that allows mobile hosts
(nodes) to communicate without relying on a predefined infrastructure to keep
the network connected. Most nodes are assumed to be mobile and communication is
assumed to be wireless. The mobility of nodes in an ad-hoc network means that
both the population and the topology of the network are highly dynamic. It is
very difficult to design a once-for-all intrusion detection system. A secure
protocol should atleast include mechanisms against known attack types. In
addition, it should provide a scheme to easily add new security features in the
future. The paper includes the detailed description of Proposed Intrusion
Detection System based on Local Reputation Scheme. The proposed System also
includes concept of Redemption and Fading these are mechanism that allow nodes
previously considered malicious to become a part of the network again. The
simulation of the proposed system is to be done using NS-2 simulator.
