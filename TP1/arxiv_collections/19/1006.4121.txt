The stellar rotation periods of ten exoplanet host stars have been determined
using newly analysed Ca II H & K flux records from Mount Wilson Observatory and
Stromgren b, y photometric measurements from Tennessee State University's
automatic photometric telescopes (APTs) at Fairborn Observatory. Five of the
rotation periods have not previously been reported, with that of HD 130322 very
strongly detected at Prot = 26.1 \pm 3.5 d. The rotation periods of five other
stars have been updated using new data. We use the rotation periods to derive
the line-of-sight inclinations of the stellar rotation axes, which may be used
to probe theories of planet formation and evolution when combined with the
planetary orbital inclination found from other methods. Finally, we estimate
the masses of fourteen exoplanets under the assumption that the stellar
rotation axis is aligned with the orbital axis. We calculate the mass of HD
92788 b (28 MJ) to be within the low-mass brown dwarf regime and suggest that
this object warrants further investigation to confirm its true nature.
