We investigate the merger of a neutron star (of compaction ratio $0.1$) in
orbit about a spinning black hole in full general relativity with a mass ratio
of $5:1$, allowing for the star to have an initial magnetization of $10^{12}
{\rm Gauss}$. We present the resulting gravitational waveform and analyze the
fallback accretion as the star is disrupted. The evolutions suggest no
significant effects from the initial magnetization. We find that only a
negligible amount of matter becomes unbound; $99%$ of the neutron star material
has a fallback time of 10 seconds or shorter to reach the region of the central
engine and that $99.99%$ of the star will interact with the central disk and
black hole within 3 hours.
