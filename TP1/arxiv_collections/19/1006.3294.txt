We investigate the impact of three-body forces on the transverse-momentum
distribution of partons inside the proton. This is achieved by considering the
three-body problem in a class of hyper-central quark potential models. Solving
the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation, we determine the quark wave function
in the proton and with appropriate transformations and projections we find the
transverse-momentum distribution of a single quark. In each case the parameters
of the quark potentials are adjusted in order to sufficiently describe
observable properties of the proton. Using a factorization ansatz, we
incorporate the obtained transverse-momentum distribution in a perturbative QCD
scheme for the calculation of the cross-section for prompt photon production in
pp collisions. A large set of experimental data is fitted using as a single
free parameter the mean partonic transverse momentum. The dependence of <k T>
on the collision characteristics (initial energy and transverse momentum of the
final photon) is much smoother when compared with similar results found in the
literature using a Gaussian distribution for the partonic transverse momenta.
Within the considered class of hyper-central quark potentials the one with the
weaker dependence on the hyper-radius is preferred for the description of the
data since it leads to the smoothest mean partonic transverse-momentum profile.
We have repeated all the calculations using a two-body potential of the same
form as the optimal (within the considered class) hyper-central potential in
order to check if the presence of three-body forces is supported by the
experimental data. Our analysis indicates that three-body forces influence
significantly the form of the parton transverse-momentum distribution and
consequently lead to an improved description of the considered data.
