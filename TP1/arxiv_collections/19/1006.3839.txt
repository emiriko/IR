We investigate solitons and nonlinear Bloch waves in Bose-Einstein
condensates trapped in optical lattices. By introducing specially designed
localized profiles of the spatial modulation of the attractive nonlinearity, we
construct an infinite number of exact soliton solutions in terms of the Mathieu
and elliptic functions, with the chemical potential belonging to the
semi-infinite bandgap of the optical-lattice-induced spectrum. Starting from
the exact solutions, we employ the relaxation method to construct generic
families of soliton solutions in a numerical form. The stability of the
solitons is investigated through the computation of the eigenvalues for small
perturbations, and also by direct simulations. Finally, we demonstrate a
virtually exact (in the numerical sense) composition relation between nonlinear
Bloch waves and solitons.
