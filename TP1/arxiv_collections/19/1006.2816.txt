Object-oriented programming has been considered a most promising method in
program development and maintenance. An important feature of object-oriented
programs (OOPs) is their reusability which can be achieved through the
inheritance of classes or reusable components.Dynamic program slicing is an
effective technique for narrowing the errors to the relevant parts of a program
when debugging. Given a slicing criterion, the dynamic slice contains only
those statements that actually affect the variables in the slicing criterion.
This paper proposes a method to dynamically slice object-oriented (00) programs
based on dependence analysis. It uses the Control Dependency Graph for object
program and other static information to reduce the information to be traced
during program execution. In this paper we present a method to find the dynamic
Slice of object oriented programs where we are finding the slices for object
and in case of function overloading.
