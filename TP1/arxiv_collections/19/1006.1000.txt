In the standard scenario of the Newtonian gravity, a late-type galaxy (i.e.,
a spiral galaxy) is well described by a disk and a bulge embedded in a halo
mainly composed by dark matter. In Brownstein-Moffat gravity, there is a claim
that late-type galaxy systems would not need to have halos, avoiding as a
result the dark matter problem, i.e., a modified gravity (non-Newtonian) would
account for the galactic structure with no need of dark matter. In the present
paper, we probe this claim via numerical simulations. Instead of using a
"static galaxy," where the centrifugal equilibrium is usually adopted, we probe
the Brownstein-Moffat gravity dynamically via numerical $N$-body simulations.
