Raman measurements on monolayer graphene folded back upon itself as an
ordered but skew-stacked bilayer (i.e. with interlayer rotation) presents new
mechanism for Raman scattering in sp2 carbons that arises in systems that lack
coherent AB interlayer stacking. Although the parent monolayer does not exhibit
a D-band, the interior of the skewed bilayer produces a strong two-peak Raman
feature near 1350 cm-1; one of these peaks is non-dispersive, unlike all
previously observed D-band features in sp2 carbons. Within a double-resonant
model of Raman scattering, these unusual features are consistent with a skewed
bilayer coupling, wherein one layer imposes a weak but well-ordered
perturbation on the other. The discrete Fourier structure of the rotated
interlayer interaction potential explains the unusual non-dispersive peak near
1350 cm-1.
