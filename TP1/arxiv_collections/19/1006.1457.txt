A systematic study of the effect of magnetic field (h) on Hubbard model has
been carried out at half filling within dynamical mean field theory. In
agreement with previous studies, we find a zero temperature itinerant
metamagnetic transition, reflected in the discontinuous changes in
magnetization as well as in the hysteresis, from a paramagnetic (PM) metallic
state to a polarized quasi-ferromagnetic (QFM) state, at intermediate and large
interaction strength ($U$). The jump in magnetization vanishes smoothly with
decreasing interaction strength, and at a critical $U$, the transition becomes
continuous. The region of `coexistence' of the PM and QFM solutions in the
field-$U$ plane obtained in this study agrees quantitatively with recent
numerical renormalization group calculations, thus providing an important
benchmark. We highlight the changes in dynamics and quasiparticle weight across
this transition. The effective mass increases sharply as the transition is
approached, exhibiting a cusp-like singularity at the critical field,and
decreases with field monotonically beyond the transition. We conjecture that
the first order metamagnetic transition is a result of the competition between
Kondo screening, that tries to quench the local moments, and Zeeman coupling,
which induces polarization and hence promotes local moment formation. A
comparison of our theoretical results with experiments on $^{3}He$ indicate
that, a theory of $^{3}He$ based on the half-filled Hubbard model places it in
a regime of intermediate interaction strength.
