Ultra-luminous infrared galaxies are among the most luminous objects in the
local universe and are thought to be powered by intense star formation. It has
been shown that in these objects the rotational spectral lines of molecular
hydrogen observed at mid-infrared wavelengths are not affected by dust
obscuration, leaving unresolved the source of excitation of this emission. Here
I report an analysis of archival Spitzer Space Telescope data on ultra-luminous
infrared galaxies and demonstrate that star formation regions are buried inside
optically thick clouds of gas and dust, so that dust obscuration affects
star-formation indicators but not molecular hydrogen. I thereby establish that
the emission of H_2 is not co-spatial with the buried starburst activity and
originates outside the obscured regions. This is rather surprising in light of
the standard view that H_2 emission is directly associated with star-formation
activity. Instead, I propose that H_2 emission in these objects traces shocks
in the surrounding material, which are in turn excited by interactions with
nearby galaxies, and that powerful large-scale shocks cooling by means of H_2
emission may be much more common than previously thought. In the early
universe, a boost in H_2 emission by this process may speed up the cooling of
matter as it collapsed to form the first stars and galaxies and would make
these first structures more readily observable.
