When four-dimensional general relativity is embedded in an unconstrained
man-ner in a fifth dimension, the physical quantities of spacetime can be
interpreted as geometrical properties related to the extra dimension. It has
become widespread to view the ten Einstein equations and the source terms of
the energy-momentum tensor in this way. We now assign physical meanings to the
other five equations involved. The scalar field acts like gravity, but concerns
inertial as opposed to gravitational mass. The other four equations are
conservation laws for 4D dynamics, but where the mass of a test particle is
related to a local value of the cosmological 'constant'. Ways of testing these
identifications are suggested.
