We construct a universal secure network coding. Our construction just
modifies the transmission scheme at the source node and works with every linear
coding at an intermediate node. We relax the security criterion such that the
mutual information between the message and the eavesdropped signal is
sufficiently small instead of strictly zero. Our construction allows the set of
eavesdropped links to change at each time slot.
