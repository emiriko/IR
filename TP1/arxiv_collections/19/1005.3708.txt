Nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetization measurements were used to probe
the magnetic features of single-crystalline Bi(Cu(1-x)Znx)2PO6 with 0<x<0.05 at
temperatures between 2.6 K and 300 K. The simple lineshape of the 31P NMR
signals of the pristine compound changes considerably for x>0 and we present
clear evidence for a temperature dependent variation of the local magnetization
close to the Zn sites. The generic nature of this observation is indicated by
results of model calculations on appropriate spin systems of limited size
employing QMC methods.
