The availability of the double-differential charged-current neutrino cross
section, measured by the MiniBooNE collaboration using a carbon target, allows
for a systematic comparison of nuclear effects in quasi-elastic electron and
neutrino scattering. The results of our study, based on the impulse
approximation scheme and a state-of-the-art model of the nuclear spectral
functions, suggest that the electron cross section and the flux averaged
neutrino cross sections, corresponding to the same target and comparable
kinematical conditions, cannot be described within the same theoretical
approach using the value of the nucleon axial mass obtained from deuterium
measurements. We analyze the assumptions underlying the treatment of electron
scattering data, and argue that the description of neutrino data will require a
new {\em paradigm}, suitable for application to processes in which the lepton
kinematics is not fully determined.
