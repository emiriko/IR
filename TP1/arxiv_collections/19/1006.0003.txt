The global electroweak fit of the Standard Model (SM) with Gfitter can be
used to constrain yet unknown SM parameters, such as the Higgs mass, but also
physics beyond the SM (BSM) via the formalism of oblique parameters. This paper
presents updated results of the Gfitter SM fit using the latest available
electroweak precision measurements and the recent combination of direct Higgs
searches at the Tevatron. In addition, newly obtained constraints on BSM
models, such as models with extra dimensions, little Higgs and a fourth fermion
generation, are presented. While a light Higgs mass is preferred by the fit in
the SM, significantly larger Higgs masses are allowed in these new physics
models.
