We define sparse saturated fusion systems and show that, for odd primes,
sparse systems are constrained. This simplifies the proof of the
Glauberman-Thompson p-nilpotency theorem for fusion systems and a related
theorem of Stellmacher. We then define a more restrictive class of saturated
fusion systems, called extremely sparse, that are constrained for all primes.
