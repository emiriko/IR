We study numerically the thermalisation and temporal evolution of the reduced
density matrix for a two-site subsystem of a fermionic Hubbard model prepared
far from equilibrium at a definite energy. Even for very small systems near
quantum degeneracy, the subsystem can reach a steady state resembling
equilibrium. This occurs for a non-perturbative coupling between the subsystem
and the rest of the lattice where relaxation to equilibrium is Gaussian in
time, in sharp contrast to perturbative results. We find similar results for
random couplings, suggesting such behaviour is generic for small systems.
