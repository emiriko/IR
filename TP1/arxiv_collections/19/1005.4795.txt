The Hubbard model with strong correlations is treated in the many-electron
representation of Hubbard's operators. The regions of stability of saturated
and non-saturated ferromagnetism in the n-U plane for the square and simple
cubic lattices are calculated. The role of the bare density of states
singularities for the magnetic phase diagram is discussed. A comparison with
the results of previous works is performed.
