At the LHC combinatorics make it unlikely that we will be able to observe
stop pair production with a decay to a semi-leptonic top pair and missing
energy for generic supersymmetric mass spectra. Using a Standard-Model top
tagger on fully hadronic top decays we can not only extract the stop signal but
also measure the top momentum. To illustrate the promise of tagging tops with
moderate boost we include a detailed discussion of our HEPTopTagger algorithm.
