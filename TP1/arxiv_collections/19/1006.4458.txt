Existing models for ranking documents(mostly in world wide web) are prestige
based. In this article, three algorithms to objectively judge the merit of a
document are proposed - 1) Citation graph maxflow 2) Recursive Gloss Overlap
based intrinsic merit scoring and 3) Interview algorithm. A short discussion on
generic judgement and its mathematical treatment is presented in introduction
to motivate these algorithms.
