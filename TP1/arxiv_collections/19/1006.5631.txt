We explore the influence of the deformation on the nuclear matrix elements of
the neutrinoless double beta decay (NME), concluding that the difference in
deformation -or more generally in the amount of quadrupole correlations-
between parent and grand daughter nuclei quenches strongly the decay. We
correlate these differences with the seniority structure of the nuclear wave
functions. In this context, we examine the present discrepancies between the
NME's obtained in the framework of the Interacting Shell Model and the
Quasiparticle RPA. We surmise that part of the discrepancy can be due to the
limitations of the spherical QRPA in treating nuclei which have strong
quadrupole correlations. We surmise that the NME's in a basis of generalized
seniority are approximately model independent, i. e. they are "universal".
