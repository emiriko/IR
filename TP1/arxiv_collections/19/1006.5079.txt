The autocorrelation of an asteroseismic time series has been identified as a
powerful tool capable of providing measurements of the large frequency
separations. The performance of this method has been assessed and quantified by
Mosser & Appourchaux (2009). We propose now an automated pipeline based on it
and describe its performance.
