We present the optical spectra of a sample of 34 SWIRE-CDFS sources observed
with EFOSC2 on the ESO 3.6m Telescope. We have used the spectra and
spectroscopic redshifts to validate our photometric redshift codes and SED
template fitting methods. 12 of our sources are Infrared Luminous Galaxies. Of
these, five belong to the class of ULIRGs and one to the class of HLIRGs with
evidence of both an AGN and starburst component contributing to their extreme
infrared luminosity for 3, starburst contributing for 1 and AGN contributing
for 2 of them.
