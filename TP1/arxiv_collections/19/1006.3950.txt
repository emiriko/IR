We present a novel homogeneous and geometrically flat exact solution of
Einstein's General Relativity equations for an ideal fluid. The solution, which
describes an expanding/contracting hypercylinder, fits well with the
observational pillars upon which rely the standard FLRW cosmology and,
furthermore, it can naturally solve some of its most outstanding problems.
