The purpose of this paper is to explain clearly why nonlocality must be an
essential part of the theory of relativity. In the standard local version of
this theory, Lorentz invariance is extended to accelerated observers by
assuming that they are pointwise inertial. This locality postulate is exact
when dealing with phenomena involving classical point particles and rays of
radiation, but breaks down for electromagnetic fields, as field properties in
general cannot be measured instantaneously. The problem is corrected in
nonlocal relativity by supplementing the locality postulate with a certain
average over the past world line of the observer.
