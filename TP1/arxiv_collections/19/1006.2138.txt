We have performed a Monte Carlo study of the classical XY-model on
two-dimensional Sierpinski gaskets of several cluster sizes. From the
dependence of the helicity modulus on the cluster size we conclude that there
is no phase transition in this system at a finite temperature. This is in
agreement with previous findings for the harmonic approximation to the XY-model
on Sierpinski gasket and is analogous to the absence of finite temperature
phase transition for the Ising model on fractals with a finite order of
ramification.
