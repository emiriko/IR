A recently proposed "DFT+dispersion" treatment (Rajchel et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett., 2010, 104, 163001) is described in detail and illustrated by more
examples. The formalism derives the dispersion-free density functional theory
(DFT) interaction energy and combines it with the dispersion energy from
separate DFT calculations. It consists in the self-consistent polarization of
DFT monomers restrained by the exclusion principle via the Pauli blockade
technique. Within the monomers a complete exchange-correlation potential should
be used, but between them only the exact exchange operates. The applications to
wide range of molecular complexes from rare-gas dimers to H-bonds to
pi-electron interactions show good agreement with benchmark values.
