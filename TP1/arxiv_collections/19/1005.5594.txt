In this work, we consider the problem of reconstructing a small anomaly in a
viscoelastic medium from wave-field measurements. We choose Szabo's model to
describe the viscoelastic properties of the medium. Expressing the ideal
elastic field without any viscous effect in terms of the measured field in a
viscous medium, we generalize the imaging procedures, such as time reversal,
Kirchhoff Imaging and Back propagation, for an ideal medium to detect an
anomaly in a visco-elastic medium from wave-field measurements.
