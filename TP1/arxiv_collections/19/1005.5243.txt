We investigate the structure of the wind in the neutron star X-ray binary
system Vela X-1 by analyzing its flaring behavior. Vela X-1 shows constant
flaring, with some flares reaching fluxes of more than 3.0 Crab between 20-60
keV for several 100 seconds, while the average flux is around 250 mCrab. We
analyzed all archival INTEGRAL data, calculating the brightness distribution in
the 20-60 keV band, which, as we show, closely follows a log-normal
distribution. Orbital resolved analysis shows that the structure is strongly
variable, explainable by shocks and a fluctuating accretion wake. Analysis of
RXTE ASM data suggests a strong orbital change of N_H. Accreted clump masses
derived from the INTEGRAL data are on the order of 5 x 10^19 -10^21 g. We show
that the lightcurve can be described with a model of multiplicative random
numbers. In the course of the simulation we calculate the power spectral
density of the system in the 20-100 keV energy band and show that it follows a
red-noise power law. We suggest that a mixture of a clumpy wind, shocks, and
turbulence can explain the measured mass distribution. As the recently
discovered class of supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXT) seems to show the
same parameters for the wind, the link between persistent HMXB like Vela X-1
and SFXT is further strengthened.
