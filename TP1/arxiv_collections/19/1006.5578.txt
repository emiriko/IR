We consider the supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model with neutrino
Yukawa interactions and R-parity violation. We found that R-parity breaking
term \lambda \nu H_u H_d leads to an additional F-type contribution to the
Higgs scalar potential, and thus to the masses of supersymmetric Higgs bosons.
The most interesting consequence is the modification of the tree-level
expression for the lightest neutral supersymmetric Higgs boson mass. It appears
that due to this contribution the bound on the lightest Higgs mass may be
shifted upwards, thus slightly opening the part of the model parameter space
excluded by non-observation of the light Higgs boson at LEP in the framework of
the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.
