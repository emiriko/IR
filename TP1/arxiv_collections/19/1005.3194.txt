We report significant influence of electric current on the orbital
order-disorder transition in LaMnO3. The transition temperature T_OO, thermal
hysteresis in the resistivity (rho) versus temperature (T) plot around T_OO,
and latent heat L associated with the transition decrease with the increase in
current density. Eventually, at a critical current density, L reaches zero. The
transition zone, on the other hand, broadens with the increase in current
density. The states at ordered, disordered, and transition zone are all found
to be stable within the time window from ~10^-3 to ~10^4 seconds.
