The effects of quantum fluctuations due to directional anisotropy and
frustration between nearest neighbors and next-nearest neighbors of the quantum
spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice are investigated using
spin-wave expansion. We have calculated the spin-wave energy dispersion in the
entire Brillouin zone, renormalized spin-wave velocities, and the magnetization
up to second order in 1/S expansion for the antiferromagnetic Neel and
collinear antiferromagnetic stripe phases. It is shown that the second-order
corrections become significant with increase in frustration. With these
corrections magnetizations and spin-wave velocities for both the phases become
zero at the quantum critical points as expected from other numerical and
analytical methods. We have shown that the transition between the two ordered
phases are always separated by the disordered paramagnetic phase.
