Quantum Analogical Modeling (QAM) works under the assumption that the correct
exemplar-based description for a system of behavior minimizes the overall
uncertainty of the system. The measure used in QAM differs from the traditional
logarithmic measure of uncertainty; instead QAM uses a quadratic measure of
disagreement between pairs of exemplars. (This quadratic measure parallels the
squaring function holding between the amplitude and the probability for a state
function in quantum mechanics.) QAM eliminates all supracontexts (contextual
groupings of exemplars) that fail to minimize the number of disagreements. The
resulting system thus distinguishes between homogeneous and heterogeneous
supracontexts and uses only exemplars in homogeneous supracontexts to predict
behavior. This paper revises earlier work on QAM (in 2005) by showing that
homogeneity for a supracontext can be most simply determined by discovering
whether there are any heterogeneous pointers between any of the supracontext's
exemplars. A pointer for a pair of exemplars is heterogeneous whenever those
two exemplars are found in different subcontexts of the supracontext and take
different outcomes.
