We performed far-infrared optical spectroscopy measurements on the heavy
fermion compound URu 2 Si 2 as a function of temperature. The light's
electric-field was applied along the a-axis or the c-axis of the tetragonal
structure. We show that in addition to a pronounced anisotropy, the optical
conductivity exhibits for both axis a partial suppression of spectral weight
around 12 meV and below 30 K. We attribute these observations to a change in
the bandstructure below 30 K. However, since these changes have no noticeable
impact on the entropy nor on the DC transport properties, we suggest that this
is a crossover phenomenon rather than a thermodynamic phase transition.
