TBA equations for two-particle states from the sl(2) sector proposed by
Arutyunov, Suzuki and the author are solved numerically for the Konishi
operator descendent up to 't Hooft's coupling lambda ~ 2046. The data obtained
is used to analyze the properties of Y-functions and address the issue of the
existence of the critical values of the coupling. In addition we find a new
integral representation for the BES dressing phase which substantially reduces
the computational time.
