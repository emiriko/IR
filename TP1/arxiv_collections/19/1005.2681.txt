Neutrinos emitted from a supernova encode useful information about neutrino
physics and astrophysics. Interpreting the neutrino signal depends crucially on
understanding neutrino production, flavor mixing during propagation, and
detection. In this talk, we review the physics potential of a SN neutrino
observation.
