We examine perfect information stochastic mean-payoff games - a class of
games containing as special sub-classes the usual mean-payoff games and parity
games. We show that deterministic memoryless strategies that are optimal for
discounted games with state-dependent discount factors close to 1 are optimal
for priority mean-payoff games establishing a strong link between these two
classes.
