We introduce the notion of quantum dissension for a three-qubit system as a
measure of quantum correlations. We use three equivalent expressions of
three-variable mutual information. Their differences can be zero classically
but not so in quantum domain. It generalizes the notion of quantum discord to a
multipartite system. There can be multiple definitions of the dissension
depending on the nature of projective measurements done on the subsystems. As
an illustration, we explore the consequences of these multiple definitions and
compare them for three-qubit pure and mixed GHZ and W states. We find that
unlike discord, dissension can be negative. This is because measurement on a
subsystem may enhance the correlations in the rest of the system. This approach
can pave a way to generalize the notion of quantum correlations in the
multiparticle setting.
