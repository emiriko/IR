We have fabricated C-Ga-O nanowires by gallium focused ion beam-induced
deposition from the carbon-based precursor phenanthrene. The electrical
conductivity of the nanowires is weakly temperature dependent below 300 K, and
indicates a transition to a superconducting state below Tc = 7 K. We have
measured the temperature dependence of the upper critical field Hc2(T), and
estimate a zero temperature critical field of 8.8 T. The Tc of this material is
approximately 40% higher than that of any other direct write nanowire, such as
those based on C-W-Ga, expanding the possibility of fabricating direct-write
nanostructures that superconduct above liquid helium temperatures
