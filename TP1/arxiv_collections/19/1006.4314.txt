Using the formalism of extended $N=4$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics we
consider the procedure of the construction of multi--well potentials. We
demostrate the form--invariance of Hamiltonians entering the supermultiplet,
using the presented relation for integrals, which contain fundamental
solutions. The possibility of partial $N=4$ supersymmetry breaking is
determined. We also obtain exact forms of multi--well potentials, both
symmetric and asymmetric, using the Hamiltonian of harmonic oscillator as
initial. The modification of the shape of potentials due to variation of
parameters is also discussed, as well as application of the obtained results to
the study of tunneling processes.
