We study Fiske steps in small Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x mesa structures, containing
only few stacked intrinsic Josephson junctions. Careful alignment of magnetic
field prevents penetration of Abrikosov vortices and facilitates observation of
a large variety of high quality geometrical resonances, including superluminal
with velocities larger than the slowest velocity of electromagnetic waves. A
small number of junctions limits the number of resonant modes and allows
accurate identification of modes and velocities. It is shown that superluminal
geometrical resonances can be excited by subluminal fluxon motion and that
flux-flow itself becomes superluminal at high magnetic fields. We argue that
observation of high-quality superluminal geometrical resonances is crucial for
realization of the coherent flux-flow oscillator in the THz frequency range.
