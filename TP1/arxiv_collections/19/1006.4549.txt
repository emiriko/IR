This paper describes an implemented system which is designed to support the
deployment of applications offering distributed services, comprising a number
of distributed components. This is achieved by creating high level placement
and topology descriptions which drive tools that deploy applications consisting
of components running on multiple hosts. The system addresses issues of
heterogeneity by providing abstractions over host-specific attributes yielding
a homogeneous run-time environment into which components may be deployed. The
run-time environments provide secure binding mechanisms that permit deployed
components to bind to stored data and services on the hosts on which they are
running.
