We present a quantization scheme for a three-player Prisoner's Dilemma game.
It is shown that entanglement plays a dominant role in the three-player quantum
game. Four different types of payoffs are identified on the basis of different
combinations of initial state and measurement basis entanglement parameters. A
relation among these different payoffs is also established. We also study the
communication aspects of the three-player game. By exploiting different
combinations of initial state and measurement basis entanglement parameters, we
establish a relationship for the information shared among the parties. It is
seen that the strategies of the players act as carriers of information in
quantum games.
