We calculate heating rate, attractive conservative and tangential dissipative
fluctuation electromagnetic forces felt by a thick plate moving with
nonrelativistic velocity parallel to a closely spaced another plate in rest
using relativistic fluctuation electrodynamics. We argue that recently
developed relativistic out of equilibrium theory of fluctuation electromagnetic
interactions (Volokitin et. al., Phys.Rev. B78, 155437 (2008))has serious
drawbacks.
