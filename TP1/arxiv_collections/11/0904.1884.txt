We describe how the large scale geometry of the circumstellar envelopes of
asymptotic giant branch stars can be used to probe the presence of unseen
stellar companions. A nearby companion modifies the mass loss by
gravitationally focusing the wind towards the orbital plane, and thereby
determines the shape of the envelope at large distances from the star. Using
available simulations, we develop a prescription for the observed shapes of
envelopes in terms of the binary parameters, envelope orientation, and type of
observation. The prescription provides a tool for the analysis of envelope
images at optical, infrared, and millimetre wavelengths, which can be used to
constrain the presence of companions in well observed cases. We illustrate this
approach by examining the possible role of binary companions in triggering the
onset of axi-symmetry in planetary nebula formation. If interaction with the
primary leads to axi-symmetry, the spherical halos widely seen around newly
formed nebulae set limits on the companion mass. Only low mass objects may
orbit close to the primary without observable shaping effects: they remain
invisible until the interaction causes a sudden change in the mass loss
geometry.
