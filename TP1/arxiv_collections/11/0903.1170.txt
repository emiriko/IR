This paper summarizes the known physics of turbulent jets observed in
laboratory experiments. The formula, which gives the power released in
turbulence describes the concentration of turbulence/relativistic particles in
each point of the astrophysical jets. The same expression is also used to
analyze the power released in turbulence in the case of pipe and non Newtonian
fluids. Through an integral operation it is possible to deduce the intensity of
synchrotron radiation for a profile perpendicular or not to a straight jet, a
2D map for a perpendicular, randomly oriented straight jet as well as a 2D map
of complex trajectories such as NCC4061 and 3C31. Presented here is a
simulation of the spectral index in brightness of 3C273 as well as a 2D map of
the degree of linear polarization. The Sobel operator is applied to the
theoretical 2D maps of straight perpendicular jets.
