We describe the relation between simple logarithmic CFTs associated with
closed and open strings, and their "infinite metric" limits, corresponding to
the beta-gamma systems. This relation is studied on the level of the BRST
complex: we show that the consideration of metric as a perturbation leads to a
certain deformation of the algebraic operations of the Lian-Zuckerman type on
the vertex algebra, associated with the beta-gamma systems. The Maurer-Cartan
equations corresponding to this deformed structure in the quasiclassical
approximation lead to the nonlinear field equations. As an explicit example, we
demonstrate, that using this construction, Yang-Mills equations can be derived.
This gives rise to a nontrivial relation between the Courant-Dorfman algebroid
and homotopy algebras emerging from the gauge theory. We also discuss possible
algebraic approach to the study of beta-functions in sigma-models.
