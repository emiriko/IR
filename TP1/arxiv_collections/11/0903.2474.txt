Various early-type dwarf galaxies with disk features were identified in the
Virgo cluster, including objects that display weak grand-design spiral arms
despite being devoid of gas. Are these still related to the classical dEs, or
are they a continuation of ordinary spiral galaxies? Kinematical information of
acceptable quality is available for one of these galaxies, IC 3328. We perform
an investigation of its dynamical configuration, taking into account the effect
of asymmetric drift, and using the Toomre parameter as well as density wave
considerations. The derived mass-to-light ratios and rotational velocities
indicate the presence of a significant dynamically hot component in addition to
the disk. However, unambiguous conclusions need to await the availability of
further data for this and other early-type dwarfs with spiral structure.
