We study models in which a light scalar dark energy particle couples to the
gauge fields of the electroweak force, the photon, Z and W bosons. Our analysis
applies to a large class of interacting dark energy models, including those in
which the dark energy mass can be adjusted to evade fifth-force bounds by the
so-called chameleon mechanism. We conclude that--with the usual choice of Higgs
sector--electroweak precision observables are screened from the indirect
effects of dark energy, making such corrections effectively unobservable at
present-day colliders, and limiting the dark energy discovery potential of any
future International Linear Collider. We show that a similar screening effect
applies to processes mediated by flavour-changing neutral currents, which can
be traced to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani mechanism. However, Higgs boson
production at the Large Hadron Collider via weak boson fusion may receive
observable corrections.
