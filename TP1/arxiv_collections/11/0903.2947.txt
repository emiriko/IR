Charmonia are flavour singlet mesons and thus in principle contributions from
disconnected quark line diagrams might affect their masses, either directly or
via mixing with other flavour singlet channels. We present a first study that
takes both effects into account. We employ improved stochastic all-to-all
propagator techniques (including new methods) to calculate the diagrams that
appear within the mixing matrix between the $\eta'$ and the $\eta_c$. The runs
are initially performed on $N_f=2$ $16^3\times 32$ configurations with the
non-perturbatively improved Sheikholeslami-Wilson action, both for valence and
sea quarks.
