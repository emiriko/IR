We study intrinsic localized modes (ILMs), or solitons, in arrays of
parametrically-driven nonlinear resonators with application to
microelectromechanical and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS). The
analysis is performed using an amplitude equation in the form of a nonlinear
Schroedinger equation with a term corresponding to nonlinear damping (also
known as a forced complex Ginzburg-Landau equation), which is derived directly
from the underlying equations of motion of the coupled resonators, using the
method of multiple scales. We investigate the creation, stability, and
interaction of ILMs, show that they can form bound states, and that under
certain conditions one ILM can split into two. Our findings are confirmed by
simulations of the underlying equations of motion of the resonators, suggesting
possible experimental tests of the theory.
