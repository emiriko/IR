We study the dynamical stability of the entanglement between the two spin
ensembles in the presence of an environment. For a comparative study, we
consider the two cases: a single spin ensemble, and two ensembles linearly
coupled to a bath, respectively. In both circumstances, we assume the validity
of the Markovian approximation for the bath. We examine the robustness of the
state by means of the growth of the linear entropy which gives a measure of the
purity of the system. We find out macroscopic entangled states of two spin
ensembles can stably exist in a common bath. This result may be very useful to
generate and detect macroscopic entanglement in a common noisy environment and
even a stable macroscopic memory.
