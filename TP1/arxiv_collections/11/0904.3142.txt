In this paper we extend the notion of a locally hypercyclic operator to that
of a locally hypercyclic tuple of operators. We then show that the class of
hypercyclic tuples of operators forms a proper subclass to that of locally
hypercyclic tuples of operators. What is rather remarkable is that in every
finite dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, a pair of
commuting matrices exists which forms a locally hypercyclic, non-hypercyclic
tuple. This comes in direct contrast to the case of hypercyclic tuples where
the minimal number of matrices required for hypercyclicity is related to the
dimension of the vector space. In this direction we prove that the minimal
number of diagonal matrices required to form a hypercyclic tuple on
$\mathbb{R}^n$ is $n+1$, thus complementing a recent result due to Feldman.
