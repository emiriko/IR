Fundamental mysteries remain regarding the physics of Type Ia supernovae
(SNIa) and their stellar progenitors. We argue here that important clues to
these questions may emerge by the identification of those SNIa that occur in
extragalactic globular clusters--stellar systems with well defined ages and
metallicities. We estimate an all-sky rate of approximately 0.1 eta (D/100
Mpc)^3 per year for SNIa in globular clusters within a distance D, where eta is
the rate enhancement per unit mass as a result of dynamical production channels
that are inaccessible in the galactic field. If eta is approximately 2-10, as
suggested by observations and theory, the combined efforts of accurate
supernova astrometry and deep follow-up imaging should identify the > 1% of
nearby (D < 100 Mpc) SNIa that occur in globular clusters.
