The continual model of the nonuniform magnetism in thin films and wires of a
diluted magnetic semiconductor is considered with taking into account the
finite spin polarization of carriers responsible for the indirect interaction
of magnetic impurities (e.g. via RKKY mechanism). Spatial distributions (across
the film thickness or the wire radius) of the magnetizaton and carrier
concentrations of different spin orientations, as well as the temperature
dependence of the average magnetization are determined as the solution of the
nonlinear integral equation.
