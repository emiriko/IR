We report the discovery of burst oscillations from the intermittent
accretion-powered millisecond pulsar (AMP) HETE J1900.1-2455, with a frequency
approximately 1 Hz below the known spin frequency. The burst oscillation
properties are far more similar to those of the non-AMPs and Aql X-1 (an
intermittent AMP with a far lower duty cycle), than those of the AMPs SAX
J1808.4-3658 and XTE J1814-338. We discuss the implications for models of the
burst oscillation and intermittency mechanisms.
