We consider the cumulant expansion of the PAM employing the hybridization as
perturbation (Phys. Rev. B 50, 17933 (1994)), and we obtain formally exact
one-electron Green's functions (GF). These GF contain effective cumulants that
are as difficult to calculate as the original GF, and the Atomic Approximation
consists in substituting the effective cumulants by the ones that correspond to
the atomic case, namely by taking a conduction band of zeroth width and local
hybridization. This approximation has already been used for the case of
infinite electronic repulsion U (Phys. Rev. B 62, 7882 (2000)), and here we
extend the treatment to the case of finite U. The method can also be applied to
the single impurity Anderson model (SIAM), and we give explicit expressions of
the approximate GF both for the PAM and the SIAM.
