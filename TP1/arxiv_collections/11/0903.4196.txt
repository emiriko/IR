We derive the non-universal gaugino mass ratios in a supergravity (SUGRA)
framework where the Higgs superfields belong to the non-singlet representations
{\bf 54} and {\bf 770} in a SO(10) Grand Unified Theory (GUT). We evaluate the
ratios for the phenomenologically viable intermediate breaking chain $SU(4)_C
\times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R (G_{422})$. After a full calculation of the
gaugino mass ratios, noting some errors in the earlier calculation for {\bf
54}, we obtain, using the renormalisation group equations (RGE), interesting
low scale phenomenology of such breaking patterns. Here, we assume the breaking
of the SO(10) GUT group to the intermediate gauge group and that to the
Standard Model (SM) take place at the GUT scale itself. We also study the
collider signatures in multilepton channels at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
for some selected benchmark points allowed by the cold dark matter relic
density constraint provided by the WMAP data and compare these results with the
minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) framework with similar gluino masses indicating
their distinguishability in this regard.
