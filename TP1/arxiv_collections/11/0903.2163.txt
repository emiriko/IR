We show that the origin of the universal optical conductivity in a normal
$N$-layer graphene multilayer is an emergent chiral symmetry which guarantees
that $\sigma(\omega)=N\sigma_{uni}$ in both low and high frequency limits.
[$\sigma_{uni}=(\pi/2) e^2/h$]. We use this physics to relate intermediate
frequency conductivity trends to qualitative characteristics of the multilayer
stacking sequence.
