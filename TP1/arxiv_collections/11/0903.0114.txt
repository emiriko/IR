The blue emission of polyfluorene (PF) based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is
known to degrade due to a low energy green emission, which hitherto has been
attributed to oxidative defects. By studying the electroluminescence from
ethyl-hexyl substituted PF LEDs in the presence of oxygen and in an inert
atmosphere, and by using trace quantities of paramagnetic impurities (PM) in
the polymer, we show that the triplet states play a major role in the low
energy emission mechanism. Our time-dependent many-body studies show that there
is a large cross-section for the triplet formation in the electron-hole
recombination process in presence of PM, and intersystem crossing from excited
singlet to triplet states.
