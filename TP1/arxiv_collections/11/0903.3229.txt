The radiative recombination of a free electron into an excited state of a
bare, high-Z ion is studied, together with its subsequent decay, within the
framework of the density matrix theory and Dirac's relativistic equation.
Special attention is paid to the polarization and angular correlations between
the recombination and the decay photons. In order to perform a systematic
analysis of these correlations the general expression for the
double-differential recombination cross section is obtained by making use of
the resonance approximation. Based on this expression, detailed computations
for the linear polarization of x-ray photons emitted in the (e, 2\gamma)
two-step recombination of uranium ions U^92+ are carried out for a wide range
of projectile energies.
