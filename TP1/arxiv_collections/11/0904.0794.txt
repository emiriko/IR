The downscaling of optical systems to the micro and nano-scale results in
very compliant systems with nanogram-scale masses, which renders them
susceptible to optical forces. Here we show a specially designed resonant
structure for enabling efficient static control of the optical response with
relatively weak repulsive and attractive optical forces. Using attractive
gradient optical forces we demonstrate a static mechanical deformation of up to
20 nanometers in the resonator structure. This deformation is enough to shift
the optical resonances by roughly 80 optical linewidths.
