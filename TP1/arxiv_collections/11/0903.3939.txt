We study genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) in a system of $n$ qubits
prepared in symmetric Dicke states and subjected to the influences of noise. We
provide general, setup-independent expressions for experimentally favorable
tools such as fidelity- and collective spin-based entanglement witnesses, as
well as entangled-class discriminators and multi-point correlation functions.
Besides highlighting the effects of the environment on large qubit registers,
we also discuss strategies for the robust detection of GME. Our work provides
techniques and results for the experimental communities interested in
investigating and characterizing multipartite entangled states by introducing
realistic milestones for setup design and associated predictions.
