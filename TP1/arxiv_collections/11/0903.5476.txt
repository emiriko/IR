The dynamical degenerate four-wave mixing is studied analytically in detail.
By removing the unessential freedom, we first characterize this system by a
lower-dimensional closed subsystem of a deformed Maxwell-Bloch type, involving
only three physical variables: the intensity pattern, the dynamical grating
amplitude, the relative net gain. We then classify by the Painleve' test all
the cases when singlevalued solutions may exist, according to the two essential
parameters of the system: the real relaxation time tau, the complex response
constant gamma. In addition to the stationary case, the only two integrable
cases occur for a purely nonlocal response (Real(gamma)=0), these are the
complex unpumped Maxwell-Bloch system and another one, which is explicitly
integrated with elliptic functions. For a generic response (Re(gamma) not=0),
we display strong similarities with the cubic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation.
