Current-induced switching is considered in a magnetic junction. The junction
includes pinned and free ferromagnetic layers which work in the regime of the
high spin injection. It is shown that in such a regime the exchange
magnetization reversal threshold can be lowered up to two times when the axes
of the layers are noncollinear.
