In a recent paper a systematic study on shearing expansion-free spherically
symmetric distributions was presented. As a particular case of such systems,
the Skripkin model was mentioned, which corresponds to a nondissipative perfect
fluid with a constant energy density. Here we show that such a model is
inconsistent with junction conditions. It is shown that in general for any
nondissipative fluid distribution, the expansion-free condition requires the
energy density to be inhomogeneous. As an example we consider the case of dust,
which allows for a complete integration.
