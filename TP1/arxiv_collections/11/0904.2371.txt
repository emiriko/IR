We show that the excess in the Galactic electron flux recently published by
Chang, et al. (Nature, 20 Nov. 2008) can have a simple methodical origin due to
a contribution from misidentified proton induced electron-like events in the
ATIC detector. A subtraction of the cosmic ray proton component from the
published ATIC electron flux eliminates this excess in the range of 300 to 800
GeV.
