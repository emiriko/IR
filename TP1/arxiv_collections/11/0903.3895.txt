The DMTPC detector is a low-pressure CF4 TPC with optical readout for
directional detection of Dark Matter. The combination of the energy and
directional tracking information allows for an efficient suppression of all
backgrounds. The choice of gas (CF4) makes this detector particularly sensitive
to spin-dependent interactions.
