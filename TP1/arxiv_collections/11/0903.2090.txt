To search for the temporal variation of the fundamental constants one needs
to know dependence of atomic transition frequencies on these constants. We
study the dependence of the hyperfine structure of atomic $s$-levels on nuclear
radius and, via radius, on quark masses. An analytical formula has been derived
and tested by the numerical relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations for Rb,
Cd$^+$, Cs, Yb$^+$ and Hg$^+$. The results of this work allow the use of the
results of past and future atomic clock experiments and quasar spectra
measurements to put constrains on time variation of the quark masses.
