We study composite systems of light ($\rho$ and $\omega$) and heavy
  ($D^*$) vector mesons by using the interaction within the hidden gauge
formalism. We find a strong attraction in the isospin, spin channels
$(I,S)=(1/2,0)$; $(1/2,1)$; $(1/2,2)$ with positive parity. The attraction is
large enough to strongly bind these mesons in states with these quantum
numbers, leading to states which can be identified with $D_2^*(2460)$ and
probably with $D^*(2640)$, the last one without experimental spin and parity
assignment. In the case of $I=3/2$ one obtains repulsion and thus, no exotic
mesons in this sector are generated in the approach.
