We have studied theoretically, using density functional theory, several
materials properties when going from one C layer in graphene to two and three g
raphene layers and on to graphite. The properties we have focused on are the
elastic constants, electronic structure (energy bands and density of state s),
and the dielectric properties. For any of the properties we have investigated
the modification due to an increase in the number of graphene layers is within
a few percent. Our results are in agreement with the analysis presented
recently by Kopelevich and Esquinazi (unpublished).
