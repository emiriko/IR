A new scenario of hybrid-like inflation is considered without using
hybrid-type potential. Radiation raised continuously by a dissipating inflaton
field keeps symmetry restoration in a remote sector, and the false-vacuum
energy of the remote sector dominates the energy density during inflation.
Remote inflation is terminated when the temperature reaches the critical
temperature, or when the slow-roll condition is violated. Without introducing a
complex form of couplings, inflaton field may either roll-in (like a standard
hybrid inflation) or roll-out (like an inverted-hybrid model or quintessential
inflation) on arbitrary inflaton potential. Significant signatures of remote
inflation can be observed in the spectrum caused by (1) the inhomogeneous phase
transition in the remote sector, or (2) a successive phase transition in the
remote sector. Remote inflation can predict strong amplification or suppression
of small-scale perturbations without introducing multiple inflation. Since the
inflaton may have a run-away potential, it is also possible to identify the
inflaton with quintessence, without introducing additional mechanisms. Even if
the false-vacuum energy is not dominated by the remote sector, the phase
transition in the remote sector is possible during warm inflation, which may
cause significant amplification/suppression of the curvature perturbations.
