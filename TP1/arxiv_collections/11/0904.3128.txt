The low temperature heat capacity investigations on pure(y=0) and Zn-doped
La1.84Sr0.16Cu1-yZnyO4 samples have been performed in the interval of 1.8-60K
by a new method of high-precision, pulsed differential calorimetry (PDC), which
provides the measurements under the equilibrium conditions, in contrast to
commonly used differential scanning calorimeters (DSC). For these systems a new
heat capacity anomaly was observed, which is associated with Zn impurities and
has the form of one wide peak. It does not show a phonon character shifts
towards the higher temperatures with the increase of Zn content.
