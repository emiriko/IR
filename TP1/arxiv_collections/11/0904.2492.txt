We analyse the asymptotic behaviour of a nonlinear mathematical model of
cellular proliferation which describes the production of blood cells in the
bone marrow. This model takes the form of a system of two maturity structured
partial differential equations, with a retardation of the maturation variable
and a time delay depending on this maturity. We show that the stability of this
system depends strongly on the behaviour of the immature cells population. We
obtain conditions for the global stability and the instability of the trivial
solution.
