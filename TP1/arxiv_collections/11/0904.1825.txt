We present and categorize Spitzer IRS spectra of 294 objects in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to create the largest and most complete catalog of
massive young stellar object (YSO) spectra in the LMC. Target sources were
identified from infrared photometry and multi-wavelength images indicative of
young, massive stars highly enshrouded in their natal gas and dust clouds. Our
sample primarily consists of 277 objects we identify as having spectral
features indicative of embedded YSOs. The remaining sources are comprised of 7
C-rich evolved sources, 8 sources dominated by broad silicate emission, and 1
source with multiple broad emission features. Those with YSO-like spectra show
a range of spectral features including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
emission, deep silicate absorption, fine-structure lines, and ice absorption
features. Based upon the relative strengths of these features, we have
classified the YSO candidates into several distinct categories using the
widely-used statistical procedure known as principal component analysis. We
propose that these categories represent a spectrum of evolutionary stages
during massive YSO formation. We conclude that massive pre-main sequence stars
spend a majority of their massive, embedded lives emitting in the UV. Half of
the sources in our study have features typical of compact HII regions,
suggesting that massive YSOs can create a detectable compact HII region
half-way through the formation time present in our sample. This study also
provides a check on commonly used source-selection procedures including the use
of photometry to identify YSOs. We determine a high success rate (>95%) of
identifying objects with YSO-like spectra can be achieved through careful use
of infrared CMDs, SEDs, and image inspections.
