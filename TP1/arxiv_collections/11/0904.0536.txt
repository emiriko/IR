We present a reconstruction technique for simultaneous retrieval of
absorption and phase shifting properties of an object recorded by in-line
holography. The routine is experimentally tested by applying it to optical
holograms of a pure phase respectively amplitude object of micrometer
dimensions that has been machined into a glass-plate using a focused ion beam.
The method has also been applied to previously published electron holograms of
single DNA molecules.
