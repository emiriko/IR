We examine the appearance of a spin density wave in the FeAs parent compounds
due to an excitonic instability. Using a realistic four-band model, we show
that the magnetic state depends very sensitively upon the details of the band
structure. We demonstrate that an orthorhombic distortion of the crystal
enhances the stability of the antiferromagnetic order.
