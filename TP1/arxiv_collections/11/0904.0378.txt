We consider corrections to the unification of down-quark and charged-lepton
Yukawa couplings in supersymmetric GUTs, which links the large nu_tau-nu_mu
mixing angle to b -> s transitions. These corrections generically occur in
simple grand-unified models with small Higgs representations and affect s -> d
and b -> d transitions via the mixing of the corresponding right-handed
superpartners. On the basis of a specific SUSY-SO(10) model, we analyze the
constraints from K-Kbar and B-Bbar mixing on the additional
\tilde{d}_R-\tilde{s}_R rotation angle theta. We find that epsilon_K already
sets a stringent bound on theta, theta^{max}=O(1 degree), indicating a very
specific flavor structure of the correction operators. The impact of the large
neutrino mixings on the unitarity triangle analysis is also briefly discussed,
as well as their ability to account for the sizeable CP-violating phase
observed recently in B_s -> psi phi decays.
