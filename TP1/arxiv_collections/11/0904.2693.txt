In analogy to chapter 9 of arXiv:0709.3705 we define an intersection product
of tropical cycles on tropical linear spaces L^n_k, i.e. on tropical fans of
the type max{0,x_1,...,x_n}^(n-k)*R^n. Afterwards we use this result to obtain
an intersection product of cycles on every smooth tropical variety, i.e. on
every tropical variety that arises from gluing such tropical linear spaces. In
contrast to classical algebraic geometry these products always yield
well-defined cycles, not cycle classes only. Using these intersection products
we are able to define the pull-back of a tropical cycle along a morphism
between smooth tropical varieties. In the present article we stick to the
definitions, notions and concepts introduced in arXiv:0709.3705.
