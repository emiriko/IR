We describe a method by which the abundance of metals and the reddening of
globular clusters are simultaneously derived. The method is based on the
analysis of the shape of the red giant branch and V magnitude of the horizontal
branch on the V vs. (B-R) color-magnitude diagram for a cluster. The
application of our technique to the photometry of the globular cluster NGC7006
yields the metallicity $[Fe/H] = - 1.78 \pm0.11$ and the reddening $E_{B-R} =
0.^{m}25 \pm0.^{m}02$.
