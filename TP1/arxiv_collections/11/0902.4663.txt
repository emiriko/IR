Instead of evaluating the gradient field of the brightness map of an image,
we propose the use of dipole vectors. This approach is obtained by adapting to
the image gray-tone distribution the definition of the dipole moment of charge
distributions. We will show how to evaluate the dipoles and obtain a vector
field, which can be a good alternative to the gradient field in pattern
recognition.
