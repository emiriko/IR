We study the asymptotic behavior of almost-orbits of abstract evolution
systems in Banach spaces with or without a Lipschitz assumption. In particular,
we establish convergence, convergence in average and almost-convergence of
almost-orbits both for the weak and the strong topologies based on the behavior
of the orbits. We also analyze the set of almost-stationary points.
