This article is a survey on Lorenz knots. We describe the original
construction, prove several classical properties, in particular the fact that
the closure of a positive braid is a fibered knot, and describe
Ghys'correspondance between modular knots and Lorenz knots. We also prove two
new properties, namely that following Ghys' correspondance, the images of
trivial orbits of the Lorenz flow form a subgroup of the class group, and that
the reverse images of an element in the class group and of its inverse are
isotopic orbits.
