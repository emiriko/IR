Due to the strong effect of systematics/trends in variable star observations,
we employ the Trend Filtering Algorithm (TFA) on a subset of the MACHO database
and search for variable stars. TFA has been applied successfully in planetary
transit searches, where weak, short-lasting periodic dimmings are sought in the
presence of noise and various systematics (due to, e.g., imperfect flat
fielding, crowding, etc). These latter effects introduce colored noise in the
photometric time series that can lead to a complete miss of the signal. By
using a large number of available photometric time series of a given field, TFA
utilizes the fact that the same types of systematics appear in several/many
time series of the same field. As a result, we fit each target time series by a
(least-square-sense) optimum linear combination of templates and
frequency-analyze the residuals. Once a signal is found, we reconstruct the
signal by employing the full model, including the signal, systematics and
noise. We apply TFA on the brightest ~5300 objects from subsets of each of the
MACHO Large Magellanic Cloud fields #1 and #79. We find that the Fourier
frequency analysis performed on the original data detect some 60% of the
objects as trend-dominated. This figure decreases essentially to zero after
using TFA. Altogether, We detect 387 variables in the two fields, 183 of which
would have remained undetected without using TFA. Where possible, we give
preliminary classification of the variables found.
