We study the Monadic Second Order (MSO) Hierarchy over infinite pictures,
that is tilings. We give a characterization of existential MSO in terms of
tilings and projections of tilings. Conversely, we characterise logic fragments
corresponding to various classes of infinite pictures (subshifts of finite
type, so?c subshifts).
