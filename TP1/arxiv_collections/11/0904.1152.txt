General physics approach is applied to analysis of power components in
electrical systems under sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal conditions. Physical
essence of active, reactive and distorting powers are determinate. It is shown
that the all three powers are the different aspects of the same physical
phenomenon: mechanical action per time of Coulomb forces or inertial forces.
