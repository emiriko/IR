By revisiting an asymptotic integration theory of nonlinear ordinary
differential equations due to J.K. Hale and N. Onuchic [Contributions
Differential Equations 2 (1963), 61--75], we improve and generalize several
recent results in the literature. As an application, we study the existence of
bounded positive solutions to a large class of semi-linear elliptic partial
differential equations via the subsolution-supersolution approach.
