Strong Balmer absorption lines and the lack of Ha and [OII] emission lines
signify that E+As are post-starburst systems. Recent studies suggest that E+As
may undergo the transition from the `blue cloud' to the `red sequence' and
eventually migrate to red sequence ETGs. An observational validation of this
scenario is to identify the intervening galaxy population between E+As and the
red-sequence. Motivated by recent findings with GALEX that a large fraction of
ETGs exhibit UV-excess as a sign of RSF, we investigate the possible connection
of the UV-excess galaxies to E+As. In particular, we examine the FP scaling
relations of the largest sample of ~1,000 E+As selected from the SDSS and
~20,000 morphologically-selected SDSS ETGs with GALEX UV data. The FP
parameters, combined with stellar population indicators, reveal a certain group
of UV-excess ETGs that bridges between E+As and quiescent red galaxies. The
newly identified galaxies are the post-starburst systems characterized by
UV-excess but no Ha emission. This is a conceptual generalisation of "E+A", in
that the Balmer absorption line in the "E+A" definition is replaced with
UV-optical colours that are far more sensitive to RSF than the Balmer lines. We
refer to these UV-excess galaxies as "E+a" galaxies, which stands for
elliptical ("E") galaxies with a minority of A-type ("a") young stars. The
species are either (1) galaxies that experienced starbursts weaker than those
observed in E+As (1~10% of E+As, "mild E+As") or (2) the products of passively
evolved E+As after quenching star formation quite a while ago (~1 Gyr, "old
E+As"). We suggest that the latter type of E+a galaxies represents the most
recent arrival to the red sequence in the final phase of the "E+A" to "red
early-type" transition. (Abridged)
