We present a new code for the calculation of the 1D structure and synthetic
spectra of accretion disks. The code is an extension of the general purpose
stellar atmosphere code PHOENIX and is therefore capable of including extensive
lists of atomic and molecular lines as well as dust in the calculations. We
assume that the average viscosity can be represented by a critical Reynolds
number in a geometrically thin disk and solve the structure and radiative
transfer equations for a number of disk rings in the vertical direction. The
combination of these rings provides the total disk structure and spectrum.
Since the warm inner regions of protoplanetary disks show a rich molecular
spectrum, they are well suited for a spectral analysis with our models. In this
paper we test our code by comparing our models with high-resolution VLT CRIRES
spectra of the T Tauri star GQ Lup.
