An effective approach for construction of simple approximation for
description of non-ideality effects in classical one- and two-component plasma
model is under discussion. General constraints i.e. positiveness and
exponential type for radial distribution functions F2(r) combined with
normalizing (local electroneutrality) conditions, which validity is independent
on degree of non-ideality, are used for effective correction of several
well-known approximated forms of F(r). Resulting corrected forms F*(r) leads to
non-ideality corrections, which are asymptotically exact in the weak
non-ideality limit and at the same time have good extrapolating properties in
the strong non-ideality limit. The simplest example - corrected Debye-Hueckel
approximation - leads to simple and explicit form of such non-ideality
corrections. The same approach is applied to classical two-component plasma
model. Resulting corrected approximation gives smooth and plausible
interpolation between weak and strong non-ideality limits.
