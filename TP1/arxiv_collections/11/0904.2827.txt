Today, science have a powerful tool for the description of reality - the
numbers. However, the concept of number was not immediately, lets try to trace
the evolution of the concept. The numbers emerged as the need for accurate
estimates of the amount in order to permit a comparison of some objects. So if
you see to it how many times a day a person uses the numbers and compare, it
becomes evident that the comparison is used much more frequently. However, the
comparison is not possible without two opposite basic standards. Thus, to
introduce the concept of comparison, must have two opposing standards, in turn,
the operation of comparison is necessary to introduce the concept of number.
Arguably, the scientific description of reality is impossible without the
concept of opposites.
  In this paper analyzes the concept of opposites, as the basis for the
introduction of the principle of development.
