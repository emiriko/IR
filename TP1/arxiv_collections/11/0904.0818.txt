We calculate the self-similar longitudinal velocity correlation function, the
energy spectrum and the corresponding other properties using a theory on the
isotropic homogeneous turbulence just presented by the author in a previous
work. The correlation functions correspond to steady-state solutions of the
evolution equation under the self-similarity hypothesis introduced by von
K\'arm\'an. These solutions are numerically calculated and the results
adequately describe several properties of the isotropic turbulence.
