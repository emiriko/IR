Water-soluble clusters made from 7 nm inorganic nanoparticles have been
investigated by small-angle neutron scattering. The internal structure factor
of the clusters was derived and exhibited a universal behavior as evidenced by
a correlation hole at intermediate wave-vectors. Reverse Monte-Carlo
calculations were performed to adjust the data and provided an accurate
description of the clusters in terms of interparticle distance and volume
fraction. Additional parameters influencing the microstructure were also
investigated, including the nature and thickness of the nanoparticle adlayer.
