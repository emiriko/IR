There are several physical situations in which the `tangling' of a loop is
relevant: the game of cat's cradle is a simple example, but a more important
application involves the stirring of a fluid by rods. Here we discuss how
elementary topology constrains the types of mappings that can occur on a
surface, for example when the surface is the domain of a two-dimensional fluid.
