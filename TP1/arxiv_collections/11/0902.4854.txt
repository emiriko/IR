We present an approximation scheme for the dielectric response of thermal
collisionless plasmas at arbitrary degeneracy. A T-fraction representation is
obtained from the known expansions of the real part of the dielectric function
for small and large arguments. The partial numerators and denominators of the
continued fraction are generated by a modified Q-D algorithm. For several
typical values of the degeneracy parameter $\theta$, extensive tables for the
expansion coefficients and the partial numerators and denominations are given
allowing for an easy implementation of the fitting function. Also, an error
analysis is performed.
