Unintegrated parton distributions in the proton and nucleus are predicted by
a modified DGLAP equation incorporating the shadowing corrections, which
include exact energy-momentum conservation in each splitting and fusion
vertices. We find that the nuclear shadowing effects are obvious, although they
are far from the saturation limit. On the other hand, we point out that the
suppression of the unintegrated gluon distribution toward lower $k_t^2$ may
arise from the valence-like input rather than the saturation effects.
