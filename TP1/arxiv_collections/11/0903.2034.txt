The WMAP dark matter constraints on b-$\tau$ Yukawa Unification in the
presence of massive neutrinos is revisited. The predictions for the bottom
quark mass are observed to be modified by the large neutrino mixing suggested
by the data. This enables Yukawa unification also for large $\tan\beta$, and
for positive $\mu$ that were previously disfavoured. Consequently, the allowed
parameter space for neutralino dark matter differs from the MSSM one. We also
find that the parameter space being compatible with dark matter also predicts
detectable rates for Lepton Flavour Violation at the LHC.
