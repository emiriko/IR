The measurement of the ionization produced by particles in a medium presents
a great interest in several fields from metrology to particule physics and
cosmology. The ionization quenching factor is defined as the fraction of energy
released by ionisation by a recoil in a medium compared with its kinetic
energy. At low energy, in the range of a few keV, the ionization falls rapidly
and systematic measurement are needed. We have developped an experimental setup
devoted to the measurement of low energy (keV) ionization quenching factor for
the MIMAC project. The ionization produced in the gas has been measured with a
Micromegas detector filled with Helium gas mixture.
