We theoretically predict, with the Keldysh Green's function combined with the
Floquet method, that the AC electric field of a circularly polarized light
should induce a Hall effect, in the absence of uniform magnetic fields, in
graphene with a pair of Dirac dispersions. Although the Hall coefficient is not
quantized, the dynamical gap generated by the AC field and the associated Hall
effect bear a topological origin which can be traced back to the Dirac cones.
We also study the dependence on boundary conditions. The required AC field
strength is estimated to be realistic.
