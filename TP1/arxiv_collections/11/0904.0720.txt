Semi-analytical model for calculating acoustic response to a line-focused
laser pulse in an optically absorptive isotropic cylinder is proposed and
implemented. It is assumed that the laser input is absorbed over the volume and
thus creates a radially distributed thermoelastic source. Closed-form solution
is obtained in the Fourier domain. Two inverse Fourier transforms in frequency
and circumferential wave number yield the sought waveforms of acoustic response
in the time-space domain. Numerical simulation is compared to the calculation
based on a surface dipole source. The two signals have essentially different
shapes of the wave-arrival peaks when the optical penetration is large enough.
