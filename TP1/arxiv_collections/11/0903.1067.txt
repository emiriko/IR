The Scher-Lax-Phillips (SLP) universal minimalist model quantitatively
explains stretching fractions beta(Tg) for a wide variety of relaxation
experiments (nearly 50 altogether) on electronic and molecular glasses and
deeply supercooled liquids by assuming that quasi-particle excitations indexed
by Breit-Wigner channels diffuse to traps (sinks). This model is effective here
in discussing in detail three experiments: luminescence in isoelectronic
Zn(Se,Te) alloys, fibrous relaxation in orthoterphenyl (OTP) and related
glasses and melts up to 1.15Tg, and relaxation of binary chalcogen melts probed
by spin-polarized neutrons (T as high as 1.5Tg). The model is also compared to
several other recent theories.
