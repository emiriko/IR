We present an efficient and general method to identify promising candidate
configurations for thin-film oxides and to determine structural characteristics
of (metastable) thin-film structures using ab initio calculations. At the heart
of this method is the complexity of the oxide bulk structure, from which a
large number of thin films with structural building blocks, that is motifs,
from metastable bulk oxide systems can be extracted. These span a coarse but
well-defined network of initial configurations for which density functional
theory (DFT) calculations predict and implement dramatic atomic relaxations in
the corresponding, resulting thin-film candidates. The network of thin-film
candidates (for various film thicknesses and stoichiometries) can be ordered
according to their variation in ab initio total energy or in ab initio
equilibrium Gibbs free energy. Analysis of the relaxed atomic structures for
the most favored structures gives insight into the nature of stable and
metastable thin-film oxides. We investigate ultrathin alumina nucleated on TiC
as a model system to illustrate this method.
