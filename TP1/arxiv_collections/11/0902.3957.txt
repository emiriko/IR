By substituting the Fe with the 5d-transition metal Ir in SrFe2As2, we have
successfully synthesized the superconductor SrFe2-xIrxAs2 with Tc = 22.3 K at x
= 0.5. X-ray diffraction indicates that the material has formed the
ThCr2Si2-type structure with a space group I4/mmm. The temperature dependence
of resistivity and dc magnetization both reveal sharp superconducting
transitions at around 22 K. An estimate on the diamagnetization signal reveals
a high Meissner shielding volume. Interestingly, the normal state resistivity
exhibits a roughly linear behavior up to 300 K. The superconducting transitions
at different magnetic fields were also measured yielding a slope of -dHc2/dT =
3.8 T/K near Tc. Using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula, the upper
critical field at zero K is found to be about 58 T. Counting the possible
number of electrons doped into the system in SrFe2-xIrxAs2, we argue that the
superconductivity in the Ir-doped system is different from the Co-doped case,
which should add more ingredients to the underlying physics of the iron
pnictide superconductors.
