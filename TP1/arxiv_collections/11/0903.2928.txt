Unimodal maps have been broadly used as a base of new encryption strategies.
Recently, a stream cipher has been proposed in the literature, whose keystream
is basically a symbolic sequence of the (one-parameter) logistic map or of the
tent map. In the present work a thorough analysis of the keystream is made
which reveals the existence of some serious security problems
