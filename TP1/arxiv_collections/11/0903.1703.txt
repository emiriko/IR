The binding energies and matter distributions for the 3- body systems like
$\phi$- meson + 2N, 2$\phi$ + N and 4- body system like $\phi$+3n are
calculated. For the 3- particle systems two- dimensional Faddeev equations in
the differential form are used. For the 4- body system $\phi$+3n the folding
model is applied.
