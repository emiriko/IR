We present numerical evidence for the existence of new black hole solutions
in $d\geq 6$ spacetime dimensions. They approach asymptotically the Minkowski
background and have an event horizon topology $S^2\times S^{d-4}$. These static
solutions share the basic properties of the nonrotating black rings in five
dimensions, in particular the presence of a conical singularity.
