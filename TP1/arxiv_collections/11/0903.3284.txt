We describe the operation of a light pulse interferometer using cold 87Rb
atoms in reduced gravity. Using a series of two Raman transitions induced by
light pulses, we have obtained Ramsey fringes in the low gravity environment
achieved during parabolic flights. With our compact apparatus, we have operated
in a regime which is not accessible on ground. In the much lower gravity
environment and lower vibration level of a satellite, our cold atom
interferometer could measure accelerations with a sensitivity orders of
magnitude better than the best ground based accelerometers and close to proven
spaced-based ones.
