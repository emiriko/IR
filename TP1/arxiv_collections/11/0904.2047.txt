Based on the general description for Z'-Z-\gamma mixing as derived from the
electroweak chiral Lagrangian, we characterize and classify the various new
physics models involving the Z' boson that have appeared in the literature into
five classes: 1. Models with minimal Z'-Z mass mixing; 2. Models with minimal
Z'-Z kinetic mixing; 3. Models with general Z'-Z mixing; 4. Models with
Z'-\gamma kinetic and Z'-Z mixing; and 5. Models with Stueckelberg-type mixing.
The corresponding mixing matrices are explicitly evaluated for each of these
classes. We constrain and classify the Z' boson charges with respect to
quark-leptons by anomaly cancellation conditions.
