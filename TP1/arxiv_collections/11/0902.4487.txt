In agreement with a recent experimental discovery by Xia et. al. (2009), we
also find a sloshing mode in experiments on the large-scale circulation (LSC)
of turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection in a cylindrical sample of aspect ratio
one. The sloshing mode has the same frequency as the torsional oscillation
discovered by Funfschilling and Ahlers (2004). We show that both modes can be
described by an extension of a model developed previously [Brown and Ahlers
(2008)] which consists of permitting a lateral displacement of the LSC
circulation plane away from the vertical center line of the sample as well as a
variation in displacements with height (such displacements had been excluded in
the original model). Pressure gradients produced by the side wall of the
container on average center the plane of the LSC so that it prefers to reach
its longest diameter. If the LSC is displaced away from this diameter, the
walls provide a restoring force. Turbulent fluctuations drive the LSC away from
the central alignment, and combined with the restoring force they lead to
oscillations. These oscillations are advected along with the LSC. This model
predicts the correct wavenumber and phase of the oscillations, as well as
estimates of the frequency, amplitude, and probability distributions of the
displacements.
