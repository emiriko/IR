Type II-linear supernovae are thought to arise from progenitors that have
lost most of their H envelope by the time of the explosion, and they are poorly
understood because they are only occasionally discovered. It is possible that
they are intrinsically rare, but selection effects due to their rapid
luminosity evolution may also play an important role in limiting the number of
detections. In this context, the discovery of a subluminous type II-linear
event is even more interesting. We investigate the physical properties and
characterise the explosion site of the type II SN 1999ga, which exploded in the
nearby spiral galaxy NGC 2442. Spectroscopic and photometric observations of SN
1999ga allow us to constrain the energetics of the explosion and to estimate
the mass of the ejected material, shedding light on the nature of the
progenitor star in the final stages of its life. The study of the environment
in the vicinity of the explosion site provides information on a possible
relation between these unusual supernovae and the properties of the galaxies
hosting them. Despite the lack of early-time observations, we provide
reasonable evidence that SN 1999ga was probably a type II-linear supernova that
ejected a few solar masses of material, with a very small amount of radioactive
elements of the order of 0.01 solar masses.
