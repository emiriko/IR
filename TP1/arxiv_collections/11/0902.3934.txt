Multiplicity fluctuations and correlations are calculated within thermalized
relativistic ideal quantum gases. These are shown to be sensitive to the choice
of statistical ensemble as well as to the choice of acceptance window in
momentum space. It is furthermore shown that global conservation laws introduce
non-trivial correlations between disconnected regions in momentum space, even
in the absence of any dynamics.
