The dipole and the DGLAP approximations are combined with the $k_t$
factorization theorem to demonstrate the fundamental property of pQCD: smaller
is the size of the colorless quark-gluon configurations in the fragmentation
region, more rapid is the increase of its interaction with the target as a
function of energy. First, we show that the transverse momenta of the
quark(antiquark) within the $q\bar{q}$ pair, produced in the fragmentation
region by the strongly virtual photon, increase with the decrease of x for
fixed $Q^2$. As practical consequence of these effects we show that the cross
sections of DIS and DVCS. We predict that the ratio of DVCS to DIS amplitudes
should very slowly approach one from above at very large collision energies.
Second, we study a closely related phenomenon of the increase of the transverse
momenta with the energy of the characteristic transverse momenta of the
gluon/quark configurations responsible for the transition to the black disk
regime. We discuss the impact of this phenomenona on the slowing of the
dependence on the initial energy of the coherence length. We demonstrate that a
rapid projectile has the biconcave shape, which is different from the
expectations of the preQCD parton model where a fast hadron has a pancake
shape. We show that the increase of the transverse momenta leads to a new
expression for the total cross section of a DIS scattering at very large
energies, relevant to LHeC and LHC. We discuss the impact of the discovered
phenomena on the hard processes in pp collisions, and on the dominance
ofdifferent phases of chiral and conformal symmetries in the central and
peripheral pp, pA, and AA collisions.
