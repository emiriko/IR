The search for the Higgs boson and for physics beyond the Standard Model are
the major motivations behind the LHC experiment. In many scenarios the success
of the experiment depends on the knowledge of signal and background event rates
at least at one-loop precision. We present the approach of the \texttt{GOLEM}
collaboration to build a highly automated framework for the calculation of
matrix elements at the one-loop level, which is based on the evaluation of
Feynman diagrams. Part of this effort is an open-source library for the
numerical evaluation of tensor integrals. As an application, some results for
the process $pp\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ calculated with this method are presented.
