We obtained the first experimental evidence for the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
nature of ionospheric medium-scale travelling wave packets (MSTWP). We used
data on total electron content (TEC) measurements obtained at the dense
Japanese network GPS/GEONET (1220 stations) in 2008-2009. We found that the
diurnal, seasonal and spectral MSTWP characteristics are specified by the solar
terminator (ST) dynamics. MSTWPs are the chains of narrow-band TEC oscillations
with single packet's duration of about 1-2 hours and oscillation periods of
10-20 minutes. Their total duration is about 4--6 hours. The MSTWP spatial
structure is characterized by a high degree of anisotropy and coherence at the
distance of more than 10 wavelengths. The MSTWP direction of travelling is
characterized by a high directivity regardless of seasons. Occurrence rate of
daytime MSTWPs is high in winter and during equinoxes. Occurrence rate of
nighttime MSTIDs has its peak in summer. These features are consistent with
previous MS travelling ionosphere disturbance (TID) statistics obtained from
630-nm airglow imaging observations in Japan. In winter, MSTWPs in the northern
hemisphere are observed 3-4 hours after the morning ST passage. In summer,
MSTWPs are detected 1.5-2 hours before the evening ST occurrence at the point
of observations, at the moment of the evening ST passage in the
magneto-conjugate point. Both the high Q-factor of oscillatory system and
synchronization of MSTWP occurrence with the solar terminator passage at the
point of observations and in the magneto-conjugate area testify the MHD nature
of ST-excited MSTWP generation. The obtained results are the first experimental
evidence for the hypothesis of the ST-generated ion sound waves.
