In this article we describe simulations of the hadronic decay of Higgs bosons
produced in association with vector bosons at linear and hadronic colliders. We
use the Monte Carlo at next-to-leading-order MC@NLO matching prescription with
the Herwig++ event generator to predict various spectra of the resulting b
anti-b pairs and compare our results with leading order and matrix element
correction predictions.
