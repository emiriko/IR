To clarify the controversy concerning the ferroelectricity of the lower
temperature magnetic phases of Eu0.8Y0.2MnO3, hence its multiferroic character,
we have studied in detail the temperature dependence of the electric
polarization. The existence of a spontaneous polarization in 30K < T < 22K,
provides clear evidence for the ferroelectric character of the re-entrant
magnetic phase, stable in that temperature range. Both lower temperature
magnetic phases allow easily-induced electric polarization, which actually mask
any spontaneous polarization.
