Within the next decade gravitational-wave (GW) observations by Advanced LIGO
in the United States, Advanced Virgo and GEO HF in Europe, and possibly other
ground-based instruments will provide unprecedented opportunities to look
directly into the dense interiors of neutron stars which are opaque to all
forms of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The 10-10000 Hz frequency band
available to these ground-based interferometers is inhabited by many neutron
star mode frequencies, spin frequencies, and inverse dynamical timescales. GWs
can provide information on bulk properties of neutron stars (masses, radii,
locations...) as well as microphysics of their substance (crystalline
structure, viscosity, composition...), some of which is difficult or impossible
to obtain by EM observations alone. The former will tell us about the
astrophysics of neutron stars, and the latter will illuminate fundamental
issues in nuclear and particle physics and the physics of extremely condensed
matter. Although GW searches can be done "blind," they become richer and more
informative with input from EM observations; and thus the combination of the
two is crucial for learning the most we can about neutron stars. Healthy GW and
EM observational programs must be accompanied by vigorous theoretical research
on the interface of astrophysics, gravitational physics, nuclear and particle
physics in order to extract the most from the observations.
