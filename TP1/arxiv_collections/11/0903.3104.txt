Neutron emission measurements by means of helium-3 neutron detectors were
performed on solid test specimens during crushing failure. The materials used
were marble and granite, selected in that they present a different behaviour in
compression failure (i.e., a different brittleness index) and a different iron
content. All the test specimens were of the same size and shape. Neutron
emissions from the granite test specimens were found to be of about one order
of magnitude higher than the natural background level at the time of failure.
