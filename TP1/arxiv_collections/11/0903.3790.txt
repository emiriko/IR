Let $\Gamma$ be the Littlewood-Richardson tableau corresponding to an
embedding $M$ of a subgroup in a finite abelian $p$-group. Each individual
entry in $\Gamma$ yields information about the homomorphisms from $M$ into a
particular subgroup embedding, and hence determines the position of $M$ within
the category of subgroup embeddings. Conversely, this category provides a
categorification for LR-tableaux in the sense that all subgroup embeddings
corresponding to a given LR-tableau share certain homological properties.
