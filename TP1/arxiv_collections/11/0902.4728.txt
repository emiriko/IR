The flexible Heliac coil set of helical axis stellarator H-1 (R=1m,
<r>~0.15-0.2 m) permits access to a wide range of magnetic configurations.
Surprisingly, in the absence of any obvious population of energetic particles,
Alfven modes normally associated with energetic populations in larger fusion
experiments are observed. Using H-1's unique combination of flexibility and
advanced diagnostics, RF-generated plasma in H-1 is shown to have a very
complex dependence on configuration of both the electron density and
fluctuations in the MHD Alfven range. Magnetic fluctuations range from highly
coherent, often multi-frequency, to approaching broad-band (df/f ~ 0.02-0.5),
in the range 1-200 kHz. Application of datamining techniques to a wide range of
configurations classifies these fluctuations and extracts poloidal and toroidal
mode numbers, revealing that a significant class of fluctuations exhibit
scaling which is i) Alfvenic with electron density (within a constant factor)
and ii) shear Alfvenic in rotational transform. This is confirmed by scans
within a single pulse, which can follow mode conversions. An array of optical
and interferometric diagnostics is combined with the magnetic probe arrays to
provide initial information on the internal structure of the MHD modes, and
associated 3D effects. The configurational dependence is closely related to the
presence of low order rational surfaces; density falls to very low values near,
but not precisely at these rational values. Results from a uniquely accurate
magnetic field mapping system, combined with a comprehensive model of the
vacuum magnetic field in H-1 show that magnetic islands should not dominate the
confinement of the configuration, and indicate that the dependence of density
on configuration may be attributable to plasma generation effects.
