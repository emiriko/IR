We study numerically a model of nonequilibrium networks where nodes and links
are added at each time step with aging of nodes and connectivity- and
age-dependent attachment of links. By varying the effects of age in the
attachment probability we find, with numerical simulations and scaling
arguments, that a giant cluster emerges at a first-order critical point and
that the problem is in the universality class of one dimensional percolation.
This transition is followed by a change in the giant cluster's topology from
tree-like to quasi-linear, as inferred from measurements of the average
shortest-path length, which scales logarithmically with system size in one
phase and linearly in the other.
