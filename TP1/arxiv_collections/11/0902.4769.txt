We discuss multiscale simulations of long biopolymer translocation through
wide nanopores that can accommodate multiple polymer strands. The simulations
provide clear evidence of folding quantization, namely, the translocation
proceeds through multi-folded configurations characterized by a well-defined
integer number of folds. As a consequence, the translocation time acquires a
dependence on the average folding number, which results in a deviation from the
single-exponent power-law characterizing single-file translocation through
narrow pores. The mechanism of folding quantization allows polymers above a
threshold length (approximately $1,000$ persistence lengths for double-stranded
DNA) to exhibit cooperative behavior and as a result to translocate noticeably
faster.
