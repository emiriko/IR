We present some results of the deepest extragalactic survey performed by the
INTEGRAL satellite. The fraction of very absorbed AGN is quite large. The sharp
decrease in the absorption fraction with X-ray luminosity observed at
lower-energy X-rays is not observed. The current lack of truly Compton-thick
objects, with an upper limit of 14% to the size of this population, is just
compatible with recent modeling of the cosmic X-ray background.
  We also study the prospects for a future hard X-ray serendipitous survey with
Simbol-X. We show that Simbol-X will easily detect a large number of
serendipitous AGN, allowing us to study the evolution of AGN up to redshifts
about 2, opening the door to the cosmological study of hard X-ray selected AGN,
which is barely possible with existing satellites like Swift and INTEGRAL.
