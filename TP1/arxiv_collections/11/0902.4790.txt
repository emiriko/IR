The electric dipole moment of atomic $^{199}$Hg induced by the nuclear Schiff
moment and tensor-pseudotensor electron-nucleus interactions has been
calculated. For this, we have developed and employed a novel method based on
the relativistic coupled-cluster theory. The results of our theoretical
calculations combined with the latest experimental result of $^{199}$Hg
electric dipole moment, provide new bounds on the T reversal or CP violation
parameters $\theta_{\rm QCD}$, the tensor-pseudotensor coupling constant $C_T$
and $(\widetilde{d}_u - \widetilde{d}_d)$. This is the most accurate
calculation of these parameters to date. We highlight the the crucial role of
electron correlation effects in their interplay with the P,T violating
interactions. Our results demonstrate substantial changes in the results of
earlier calculations of these parameters which can be attributed to the more
accurate inclusion of important correlation effects in the present work.
