Data collected at the Pierre Auger Observatory are used to establish an upper
limit on the diffuse flux of tau neutrinos in the cosmic radiation.
Earth-skimming $\nu_{\tau}$ may interact in the Earth's crust and produce a
$\tau$ lepton by means of charged-current interactions. The $\tau$ lepton may
emerge from the Earth and decay in the atmosphere to produce a nearly
horizontal shower with a typical signature, a persistent electromagnetic
component even at very large atmospheric depths. The search procedure to select
events induced by $\tau$ decays against the background of normal showers
induced by cosmic rays is described. The method used to compute the exposure
for a detector continuously growing with time is detailed. Systematic
uncertainties in the exposure from the detector, the analysis and the involved
physics are discussed. No $\tau$ neutrino candidates have been found. For
neutrinos in the energy range $2\times10^{17}$ eV $< E_{\nu}$ $<$
$2\times10^{19}$ eV, assuming a diffuse spectrum of the form $E_{\nu}^{-2}$,
data collected between 1 January 2004 and 30 April 2008 yield a 90%
confidence-level upper limit of $E_\nu^{2}
\mathrm{d}N_{\nu_\tau}/\mathrm{d}E_{\nu} < 9 \times 10^{-8}$ GeV cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$.
