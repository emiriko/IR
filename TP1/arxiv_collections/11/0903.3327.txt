The core of scientific research is turning new ideas into reality. From the
school science fair to the search for the secrets of dark energy, high-quality
research consists of scientific investigation constrained within the scope of a
well-defined project. Large or small, generously funded or just scraping
by,scientific projects use time, money, and information to turn ideas into
plans, plans into action, and action into results. While we, as a community, do
much to educate students in the techniques of research, we do not
systematically train students in the nature and organization of scientific
projects or in the techniques of project management. We propose a two-pronged
attack to address this issue in the next decade. First, to generate a broad
base of future scientists who have a basic familiarity with the ideas of
projects, we propose that the community develop standards for the content of a
project design and management course in astronomy and astrophysics. Second, to
train future scientists to assume leadership roles in new investigations in
astronomy and astrophysics, we propose that the community develop standards for
graduate programs in the area of research project leadership.
