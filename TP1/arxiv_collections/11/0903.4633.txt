After a brief review of the minimal flavour violation hypothesis and its
implementation in the MSSM, the most general parametrisation of the soft
supersymmetry-breaking terms by means of the charged lepton and neutrino
spurions is constructed. Thereby a type I seesaw mechanism is assumed to
generate neutrino masses. This expansion introduces several new CP-violating
phases, whose effects on the leptonic electric dipole moments are investigated.
