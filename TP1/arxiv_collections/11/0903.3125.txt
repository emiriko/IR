Motivated by the recent results from the PAMELA and ATIC, we study the
cosmic-ray electron and positron produced by the decay of gravitino dark
matter. We calculate the cosmic-ray electron and positron fluxes and discuss
implications to the PAMELA and ATIC data. In this paper, we will show that the
observed anomalous fluxes by the PAMELA and ATIC can be explained in such a
scenario. We will also discuss the synchrotron radiation flux from the Galactic
center in such a scenario.
