Recently Vladimir Novikov found a new integrable analogue of the Camassa-Holm
equation, admitting peaked soliton (peakon) solutions, which has nonlinear
terms that are cubic, rather than quadratic. In this paper, the explicit
formulas for multipeakon solutions of Novikov's cubically nonlinear equation
are calculated, using the matrix Lax pair found by Hone and Wang. By a
transformation of Liouville type, the associated spectral problem is related to
a cubic string equation, which is dual to the cubic string that was previously
found in the work of Lundmark and Szmigielski on the multipeakons of the
Degasperis-Procesi equation.
