The generic square-gradient density-functional model with triple-parabolic
free energy is used to study the stability of a cavity introduced into the
stretched liquid. The various properties of the critical cavity, which is the
largest stable cavity within the liquid, are compared with those of the
critical bubble of the homogeneous bubble nucleation. It is found that the size
of the critical cavity is always smaller than that of the critical bubble,
while the work of formation of the former is always higher than the latter in
accordance with the conjectures made by Punnathanam and Corti [J. Chem. Phys.
{\bf 119}, 10224 (2003)] deduced from the Lennard-Jones fluids. Therefore their
conjectures about the critical cavity size and the work of formation would be
more general and valid even for other types of liquid such as metallic liquid
or amorphous. However, the scaling relations they found for the critical cavity
in the Lennard-Jones fluid are marginally satisfied only near the spinodal.
