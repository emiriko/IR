We present a general method to obtain the central charge and quasihole
scaling dimension directly from groundstate and quasihole wavefunctions. Our
method applies to wavefunctions satisfying specific clustering properties. We
then use our method to examine the relation between Jack symmetric functions
and certain W-algebras. We add substantially to the evidence that the (k,r)
admissible Jack functions correspond to correlators of the conformal field
theory W_k(k+1,k+r), by calculating the central charge and scaling dimensions
of some of the fields in both cases and showing that they match. For the Jacks
described by unitary W-models, the central charge and quasihole exponents match
the ones previously obtained from analyzing the physics of the edge
excitations. For the Jacks described by non-unitary W-models the central charge
and quasihole scaling dimensions obtained from the wavefunctions differ from
the ones obtained from the edge physics, which instead agree with the
"effective" central charge of the corresponding W-model.
