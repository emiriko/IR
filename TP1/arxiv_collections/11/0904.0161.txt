The distribution of singular values of the propagation operator in a random
medium is investigated, in a backscattering configuration. Experiments are
carried out with pulsed ultrasonic waves around 3 MHz, using an array of 64
programmable transducers placed in front of a random scattering medium. The
impulse responses between each pair of transducers are measured and form the
response matrix. The evolution of its singular values with time and frequency
is computed by means of a short-time Fourier analysis. The mean distribution of
singular values exhibits very different behaviours in the single and multiple
scattering regimes. The results are compared with random matrix theory. Once
the experimental matrix coefficients are renormalized, experimental results and
theoretical predictions are found to be in a very good agreement. Two kinds of
random media have been investigated: a highly scattering medium in which
multiple scattering predominates and a weakly scattering medium. In both cases,
residual correlations that may exist between matrix elements are shown to be a
key parameter. Finally, the possibility of detecting a target embedded in a
random scattering medium based on the statistical properties of the strongest
singular value is discussed.
