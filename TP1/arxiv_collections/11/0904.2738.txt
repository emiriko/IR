To fix the bundle moduli of a heterotic compactification one has to
understand the Pfaffian one-loop prefactor of the classical instanton
contribution. For compactifications on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau spaces X
this can be made explicit for spectral bundles and world-sheet instantons
supported on rational base curves b: one can express the Pfaffian in a closed
algebraic form as a polynomial, or it may be understood as a theta-function
expression. We elucidate the connection between these two points of view via
the respective perception of the relevant spectral curve, related to its
extrinsic geometry in the ambient space (the elliptic surface in X over b) or
to its intrinsic geometry as abstract Riemann surface. We identify, within a
conceptual description, general vanishing loci of the Pfaffian, and derive
bounds on the vanishing order, relevant to solutions of W=dW=0.
