The young active G-dwarf star V889 Herculis (HD 171488) shows pronounced
spots in Doppler images as well as large variations in photometry and radial
velocity (RV) measurements. However, the lifetime and evolution of its active
regions are not well known. We study the existence and stability of active
regions on the star's surface using complementary data and methods.
Furthermore, we analyze the correlation of spot-induced RV variations and
Doppler images. Photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy are used to examine
stellar activity. A CLEAN-like Doppler Imaging (DI) algorithm is used to derive
surface reconstructions. We study high-precision RV curves to determine their
modulation due to stellar activity in analogy to the Rossiter-McLaughlin
effect. To this end we develop a measure for the shift of a line's center and
compare it to RV measurements. We show that large spotted regions exist on V889
Her for more than one year remaining similar in their large scale structure and
position. This applies to several time periods of our observations, which cover
more than a decade. Furthermore we use DI line profile reconstructions to
identify influences of long-lasting starspots on RV measurements. In this way
we verify the RV curve's agreement with our Doppler images. Based on long-term
RV data we confirm V889 Her's rotation period of $1.3371 \pm 0.0002$ days.
