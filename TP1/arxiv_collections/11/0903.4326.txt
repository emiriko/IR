We use the characteristic polynomial of the Coxeter matrix of an algebra to
complete the combinatorial classification of piecewise hereditary algebras
which Happel gave in terms of the trace of the Coxeter matrix. We also give a
cohomological interpretation of the coefficients (other than the trace) of the
characteristic polynomial of the Coxeter matrix of any finite dimensional
algebra with finite global dimension.
