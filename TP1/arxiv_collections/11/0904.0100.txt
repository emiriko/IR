We present calculations of the free-free XUV opacity of warm, solid-density
aluminum at photon energies between the plasma frequency at 15 eV and the
L-edge at 73 eV, using both density functional theory combined with molecular
dynamics and a semi-analytical model in the RPA framework with the inclusion of
local field corrections. As the temperature is increased from room temperature
to 10 eV, with the ion and electron temperatures equal, we calculate an
increase in the opacity in the range over which the degree of ionization is
constant. The effect is less pronounced if only the electron temperature is
allowed to increase. The physical significance of these increases is discussed
in terms of intense XUV-laser matter interactions on both femtosecond and
picosecond time-scales.
