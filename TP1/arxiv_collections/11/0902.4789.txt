In the framework of perturbative Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (pAQFT),
recently introduced by Brunetti, Duetsch and Fredenhagen, I give a general
construction of so-called "Euclidean time-ordered products", i.e. algebraic
versions of the Schwinger functions, for scalar quantum field theories on
spaces of Euclidean signature. This is done by generalizing the recursive
construction of time-ordered products by Epstein and Glaser, originally
formulated for quantum field theories on Minkowski space (MQFT). An essential
input of Epstein-Glaser renormalization is the causal structure of Minkowski
space. The absence of this causal structure in the Euclidean framework makes it
necessary to modify the original construction of Epstein and Glaser at two
points. First, the whole construction has to be performed with an only
partially defined product on (interaction-) functionals. This is due to the
fact that the fundamental solutions of the Helmholtz operator of EQFT have a
unique singularity structure, i.e. they are unique up to a smooth part. Second,
one needs to (re-)introduce a (rather natural) "Euclidean causality" condition
for the recursion of Epstein and Glaser to be applicable.
