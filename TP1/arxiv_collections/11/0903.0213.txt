Four-terminal resistances, both longitudinal and diagonal, of a locally gated
graphene device are measured in the quantum-Hall (QH) regime. In sharp
distinction from previous two-terminal studies [J. R. Williams \textit{et al.},
Science {\bf 317}, 638 (2007); B. \"{O}zyilmaz \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 99}, 166804 (2007)], asymmetric QH resistances are observed, which
provide information on reflection as well as transmission of the QH edge
states. Most quantized values of resistances are well analyzed by the
assumption that all edge states are equally populated. Contrary to the
expectation, however, a 5/2 transmission of the edge states is also found,
which may be caused by incomplete mode mixing and/or by the presence of
counter-propagating edge states. This four-terminal scheme can be conveniently
used to study the edge-state equilibration in locally gated graphene devices as
well as mono- and multi-layer graphene hybrid structures.
