In order to describe the quantum electrodynamic measurement process in a
relativistic observer-participant manner, an operator symmetry of "microscopic
observer-participation" called Measurement Color (MC) is incorporated into the
field theoretic structure of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) in the Heisenberg
Picture. It is found that the resultant Measurement Color Quantum
Electrodynamics (MC-QED) contains a microscopic quantum electrodynamic arrow of
time that emerges dynamically, independent of any thermodynamic or cosmological
assumptions. This occurs because the photon has a negative time parity in
MC-QED. This causes a spontaneous breaking of the T and CPT symmetry to be
generated by the physical requirement that a stable vacuum state exists in the
MC-QED formalimm. This dynamically selects operator solutions containing a
causal, retarded, quantum electrodynamic arrow of time due in the Heisenberg
operator equations of motion. In support of the validity of this idea we show
that a classic nonlinear optics experiment in the scientific literature, which
involves a Michelson interferometer using combinations of ordinary mirrors and
phase conjugate mirrors, contains experimental results which support the idea
that the photon has a negative parity under Wigner time reversal and thus
carries the arrow of time in the universe.
