Vector bosons become accessible experimental probes in heavy-ion collisions
at the LHC. The capabilities of the LHC experiments to perform their
measurement are outlined. The focus is given to their utility to study the
possible formation and properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) in the most
central heavy-ion collisions. Their own sensitivity (if any) to the QGP is
discussed. Their interest as references to observe multiple QGP sensitive
probes is justified.
