We propose and investigate a general form of the dissipative coefficient
$\Gamma=C_{\phi}T^{m}/\phi^{m-1}$ in warm inflation. We focus on discussing the
strong dissipative processes $r=\Gamma/3H\gg1$ in the thermal state of
approximate equilibrium. To this toy model, we give the slow-roll conditions,
the amplitude and the index of the power spectrum under the general form of
dissipative coefficient. Furthermore, the monomial potential and the
hybrid-like potential are analyzed specifically. We conclude that the $m=0,3$
cases are worthy further investigation especially.
