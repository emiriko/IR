We present a framework to determine nonequilibrium steady states in strongly
correlated electron systems in the presence of dissipation. This is
demonstrated for a correlated electron (Falicov-Kimball) model attached to a
heat bath and irradiated by an intense pump light, for which an exact solution
is obtained with the Floquet method combined with the nonequilibrium dynamical
mean-field theory. On top of a Drude-like peak indicative of photometallization
as observed in recent pump-probe experiments, new nonequilibrium phenomena are
predicted to emerge, where the optical conductivity exhibits dip and kink
structures around the frequency of the pump light, a midgap absorption arising
from photoinduced Floquet subbands, and a negative attenuation (gain) due to a
population inversion.
