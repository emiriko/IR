Doped and undoped manganites are modeled by the coupling between itinerant
$e_g$ electrons and static $t_{2g}$ spins, the Jahn-Teller and breathing phonon
modes, and the Coulomb interaction. We provide for a careful estimate of all
parameters and solve the corresponding Hamiltonian by dynamical mean field
theory. Our results for the one-electron spectrum, the optical conductivity,
the dynamic and static lattice distortion, as well as the Curie temperature
show the importance of all of the above ingredients for a realistic calculation
as well as for describing the unusual dynamical properties of manganites
including the insulating parent compound and the insulating-like paramagnetic
state of doped manganites.
