In this paper, we perform a three-stage numerical relay to investigate the
finite time singularity in the two-dimensional Boussinesq approximation
equations. The initial asymmetric condition is the middle-stage output of a
$2048^2$ run, the highest resolution in our study is $40960^2$, and some
signals of numerical blowup are observed.
