In a toroidal plasma confined by a purely toroidal magnetic field the plasma
transport is governed by electrostatic turbulence driven by the flute
interchange instability on the low-field side of the torus cross section. In
this paper we revisit experimental data obtained from the Blaamann torus at the
University of Tromso. On time-scales shorter than the poloidal rotation time,
the time series of potential and electron density fluctuations measured on
stationary Langmuir probes essentially reflect the spatial poloidal structure
of the turbulent field (Taylor hypothesis). On these time scales the signals
reveals an intermittent character exposed via analysis of probability density
functions and computation of multifractal dimension spectra in different
regimes of time scales. This intermittency is associated with the shape and
distribution of pronounced spikes in the signal. On time scales much longer
than the rotation period there are strong global fluctuations in the plasma
potential which are shown to to be the result of low-dimensional chaotic
dynamics.
