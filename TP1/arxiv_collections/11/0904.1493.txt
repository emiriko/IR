The proton analyzing power in carbon has been measured for energies of 82 to
217 MeV and proton scattering angles of 5 to 41 degrees. The measurements were
carried out using polarized protons from the elastic scattering H(pol. e, pol.
p) reaction and the Focal Plane Polarimeter (FPP) in Hall A of Jefferson Lab. A
new parameterization of the FPP p-C analyzing power was fit to the data, which
is in good agreement with previous parameterizations and provides an extension
to lower energies and larger angles. The main conclusions are that all
polarimeters to date give consistent measurements of the carbon analyzing
power, independently of the details of their construction and that measuring on
a larger angular range significantly improves the polarimeter figure of merit
at low energies.
