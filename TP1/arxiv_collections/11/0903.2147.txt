In this talk, I present and discuss a number of attempts to construct black
hole solutions in models with Warped Extra Dimensions. Then, a contact is made
with models with Large Extra Dimensions, where black-hole solutions are easily
constructed -- here the focus will be on the properties of microscopic black
holes and the possibility of using phenomena associated with them, such as the
emission of Hawking radiation, to discover fundamental properties of our
spacetime.
