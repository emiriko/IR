Casimir energy is calculated for the 5D electromagnetism in the warped
geometry. It is compared with the flat case(arXiv:0801.3064). A new
regularization, called sphere lattice regularization, is taken. It is based on
the minimal area principle and is a direct realization of the geometrical
approach to the renormalization group. The properly regularized form of Casimir
energy, is expressed in a closed form. We numerically evaluate $\La$(4D
UV-cutoff), $\om$(5D bulk curvature, warp parameter) and $T$(extra space IR
parameter) dependence of the Casimir energy. The warp parameter $\om$ suffers
from the renormalization effect. We examine the meaning of the weight function
and finally reach a new definition of the Casimir energy where the 4D
momenta(or coordinates) are quantized with the extra coordinate as the
Euclidean time. We comment on the cosmological term at the end.
