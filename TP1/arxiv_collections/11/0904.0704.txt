The asymptotic discrimination problem of two quantum states is studied in the
setting where measurements are required to be invariant under some symmetry
group of the system. We consider various asymptotic error exponents in
connection with the problems of the Chernoff bound, the Hoeffding bound and
Stein's lemma, and derive bounds on these quantities in terms of their
corresponding statistical distance measures. A special emphasis is put on the
comparison of the performances of group-invariant and unrestricted
measurements.
