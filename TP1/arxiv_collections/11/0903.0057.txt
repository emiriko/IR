The previously unknown property of the optical speckle pattern reported. The
interference of a speckle with an oppositely moving phase-conjugated speckle
wave produces a randomly distributed ensemble of a twisted entities (ropes)
surrounding optical vortex lines. These entities appear in a wide range of
randomly chosen speckle parameters inside the phase-conjugating mirrors
regardless to an internal physical mechanism of the wavefront reversal. These
numerically generated interference patterns are relevant to a Brillouin $\bf
PC$-mirrors and to a four-wave mixing $\bf PC$-mirrors based upon laser trapped
ultracold atomic cloud.
