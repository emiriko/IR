We consider the problem of finding one or more desired items out of an
unsorted database. Patel has shown that if the database permits quantum
queries, then mere digitization is sufficient for efficient search for one
desired item. The algorithm, called factorized quantum search algorithm,
presented by him can locate the desired item in an unsorted database using
$O(log_{4}N)$ queries to factorized oracles. But the algorithm requires that
all the property values must be distinct from each other. In this paper, we
discuss how to make a database satisfy the requirements, and present a quantum
search engine based on the algorithm. Our goal is achieved by introducing
auxiliary files for the property values that are not distinct, and converting
every complex query request into a sequence of calls to factorized quantum
search algorithm. The query complexity of our algorithm is $O(P*Q*M*log_{4}N)$,
where P is the number of the potential simple query requests in the complex
query request, Q is the maximum number of calls to the factorized quantum
search algorithm of the simple queries, M is the number of the auxiliary files
for the property on which our algorithm are searching for desired items. This
implies that to manage an unsorted database on an actual quantum computer is
possible and efficient.
