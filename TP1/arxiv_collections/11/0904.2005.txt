We consider models with multiple Higgs scalar gauge singlets and the
resulting restrictions on the parameters from precision electroweak
measurements. In these models, the scalar singlets mix with the SU(2) Higgs
doublet, potentially leading to reduced couplings of the scalars to fermions
and gauge bosons relative to the Standard Model Higgs boson couplings. Such
models can make the Higgs sector difficult to explore at the LHC. We emphasize
the new physics resulting from the addition of at least two scalar Higgs
singlets.
