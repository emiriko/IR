In this paper, we continue to study factorization of supersymmetric (SUSY)
transformations in one-dimensional Quantum Mechanics into chains of elementary
Darboux transformations with nonsingular coefficients. We define the class of
potentials that are invariant under the Darboux - Crum transformations and
prove a number of lemmas and theorems substantiating the formulated formerly
conjectures on reducibility of differential operators for spectral equivalence
transformations. Analysis of the general case is performed with all the
necessary proofs.
