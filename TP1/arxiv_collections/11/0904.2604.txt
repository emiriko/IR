In this paper, we give a survey of various sphere theorems in geometry. These
include the topological sphere theorem of Berger and Klingenberg as well as the
differentiable version obtained by the authors. These theorems employ a variety
of methods, including geodesic and minimal surface techniques as well as
Hamilton's Ricci flow. We also obtain here new results concerning complete
manifolds with pinched curvature.
