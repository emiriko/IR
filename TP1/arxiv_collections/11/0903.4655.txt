The finite temperature phase diagram of two-dimensional dipolar bosons versus
dipolar interaction strength is discussed. We identify the stable phases as
dipolar superfluid (DSF), dipolar Wigner crystal (DWC), dipolar hexatic fluid
(DHF), and dipolar normal fluid (DNF). We also show that other interesting
phases like dipolar supersolid (DSS) and dipolar hexatic superfluid (DHSF) are
at least metastable, and can potentially be reached by thermal quenching. In
particular, for large densities or strong dipolar interactions, we find that
the DWC exists at low temperatures, but melts into a DHF at higher
temperatures, where translational crystaline order is destroyed but
orientational order is preserved. Upon further increase in temperature the DHF
phase melts into the DNF, where both orientational and translational lattice
order are absent. Lastly, we discuss the static structure factor for some of
the stable phases and show that they can be identified via optical Bragg
scattering measurements.
