In this work, we present a comprehensive X-ray picture of the interaction
between a super star cluster and the ISM. In order to do that, we compare and
combine the X-ray emission from the superwind driven by the cluster with the
emission from the wind-blown bubble. Detailed analytical models for the
hydrodynamics and X-ray luminosity of fast polytropic superwinds are presented.
The superwind X-ray luminosity models are an extension of the results obtained
in Paper I of this series. Here, the superwind polytropic character allows to
parameterize a wide variety of effects, for instance, radiative cooling.
Additionally, X-ray properties that are valid for all bubble models taking
thermal evaporation into account are derived. The final X-ray picture is
obtained by calculating analytically the expected surface brightness and
weighted temperature of each component. All of our X-ray models have an
explicit dependence on metallicity and admit general emissivities as functions
of the hydrodynamical variables. We consider a realistic X-ray emissivity that
separates the contributions from hydrogen and metals. The paper ends with a
comparison of the models with observational data.
