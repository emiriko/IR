We deduce a new set of symmetries and relations between the coefficients of
the expansion of Abelian and Non-Abelian Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) states
in free (bosonic or fermionic) many-body states. Our rules allow to build an
approximation of a FQH model state with an overlap increasing with growing
system size (that may sometimes reach unity!) while using a fraction of the
original Hilbert space. We prove these symmetries by deriving a previously
unknown recursion formula for all the coefficients of the Slater expansion of
the Laughlin, Read Rezayi and many other states (all Jacks multiplied by
Vandermonde determinants), which completely removes the current need for
diagonalization procedures.
