The theory of planetary dynamos and its applications to observed phenomena of
planetary magnetism are outlined. It is generally accepted that convection
flows driven by thermal or compositional buoyancy are the most likely source
for the sustenance of global planetary magnetic fields. While the existence of
dynamos in electrically conducting fluid planetary cores provides constraints
on properties of the latter, the lack of knowledge about time dependences of
the magnetic fields and about their toroidal components together with the
restricted parameter regions accessible to theory have prevented so far a full
understanding of the phenomena of planetary magnetism.
