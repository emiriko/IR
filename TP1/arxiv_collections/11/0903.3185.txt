We calculate numerically the exact energy spectrum of the six dimensional
problem of two interacting Bosons in a three-well optical lattice. The
particles interact via a full Born-Oppenheimer potential which can be adapted
to model the behavior of the s-wave scattering length at Feshbach resonances.
By adjusting the parameters of the corresponding Bose-Hubbard (BH) Hamiltonian
the deviation between the numerical energy spectrum and the BH spectrum is
minimized. This defines the optimal BH parameter set which we compare to the
standard parameters of the BH model. The range of validity of the BH model with
these parameter sets is examined, and an improved analytical prediction of the
interaction parameter is introduced. Furthermore, an extended BH model and
implications due to the energy dependence of the scattering length and
couplings to higher Bloch bands at a Feshbach resonance are discussed.
