Recently, an exact conformal mapping between soft gluons emitted from jets at
large angle in e+e- annihilation and those in the BFKL evolution of a high
energy hadron has been proposed. We elucidate some remarkable aspects of this
correspondence and use them to analytically compute the distribution and
correlation of gluons in the interjet region. We also establish the timelike
counterpart of Mueller's dipole model and discuss the resulting linear and
nonlinear evolution equations.
