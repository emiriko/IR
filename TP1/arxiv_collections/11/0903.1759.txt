We study the full counting statistics of electronic transport through a
single-level quantum dot weakly coupled to two leads, with either one or both
of them being ferromagnetic. The interplay of Coulomb interaction and finite
spin polarization implies spin-correlation induced charge correlations that
give rise to super-Poissonian transport behavior and positive cross
correlations of the currents of the two spin species. In the case of two
ferromagnetic leads, we analyze the nontrivial dependence of the cumulants on
the angle between the polarization directions of the leads. We find diverging
second and higher cumulants for spin polarizations approaching unity.
