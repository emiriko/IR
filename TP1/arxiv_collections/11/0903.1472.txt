This is a contribution to the project of quiver approaches to quasi-quantum
groups initiated in arXiv:0902.1620. We classify Majid bimodules over groups
with 3-cocycles by virtue of projective representations. This leads to a
theoretic classification of graded pointed Majid algebras over path coalgebras,
or equivalently cofree pointed coalgebras, and helps to provide a projective
representation-theoretic description of the gauge equivalence of graded pointed
Majid algebras. We apply this machinery to construct some concrete examples and
obtain a classification of finite-dimensional graded pointed Majid algebras
with the set of group-likes equal to the cyclic group of order 2.
