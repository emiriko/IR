The expression for super-allowed beta-decay transition rates have been
derived within the context of Coriolis coupling model. The derived expressions,
valid for the beta-decay between any two mirror nuclei, has been applied to
calculate super-allowed beta-decay transition rates of 21Na, 21Mg, 21Al, and
21Si. The calculated rates agree well with the data and the calculations done
using the shell model with configuration admixture.
