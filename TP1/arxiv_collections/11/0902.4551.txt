Searches for planets around massive stars are essential for developing
general understanding of planet formation and evolution of the planetary
systems. The main objective of the Pennsylvania - Torun Planet Search is
detection of planets around G-K subgiants and giants through precision radial
velocity (RV) measurements with iodine absorption cell using HET HRS
spectrograph. However, the long period radial velocity variations of red giants
may also have other than planetary nature (e.g. a non-radial pulsations or
rotational modulation in presence of starspots). In this work we present
bisector analysis of cross-correlation functions (CCF) constructed from the
spectra used for radial velocity determination but cleaned from the iodine
lines for the second red giant with planets from our survey HD 102272.
