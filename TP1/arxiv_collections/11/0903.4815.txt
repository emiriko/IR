The Rolling Ball Theorem asserts that given a convex body K in Euclidean
space and having a smooth surface bd(K) with all principal curvatures not
exceeding c>0 at all boundary points, K necessarily has the property that to
each boundary point there exists a ball B_r of radius r=1/c, fully contained in
K and touching bd(K) at the given boundary point from the inside of K.
  In the present work we prove a discrete analogue of the result on the plane.
We consider a certain discrete condition on the curvature, namely that to any
boundary points x,y with |x-y|<t, the angle between any unit outer normals at x
and at y, resp., does not exceed a given angle s. Then we construct a
corresponding body, M(t,s), which is to lie fully within K while containing the
given boundary point x.
  In dimension 2, M is almost a regular n-gon, and the result allows to recover
the precise form of Blaschke's Rolling Ball Theorem in the limit. Similarly, we
consider the dual type discrete Blaschke theorems ensuring certain
circumscribed polygons. In the limit, the discrete theorem enables us to
provide a new proof for a strong result of Strantzen assuming only a.e.
existence and lower estimations on the curvature.
