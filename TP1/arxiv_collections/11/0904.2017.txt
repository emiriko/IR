The short-range nuclear attraction is stronger in the isoscalar channel than
in the isovector channel, as evidenced by the existence of the deuteron and not
the dineutron. Nevertheless, apart from light N=Z nuclei, pairing is only seen
in the isovector channel. This is explained by the effect of the strong
spin-orbit splitting on the single-particle energies. A semiquantitative
argument is presented treating the high-j orbitals at the Fermi surface as
plane waves on a two-dimensional sheet.
