The oxygen quenching effect in Linear Alkl Benzne (LAB) based liquid
scintillator (LAB as the solvent, 3 g/L 2, 5 diphe-nyloxazole (PPO) as the
fluor and 15 mg/L $p$-bis-($o$-methylstyryl)-benzene (bis-MSB) as the
$\lambda$-shifter) is studied by measuring the light yield as the function of
the nitrogen bubbling time. It is shown that the light yield of the fully
purged liquid scintillator is increased by 11% at the room temperature and the
room atmosphere pressure. A simple nitrogen bubbling model is proposed to
describe the relationship between the relative light yield (oxygen quenching
factor) and the bubbling time.
