The ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury (ANGST) has acquired deep ACS imaging
of a field in the outer disk of the large spiral galaxy M81. These data were
obtained over a total of 20 HST orbits, providing a baseline long enough to
reliably identify Cepheid variable stars in the field. Fundamental mode and
first overtone types have been distinguished through comparative fits with
corresponding Cepheid light curve templates derived from principal component
analysis of confirmed Cepheids in the LMC, SMC, and Milky Way. A distance
modulus of 27.78 pm 0.05_random pm 0.14_systematic with a corresponding
distance of 3.60 pm 0.23 Mpc has been calculated from a sample of 11
fundamental mode and 2 first overtone Cepheids (assuming an LMC distance
modulus of mu_LMC=18.41 pm 0.10_r pm 0.13_s).
