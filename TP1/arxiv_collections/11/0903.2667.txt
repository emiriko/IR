The zero-mass (ZM) parton formalism is widely used in high-energy physics
because of its simplicity and historical importance, even while massive quarks
(c,b,t) are playing an increasingly prominent role in particle phenomenology,
including global QCD analyses of parton distributions based on the more precise
general-mass (GM) QCD formalism. In view of this dichotomy, we show how the
obvious inconsistencies of the conventional implementation of the ZM formalism
can be corrected, while preserving the simplicity of its matrix elements. The
resulting intermediate mass (IM) scheme for perturbative QCD calculation can be
considered either as improved ZM formulation with realistic treatment of
heavy-flavor kinematics; or as a simplified GM formulation with approximate ZM
hard cross sections. Phenomenologically, global analyses based on IM
calculations can effectively reproduce, within the present estimated
uncertainty bands, the more correct GM results on parton distributions, as well
as their predictions for a wide range of collider processes of current
interest.
