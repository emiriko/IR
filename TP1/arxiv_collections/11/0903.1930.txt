In the presence of the primordial magnetic field, initial vector (vorticity)
perturbations produce cosmological Alfven waves and leave imprints on cosmic
microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropy. We have
investigated imprints of cosmological Alfven waves in CMB anisotropy. For data
constraints, we have used the power spectrum of the recent CMB observations,
and correlations estimated from WMAP Internal Linear Combination (ILC) maps.
Our analysis shows 3 sigma evidence of cosmological Alfven waves. Using the 3
sigma limit from our analysis and the Alfven velocity limit from the total
energy density constraint, we impose a lower bound on the amplitude of
primordial vector perturbation: 4*10^-12 at k_0=0.002/Mpc.
