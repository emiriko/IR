The search for extraterrestrial intelligence by looking for signals from
advanced technological civilizations has been ongoing for some decades. We
suggest that it could possibly be made more efficient by focusing on stars from
which the solar system can be observed via mini-eclipsings of the Sun by
transiting planets.
