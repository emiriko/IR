We report on the nonlinear turbulent processes associated with
electromagnetic waves in plasmas. We focus on low-frequency (in comparison with
the electron gyrofrequency) nonlinearly interacting electron whistlers and
nonlinearly interacting Hall-magnetohydrodynamic (H-MHD) fluctuations in a
magnetized plasma.
