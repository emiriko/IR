X-ray photons emitted from the surface or atmosphere of a magnetized neutron
star is highly polarized. However, the observed polarization may be modified
due to photon propagation through the star's magnetosphere. For photon
frequencies much larger than the typical radio frequency, vacuum birefringence
due to strong-field quantum electrodynamics dominates over the plasma effect.
We study the evolution of photon polarization in the magnetized QED vacuum of a
neutron star magnetosphere, paying particular attention to the propagation
effect across the quasi-tangential (QT) point, where the photon momentum is
nearly aligned with the magnetic field. In agreement with previous studies, we
find that in most regions of the magnetosphere, the photon polarization modes
are decoupled due to vacuum birefringence, and therefore a large net linear
polarization can be expected when the radiation escapes the magnetosphere.
However, we show that X-ray polarization may change significantly when the
photon passes through the QT region. When averaging over a finite emission
area, the net effect of QT propagation is to reduce the degree of linear
polarization; the reduction factor depends on the photon energy, magnetic field
strength, geometry, rotation phase and the emission area, and can be more than
a factor of two. We derive the general conditions under which the QT
propagation effect is important, and provide an easy-to-use prescription to
account for the QT effect for most practical calculations of X-ray polarization
signals from magnetic neutron stars. For a neutron star with a dipole magnetic
field, the QT effect can be important for emission from the polar cap for
certain magnetic field and energy ranges, and is negligible for emission from
the entire stellar surface.
