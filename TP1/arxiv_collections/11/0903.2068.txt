In many astronomical problems one often needs to determine the upper and/or
lower boundary of a given data set. An automatic and objective approach
consists in fitting the data using a generalised least-squares method, where
the function to be minimized is defined to handle asymmetrically the data at
both sides of the boundary. In order to minimise the cost function, a numerical
approach, based on the popular downhill simplex method, is employed. The
procedure is valid for any numerically computable function. Simple polynomials
provide good boundaries in common situations. For data exhibiting a complex
behaviour, the use of adaptive splines gives excellent results. Since the
described method is sensitive to extreme data points, the simultaneous
introduction of error weighting and the flexibility of allowing some points to
fall outside of the fitted frontier, supplies the parameters that help to tune
the boundary fitting depending on the nature of the considered problem. Two
simple examples are presented, namely the estimation of spectra
pseudo-continuum and the segregation of scattered data into ranges. The
normalisation of the data ranges prior to the fitting computation typically
reduces both the numerical errors and the number of iterations required during
the iterative minimisation procedure.
