We propose a new experimental technique, which allows for a complete
characterization of ultrashort optical pulses both in space and in time.
Combining the well-known Frequency-Resolved-Optical-Gating technique for the
retrieval of the temporal profile of the pulse with a measurement of the
near-field made with an Hartmann-Shack sensor, we are able to retrieve the
spatiotemporal amplitude and phase profile of a Bessel-X pulse. By following
the pulse evolution along the propagation direction we highlight the
superluminal propagation of the pulse peak.
