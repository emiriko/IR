Predictions of analytical models for hadronisation, namely the dispersive
model, the shape function and the single dressed gluon approximation, are
compared with moments of hadronic event shape distributions measured in \epem
annihilation at centre-of-mass energies between 14 and 209 GeV. In contrast to
Monte Carlo models for hadronisation, analytical models require to adjust only
two universal parameters, the strong coupling and a second quantity
parametrising nonperturbative corrections. The extracted values of as are
consistent with the world average and competitive with previous measurements.
The variance of event shape distributions is compared with predictions given by
some of these models. Limitations of the models, probably due to unknown higher
order corrections, are demonstrated and discussed.
