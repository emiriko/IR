Rational solutions of the Painleve IV equation are constructed in the setting
of pseudo-differential Lax formalism describing AKNS hierarchy subject to the
additional non-isospectral Virasoro symmetry constraint. Convenient Wronskian
representations for rational solutions are obtained by successive actions of
the Darboux-Backlund transformations.
