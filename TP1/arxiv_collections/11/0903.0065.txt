We report the discovery of a luminous, mini radio halo of ~240 kpc dimension
at the center of a distant cluster of galaxies at redshift z = 0.131. Our
optical and multi-wavelength GMRT and VLA observations reveal a highly unusual
structure showing a twin bubble-like diffuse radio halo surrounding a cluster
of bright elliptical galaxies; very similar to the large-scale radio structure
of M87, the dominant galaxy in Virgo cluster. It presents an excellent
opportunity to understand the energetics and the dynamical evolution of such
radio jet inflated plasma bubbles in the hot cluster atmosphere.
