First-principles calculations predict the existence of a spin-polarized
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the LaO/EuO interface in a LaAlO3/EuO
(001) heterostructure. This polar interface favors electron doping into the
Eu-5d conduction bands resulting in a 2DEG formed at the interface. Due to the
exchange splitting of the Eu-5d states the 2DEG is spin-polarized below the
Curie temperature of EuO. The predicted mechanism for the formation of a
spinpolarized 2DEG at the interface between polar and ferromagnetic insulators
may provide a robust magnetism of the 2DEG which is interesting for spintronics
applications.
