Two-dimensional PT-symmetric quantum-mechanical systems with the complex
cubic potential V_{12}=x^2+y^2+igxy^2 and the complex Henon-Heiles potential
V_{HH}=x^2+y^2+ig(xy^2-x^3/3) are investigated. Using numerical and
perturbative methods, energy spectra are obtained to high levels. Although both
potentials respect the PT symmetry, the complex energy eigenvalues appear when
level crossing happens between same parity eigenstates.
