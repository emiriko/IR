By use of a novel experimental design, one that provides for superfluid
helium in contact with bulk hcp 4He off the melting curve, we have observed the
DC transport of mass through a cell filled with solid 4He in the hcp region of
the phase diagram. Flow, which shows characteristics of a superflow, is seen to
be independent of the method used to grow the solid, but depends on pressure
and temperature. The temperature dependence suggests the possibility of
hysteresis.
