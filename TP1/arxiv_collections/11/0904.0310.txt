Traditional optical phase imprinting of matter waves is of a dynamical
nature. In this paper we show that both Abelian and non-Abelian geometric
phases can be optically imprinted onto matter waves, yielding a number of
interesting phenomena such as wavepacket re-directing and wavepacket splitting.
In addition to their fundamental interest, our results open up new
opportunities for robust optical control of matter waves.
