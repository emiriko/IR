In order to attract, recruit and retain underrepresented minority students to
pursue Astronomy and related fields, we must ensure that there continues to be
a well qualified pool of graduate and undergraduate students from which to
recruit. This required pool of people are today's elementary, middle and high
school students. The Astronomy community must be proactive in demonstrating the
importance of pursing scientific study and careers to these students and their
parents. Only by actively engaging these communities can U.S Astronomy hope to
increase the numbers of minority PhDs and continue to be a leader in
Astronomical discovery and knowledge.
