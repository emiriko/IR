A sequential effect algebra $(E,0,1, \oplus, \circ)$ is an effect algebra on
which a sequential product $\circ$ with certain physics properties is defined,
in particular, sequential effect algebra is an important model for studying
quantum measurement theory. In 2005, Gudder asked the following problem: If $a,
b\in (E,0,1,\oplus, \circ)$ and $a\bot b$ and $a\circ b\bot a\circ b$, is it
the case that $2(a\circ b)\leq a^2\oplus b^2$ ? In this paper, we construct an
example to answer the problem negatively.
