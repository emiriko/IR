Suppression of selection among broken-symmetry states has been found in
double-well system resulting from two simultaneous correlated white noises, one
additive and the other multiplicative. Symmetry-asymmetry-symmetry transition
is re-entrant as a function of the additive noise intensity for small
multiplicative noise.
