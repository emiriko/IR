On the basis of the field concept of gravitation and gravitational analogue
of the Faradays induction law the difference of inertial mass of a body at its
accelerated movement in horizontal and vertical directions relative to the
Earth is shown. For an illustration of such a distinction the results of
comparison of a motion of balance mechanical watch at horizontal and vertical
orientations of balance axis are given. The expediency of statement of
precision mechanical experiments with measurement of anisotropy of the inertial
mass is noted, allowing to estimate the validity of the field approach in the
description of gravitation.
