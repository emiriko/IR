We systematically study the possibility to probe the physics behind the
electroweak symmetry breaking at the LHC assuming new strong interactions being
responsible for the effect. The new physics is described by the Higgs-less
effective Lagrangian with a vector resonance in the particle spectrum, in
addition to the Standard Model fields. We analyze signals of the resonance in
the mixing-induced LHC processes pp-> abX,
ab=t\bar{t},b\bar{b},t\bar{b},W^+Z,W^+W^-. At this level of our calculations we
do not consider further decays of the quarks and of the gauge bosons.
