In this paper, we investigate the two component long wave short wave
resonance interaction (2CLSRI) equation and show that it admits the Painleve
property. We then suitably exploit the recently developed truncated Painleve
approach to generate exponentially localized solutions for the short wave
components $S^{(1)}$ and $S^{(2)}$ while the long wave L admits line soliton
only. The exponentially localized solutions driving the short waves $S^{(1)}$
and $S^{(2)}$ in the y direction are endowed with different energies
(intensities) and are called "multimode dromions". We also observe that the
multimode dromions suffer intramodal inelastic collision while the existence of
a firewall across the modes prevents the switching of energy between the modes.
