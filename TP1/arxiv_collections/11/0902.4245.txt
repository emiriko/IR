The dynamical analysis of American options has motivated the development of
robust versions of the classical Snell envelopes. The cost of superhedging an
American option is characterized by the upper Snell envelope. The infimum of
the arbitrage free prices is characterized by the lower Snell envelope. In this
paper we focus on the lower Snell envelope. We construct a regular version of
this stochastic process. To this end, we apply results due to Dellacherie and
Lenglart on regularization of stochastic processes and T -Systems.
