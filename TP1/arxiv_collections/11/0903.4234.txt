The cold-atom on a two-dimensional square optical lattice is studied within
the hard-core boson Hubbard model with an alternating potential. In terms of
the quantum Monte Carlo method, it is shown explicitly that a supersolid phase
emerges due to the presence of the alternating potential. For the weak
alternating potential, the supersolid state appears for the whole range of
hard-core boson densities except the half-filling case, where the system is a
Mott insulator. However, for the strong alternating potential, besides the
supersolid and Mott insulating states, a charge density wave phase appears.
