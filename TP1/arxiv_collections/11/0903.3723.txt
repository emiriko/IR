In this letter, we derive the Hawking temperature in the tunneling method by
considering the system is open to the environment. This consideration yields
the temperature which is higher than the standard one. The correction of
temperatures depends on spectral density of bath oscillators which is
responsible for dissipation effect in our analysis.
