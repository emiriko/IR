To elucidate the underlying nature of the hidden order (HO) state in
heavy-fermion compound URu2Si2, we measure electrical transport properties of
ultraclean crystals in a high field/low temperature regime. Unlike previous
studies, the present system with much less impurity scattering resolves a
distinct anomaly of the Hall resistivity at H*=22.5 T well below the
destruction field of the HO phase ~36 T. In addition, a novel quantum
oscillation appears above a magnetic field slightly below H*. These results
indicate an abrupt reconstruction of the Fermi surface, which implies a
possible phase transition well within the HO phase caused by a band-dependent
destruction of the HO parameter. The present results definitely indicate that
the HO transition should be described by an itinerant electron picture.
