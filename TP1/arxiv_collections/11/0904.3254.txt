In Sphingomonas CHY-1, a single ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase is responsible
for the initial attack of a range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
composed of up to five rings. The components of this enzyme were separately
purified and characterized. The oxygenase component (ht-PhnI) was shown to
contain one Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster and one mononuclear Fe center per
alpha subunit, based on EPR measurements and iron assay. Steady-state kinetic
measurements revealed that the enzyme had a relatively low apparent Michaelis
constant for naphthalene (Km= 0.92 $\pm$ 0.15 $\mu$M), and an apparent
specificity constant of 2.0 $\pm$ 0.3 $\mu$M-1 s-1. Naphthalene was converted
to the corresponding 1,2-dihydrodiol with stoichiometric oxidation of NADH. On
the other hand, the oxidation of eight other PAHs occurred at slower rates, and
with coupling efficiencies that decreased with the enzyme reaction rate.
Uncoupling was associated with hydrogen peroxide formation, which is
potentially deleterious to cells and might inhibit PAH degradation. In single
turnover reactions, ht-PhnI alone catalyzed PAH hydroxylation at a faster rate
in the presence of organic solvent, suggesting that the transfer of substrate
to the active site is a limiting factor. The four-ring PAHs chrysene and
benz[a]anthracene were subjected to a double ring-dihydroxylation, giving rise
to the formation of a significant proportion of bis-cis-dihydrodiols. In
addition, the dihydroxylation of benz[a]anthracene yielded three dihydrodiols,
the enzyme showing a preference for carbons in positions 1,2 and 10,11. This is
the first characterization of a dioxygenase able to dihydroxylate PAHs made up
of four and five rings.
