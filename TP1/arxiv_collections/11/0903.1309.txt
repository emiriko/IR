A controlled hybridization between full quantum dynamics and semiclassical
approaches (mean-field and truncated Wigner) is implemented for interacting
many-boson systems. It is then demonstrated how simulating the resulting hybrid
evolution equations allows one to obtain the full quantum dynamics for much
longer times than is possible using an exact treatment directly. A collision of
sodium BECs with 1.x10^5 atoms is simulated, in a regime that is difficult to
describe semiclassically. The uncertainty of physical quantities depends on the
statistics of the full quantum prediction. Cutoffs are minimised to a
discretization of the Hamiltonian. The technique presented is quite general and
extension to other systems is considered.
