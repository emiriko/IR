We discuss the DISORT-based radiative transfer pipeline ('CRISM_LambertAlb')
for atmospheric and thermal correction of MRO/CRISM data acquired in
multispectral mapping mode (~200 m/pixel, 72 spectral channels). Currently, in
this phase-one version of the system, we use aerosol optical depths, surface
temperatures, and lower-atmospheric temperatures, all from climatology derived
from Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (MGS-TES) data, and
surface altimetry derived from MGS Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA). The
DISORT-based model takes as input the dust and ice aerosol optical depths
(scaled to the CRISM wavelength range), the surface pressures (computed from
MOLA altimetry, MGS-TES lower-atmospheric thermometry, and Viking-based
pressure climatology), the surface temperatures, the reconstructed instrumental
photometric angles, and the measured I/F spectrum, and then outputs a
Lambertian albedo spectrum. The Lambertian albedo spectrum is valuable
geologically since it allows the mineralogical composition to be estimated.
Here, I/F is defined as the ratio of the radiance measured by CRISM to the
solar irradiance at Mars divided by $\pi$. After discussing the capabilities
and limitations of the pipeline software system, we demonstrate its application
on several multispectral data cubes: the outer northern ice cap of Mars,
Tyrrhena Terra, and near the landing site for the Phoenix mission. For the icy
spectra near the northern polar cap, aerosols need to be included in order to
properly correct for the CO_2 absorption in the H_{2}O ice bands at wavelengths
near 2.0 $\mu$m. In future phases of software development, we intend to use
CRISM data directly in order to retrieve the spatiotemporal maps of aerosol
optical depths, surface pressure and surface temperature.
