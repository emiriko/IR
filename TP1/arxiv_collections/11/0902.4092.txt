We give an alternative description of the new data produced in the KamLAND
experiment, assuming the existence of a natural nuclear reactor on the boundary
of the liquid and solid phases of the Earth's core. Analyzing the uncertainty
of antineutrino spectrum of georeactor origin, we show that the theoretical
(which takes into account the soliton-like nuclear georeactor with power about
20 TW) reactor antineutrino spectrum describes with good accuracy the new
experimental KamLAND-data. At the same time the parameters of mixing calculated
within the framework of georeactor hypothesis are substantially closer to the
data of solar flux SNO-experiment then the parameters of mixing obtained in
KamLAND-experiment.
