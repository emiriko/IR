We geometrically study the Legendre duality relation that plays an important
role in statistical physics with the standard or generalized entropies. For
this purpose, we introduce dualistic structure defined by information geometry,
and discuss concepts arising in generalized thermostatistics, such as relative
entropies, escort distributions and modified expectations. Further, a possible
generalization of these concepts in a certain direction is also considered.
Finally, as an application of such a geometric viewpoint, we briefly
demonstrate several new results on a behavior of the solution to the nonlinear
diffusion equation called the {\em porous medium equation}.
