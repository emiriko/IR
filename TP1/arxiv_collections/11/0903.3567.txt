Using multi-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations we study ion
acceleration from a foil irradiated by a circularly polarized laser pulse at
1022W/cm^2 intensity. When the foil is shaped initially in the transverse
direction to match the laser intensity profile, the center part of the target
can be uniformly accelerated for a longer time compared to a usual flat target.
Target deformation and undesirable plasma heating are effectively suppressed.
The final energy spectrum of the accelerated ion beam is improved dramatically.
Collimated GeV quasi-mono-energetic ion beams carrying as much as 18% of the
laser energy are observed in multi-dimensional simulations. Radiation damping
effects are also checked in the simulations.
