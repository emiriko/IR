We demonstrate the long-distance transmission of an ultra-stable optical
frequency derived directly from a state-of-the-art optical frequency standard.
Using an active stabilization system we deliver the frequency via a 146 km long
underground fiber link with a fractional instability of 3*10^{-15} at 1 s,
which is close to the theoretical limit for our transfer experiment. The
relative uncertainty for the transfer is below 1*10^{-19} after 30 000 seconds.
Tests with a very short fiber show that noise in our stabilization system
contributes fluctuations which are two orders of magnitude lower, namely
3*10^{-17} at 1 s, reaching 10^{-20} after 4000 s.
