A space-based superconducting gravitational low-frequency wave detector is
considered. Sensitivity of the detector is sufficient to use the detector as a
partner of other contemporary low-frequency detectors like LIGO and LISA. This
device can also be very useful for experimental study of other effects
predicted by theories of gravitation.
