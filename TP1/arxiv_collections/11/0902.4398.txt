The aim of this work is to search for radio signals in the quiescent phase of
accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars, in this way giving an ultimate proof of
the recycling model, thereby unambiguously establishing that accreting
millisecond X-ray pulsars are the progenitors of radio millisecond pulsars.
  To overcome the possible free-free absorption caused by matter surrounding
accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars in their quiescence phase, we performed the
observations at high frequencies. Making use of particularly precise orbital
and spin parameters obtained from X-ray observations, we carried out a deep
search for radio-pulsed emission from the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar
XTE J0929-314 in three steps, correcting for the effect of the dispersion due
to the interstellar medium, eliminating the orbital motions effects, and
finally folding the time series.
  No radio pulsation is present in the analyzed data down to a limit of 68
microJy at 6.4 GHz and 26 microJy at 8.5 GHz.
  We discuss several mechanisms that could prevent the detection, concluding
that beaming factor and intrinsic low luminosity are the most likely
explanations.
