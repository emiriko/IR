Skeptics of biological evolution often claim that evolution requires a
decrease in entropy, giving rise to a conflict with the second law of
thermodynamics. This argument is fallacious because it neglects the large
increase in entropy provided by sunlight striking the Earth. A recent article
provided a quantitative assessment of the entropies involved and showed
explicitly that there is no conflict. That article rests on an unjustified
assumption about the amount of entropy reduction involved in evolution. I
present a refinement of the argument that does not rely on this assumption.
