The blackbody radiation (BBR) shift of the 5s - 4d_{5/2} clock transition in
88Sr+ is calculated to be 0.250(9) Hz at room temperature, T=300K, using the
relativistic all-order method where all single and double excitations of the
Dirac-Fock wave function are included to all orders of perturbation theory. The
BBR shift is a major component in the uncertainty budget of the optical
frequency standard based on the 88Sr+ trapped ion. The scalar polarizabilities
of the 5s and 4d_{5/2} levels, as well as the tensor polarizability of the
4d_{5/2} level, are presented together with the evaluation of their
uncertainties. The lifetimes of the 4d_{3/2}, 4d_{5/2}, 5p_{1/2}, and 5p_{3/2}
states are calculated and compared with experimental values.
