Injection-type ballistic rectifiers on Si/SiGe are studied with respect to
the influence of gate voltage on the transfer resistance RT (output voltage
divided by input current) for different positions of a local gate electrode.
The rectifiers are trifurcated quantum wires with straight voltage stem and
oblique current-injecting leads. Depending on the gate configuration,
thermopower contributions arise from nearly-pinched stem regions which either
cancel each other or impose upon the ballistic signal with same or opposite
polarity. At best, this enhances RT to a maximum value of 470 Ohm close to
threshold voltage.
