WIMPless dark matter offers an attractive framework in which dark matter can
be very light. We investigate the implications of such scenarios on invisible
decays of bottomonium states for dark matter with a mass less than around $5
{\rm GeV}$. We relate these decays to measurements of nucleon-dark matter
elastic scattering. We also investigate the effect that a coupling to $s$
quarks has on flavor changing $b\to s$ processes involving missing energy.
