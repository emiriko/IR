ALOHA is one of the most basic Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols and
represents a foundation for other more sophisticated distributed and
asynchronous MAC protocols, e.g., CSMA. In this paper, unlike in the
traditional work that focused on mean value analysis, we study the
distributional properties of packet transmission delays over an ALOHA channel.
We discover a new phenomenon showing that a basic finite population ALOHA model
with variable size (exponential) packets is characterized by power law
transmission delays, possibly even resulting in zero throughput. These results
are in contrast to the classical work that shows exponential delays and
positive throughput for finite population ALOHA with fixed packets.
Furthermore, we characterize a new stability condition that is entirely derived
from the tail behavior of the packet and backoff distributions that may not be
determined by mean values. The power law effects and the possible instability
might be diminished, or perhaps eliminated, by reducing the variability of
packets. However, we show that even a slotted (synchronized) ALOHA with packets
of constant size can exhibit power law delays when the number of active users
is random. From an engineering perspective, our results imply that the
variability of packet sizes and number of active users need to be taken into
consideration when designing robust MAC protocols, especially for ad-hoc/sensor
networks where other factors, such as link failures and mobility, might further
compound the problem.
