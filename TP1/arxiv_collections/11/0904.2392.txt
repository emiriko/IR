Solar activity is studied using a cluster analysis of the time-fluctuations
of sunspot number. In the historic period (1850-1932) the cluster exponent was
approximately equal to 0.37 (strong clustering) for the high activity
components of the solar cycles. In the modern period (last seven solar cycles:
1933-2007) the cluster exponent was approximately equal to 0.50 (random, white
noise-like). Comparing these results with the corresponding data from
laboratory experiments on convection it is shown, that in the historic period
emergence of sunspots in the solar photosphere was dominated by turbulent
photospheric convection. In the modern period, this domination was broken by a
new more active dynamics of the inner layers of the convection zone. Cluster
properties of the solar wind magnetic field and the aa-geomagnetic-index also
support this result. Long-range chaotic dynamics in the solar activity is
briefly discussed.
