We consider a class of stochastic dynamical systems, called piecewise
deterministic Markov processes, with states $(x, \s)\in \O\times \G$, $\O$
being a region in $\bbR^d$ or the $d$--dimensional torus, $\G$ being a finite
set. The continuous variable $x$ follows a piecewise deterministic dynamics,
the discrete variable $\s$ evolves by a stochastic jump dynamics and the two
resulting evolutions are fully--coupled. We study stationarity, reversibility
and time--reversal symmetries of the process. Increasing the frequency of the
$\s$--jumps, we show that the system behaves asymptotically as deterministic
and we investigate the structure of fluctuations (i.e. deviations from the
asymptotic behavior), recovering in a non Markovian frame results obtained by
Bertini et al. \cite{BDGJL1, BDGJL2, BDGJL3, BDGJL4}, in the context of
Markovian stochastic interacting particle systems. Finally, we discuss a
Gallavotti--Cohen--type symmetry relation with involution map different from
time--reversal. For several examples the above results are recovered by
explicit computations.
