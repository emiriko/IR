We microscopically derive transport equations for the conduction electrons in
ferromagnetic materials with an inhomogeneous magnetization profile. Our
quantum kinetic approach includes elastic scattering and anisotropic spin-flip
scattering at magnetic impurities. In the diffusive limit, we calculate the
resistance through a domain wall and find that the domain-wall resistance can
be positive or negative. In the limit of long domain walls we derive analytical
expressions and compare them with existing works, which used less general
models or different theoretical frameworks.
