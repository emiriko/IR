During the last decades algebraization of space turned out to be a promising
tool at the interface between Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. Starting
with works by Gel'fand-Kolmogoroff and Gel'fand-Naimark, this branch developed
as from the fortieth in two directions: algebraic characterization of usual
geometric space on the one hand, and algebraically defined noncommutative
space, which is known to be tightly related with e.g. quantum gravity and super
string theory, on the other hand. In this note, we combine both aspects, prove
a superversion of Shanks and Pursell's classical result stating that any
isomorphism of the Lie algebras of compactly supported vector fields is
implemented by a diffeomorphism of underlying manifolds. We thus provide a
super Lie algebraic characterization of super and graded spaces and describe
explicitly isomorphisms of the super Lie algebras of super vector fields.
