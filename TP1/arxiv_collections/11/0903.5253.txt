Applying time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA), we study the
high-order harmonic generation (HHG) of ethylene subjected to the one-color
($\omega=2.72$ eV) and the two-color ($\omega_1=2.72$ eV and $\omega_2=5.44$
eV) ultrashort intense laser pulses. The HHG spectrum of ethylene in the
one-color laser field shows the obvious plateaus and odd order harmonics are
produced while the two-color laser field can result in the breaking of the
symmetry and generation of the even order harmonic. The ionization
probabilities are obtained showing the increase of the ionization probability
of higher charge state by the two-color laser field. The temporal structures of
HHG spectrum of ethylene is explored by means of the time-frequency analysis
showing new insights of the HHG mechanisms in the one-color and the two-color
laser fields.
