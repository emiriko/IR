Although empirical evidence indicates that that the universe's gas had become
ionized by redshift z ~ 6, the mechanism by which this transition occurred
remains unclear. In this article, we explore the possibility that dark matter
annihilations may have played the dominant role in this process. Energetic
electrons produced in these annihilations can scatter with the cosmic microwave
background to generate relatively low energy gamma rays, which ionize and heat
gas far more efficiently than higher energy prompt photons. In contrast to
previous studies, we find that viable dark matter candidates with electroweak
scale masses can naturally provide the dominant contribution to the
reionization of the universe. Intriguingly, we find that dark matter candidates
capable of producing the recent cosmic ray excesses observed by PAMELA and/or
ATIC are also predicted to lead to the full reionization of the universe by z ~
6.
