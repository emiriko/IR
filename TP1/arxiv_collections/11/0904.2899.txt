A new classical solution for the SU(2) Yang-Mills theory, in which the
Euclidean energy plays a role of a parameter is found. A correspondence between
this solution and the known selfdual multi-instanton configuration, which has
the topological charge N, is discussed, the number of parameters governing the
new solution is found to be 8N+1. For negative energies the new solution is
periodic in Euclidean time, for positive energies it exhibits the effect of
localization, which states that the solution is completely described within a
finite interval of time, for zero energy the found solution is reduced to a
selfdual one.
