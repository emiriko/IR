The concept of the limiting step is extended to the asymptotology of
multiscale reaction networks. Complete theory for linear networks with well
separated reaction rate constants is developed. We present algorithms for
explicit approximations of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of kinetic matrix.
Accuracy of estimates is proven. Performance of the algorithms is demonstrated
on simple examples. Application of algorithms to nonlinear systems is
discussed.
