Recently superconductivity at the interface between the insulators LaAlO3 and
SrTiO3 has been tuned with the electric field effect to an unprecedented range
of transition temperatures. Here we perform a detailed finite size scaling
analysis to explore the compatibility of the phase transition line with
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) behavior and a 2D-quantum
phase(QP)-transition. In an intermediate regime, limited by a gate voltage
dependent limiting length, we uncover remarkable consistency with a
BKT-critical line ending at a metallic quantum critical point, separating a
weakly localized insulator from the superconducting phase. Our estimates for
the critical exponents of the 2D-QP-transition, z=1 and nu=0.66, suggest that
it belongs to the 3D-xy universality class.
