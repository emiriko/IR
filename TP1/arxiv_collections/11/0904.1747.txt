We study the time variations of the cycles of 20 active stars based on
decades-long photometric or spectroscopic observations. A method of
time-frequency analysis, as discussed in a companion paper, is applied to the
data. Fifteen stars definitely show multiple cycles; the records of the rest
are too short to verify a timescale for a second cycle. The cycles typically
show systematic changes. For three stars, we found two cycles in each of them
that are not harmonics, and which vary in parallel, indicating that a common
physical mechanism arising from a dynamo construct. The positive relation
between the rotational and cycle periods is confirmed for the inhomogeneous set
of active stars. Stellar activity cycles are generally multiple and variable.
