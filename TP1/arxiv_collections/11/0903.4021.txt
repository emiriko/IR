The issue of quantum size effects of interactive electron-hole systems in
spherical semiconductor quantum dots is put to question. A sharper theoretical
approach is suggested based on a new pseudo-potential method. In this new
setting, analytical computations can be performed in most intermediate steps
lending stronger support to the adopted physical assumptions. The resulting
numerical values for physical quantities are found to be much closer to the
experimental values than those existing so far in the literature.
