In this paper, following an elementary line of thought which somewhat differs
from the usual one, we prove once more that any deterministic theory
predictively equivalent to quantum mechanics unavoidably exhibits a contextual
character. The purpose of adopting this perspective is that of paving the way
for a critical analysis of the use of counterfactual arguments when dealing
with nonlocal physical processes.
