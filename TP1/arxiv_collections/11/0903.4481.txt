A definition of `dynamical generation', a hotly debated topic at present, is
proposed and its implications are discussed. This definition, in turn, leads to
a method allowing to distinguish in principle tetraquark and molecular states.
The different concept of `dynamical reconstruction' is also introduced and
applies to the generation of preexisting mesons (quark-antiquark, glueballs,
>...) via unitarization methods applied to low-energy effective Lagrangians.
Large $N_{c}$ arguments play an important role in all these investigations. A
simple toy model with two scalar fields is introduced to elucidate these
concepts. The large $N_{c}$ behavior of the parameters is chosen in order that
the two scalar fields behave as quark-antiquark mesons. When the heavier field
is integrated out, one is left with an effective Lagrangian with the lighter
field only. A unitarization method applied to the latter allows to
`reconstruct' the heavier `quarkonium-like' field, which was previously
integrated out. It is shown that a Bethe-Salpeter (BS) analysis is capable to
reproduce the preformed quark-antiquark state. However, when only the lowest
term of the effective Lagrangian is retained, the large $N_{c}$ limit of the
reconstructed state is not reproduced: instead of the correct large $N_{c}$
quarkonium limit, it fades out as a molecular state would do. Implications of
these results are presented: it is proposed that axial-vector, tensor and
(some) scalar mesons just above 1 GeV obtained via the BS approach from the
corresponding low-energy, effective Lagrangian in which only the lowest term is
kept, are quarkonia states, in agreement with the constituent quark model,
although they might fade away as molecular states in the large $N_{c}$ limit.
