The dielectron widths of $\Upsilon(nS) (n=1,...,7)$ and vector decay
constants are calculated using the Relativistic String Hamiltonian with a
universal interaction. For $\Upsilon(nS) (n=1,2,3)$ the dielectron widths and
their ratios are obtained in full agreement with the latest CLEO data. For
$\Upsilon(10580)$ and $\Upsilon(11020)$ a good agreement with experiment is
reached only if the 4S--3D mixing (with a mixing angle $\theta=27^\circ\pm
4^\circ$) and 6S--5D mixing (with $\theta=40^\circ\pm 5^\circ$) are taken into
account. The possibility to observe higher "mixed $D$-wave" resonances,
$\tilde\Upsilon(n {}^3D_1)$ with $n=3,4,5$ is discussed. In particular,
$\tilde\Upsilon(\approx 11120)$, originating from the pure $5 {}^3D_1$ state,
can acquire a rather large dielectron width, $\sim 130$ eV, so that this
resonance may become manifest in the $e^+e^-$ experiments. On the contrary, the
widths of pure $D$-wave states are very small, $\Gamma_{ee}(n{}^3 D_1) \leq 2$
eV.
