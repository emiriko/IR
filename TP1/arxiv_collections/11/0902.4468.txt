We consider an optical quantum dot where an electron level and a hole level
are coupled to respective superconducting leads. We find that electrons and
holes recombine producing photons at discrete energies as well as a continuous
tail. Further, the spectral lines directly probe the induced superconducting
correlations on the dot. At energies close to the applied bias voltage eV, a
parameter range exists, where radiation proceeds in pairwise emission of
polarization correlated photons. At energies close to 2eV, emitted photons are
associated with Cooper pair transfer and are reminiscent of Josephson
radiation. We discuss how to probe the coherence of these photons in a SQUID
geometry via single photon interference.
