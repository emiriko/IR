We compute the black hole entropy in the context of the Modified Dispersion
Relations using the brick wall model. An explicit dependence of the radial
coordinate approaching the horizon is shown to analyze the behavior of the
divergence. We find that, due to the modification of the density of states, the
brick wall can be eliminated. By assuming a specific form for the radial
coordinate $r(E/E_{P}) $, we examine a possible candidate for $r(E/E_{P}) $. A
comparison with the 't Hooft approach is presented.
