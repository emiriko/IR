The gyrocenter phase-space transformation used to describe nonlinear
gyrokinetic theory is rediscovered by a recursive solution of the Hamiltonian
dynamics associated with the perturbed guiding-center Vlasov operator. The
present work clarifies the relation between the derivation of the gyrocenter
phase-space coordinates by the guiding-center recursive Vlasov method and the
method of Lie-transform phase-space transformations.
