The cross section for production of Z bosons with two associated b-jets, and
Z decaying to leptons, can be measured at the LHC with about 100 pb-1 of data.
We use simulated data to study possible strategies for an early measurement of
this process with the CMS detector. The rate and kinematic properties of this
final state needs to be well understood because it constitutes a large fraction
of the total backgrounds to several of the Higgs discovery channels at the LHC.
