The first results on next-to-leading order QCD corrections to production of
direct photon pairs in hadronic collisions in the large extra dimension models-
ADD and RS are presented. Various kinematical distributions are obtained to
order alpha_s in QCD by taking into account all the parton level subprocesses.
Our Monte Carlo based code incorporates all the experimental cuts suitable for
physics studies at the LHC. We estimate the impact of the QCD corrections on
various observables and find that they are significant. We also show the
reduction in factorisation scale uncertainity when order alpha_s effects are
included.
