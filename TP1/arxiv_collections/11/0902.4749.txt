Conformal Ricci and conformal matter collineations for the combination of two
perfect fluids in General Relativity are investigated. We study the existence
of timelike and spacelike conformal Ricci and matter collineations by
introducing the kinematical and dynamical properties of such fluids and using
the Einstein field equations. Some recent studies on conformal collineations
are extended and new results are found. It is worth mentioning that we recover
all the previous results a special cases.
