Propane steam reforming using a sliding discharge reactor was investigated
under atmospheric pressure and low temperature (420 K). Non-thermal plasma
steam reforming proceeded efficiently and hydrogen was formed as a main product
(H2 concentration up to 50%). By-products (C2-hydrocarbons, methane, carbon
dioxide) were measured with concentrations lower than 6%. The mean electrical
power injected in the discharge is less than 2 kW. The process efficiency is
described in terms of propane conversion rate, steam reforming and cracking
selectivity, as well as by-products production. Chemical processes modelling
based on classical thermodynamic equilibrium reactor is also proposed.
Calculated data fit quiet well experimental results and indicate that the
improvement of C3H8 conversion and then H2 production can be achieved by
increasing the gas fraction through the discharge. By improving the reactor
design, the non-thermal plasma has a potential for being an effective way for
supplying hydrogen or synthesis gas.
