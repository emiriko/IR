Experimental results on diffraction from the Fermilab Tevatron collider
obtained by the CDF experiment are reviewed and compared. We report on the
diffractive structure function obtained from dijet production in the range
$0<Q^2<10,000$ GeV$^2$, and on the $|t|$ distribution in the region $0<|t<1$
GeV$^2$ for both soft and hard diffractive events up to $Q^2\approx 4,500$
GeV$^2$. Results on single diffractive W/Z production, forward jets, and
central exclusive production of both dijets and diphotons are also presented.
