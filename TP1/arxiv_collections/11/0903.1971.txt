We explicitly show that split-universal extra dimension (split-UED), a
recently suggested extension of universal extra dimension (UED) model, can
nicely explain recent anomalies in cosmic-ray positrons and electrons observed
by PAMELA and ATIC/PPB-BETS. Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matters mainly annihilate
into leptons because the hadronic branching fraction is highly suppressed by
large KK quark masses and the antiproton flux agrees very well with the
observation where no excess is found . The flux of cosmic gamma-rays from pion
decay is also highly suppressed and hardly detected in low energy region (E<20
GeV). Collider signatures of colored KK particles at the LHC, especially q_1
q_1 production, are studied in detail. Due to the large split in masses of KK
quarks and other particles, hard p_T jets and missing E_T are generated, which
make it possible to suppress the standard model background and discover the
signals.
