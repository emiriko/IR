In a companion paper, equations for partially molten media were derived using
two-scale homogenization theory. One advantage of homogenization is that
material properties, such as permeability and viscosity, readily emerge. A
caveat is that the dependence of these parameters upon the microstructure is
not self-evident. In particular, one seeks to relate them to the porosity. In
this paper, we numerically solve ensembles of the cell problems from which
these quantities emerge. Using this data, we estimate relationships between the
parameters and the porosity. In particular, the bulk viscosity appears to be
inversely proportional to the porosity. Finally, we synthesize these numerical
estimates with the models. Our hybrid numerical--analytical model predicts that
the compaction length vanishes with porosity.
