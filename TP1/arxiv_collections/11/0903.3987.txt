In order to find counterparts of the detected objects in the AKARI Deep Field
South (ADFS) in all available wavelengths, we searched public databases (NED,
SIMBAD and others). Checking 500 sources brighter than 0.0482 Jy in the AKARI
Wide-S band, we found 114 sources with possible counterparts, among which 78
were known galaxies. We present these sources as well as our first attempt to
construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for the most secure and most
interesting sources among them, taking into account all the known data together
with the AKARI measurements in four bands.
