Torus fixed points of quiver moduli spaces are given by stable
representations of the universal (abelian) covering quiver. As far as the
Kronecker quiver is concerned they can be described by stable representations
of certain bipartite quivers coming along with a stable colouring. By use of
the glueing method it is possible to construct a huge class of such quivers
implying a lower bound for the Euler characteristic. For certain roots it is
even possible to construct all torus fixed points.
