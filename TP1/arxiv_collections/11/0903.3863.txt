An ultracold gas is considered, loaded into a lattice, each site of which is
formed by a double-well potential. Initial conditions, after the loading,
correspond to a nonequilibrium state. The nonlinear dynamics of the system,
starting with a nonequilibrium state, is analysed in the local-field
approximation. The importance of taking into account attenuation, caused by
particle collisions, is emphasized. The presence of this attenuation
dramatically influences the system dynamics.
