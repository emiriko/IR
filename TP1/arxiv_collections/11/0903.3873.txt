In the paper the solution of KZ system (n=4, m=2) is constructed in the
explicit form in terms of the hypergeometric functions. We proved that the
corresponding solution is rational when the parameter $\rho$ is integer. We
show that in the case (n=4, m=5, $\rho$ is integer) the corresponding KZ system
hasn't got a rational solution.
