For the past 3 years we have been monitoring 62 K giant stars using precise
stellar radial velocity (RV) measurements with the 2m Alfred Jensch telescope
of the Th\"uringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg (TLS). To probe the dependence
of planet formation on stellar mass by finding planets around intermediate-mass
giant stars. We present high accuracy RV measurements of the K1.5 III star 42
Dra and the K4 III star HD 139357. The wavelength reference for the RV
measurements was provided by an iodine absorption cell placed in the optical
path of the spectrograph. Our measurements reveal that the time series of the
radial velocity of 42 Dra shows a periodic variation of 479.1 days. HD 139357
shows periodic RV variations of 1125.7 days. Keplerian motion is the most
likely explanation for the observed radial velocity variations for these stars.
Thus the K giant stars 42 Dra and HD 139357 host extrasolar planets.
