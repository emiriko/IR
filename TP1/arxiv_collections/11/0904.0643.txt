Given a time series of multicomponent measurements x(t), the usual objective
of nonlinear blind source separation (BSS) is to find a "source" time series
s(t), comprised of statistically independent combinations of the measured
components. In this paper, the source time series is required to have a density
function in (s,ds/dt)-space that is equal to the product of density functions
of individual components. This formulation of the BSS problem has a solution
that is unique, up to permutations and component-wise transformations.
Separability is shown to impose constraints on certain locally invariant
(scalar) functions of x, which are derived from local higher-order correlations
of the data's velocity dx/dt. The data are separable if and only if they
satisfy these constraints, and, if the constraints are satisfied, the sources
can be explicitly constructed from the data. The method is illustrated by using
it to separate two speech-like sounds recorded with a single microphone.
