We investigate the clustering properties of dynamical Dark Energy even in
association of a possible coupling between Dark Energy and Dark Matter. We find
that within matter inhomogeneities, Dark Energy migth form voids as well as
overdensity depending on how its background energy density evolves.
Consequently and contrarily to what expected, Dark Energy fluctuations are
found to be slightly suppressed if a coupling with Dark Matter is permitted.
When considering density contrasts and scales typical of superclusters, voids
and supervoids, perturbations amplitudes range from $|\delta_\phi|\sim {\cal O}
(10^{-6})$ to $|\delta_\phi|\sim {\cal O} (10^{-4})$ indicating an almost
homogeneous Dark Energy component.
