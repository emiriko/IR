We report on a signature of chromospheric downflows in two emerging-flux
regions detected by time-distance helioseismology analysis. We use both
chromospheric intensity oscillation data in the Ca II H line and photospheric
Dopplergrams in the Fe I 557.6nm line obtained by Hinode/SOT for our analyses.
By cross-correlating the Ca II oscillation signals, we have detected a
travel-time anomaly in the plage regions; outward travel times are shorter than
inward travel times by 0.5-1 minute. However, such an anomaly is absent in the
Fe I data. These results can be interpreted as evidence of downflows in the
lower chromosphere. The downflow speed is estimated to be below 10 km/s. This
result demonstrates a new possibility of studying chromospheric flows by
time-distance analysis.
