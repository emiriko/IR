Three-body calculations of (d,p) and (p,d) reactions involving one-neutron
halo nuclei 11Be and 15C are performed using the framework of Faddeev-type
scattering equations. Important effects of the optical potential nonlocality
are found improving the description of the experimental data. The obtained
values for the neutron spectroscopic factor are consistent with estimations
from other approaches.
