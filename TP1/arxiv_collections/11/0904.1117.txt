We investigate the chance of detecting proto-planetary or debris disks in
stars that induce microlensing events (lenses). The modification of the light
curves shapes due to occultation and extinction by the disks as well as the
additional gravitational deflection caused by the additional mass is
considered. The magnification of gravitational microlensing events is
calculated using the ray shooting method. The occultation is taken into account
by neglecting or weighting the images on the lens plane according to a
transmission map of the corresponding disk for a point source point lens (PSPL)
model. The estimated frequency of events is obtained by taking the possible
inclinations and optical depths of the disk into account. We conclude that
gravitational microlensing can be used, in principle, as a tool for detecting
debris disks beyond 1 kpc, but estimate that each year of the order of 1 debris
disk is expected for lens stars of F, G, or K spectral type and of the order of
10 debris disks might have shown signatures in existing datasets.
