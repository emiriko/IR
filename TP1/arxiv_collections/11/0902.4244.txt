The origin of rapid spectral variability and certain spectral correlations of
the prompt gamma-ray burst emission remains an intriguing question. The
recently proposed theoretical model of the prompt emission is build upon unique
spectral properties of jitter radiation -- the radiation from small-scale
magnetic fields generated at a site of strong energy release (e.g., a
relativistic collisionless shock in baryonic or pair-dominated ejecta, or a
reconnection site in a magnetically-dominated outflow). Here we present the
results of implementation of the model. We show that anisotropy of the jitter
radiation pattern and relativistic shell kinematics altogether produce effects
commonly observed in time-resolved spectra of the prompt emission, e.g., the
softening of the spectrum below the peak energy within individual pulses in the
prompt light-curve, the so-called "tracking" behavior (correlation of the
observed flux with other spectral parameters), the emergence of hard,
synchrotron-violating spectra at the beginning of individual spikes. Several
observational predictions of the model are discussed.
