The supernova paradigm for the origin of galactic cosmic rays can be tested
using multifrequency observations of both non-thermal and thermal emission from
supernova remnants. The smoking gun of hadronic acceleration in these sources
can, however, only be provided by the detection of a high energy neutrino
signal. Here we apply the theory of non-linear particle acceleration at
supernova shocks to the case of the supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946, which is
becoming the stereotypical example of a possible hadronic accelerator after the
detection of high energy gamma rays by the HESS telescope. Our aim is twofold:
on one hand we want to address the uncertainties in the discrimination between
a hadronic and a leptonic interpretation of the gamma ray emission, mainly
related to the possibility of a statistical uncertainty in the energy
determination of the gamma ray photons in the TeV region. On the other we want
to stress how a km cube neutrino telescope would break the degeneracy and
provide evidence for efficient cosmic ray acceleration in RX J1713.7-3946. A 3
sigma evidence would require about two years of observation.
