We extend the noncommutative (NC) standard model to incorporate singlet
particles as cold dark matter. In the NC space-time, the singlet particles can
be coupled to the U(1) gauge field in the adjoint representation. We Study the
relic density of the singlet particles due to the NC induced interaction.
Demanding either the singlet fermion or the singlet scalar to serve as cold
dark matter and the NC induced interactions to be relevant to the dark matter
production, we obtain the corresponding relations between the NC scale and the
dark matter masses, which are consistent with some existing bounds.
