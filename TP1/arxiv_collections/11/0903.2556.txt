We have studied the symmetric and non-symmetric pairwise ground state and
thermal entanglement in three-qubit anisotropic Heisenberg (XXZ) and Ising in a
magnetic field models and in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)
interaction. We have found that increasing of the DM interaction and magnetic
field can enhance and reduce the entanglement of system. We have shown that the
non-symmetric pairwise has higher value concurrence and critical temperature
(above which the entanglement vanishes) than the symmetric pairwise. For
negative anisotropy the non-symmetric entanglement is a monotonic function of
DM interaction while for positive anisotropy it has a maximum versus DM
parameter and vanishes for larger values of DM interaction. The conditions for
the existence of thermal entanglement are discussed in details. The most
remarkable result happens at zero temperature where 3-qubit ground state
entanglement of the system (in spite of 2-qubit counterpart) shows the
fingerprint of quantum phase transition for an infinite size system.
