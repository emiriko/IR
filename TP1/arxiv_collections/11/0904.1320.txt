Strong final-state interactions create a pronounced cusp in eta' --> eta pi0
pi0 decays. We adapt and generalize the non-relativistic effective field theory
framework developed for the extraction of pi pi scattering lengths from K --> 3
pi decays to this case. The cusp effect is predicted to have an effect of more
than 8% on the decay spectrum below the pi+ pi- threshold.
