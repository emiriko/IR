Interaction between two interpenetrating spherically symmetric charge
distributions has been calculated. Limited range terms appear in addition to
the Coulomb potential. Its strength increases and range decreases with reducing
sizes of the interacting particles. Between two hydrogen atoms it yields the
Morse Potential. Soft core potentials are obtained between pairs of nucleons.
It has been shown that when high-energy particles approach one another the
potential between them increases with increasing relative speed. They are not
likely to disintegrate on impact. A possible way of smashing particles by
3-body collisions is indicated.
