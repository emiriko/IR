Recent developments from the activity of the CGM Group are discussed.
Cosmological implications of fundamental approaches to quantization of gravity
are presented in order to fix the main issues as well as perspectives for
future investigations. Particular attention will be devoted to the classical
and quantum features of the generic inhomogeneous Universe, to the role of
reference frame in quantum gravity, and eventually to phenomenological features
related with the Kaluza-Klein framework.
