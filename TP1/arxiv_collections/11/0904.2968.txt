Streamers are the first stage of sparks and lightning; they grow due to a
strongly enhanced electric field at their tips; this field is created by a thin
curved space charge layer. These multiple scales are already challenging when
the electrons are approximated by densities. However, electron density
fluctuations in the leading edge of the front and non-thermal stretched tails
of the electron energy distribution (as a cause of X-ray emissions) require a
particle model to follow the electron motion. As super-particle methods create
wrong statistics and numerical artifacts, modeling the individual electron
dynamics in streamers is limited to early stages where the total electron
number still is limited.
  The method of choice is a hybrid computation in space where individual
electrons are followed in the region of high electric field and low density
while the bulk of the electrons is approximated by densities (or fluids). We
here develop the hybrid coupling for planar fronts. First, to obtain a
consistent flux at the interface between particle and fluid model in the hybrid
computation, the widely used classical fluid model is replaced by an extended
fluid model. Then the coupling algorithm and the numerical implementation of
the spatially hybrid model are presented in detail, in particular, the position
of the model interface and the construction of the buffer region. The method
carries generic features of pulled fronts that can be applied to similar
problems like large deviations in the leading edge of population fronts etc.
