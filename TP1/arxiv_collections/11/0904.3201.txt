We show that the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization data gathered
by the BOOMERanG 2003 flight and WMAP provide an opportunity to investigate
{\it in-vacuo} birefringence, of a type expected in some quantum pictures of
space-time, with a sensitivity that extends even beyond the desired
Planck-scale energy. In order to render this constraint more transparent we
rely on a well studied phenomenological model of quantum-gravity-induced
birefringence, in which one easily establishes that effects introduced at the
Planck scale would amount to values of a dimensionless parameter, denoted by
$\xi$, with respect to the Planck energy which are roughly of order 1. By
combining BOOMERanG and WMAP data we estimate $\xi \simeq -0.110 \pm 0.076$ at
the 68% c.l. Moreover, we forecast on the sensitivity to $\xi$ achievable by
future CMB polarization experiments (PLANCK, Spider, EPIC), which, in the
absence of systematics, will be at the 1-$\sigma$ confidence of $8.5 \times
10^{-4}$ (PLANCK), $6.1 \times 10^{-3}$ (Spider), and $1.0 \times 10^{-5}$
(EPIC) respectively. The cosmic variance-limited sensitivity from CMB is
$6.1\times 10^{-6}$.
