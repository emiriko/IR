In this paper we study the effect of a fluctuating gap in mono- and bilayer
graphene, created by a random staggered potential. We identify a continuous
symmetry for the two-particle Green's function which is spontaneously broken in
the average two-particle Green's function and leads to a massless fermion mode.
Within a loop expansion it is shown that the massless mode is dominated on
large scales by small loops. This result indicates diffusion of electrons.
Although the diffusion mechanism is the same in mono- and in bilayer graphene,
the amount of scattering is much stronger in the latter. Physical quantities at
the neutrality point, such as the density of states, the diffusion coefficient
and the conductivity, are determined by the one-particle scattering rate. All
these quantities vanish at a critical value of the average staggered potential,
signaling a continuous transition to an insulating behavior.
