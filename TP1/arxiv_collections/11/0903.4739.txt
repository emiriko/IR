Little Higgs models may provide a viable alternative to supersymmetry as an
extension of the Standard Model. After the introduction of a discrete $Z_2$
symmetry, dubbed T-parity into Little Higgs models they also contain a
promising dark matter candidate. We investigate a heavy neutrino as a dark
matter candidate in the Simplest Little Higgs with T-parity (SLHT) model. First
we calculate relic density constraints on the parameter space of the model and
then discuss collider signatures for the SLHT dark matter.
