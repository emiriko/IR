We applied the VESPA algorithm to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey final data
release of the Main Galaxies and Luminous Red Galaxies samples. The result is a
catalogue of stellar masses, detailed star formation and metallicity histories
and dust content of nearly 800,000 galaxies. We make the catalogue public via a
T-SQL database, which is described in detail in this paper. We present the
results using a range of stellar population and dust models, and will continue
to update the catalogue as new and improved models are made public. The data
and documentation are currently online, and can be found at
http://www-wfau.roe.ac.uk/vespa/. We also present a brief exploration of the
catalogue, and show that the quantities derived are robust: luminous red
galaxies can be described by one to three populations, whereas a main galaxy
sample galaxy needs on average two to five; red galaxies are older and less
dusty; the dust values we recover are well correlated with measured Balmer
decrements and star formation rates are also in agreement with previous
measurements.
