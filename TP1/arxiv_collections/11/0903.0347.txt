In the event of an observation of neutrinoless double beta decay, a relevant
question would be: what lepton number violating physics is responsible for the
decay? The exchange of Majorana neutrinos and/or supersymmetric particles may
contribute. We point out that measurements of supersymmetric signals at the
LHC, including single slepton production, could be used to help bound some
supersymmetric processes contributing to neutrinoless double beta decay. LHC
information about the supersymmetric spectrum could be combined with Bd-Bd bar
mixing data in order to bound a competing neutrinoless double beta decay
process involving sbottom exchange.
