We present a mechanism for cooling atoms by a laser beam reflected from a
single mirror. The cooling relies on the dipole force and thus in principle
applies to arbitrary refractive particles including atoms, molecules, or
dielectric spheres. Friction and equilibrium temperatures are derived by an
analytic perturbative approach. Finally, semiclassical Monte-Carlo simulations
are performed to validate the analytic results.
