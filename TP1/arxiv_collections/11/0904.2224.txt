Using 201Hg+ contained within a linear quadrupole rf ion trap that is part of
an atomic clock, we report the first high-resolution spectroscopy on the
hyperfine structure of 201Hg+. We measure the absolute ground state hyperfine
interval to be 29.954365821130(171)(62)(10) GHz, more than 8 orders of
magnitude improvement over the previous measurement. The first error estimate
in parentheses is the statistical error in the shifted line center measurement,
the second is systematic uncertainty, and the third is calibration uncertainty
in the hydrogen maser reference standard. By comparison to the already
accurately known ground state hyperfine interval for 199Hg+, we are able to
derive a new value for the hyperfine anomaly in singly ionized mercury,
Delta(S1/2, 199Hg+, 201Hg+) = -0.0016257(5), now limited by knowledge of the
nuclear magnetic moment ratio.
