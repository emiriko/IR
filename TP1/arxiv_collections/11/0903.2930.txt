A homogeneous color magnetic field is known to be unstable for the
fluctuations perpendicular to the field in the color space (the Nielsen-Olesen
instability). We argue that these unstable modes, exponentially growing,
generate an azimuthal magnetic field with the original field being in the
z-direction, which causes the Nielsen-Olesen instability for another type of
fluctuations. The growth rate of the latter unstable mode increases with the
momentum p_z and can become larger than the former's growth rate which
decreases with increasing p_z. These features may explain the interplay between
the primary and secondary instabilities observed in the real-time simulation of
a non-expanding glasma, i.e., stochastically generated anisotropic Yang-Mills
fields without expansion.
