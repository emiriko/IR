The nature of the explicit dependence on the particle number N and on the
spin number N_s of the Lieb definition for the energy density functional is
examined both in spin-free and in spin-polarized density functional theory.
First, it is pointed out that for ground states, the nonuniqueness of the
external magnetic field B(r) corresponding to a given pair of density n(r) and
spin density s(r) in spin-polarized density functional theory implies the
nonexistence of the derivative of the SDFT Lieb functional with respect to N_s.
Giving a suitable generalization of the Lieb functionals for n(r)'s and s(r)'s
with norms not equal to N and N_s of the functionals' subscripts, it is then
shown that the Lieb functionals' derivatives with respect to N and N_s are
equal to the derivatives, with respect to N and N_s, of the total energies
E[N,v] and E[N,N_s,v,B] minus the external-field energy components,
respectively.
