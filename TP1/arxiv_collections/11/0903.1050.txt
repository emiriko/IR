The diffusive behavior of a harmonic oscillator driven by a Mittag-Leffler
noise is studied. Using Laplace analysis we derive exact expressions for the
relaxation functions of the particle in terms of generalized Mittag-Leffler
functions and its derivatives from a generalized Langevin equation. Our results
show that the oscillator displays an anomalous diffusive behavior. In the
strictly asymptotic limit, the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator corresponds
to an oscillator driven by a noise with a pure power-law autocorrelation
function. However, at short and intermediate times the dynamics has qualitative
difference due to the presence of the characteristic time of the noise.
