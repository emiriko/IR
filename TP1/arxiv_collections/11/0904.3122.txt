Given pseudo-random binary sequence of length $L$, assuming it consists of
$k$ sub-sequences of length $N$. We estimate how $k$ scales with growing $N$ to
obtain a {\it limiting} ergodic behaviour, to fulfill the basic definition of
ergodicity (due to Boltzmann). The average of the consecutive sub-sequences
plays the role of time (temporal) average. This average then compared to
ensemble average to estimate quantitative value of a simple metric called Mean
Ergodic Time (MET), when system is ergodic.
