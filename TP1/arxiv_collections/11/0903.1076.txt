The Bell-wave (B-wave) supposition has been introduced in an attempt to
investigate Bell's conjecture (according to which "behind the scenes something
is going faster than light"). Here it is shown, for the case of two entangled
photons, that if it is further assumed that the B-waves propagate with
superluminal but finite velocity then it is possible, at least in principle, to
have faster-than-light (FTL) communication.
