With a conserving formalism within the self-consistent Born approximation, we
study the Hall conductivity of Dirac fermions in graphene under charged
impurity scatterings. The calculated inverse Hall coefficient is compared with
the experimental data. It is shown that the present calculations for the Hall
coefficient and the electric conductivity are in good agreement with the
experimental measurements.
