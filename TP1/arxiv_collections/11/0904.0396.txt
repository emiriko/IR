The system size dependence of dihadron azimuthal correlations in
ultra-relativistic heavy ion collision is simulated by a multi-phase transport
model. The structure of correlation functions and yields of associated
particles show clear participant path-length dependences in collision systems
with a partonic phase. The splitting parameter ($D$) and Root Mean Square Width
($\Delta \phi_{rms}$) of away side correlation functions increase with
collision system size from $^{14}$N+$^{14}$N to $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au
collisions. The double-peak structure of away side correlation functions can
only be formed in sufficient "large" collision systems. These properties
provide some hints to study onset of deconfinement, which is related to the QCD
phase boundary and QCD critical point, by an energy-size scan.
