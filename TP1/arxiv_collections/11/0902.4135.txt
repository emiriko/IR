We study the coupling parameter dependence of the Higgs boson mass in a
chirally invariant lattice Higgs-Yukawa model emulating the same Yukawa
coupling structure as in the Higgs-fermion sector of the Standard Model.
Eventually, the aim is to establish non-perturbative upper and lower Higgs
boson mass bounds derived from first principles, in particular not relying on
vacuum stability considerations for the latter case. Here, we present our
lattice results for the lower Higgs boson mass bound at several values of the
cutoff and compare them to corresponding analytical calculations based on the
effective potential as obtained from lattice perturbation theory. Furthermore,
we give a brief outlook towards the calculation of the upper Higgs boson mass
bound.
