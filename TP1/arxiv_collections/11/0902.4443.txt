The dressed-electron eigenstate of Feynman-gauge QED is computed in
light-front quantization with a Fock-space truncation to include at most the
one-photon/one-electron sector. The theory is regulated by the inclusion of
three massive Pauli-Villars (PV) particles, one PV electron and two PV photons.
In particular, the chiral limit is investigated, and the correct limit is found
to require two PV photons, not just one as previously thought. The
renormalization and covariance of the electron current are also analyzed. We
find that the plus component is well behaved and use its spin-flip matrix
element to compute the electron's anomalous moment. The dependence of the
moment on the regulator masses is shown to be slowly varying when the second PV
photon is used to guarantee the correct chiral limit.
