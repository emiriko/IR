Morphological measures are introduced to probe the complex procedure of shock
wave reaction on porous material. They characterize the geometry and topology
of the pixelized map of a state variable like the temperature. Relevance of
them to thermodynamical properties of material is revealed and various
experimental conditions are simulated. Numerical results indicate that, the
shock wave reaction results in a complicated sequence of compressions and
rarefactions in porous material. The increasing rate of the total fractional
white area $A$ roughly gives the velocity $D$ of a compressive-wave-series.
When a velocity $D$ is mentioned, the corresponding threshold contour-level of
the state variable, like the temperature, should also be stated. When the
threshold contour-level increases, $D$ becomes smaller. The area $A$ increases
parabolically with time $t$ during the initial period. The $A(t)$ curve goes
back to be linear in the following three cases: (i) when the porosity $\delta$
approaches 1, (ii) when the initial shock becomes stronger, (iii) when the
contour-level approaches the minimum value of the state variable. The area with
high-temperature may continue to increase even after the early
compressive-waves have arrived at the downstream free surface and some
rarefactive-waves have come back into the target body. In the case of energetic
