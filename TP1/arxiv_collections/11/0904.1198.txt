An analysis of a variety of existing experimental data leads to the
conclusion on the existence of a resonance mechanism allowing weak magnetic
fields to affect biological processes. These fields may either be static
magnetic fields comparable in magnitude with the magnetic field of the earth or
weak ultra-low frequency time-dependent fields. So far, a generally accepted
theoretical model allowing one to understand the effect of magnetic and
electric fields on biological processes is not available. By this reason, it is
not clear which characteristics of the fields, like magnetic and electric field
strength, frequency of change of the field, shape of the electromagnetic wave,
the duration of the magnetic or electric influence or some particular
combination of them, are responsible for the biological effect. In the present
analysis it is shown that external time-independent magnetic fields may cause a
resonance amplification of ionic electric currents in biological tissues and,
in particular, in the vasculature system due to a Brownian motion of charges.
These resonance electric currents may cause necrotic changes in the tissues or
blood circulation and in this way significantly affect the biological organism.
The magnitude of the magnetic fields leading to resonance effects is estimated,
it is shown that it depends significantly on the radius of the blood
capillaries.
