We investigate the spatially dependent relative phase evolution of an
elongated two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. The pseudospin-1/2 system is
comprised of the |F=1,m_F=-1> and |F=2,m_F=+1> hyperfine ground states of 87Rb,
which we magnetically trap and interrogate with radio-frequency and microwave
fields. We probe the relative phase evolution with Ramsey interferometry and
observe a temporal decay of the interferometric contrast well described by a
mean-field formalism. Inhomogeneity of the collective relative phase dominates
the loss of interferometric contrast, rather than decoherence or phase
diffusion. We demonstrate a technique to simultaneously image each state,
yielding subpercent variations in the measured relative number while preserving
the spatial mode of each component. In addition, we propose a spatially
sensitive interferometric technique to image the relative phase.
