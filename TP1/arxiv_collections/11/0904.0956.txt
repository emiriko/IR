I explore entanglement dynamics in examples of quantum memories, decoherence
free subspaces (DFS) and noiseless subsystems (NS), to determine how a complete
loss of entanglement affects the ability of these techniques to protect quantum
information. Using negativity and concurrence as entanglement measures, I find
that in general there is no correlation between the complete loss of
entanglement in the system and the fidelity of the stored quantum information.
These results complement previous results in which quantum protocols not
explictly based on entanglement exhibit little correlation between ESD and the
accuracy of the given protocol.
