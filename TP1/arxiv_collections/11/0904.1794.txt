Based on previous studies deriving the chiral Lagrangian for pseudo scalar
mesons from the first principle of QCD in the path integral formalism, we
derive the electroweak chiral Lagrangian and dynamically compute all its
coefficients from the one family technicolor model. The numerical results of
the $p^4$ order coefficients obtained in this paper are proportional to the
technicolor number $N_{\rm TC}$ and the technifermion number $N_{\rm TF}$,
which agrees with the arguments in previous works, and which confirms the
reliability of this dynamical computation.
