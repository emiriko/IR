The Lifshitz-type formulas for the free energy and Casimir-Polder force
acting between an atom possessing a permanent magnetic moment and a wall made
of different materials are derived. Simple model allowing analytic results is
considered where the atomic magnetic susceptibility is frequency-independent
and wall is made of ideal metal. Numerical computations of the Casimir-Polder
force are performed for H atom interacting with walls made of ideal metal,
nonmagnetic (Au) and ferromagnetic (Fe) metals and of ferromagnetic dielectric.
It is shown that for the first three wall materials the inclusion of the
magnetic moment of an atom decreases and for the fourth material increases the
magnitude of the Casimir-Polder force.
