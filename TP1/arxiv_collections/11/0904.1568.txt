Context. The understanding of fossil fields origin, topology and stability is
one of the corner stones of the stellar magnetism theory. On one hand, since
they survive over secular time-scales, they may modify the structure and the
evolution of their host stars. On the other hand, they must have a complex
stable structure since it has been demonstrated by Tayler and collaborators
that simplest purely poloidal or toroidal fields are unstable on dynamical
time-scales. In this context, the only stable configuration which has been
found today is the one resulting of a numerical simulation by Braithwaite and
collaborators who have studied the evolution of an initial stochastic magnetic
field, which is found to relax on a mixed stable configuration (poloidal and
toroidal) that seems to be in equilibrium and then diffuses. Aims. In this
work, we thus go on the track of such type of equilibrium field in a
semi-analytical way. Methods. In this first article, we study the barotropic
magnetohydrostatic equilibrium states; the problem reduces to a
Grad-Shafranov-like equation with arbitrary functions. Those latters are
constrained by deriving the lowest-energy equilibrium states for given
invariants of the considered axisymmetric problem and in particular for a given
helicity which is known to be one of the main actor of such problems. Then, we
obtain the generalization of the force-free Taylor's relaxation states obtained
in laboratory experiments (in spheromaks) that become non force-free in the
self-gravitating stellar case. The case of general baroclinic equilibrium
states will be studied in Paper II. Results. Those theoretical results are
applied to realistic stellar cases, namely to the solar radiative core and to
the envelope of an Ap star, and discussed. In both cases we assume that the
field is initially confined in the stellar radiation zone.
