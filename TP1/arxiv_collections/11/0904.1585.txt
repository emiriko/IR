We propose a method to calculate the large deviations of current fluctuations
in a class of stochastic particle systems with history-dependent rates.
Long-range temporal correlations are seen to alter the speed of the large
deviation function in analogy with long-range spatial correlations in
equilibrium systems. We give some illuminating examples and discuss the
applicability of the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem.
