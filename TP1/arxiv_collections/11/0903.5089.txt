The network of biochemical reactions inside living organisms is characterized
by an overwhelming complexity which stems from the sheer number of reactions
and from the complicated topology of biochemical cycles. However the high speed
of computers and the sophisticated computational methods that are available
today are powerful tools that allow the numerical exploration of these
exceedingly interesting dynamical systems. We are now developing a program, the
Virtual Biophysics Lab (VBL), that simulates tumor spheroids, and which
includes a reduced - but still quite complex - description of the biochemistry
of individual cells, plus many diffusion processes that bring oxygen and
nutrients into cells and metabolites into the environment. Each simulation step
requires the integration of nonlinear differential equations that describe the
individual cell's clockwork and the integration of the diffusion equations.
These integrations are carried out under widely different conditions, in a
changing environment, and for this reason they need integrators that are both
unconditionally stable and that do not display unwanted algorithmic artifacts.
These conditions are not always fulfilled in the existing literature, and we
feel that a review of the underlying mathematical principles may be important
not just for us but for other workers in the field of system biology as well.
