The current best asymptotic lower bound on the minimum distance of quantum
LDPC codes with fixed non-zero rate is logarithmic in the blocklength. We
propose a construction of quantum LDPC codes with fixed non-zero rate and prove
that the minimum distance grows proportionally to the square root of the
blocklength.
