We consider an ultracold rotating Bose gas in a harmonic trap close to the
critical angular velocity so that the system can be considered to be confined
to the lowest Landau level. With this assumption we prove that the
Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional accurately describes the ground state energy
of the corresponding $N$-body Hamiltonian with contact interaction provided the
total angular momentum $L$ is much less than $N^2$. While the Gross-Pitaevskii
energy is always an obvious variational upper bound to the ground state energy,
a more refined analysis is needed to establish it as an exact lower bound. We
also discuss the question of Bose-Einstein condensation in the parameter range
considered. Coherent states together with inequalities in spaces of analytic
functions are the main technical tools.
