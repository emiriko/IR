We present the first direct evidence for dense clumps of matter in the
companion wind in a Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient (SFXT) binary. This is seen
as a brief period of enhanced absorption during one of the bright, fast flares
that distinguish these systems. The object under study was IGR J17544-2619, and
a total of 236 ks of data were accumulated with the Japanese satellite Suzaku.
The activity in this period spans a dynamic range of almost 10000 in luminosity
and gives a detailed look at SFXT behavior.
