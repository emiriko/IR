We investigate the formation of terrestrial planets in the late stage of
planetary formation using two-planet model. At that time, the protostar has
formed for about 3 Myr and the gas disk has dissipated. In the model, the
perturbations from Jupiter and Saturn are considered. We also consider
variations of the mass of outer planet, and the initial eccentricities and
inclinations of embryos and planetesimals. Our results show that, terrestrial
planets are formed in 50 Myr, and the accretion rate is about $60% - 80%$. In
each simulation, 3 - 4 terrestrial planets are formed inside "Jupiter" with
masses of $0.15 - 3.6 M_{\oplus}$. In the $0.5 - 4$ AU, when the eccentricities
of planetesimals are excited, planetesimals are able to accrete material from
wide radial direction. The plenty of water material of the terrestrial planet
in the Habitable Zone may be transferred from the farther places by this
mechanism. Accretion could also happen a few times between two major planets
only if the outer planet has a moderate mass and the small terrestrial planet
could survive at some resonances over time scale of $10^8$ yr. In one of our
simulations, com-mensurability of the orbital periods of planets is very
common. Moreover, a librating-circulating 3:2 configuration of mean motion
resonance is found.
