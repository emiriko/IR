The aim of this paper is to quantitatively testify the "{\it small-scale
sequential star formation}" hypothesis in and around bright-rimmed clouds
(BRCs). As a continuation of the recent attempt by Ogura et al. (2007, Paper
I), we have carried out $BVI_{c}$ photometry of four more BRC aggregates along
with deeper re-observations of 2 previously observed BRCs. Again quantitative
age gradients are found in almost all the BRCs studied in the present work.
Archival Spitzer/IRAC data also support this result. The global distribution of
NIR excess stars in each HII region studied here clearly shows evidence that a
series of radiation driven implosion (RDI) processes proceeded in the past from
near the central O star(s) towards the peripheries of the HII region. We found
that in general weak-line T-Tauri stars (WTTSs) are somewhat older than
classical T-Tauri stars (CTTSs). Also the fraction of CTTSs among the T-Tauri
stars (TTSs) associated with the BRCs is found to decrease with age. These
facts are in accordance with the recent conclusion by Bertout et al. (2007)
that CTTSs evolve into WTTSs. It seems that in general the EW of H$\alpha$
emission in TTSs associated with the BRCs decreases with age. The mass function
(MF) of the aggregates associated with the BRCs of the morphological type "A"
seems to follow that found in young open clusters, whereas "B/C" type BRCs show
significantly steeper MF.
