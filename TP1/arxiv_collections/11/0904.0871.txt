A recently proposed model (arXiv:0903.2794) explains the rise in energy of
the positron fraction measured by the PAMELA satellite in terms of hadronic
production of positrons in aged supernova remnants, and acceleration therein.
Here we present a preliminary calculation of the anti-proton flux produced by
the same mechanism. While the model is consistent with present data, a rise of
the antiproton to proton ratio is predicted at high energy, which strikingly
distinguishes this scenario from other astrophysical explanations of the
positron fraction (like pulsars). We briefly discuss important implications for
Dark Matter searches via antimatter.
