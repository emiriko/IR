Computer simulations recently revealed that several liquids exhibit strong
correlations between virial and potential energy equilibrium fluctuations in
the NVT ensemble [U. R. Pedersen {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 100},
015701 (2008)]. In order to investigate whether these correlations are present
also far from equilibrium constant-volume aging following a temperature down
jump from equilibrium was simulated for two strongly correlating liquids, an
asymmetric dumbbell model and Lewis-Wahnstr{\"o}m OTP, as well as for SPC water
that is not strongly correlating. For the two strongly correlating liquids
virial and potential energy follow each other closely during the aging towards
equilibrium. For SPC water, on the other hand, virial and potential energy vary
with little correlation as the system ages towards equilibrium. Further proof
that strong pressure-energy correlations express a configuration space property
comes from monitoring pressure and energy during the crystallization (reported
here for the first time) of supercooled Lewis-Wahnstr{\"o}m OTP at constant
temperature.
