Results of classical force field geometry optimizations for twisted graphene
nanoribbons with a number of twists $N_t$ varying from 0 to 7 (the case $N_t$=1
corresponds to a half-twist M\"obius nanoribbon) are presented in this work.
Their structural stability was investigated using the Brenner reactive force
field. The best classical molecular geometries were used as input for
semiempirical calculations, from which the electronic properties (energy
levels, HOMO, LUMO orbitals) were computed for each structure. CI wavefunctions
were also calculated in the complete active space framework taking into account
eigenstates from HOMO-4 to LUMO+4, as well as the oscillator strengths
corresponding to the first optical transitions in the UV-VIS range. The lowest
energy molecules were found less symmetric than initial configurations, and the
HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are larger than the value found for the nanographene used
to build them due to electronic localization effects created by the twisting. A
high number of twists leads to a sharp increase of the HOMO $\to$ LUMO
transition energy. We suggest that some twisted nanoribbons could form crystals
stabilized by dipolar interactions.
