We investigate the width of the Ginzburg critical region and experimental
signatures of critical behavior in strongly interacting trapped Fermi gases
close to unitarity, where the s-wave scattering length diverges. Despite the
fact that the width of the critical region is of the order unity, evidence of
critical behavior in the bulk thermodynamics of trapped gases is strongly
suppressed by their inhomogeneity. The specific heat of a harmonically confined
gas, for instance, is \textit{linear} in the reduced temperature $t =
(T-T_{\mathrm{c}})/T_{\mathrm{c}}$ above $T_{\mathrm{c}}$. We also discuss the
prospects of observing critical behavior in the local compressibility from
measurements of the density profile.
