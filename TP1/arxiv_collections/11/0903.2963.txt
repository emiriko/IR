We have tuned in situ the proximity effect in a single graphene layer coupled
to two Pt/Ta superconducting electrodes. An annealing current through the
device changed the transmission coefficient of the electrode/graphene
interface, increasing the probability of multiple Andreev reflections. Repeated
annealing steps improved the contact sufficiently for a Josephson current to be
induced in graphene.
