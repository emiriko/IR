FLRW models filled with just dark energy are shown to have a finite past,
since causal geodesics cannot be extended beyond a certain proper time. It is
shown that curvature measured along causal geodesics becomes infinity on
travelling to the past, though curvature scalars tend to zero. Furthermore the
time measured by free-falling observers from coincidence time to Big Rip is
shown to be as short as wished by increasing their linear momentum.
