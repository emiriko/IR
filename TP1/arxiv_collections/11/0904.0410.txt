We calculate the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD corrections to the
transverse momentum weighted single transverse spin asymmetry in Drell-Yan
lepton pair production in hadronic collisions. We identify the splitting
function relevant for the scale evolution of the twist-three quark-gluon
correlation function. We comment on the consequences of our results for
phenomenology.
