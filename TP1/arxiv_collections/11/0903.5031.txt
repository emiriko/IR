The thermodynamic model of ultrathin lubricant film melting, confined between
two atomically-flat solid surfaces, is built using the Landau phase transition
approach. Non-equilibrium entropy is introduced describing the part of thermal
motion conditioned by non-equilibrium and non-homogeneous character of the
thermal distribution. The equilibrium entropy changes during the time of
transition of non-equilibrium entropy to the equilibrium subsystem. To describe
the condition of melting, the variable of the excess volume (disorder
parameter) is introduced which arises due to chaotization of a solid structure
in the course of melting. The thermodynamic and shear melting is described
consistently. The stick-slip mode of melting, which is observed in experiments,
are described. It is shown that with growth of shear velocity, the frequency of
stiction spikes in the irregular mode increases at first, then it decreases,
and the sliding mode comes further characterized by the constant value of
friction force. Comparison of the obtained results with experimental data is
carried out.
