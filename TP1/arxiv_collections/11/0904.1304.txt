We calculate the branching ratio of $B\to J/\Psi\pi^{0}$ with a mixed
formalism that combines the QCD-improved factorization and the perturbative QCD
approaches. The result is consistent with experimental data. The quite small
penguin contribution in $B\to J/\Psi\pi^{0}$ decay can be calculated with this
method. We suggest two methods to extract the weak phase $\beta$. One is
through the dependence of the mixing induced CP asymmetry $S_{J/\Psi\pi^{0}}$
on the weak phase$\beta$, the other is from the relation of the total asymmetry
$A_{CP}$ with the weak phase $\beta$. Our result shows that the deviation $
\bigtriangleup S_{J/\psi\pi^0}$ of the mixing induced CP asymmetry from
$Sin(-2\beta)$ is of $ \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ and has much less uncertainty. The
above $ \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ deviation can provide a good reference for
identifying new physics.
