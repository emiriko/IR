In 1981, Beta Pictoris showed strong and rapid photometric variations that
were attributed to the transit of a giant comet or a planet orbiting at several
AUs (Lecavelier des Etangs et al. 1994, 1995, 1997; Lamers et al. 1997).
Recently, a candidate planet has been identified by imagery in the
circumstellar disk of Beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al. 2009). This planet, named
Beta Pic b, is observed at a projected distance of 8AU from the central star.
It is therefore a plausible candidate for the photometric event observed in
1981. The coincidence of the observed position of the planet in November 2003
and the calculated position assuming that the 1981 transit is due to a planet
orbiting at 8 AU is intriguing. Assuming that the planet that is detected on
the image is the same as the object transiting in November 1981, we estimate
ranges of possible orbital distances and periods. In the favored scenario, the
planet orbits at about 8 AU and was seen close to its quadrature position in
the 2003 images. In this case, most of the uncertainties are related to error
bars on the position in 2003. Uncertainties related to the stellar mass and
orbital eccentricity are also discussed. We find a semi-major axis in the range
[7.6-8.7] AU and an orbital period in the range [15.9-19.5] years. We give
predictions for imaging observations at quadrature in the southwest branch of
the disk in future years (2011-2015). We also estimate possible dates for the
next transits and anti-transits.
