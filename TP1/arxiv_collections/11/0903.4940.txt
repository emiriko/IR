We use Lippman-Schwinger scattering theory to study nonequilibrium electron
transport through an interacting open quantum dot. The two-particle current is
evaluated exactly while we use perturbation theory to calculate the current
when the leads are Fermi liquids at different chemical potentials. We find an
interesting two-particle resonance induced by the interaction and obtain
criteria to observe it when a small bias is applied across the dot. Finally,
for a system without spatial inversion symmetry we find that the two-particle
current is quite different depending on whether the electrons are incident from
the left lead or the right lead.
