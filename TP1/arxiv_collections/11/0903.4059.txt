By means of a well-established algebraic framework, Rogers-Szego functions
associated with a circular geometry in the complex plane are introduced in the
context of q-special functions, and their properties are discussed in details.
The eigenfunctions related to the coherent and phase states emerge from this
formalism as infinite expansions of Rogers-Szego functions, the coefficients
being determined through proper eigenvalue equations in each situation.
Furthermore, a complementary study on the Robertson-Schrodinger and symmetrical
uncertainty relations for the cosine, sine and nondeformed number operators is
also conducted, corroborating, in this way, certain features of q-deformed
coherent states.
