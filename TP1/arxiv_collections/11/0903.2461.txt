A simplified theory of the telescopic oscillations in multiwalled carbon
nanotubes is developed. The explicit expressions for the telescopic force
constants (longitudinal rigidity) and the frequencies of telescopic
oscillations are derived. The contribution of small-amplitude telescopic
oscillations to the nanotubes low temperature specific heat is estimated.
