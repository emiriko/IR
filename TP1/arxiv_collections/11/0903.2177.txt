Continuous reducibilities are a proven tool in computable analysis, and have
applications in other fields such as constructive mathematics or reverse
mathematics. We study the order-theoretic properties of several variants of the
two most important definitions, and especially introduce suprema for them. The
suprema are shown to commutate with several characteristic numbers.
