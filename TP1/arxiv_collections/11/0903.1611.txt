Nondispersive wave packets in a fictitious time variable are calculated
analytically for the field-free hydrogen atom. As is well known by means of the
Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation the Coulomb problem can be converted into
that of a four-dimensional harmonic oscillator, subject to a constraint. This
regularization makes use of a fictitious time variable, but arbitrary Gaussian
wave packets in that time variable in general violate that constraint. The set
of "restricted Gaussian wave packets" consistent with the constraint is
constructed and shown to provide a complete basis for the expansion of states
in the original three-dimensional coordinate space. Using that expansion
arbitrary localized Gaussian wave packets of the hydrogen atom can be
propagated analytically, and exhibit a nondispersive periodic behavior as
functions of the fictitious time. Restricted wave packets with and without well
defined angular momentum quantum n umbers are constructed. They will be used as
trial functions in time-dependent variational computations for the hydrogen
atom in static external fields in the subsequent paper [T. Fab\v{c}i\v{c} et
al., submitted].
