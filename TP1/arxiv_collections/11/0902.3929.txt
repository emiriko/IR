The electric dipole polarizabilities evaluated at imaginary frequencies for
hydrogen, the alkali-metal atoms, the alkaline earth atoms, and the inert gases
are tabulated along with the resulting values of the atomic static
polarizabilities, the atom-surface interaction constants, and the dispersion
(or van der Waals) constants for the homonuclear and the heteronuclear diatomic
combinations of the atoms.
