I review here some of the physics we are learning and expect to learn in the
near future through the observation of cosmic rays. The study of cosmic rays
involves a combination of data from accelerators, ground arrays, atmospheric
fluorescence detectors and balloon and satellite experiments. I will discuss
the data of the Pierre Auger Observatory, PAMELA, ATIC and FST among other
experiments.
