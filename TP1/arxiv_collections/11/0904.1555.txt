We generalize the notion of a Lie algebroid over infinite jet bundle by
replacing the variational anchor with an N-tuple of differential operators
whose images in the Lie algebra of evolutionary vector fields of the jet space
are subject to collective commutation closure. The linear space of such
operators becomes an algebra with bi-differential structural constants, of
which we study the canonical structure. In particular, we show that these
constants incorporate bi-differential analogues of Christoffel symbols.
