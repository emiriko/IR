The electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments of the light decuplet
baryons are calculated in the framework of the light cone QCD sum rules. The
obtained non-vanishing values for the electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole
moments of these baryons show nonspherical charge distribution. The sign of
electric quadrupole moment is positive for $\Omega^-$, $\Xi^{*-}$,
$\Sigma^{*-}$ and negative for $\Sigma^{*+}$, which correspond to the prolate
and oblate charge distributions, respectively. A comparison of the obtained
results with the predictions of non-covariant quark model which shows a good
consistency between two approaches is also presented. Comparison of the
obtained results on the multipole moments of the decuplet baryons containing
strange quark with those of $\Delta$ baryons shows a large SU(3) flavor
symmetry breaking.
