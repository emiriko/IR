It is argued in [1] that when the strong coupling to the K Lambda channel is
considered, Breit-Wigner mass of the lightest orbital excitation of the nucleon
N(1535) shifts to a lower value. The new value turned out to be smaller than
the mass of the lightest radial excitation N(1440), which effectively solved
the long-standing problem of conventional constituent quark models. In this
Comment we show that it is not the Breit-Wigner mass of N(1535) that is
decreased, but its bare mass.
