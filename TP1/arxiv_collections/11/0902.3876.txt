Using first-principles approaches, this study investigated the efficiency of
energy conversion in nanojunctions, described by the thermoelectric figure of
merit $ZT$. We obtained the qualitative and quantitative descriptions for the
dependence of $ZT$ on temperatures and lengths. A characteristic temperature:
$T_{0}= \sqrt{\beta/\gamma(l)}$ was observed. When $T\ll T_{0}$, $ZT\propto
T^{2}$. When $T\gg T_{0}$, $ZT$ tends to a saturation value. The dependence of
$ZT$ on the wire length for the metallic atomic chains is opposite to that for
the insulating molecules: for aluminum atomic (conducting) wires, the
saturation value of $ZT$ increases as the length increases; while for
alkanethiol (insulating) chains, the saturation value of $ZT$ decreases as the
length increases. $ZT$ can also be enhanced by choosing low-elasticity bridging
materials or creating poor thermal contacts in nanojunctions. The results of
this study may be of interest to research attempting to increase the efficiency
of energy conversion in nano thermoelectric devices.
