The interlanguage links in Wikipedia connect pages on the same subject
written in different languages. In theory, each connected component should be a
clique and cover one topic. However, incoherent edits and obvious mistakes
result in topic coalescence, yielding a non-trivial topology that is studied in
this paper. We show that the component size distribution obeys the power law,
and we explain anomalies in the distribution as results of certain edit
conventions. Next, we propose a method of filtering out the cliques and study
basic properties of the resulting skeleton, which turns out to be scale-free.
