Dihadron azimuthal angle correlations relative to the reaction plane have
been investigated in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV using a
multi-phase transport model (AMPT). Such reaction plane azimuthal angle
dependent correlations can shed light on path-length effect of energy loss of
high transverse momentum particles propagating through the hot dense medium.
The correlations vary with the trigger particle azimuthal angle with respect to
the reaction plane direction, $\phi_{s}=\phi_{T}-\Psi_{EP}$, which is
consistent with the experimental observation by the STAR collaboration. The
dihadron azimuthal angle correlation functions on the away side of the trigger
particle present a distinct evolution from a single peak to a broad, possibly
double peak, structure when the trigger particle direction goes from in-plane
to out-of-plane of the reaction plane. The away-side angular correlation
functions are asymmetric with respect to the back-to-back direction in some
regions of $\phi_{s}$, which could provide insight on testing $v_{1}$ method to
reconstruct the reaction plane. In addition, both the root-mean-square width
($W_{rms}$) of the away-side correlation distribution and the splitting
parameter $D$ between the away-side double peaks increase slightly with
$\phi_{s}$, and the average transverse momentum of the away-side associated
hadrons shows a strong $\phi_{s}$ dependence. Our results indicate that strong
parton cascade and resultant energy loss could play an important role for the
appearance of a double-peak structure in the dihadron azimuthal angular
correlation function on the away side of the trigger particle.
