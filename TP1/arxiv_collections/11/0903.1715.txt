We present a theory of ultrafast photo-induced dynamics in a spin-charge
coupled system, motivated by pump-probe experiments in perovskite manganites. A
microscopic picture for multiple dynamics in spin and charge degrees is focused
on. Real-time simulations are carried out by two complimentary methods. Our
calculation demonstrates that electron motion governs a short-time scale where
charge and spin dynamics are combined strongly, while, in a long-time scale
controlled by spin relaxation, charge sector does not follow remarkable change
in spin sector. Present results are in contrast to a conventional
double-exchange picture in equilibrium states.
