In the original formulation of vibration-transit (V-T) theory for monatomic
liquid dynamics, the transit contribution to entropy was taken to be a
universal constant, calibrated to the constant-volume entropy of melting. This
model suffers two deficiencies: (a) it does not account for experimental
entropy differences of 2% among elemental liquids, and (b) it implies a value
of zero for the transit contribution to internal energy. The purpose of this
paper is to correct these deficiencies. To this end, the V-T equation for
entropy is fitted to an overall accuracy of 0.1% to the available experimental
high temperature entropy data for elemental liquids. The theory contains two
nuclear motion contributions: (a) the dominant vibrational contribution
S_{vib}(T/\theta_0), where T is temperature and \theta_0 is the vibrational
characteristic temperature, and (b) the transit contribution
S_{tr}(T/\theta_{tr}), where \theta_{tr} is a scaling temperature for each
liquid. The appearance of a common functional form of S_{tr} for all the
liquids studied is a property of the experimental data, when analyzed via the
V-T formula. The resulting S_{tr} implies the correct transit contribution to
internal energy. The theoretical entropy of melting is derived, in a single
formula applying to normal and anomalous melting alike. An ab initio
calculation of \theta_0, based on density functional theory, is reported for
liquid Na and Cu. Comparison of these calculations with the above analysis of
experimental entropy data provides verification of V-T theory. In view of the
present results, techniques currently being applied in ab initio simulations of
liquid properties can be employed to advantage in the further testing and
development of V-T theory.
