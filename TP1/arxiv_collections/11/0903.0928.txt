A local agglomeration of cooperators can support the survival or spreading of
cooperation, even when cooperation is predicted to die out according to the
replicator equation, which is often used in evolutionary game theory to study
the spreading and disappearance of strategies. In this paper, it is shown that
success-driven motion can trigger such local agglomeration and may, therefore,
be used to supplement other mechanisms supporting cooperation, like reputation
or punishment. Success-driven motion is formulated here as a function of the
game-theoretical payoffs. It can change the outcome and dynamics of spatial
games dramatically, in particular as it causes attractive or repulsive
interaction forces. These forces act when the spatial distributions of
strategies are inhomogeneous. However, even when starting with homogeneous
initial conditions, small perturbations can trigger large inhomogeneities by a
pattern-formation instability, when certain conditions are fulfilled. Here,
these instability conditions are studied for the prisoner's dilemma and the
snowdrift game. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that asymmetrical diffusion can
drive social, economic, and biological systems into the unstable regime, if
these would be stable without diffusion.
