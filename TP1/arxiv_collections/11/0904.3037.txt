I discuss a number of novel phenomenological features of QCD in high
transverse momentum reactions. The presence of direct higher-twist processes,
where a proton is produced directly in the hard subprocess, can explain the
"baryon anomaly" -- the large proton-to-pion ratio seen at RHIC in high
centrality heavy ion collisions. Direct hadronic processes can also account for
the deviation from leading-twist PQCD scaling at fixed x_T = 2p_T/\sqrt s. I
suggest that the "ridge" -- the same-side long-range rapidity correlation
observed at RHIC in high centrality heavy ion collisions is due to the imprint
of semihard DGLAP gluon radiation from initial-state partons which have
transverse momenta biased toward the trigger. Rescattering interactions from
gluon-exchange, normally neglected in the parton model, have a profound effect
in QCD hard-scattering reactions, leading to leading-twist single-spin
asymmetries, diffractive deep inelastic scattering, diffractive hard hadronic
reactions, the breakdown of the Lam-Tung relation in Drell-Yan reactions,
nuclear shadowing --all leading-twist dynamics not incorporated in the
light-front wavefunctions of the target computed in isolation. Antishadowing is
shown to be quark flavor specific and thus different in charged and neutral
deep inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering. I also discuss the consequences of
color-octet intrinsic heavy quark distributions in the proton for heavy
particle and Higgs production at high x_F. The AdS/CFT correspondence between
Anti-de Sitter space and conformal gauge theories allows one to compute the
analytic form of frame-independent light-front wavefunctions of mesons and
baryons and to compute quark and gluon hadronization at the amplitude level.
