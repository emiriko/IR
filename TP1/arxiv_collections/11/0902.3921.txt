A hybrid lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for binary mixtures based on the
free-energy approach is proposed. Non-ideal terms of the pressure tensor are
included as a body force in the LBM kinetic equations, used to simulate the
continuity and Navier-Stokes equations. The convection-diffusion equation is
studied by finite difference methods. Differential operators are discretized in
order to reduce the magnitude of spurious velocities. The algorithm has been
shown to be stable and reproducing the correct equilibrium behavior in simple
test configurations and to be Galilean invariant. Spurious velocities can be
reduced of about an order of magnitude with respect to standard discretization
procedure.
