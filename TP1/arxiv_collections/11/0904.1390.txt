Suppose Alice and Bob share a maximally entangled state of any finite
dimension and each perform two-outcome measurements on the respective part of
the state. It is known, due to the recent result of Regev and Toner, that if a
classical model is augmented with two bits of communication then all the
quantum correlations arising from these measurements can be reproduced. Here we
show that two bits of communication is in fact necessary for the perfect
simulation. In particular, we prove that a pair of maximally entangled
four-dimensional quantum systems cannot be simulated by a classical model
augmented by only one bit of communication.
