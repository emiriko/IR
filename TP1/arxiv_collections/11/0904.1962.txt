We develop techniques for studying the effects of self-interactions in the
conformal sector of an unparticle model. Their physics is encoded in the higher
n-point functions of the conformal theory. We study inclusive processes and
argue that the inclusive production of unparticle stuff in standard model
processes due to the unparticle self-interactions can be decomposed using the
conformal partial wave expansion and its generalizations into a sum over
contributions from the production of various kinds of unparticle stuff,
corresponding to different primary conformal operators. Such processes
typically involve the production of unparticle stuff associated with operators
other than those to which the standard model couples directly. Thus just as
interactions between particles allow scattering processes to produce new
particles in the final state, so unparticle self-interactions cause the
production of various kinds of unparticle stuff. We discuss both inclusive and
exclusive methods for computing these processes. The resulting picture, we
believe, is a step towards understanding what unparticle stuff "looks like"
because it is quite analogous to way we describe the production and scattering
of ordinary particles in quantum field theory, with the primary conformal
operators playing the role of particles and the coefficients in the conformal
partial wave expansion (and its generalization to include more fields) playing
the role of amplitudes. We exemplify our methods in the 2D toy model that we
discussed previously in which the Banks-Zaks theory is exactly solvable.
