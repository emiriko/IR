With the first measurements of the branching ratios and the direct CP
asymmetries of $B_s\to K^{-}K^{+}$, $K^{-}\pi^{+}$ decays by the CDF
collaboration, we constrain the relevant parameter space of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model with R-parity violation. Using the constrained
R-parity violating couplings, we further examine their possible effects in
$B_{s}\to K^{-*}\pi^{+}$, $K^{(*)-}\rho^{+}$ and $K^{(*)\pm}K^{(*)\mp}$ decays.
We find that some branching ratios and CP asymmetries are very sensitive to the
R-parity violating couplings. The direct longitudinal CP asymmetries of
tree-dominated process $B_s\to K^{*-}\rho^{+}$ could be enlarged to $\sim 70%$
and the longitudinal polarizations of $B_s\to K^{*-}K^{*+}$, $K^{*-}\rho^{+}$
decays could be suppressed very much by the squark exchange couplings. Near
future experiments at CERN LHC can test these predictions and shrink/reveal the
parameter spaces of RPV SUSY.
