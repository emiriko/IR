Motivated by high-accuracy scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on
disordered two-dimensional electron gases in strong magnetic field, we present
an exact solution for the local density of states (LDoS) of electrons moving in
an arbitrary potential smooth on the scale of the magnetic length, that can be
locally described up to its second derivatives. We use a technique based on
coherent state Green's functions, allowing us to treat on an equal footing
confining and open quantum systems. The energy-dependence of the LDoS is found
to be universal in terms of local geometric properties, such as drift velocity
and potential curvature. We also show that thermal effects are quite important
close to saddle points, leading to an overbroadening of the tunneling
trajectories.
