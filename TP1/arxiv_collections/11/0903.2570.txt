We focus on inelastic neutron scattering in $URu_2Si_2$ and argue that
observed gap in the fermion spectrum naturally leads to the spin feature
observed at energies $\omega_{res} = 4-6 meV$ at momenta at $\bQ^* = (1\pm 0.4,
0,0)$. We discuss how spin features seen in $URu_2Si_2$ can indeed be thought
of in terms of {\em spin resonance} that develops in HO state and is {\em not
related} to superconducting transition at 1.5K. In our analysis we assume that
the HO gap is due to a particle-hole condensate that connects nested parts of
the Fermi surface with nesting vector $\bf{Q}^* $. Within this approach we can
predicted the behavior of the spin susceptibility at $\bQ^*$ and find it to be
is strikingly similar to the phenomenology of resonance peaks in high-T$_c$ and
heavy fermion superconductors. The energy of the resonance peak scales with
$T_{HO}$ $\omega_{res} \simeq 4 k_BT_{HO}$. We discuss observable consequences
spin resonance will have on neutron scattering and local density of states.
