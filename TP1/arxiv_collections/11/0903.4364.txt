We report evidence for dynamically significant rotation in the globular
cluster systems of two luminous Virgo dwarf ellipticals, VCC1261 and VCC1528.
Including previous results for VCC1087, the globular cluster systems of all
three Virgo dwarf ellipticals studied in detail to date exhibit v_rot/sigma >
1. Taking the rotation seen in the globular clusters as maximal disk rotation,
we find all three dEs lie on the r-band Tully-Fisher relation. We argue that
these data support the hypothesis that luminous dEs are the remnants of
transformed disk galaxies. We also obtained deep, longslit data for the stars
in VCC1261 and VCC1528. Both these galaxies show rapid rotation in their inner
regions, with spatial scales of ~0.5 kpc. These rotation velocities are similar
to those seen in the GC systems. Since our longslit data for Virgo dEs extend
out to 1-2 effective radii (typical of deep observations), whereas the globular
clusters extend out to 4--7 effective radii, we conclude that non-detections of
rotation in many luminous dEs may simply be due to a lack of radial coverage in
the stellar data, and that globular clusters represent singularly sensitive
probes of the dynamics of dEs. Based on these data, we suggest that gas disks
are significant sites of globular cluster formation in the early universe.
