We consider the following problem: Given a nested sum expression, find a sum
representation such that the nested depth is minimal. We obtain a symbolic
summation framework that solves this problem for sums defined, e.g., over
hypergeometric, $q$-hypergeometric or mixed hypergeometric expressions.
Recently, our methods have found applications in quantum field theory.
