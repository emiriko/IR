This is a cursory overview of applications of concepts from random matrix
theory (RMT) to quantum electronics and classical & quantum optics. The
emphasis is on phenomena, predicted or explained by RMT, that have actually
been observed in experiments on quantum wires, quantum dots, disordered wave
guides, and chaotic resonators. Topics considered include universal conductance
fluctuations, weak localization and coherent backscattering, sub-Poissonian
shot noise and open transmission channels, non-Gaussian conductance and
thermopower distributions, mesoscopic superconductivity, grey-body radiation,
and chaotic laser cavities.
