We consider a weakly interacting finite wire with short and long range
interactions. The long range interactions enhance the $4k_{F}$ scattering and
renormalize the wire to a strongly interacting limit. For large screening
lengths, the renormalized charge stiffness Luttinger parameter $K_{eff.}$
decreases to $K_{eff.}< {1/2}$, giving rise to a Wigner crystal at T=0 with an
anomalous conductance at finite temperatures.
  For short screening lengths, the renormalized Luttinger parameter $K_{eff.}$
is restricted to ${1/2}\leq K_{eff.}\leq 1$. As a result, at temperatures
larger than the magnetic exchange energy we find an interacting metal which for
$K_{eff.}\approx {1/2}$ is equivalent to the Hubbard $U\to\infty$ model, with
the anomalous conductance $G\approx\frac{e^2}{h}$ .
