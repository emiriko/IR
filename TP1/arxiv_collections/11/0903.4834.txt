We study the production of a large-pT photon in association with a jet in
proton-proton collisions. We examine the sensitivity of the jet rapidity
distribution to the gluon distribution function in the proton. We then assess
the sensitivity of various photon + jet correlation observables to the photon
fragmentation functions. We argue that RHIC data on photon-jet correlations can
be used to constrain the photon fragmentation functions in a region which was
barely accessible in LEP experiments.
