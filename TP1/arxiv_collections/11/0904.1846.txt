We study the ground-state properties of electrons confined to a quantum wire
and subject to a smoothly modulated Rashba spin-orbit coupling. When the period
of the modulation becomes commensurate with the band filling, the Rashba
coupling drives a quantum phase transition to a nonmagnetic insulating state.
Using bosonization and a perturbative renormalization group approach, we find
that this state is robust against electron-electron interactions. The gaps to
charge- and spin excitations scale with the amplitude of the Rashba modulation
with a common interaction-dependent exponent. An estimate of the expected size
of the charge gap, using data for a gated InAs heterostructure, suggests that
the effect can be put to practical use in a future spin transistor design.
