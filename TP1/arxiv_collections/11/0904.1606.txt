Magnetization, resistivity and specific heat measurements were performed on
single crystals of RFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$ and RCo$_2$Zn$_{20}$(R = Y, Nd, Sm, Gd -
Lu). Whereas LuCo$_2$Zn$_{20}$ and YCo$_2$Zn$_{20}$ manifest unremarkable,
metallic behavior, LuFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$ and YFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$ manifest behaviors
characteristic of nearly ferromagnetic Fermi liquids. When the well defined
$4f$ local moments (Gd$^{3+}$ - Tm$^{3+}$) were embedded into this strongly
polarizable host, they all manifest enhanced, ferromagnetic ordering and the
values of $T_{\mathrm{C}}$ for RFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$ (R = Gd - Tm) scale with the de
Gennes factor. In addition, the data on the RFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$ compounds indicate
a small crystal electronic field (CEF) effect, compare with the interaction
energy scale. On the other hand, the local moment bearing members of
RCo$_2$Zn$_{20}$ (R = Nd, Sm, Gd - Tm) manifest weak magnetic interactions and
the magnetic properties for R = Dy - Tm members are strongly influenced by the
CEF effect on the R ions. The magnetic anisotropy and specific heat data for
the Co series were used to determine the CEF coefficient of R ion in the cubic
coordination. These CEF coefficients, determined for the Co series, are
consistent with the magnetic anisotropy and specific heat data for the Fe
series, which indicates similar CEF effects for the Fe and Co series. Such
analysis, combined with specific heat and resistivity data, indicates that for
R = Tb - Ho, the CEF splitting scale is smaller than their $T_{\mathrm{C}}$
values, whereas for ErFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$ and TmFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$ the $4f$ electron
loses part of its full Hund's rule ground state degeneracy above
$T_{\mathrm{C}}$. YbFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$ and YbCo$_2$Zn$_{20}$ manifest typical, but
distinct heavy Fermion behaviors associated with different Kondo temperatures.
