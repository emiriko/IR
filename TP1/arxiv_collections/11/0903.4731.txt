The Kuramoto phase diffusion equation is a nonlinear partial differential
equation which describes the spatio-temporal evolution of a phase variable in
an oscillatory reaction diffusion system. Synchronization manifests itself in a
stationary phase gradient where all phases throughout a system evolve with the
same velocity, the synchronization frequency. The formation of concentric waves
can be explained by local impurities of higher frequency which can entrain
their surroundings. Concentric waves in synchronization also occur in
heterogeneous systems, where the local frequencies are distributed randomly. We
present a perturbation analysis of the synchronization frequency where the
perturbation is given by the heterogeneity of natural frequencies in the
system. The nonlinearity in form of dispersion, leads to an overall
acceleration of the oscillation for which the expected value can be calculated
from the second order perturbation terms. We apply the theory to simple
topologies, like a line or the sphere, and deduce the dependence of the
synchronization frequency on the size and the dimension of the oscillatory
medium. We show that our theory can be extended to include rotating waves in a
medium with periodic boundary conditions. By changing a system parameter the
synchronized state may become quasi degenerate. We demonstrate how perturbation
theory fails at such a critical point.
