We have experimentally studied propagation of two optical fields in a dense
rubidium (Rb) vapor in the case when an additional microwave field is coupled
to the hyperfine levels of Rb atoms. The Rb energy levels form a close-lambda
three-level system coupled to the optical fields and the microwave field. It
has been found that the maximum transmission of a probe field depends on the
relative phase between the optical and the microwave fields. We have observed
both constructive and destructive interference in electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT). A simple theoretical model and a numerical simulation have
been developed to explain the observed experimental results.
