We study light-cone distribution amplitudes of heavy-light systems, such as a
B-meson. By an explicit computation, we determine how two-parton distribution
amplitudes mix with three-parton ones at one loop: \phi_+ is shown to mix only
into itself, whereas \phi_- mixes with the difference of three-parton
distribution amplitudes \Psi_A-\Psi_V. We determine the corresponding anomalous
dimension and we check the gauge independence of our result by considering a
general covariant gauge. Finally, we comment on some implications of our result
for phenomenological models of these distribution amplitudes.
