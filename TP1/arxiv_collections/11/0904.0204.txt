Using a scheme based on a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, we propose an analysis
of the superposition of polarized laser beams at a given angle. The focus of
our study is the spatially varying polarization state of the resulting field,
also known as a polarization grating, generated by this setup. Our proposal
combines a theoretical description of the resulting field in terms of its
Stokes parameters with an experimental demonstration of the existence of such a
polarization grating due to the effects of polarization on beam interference
experiments.
