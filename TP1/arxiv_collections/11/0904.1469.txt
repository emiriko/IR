According to the Tits conjecture proved by Crisp and Paris, [CP], the
subgroups of the braid group generated by proper powers of the Artin elements
are presented by the commutators of generators which are powers of commuting
elements. Hence they are naturally presented as right-angled Artin groups.
  The case of subgroups generated by powers of the band generators is more
involved. We show that the groups are right-angled Artin groups again, if all
generators are proper powers with exponent at least 3. We also give a
presentation in cases at the other extreme, when all generators occur with
exponent 1 or 2, which is far from being that of a right-angled Artin group.
