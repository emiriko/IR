In this paper we present reducible representation of the $n^{2}$ braid group
representation which is constructed on the tensor product of n-dimensional
spaces. By some combining methods we can construct more arbitrary $n^{2}$
dimensional braiding matrix S which satisfy the braid relations, and we get
some useful braiding matrix S. By Yang-Baxteraition approach, we derive a $
9\times9 $ unitary $ \breve{R}$ according to a $ 9\times9 $ braiding S-matrix
we have constructed. The entanglement properties of $ \breve{R}$-matrix is
investigated, and the arbitrary degree of entanglement for two-qutrit entangled
states can be generated via $ \breve{R}(\theta, \phi_{1},\phi_{2})$-matrix
acting on the standard basis.
