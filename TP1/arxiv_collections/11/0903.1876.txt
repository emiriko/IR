In this talk I report on recent developments and results relevant for LHC
phenomenology at next-to-leading order QCD. Feynman diagrammatic and unitarity
based methods have both seen considerable improvements and new ideas recently.
Current approaches point towards automated evaluation of one-loop
multi-particle amplitudes. Many results for notoriously difficult processes are
under construction by several groups and, given the enormous recent progress,
it can be concluded that LHC phenomenology at full next-to-leading order level
will become the standard approximation soon.
