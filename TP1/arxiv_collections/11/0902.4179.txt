The expanded level structure of $^{240}$Pu available from the present study
highlights the role of strong octupole correlations in this nucleus. Besides a
delayed alignment in the yrast band, the observations include the presence of
both $I^{+}{\to}(I-1)^{-}$ and $I^{-}{\to}(I-1)^{+}$ E1 transitions linking
states of the yrast and negative-parity bands at high spin and the presence of
an additional even-spin, positive-parity band deexciting exclusively to the
negative parity sequence. The observations appear to be consistent with
expectations based on the recently proposed concept of octupole phonon
condensation.
