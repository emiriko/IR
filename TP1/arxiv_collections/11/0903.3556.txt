We study time-resolved spectra of the prompt emission of Swift Gamma-ray
bursts (GRB). Our goal is to see if previous BATSE claims of the existence of a
large amount of spectra with the low energy photon indices harder than 2/3 are
consistent with Swift data. We perform a systematic search of the episodes of
the spectral hardening down to the photon indices below 2/3 in the prompt
emission spectra of Swift GRBs. We show that the data of the BAT instrument on
board of Swift are consistent with BATSE data, if one takes into account
differences between the two instruments. Much lower statistics of the very hard
spectra in Swift GRBs is explained by the smaller field of view and narrower
energy band of the BAT telescope.
