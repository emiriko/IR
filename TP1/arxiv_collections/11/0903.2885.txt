The Higgs boson production in association with a pair of W-bosons at the
Large Hadron Collider(LHC) can be used to probe the coupling between Higgs
boson and vector gauge bosons and discover the signature of new physics. We
describe the impact of the complete QCD NLO radiative corrections and the
gluon-gluon fusion subprocesss to the cross section of this process at the LHC,
and investigate the dependence of the leading order(LO) and the QCD corrected
cross sections on the fctorization/renormalization energy scale and Higgs boson
mass. We present the LO and QCD corrected distributions of the invariant mass
of W-boson pair and the transverse momenta of final W and Higgs boson. We find
that the QCD NLO corrections and the contribution from gluon-gluon fusion
subprocess significantly modify the LO distributions, and the scale dependence
of the QCD corrected cross section is badly underestimated by the LO results.
Our numerical results show that the K-factor of the QCD correction varies from
1.48 to 1.64 when $m_H$ goes up from $100 GeV$ to $160 GeV$. We find also the
QCD correction from \gghww subprocess at the LHC is significant, and should be
considered in precise experiment.
