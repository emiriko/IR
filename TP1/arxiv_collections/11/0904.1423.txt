In order to get a better understanding of amoeba-substrate interactions in
the processes of cellular adhesion and directional movement, we engineered
glass surfaces with defined local adhesion characteristics at a micrometric
scale. Amoeba (Dictyostelium dicoideum) is capable to adhere to various
surfaces independently of the presence of extracellular matrix proteins. This
paper describes the strategy used to create selective adhesion motifs using an
appropriate surface chemistry and shows the first results of locally confined
amoeba adhesion. The approach is based on the natural ability of Dictyostelium
to adhere to various types of surfaces (hydrophilic and hydrophobic) and on its
inability to spread on inert surfaces, such as the block copolymer of
polyethylene glycol and polypropylene oxide, named Pluronic. We screened
diverse alkylsilanes, such as methoxy, chloro and fluoro silanes for their
capacity to anchor Pluronic efficiently on a glass surface. Our results
demonstrate that hexylmethyldichlorosilane (HMDCS) was the most appropriate
silane for the deposition of Pluronic. A complex dependence between the
physicochemistry of the silanes and the polyethylene glycol block copolymer
deposition was observed. Using this method, we succeed in scaling down the
micro-fabrication of pluronic-based adhesion motifs to the amoeba
