We derive a standard quantum limit for probing mechanical energy quantization
in a class of systems with mechanical modes parametrically coupled to external
degrees of freedom. To resolve a single mechanical quantum, it requires a
strong-coupling regime -- the decay rate of external degrees of freedom is
smaller than the parametric coupling rate. In the case for cavity-assisted
optomechanical systems, e.g. the one proposed by Thompson et al., zero-point
motion of the mechanical oscillator needs to be comparable to linear dynamical
range of the optical system which is characterized by the optical wavelength
divided by the cavity finesse.
