Following a recent study by our group in which a large $T_c$ enhancement was
reported in bilayers of the non-superconducting $La_{1.65}Sr_{0.35}CuO_4$ and
superconducting $La_{1.88}Sr_{0.12}CuO_4$ films [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{101},
057005 (2008)], we checked if a similar effect occurs when superconducting
$La_{1.88}Sr_{0.12}CuO_4$ islands are coated with a continuous layer of the non
superconducting $La_{1.65}Sr_{0.35}CuO_4$. We found that no such phenomenon is
observed. The bare superconducting islands film behaves as an insulator where
transport occurs via hopping or tunneling between islands, but exhibits a weak
signature of localized superconductivity at $\sim$18 K. When over coated with a
$La_{1.65}Sr_{0.35}CuO_4$ film, it becomes superconducting with a $T_c$ onset
of 16.6 K, which is less than that of a thick $La_{1.88}Sr_{0.12}CuO_4$ film
(25.7 K). We therefore conclude that the lower $T_c$ in the bilayer is due to a
conventional proximity effect.
