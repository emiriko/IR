It is well understood that various alternatives are available within EM
theory for the definitions of energy density, momentum transfer, EM
stress-energy tensor, and so forth. Although the various options are all
compatible with the basic equations of electrodynamics (e.g., Maxwell's
equations, Lorentz force law, gauge invariance), nonetheless certain
alternative formulations lend themselves to being seen as preferable to others
with regard to the transparency of their application to physical problems of
interest. Here we argue for the transparency of an option based on use of the
EM potentials alone.
