We review the phenomenology of gravitino dark matter within supergravity
framework. Gravitino can be dark matter if it is the lightest supersymmetric
particle, which is stable if R-parity is conserved. There are several distinct
scenarios depending on what the next to lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP)
is. We discuss the constraints and summarize the phenomenology of neutralino,
stau, stop and sneutrino NLSPs.
