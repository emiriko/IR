A formula for the cross section and event rate constant describing
recombination of N particles are derived in terms of general S-matrix elements.
Our result immediately yields the generalized Wigner threshold scaling for the
recombination of N bosons. A semi-analytic formula encapsulates the overall
scaling with energy and scattering length, as well as resonant modifications by
the presence of borromean N-body states near the threshold collision energy in
the entrance channel. We then apply our model to the case of four-boson
recombination into an Efimov trimer and a free atom.
