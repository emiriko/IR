The question of whether the Tsallis entropy is Lesche-stable is revisited. It
is argued that when physical averages are computed with the escort
probabilities, the correct application of the concept of Lesche-stability
requires use of the escort probabilities. As a consequence, as shown here, the
Tsallis entropy is unstable but the thermodynamic averages are stable. We
further show that Lesche stability as well as thermodynamic stability can be
obtained if the homogeneous entropy is used as the basis of the formulation of
non-extensive thermodynamics. In this approach, the escort distribution arises
naturally as a secondary structure.
