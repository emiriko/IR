In recent times whole-genome gene expression analysis has turned out to be a
highly important tool to study the coordinated function of a very large number
of genes within their corresponding cellular environment, especially in
relation to phenotypic diversity and disease. A wide variety of methods of
quantitative analysis have been developed to cope with high throughput data
sets generated by gene expression profiling experiments. Due to the complexity
associated with transcriptomics, specially in the case of gene regulation
phenomena, most of these methods are of a probabilistic or statistical nature.
Even if these methods have reached a central status in the development of an
integrative, systematic understanding of the associated biological processes,
they very rarely constitute a concrete guide to the actual physicochemical
mechanisms behind biological function and the role of these methods is more on
a hypotheses generating line. An important improvement could be done with the
development of a thermodynamic theory for gene expression and transcriptional
regulation that will build the foundations for a proper integration of the vast
amount of molecular biophysical data and could lead, in the future, to a
systemic view of genetic transcription and regulation.
