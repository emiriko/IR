We improve previously derived analytical estimates of hadronisation
corrections to QCD jets at hadron colliders, firmly establishing at the
two-loop level the link to the well-known power corrections to LEP event-shape
variables. The results of this paper apply to jets defined in the kt and
anti-kt algorithms but the general framework presented here holds also for
other algorithms for which calculations are in progress.
