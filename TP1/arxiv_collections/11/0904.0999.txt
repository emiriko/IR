We present a study of scattering of massless planar scalar waves by a charged
non-rotating black hole. Partial wave methods are applied to compute scattering
and absorption cross sections, for a range of incident wavelengths. We compare
our numerical results with semi-classical approximations from a geodesic
analysis, and find excellent agreement. The glory in the backward direction is
studied, and its properties are shown to be related to the properties of the
photon orbit. The effects of black hole charge upon scattering and absorption
are examined in detail. As the charge of the black hole is increased, we find
that the absorption cross section decreases, and the angular width of the
interference fringes of the scattering cross section at large angles increases.
In particular, the glory spot in the backward direction becomes wider. We
interpret these effects under the light of our geodesic analysis.
