Many models of electroweak symmetry breaking have an additional light
pseudoscalar. If the Higgs boson can decay to a new pseudoscalar, LEP searches
for the Higgs can be significantly altered and the Higgs can be as light as 86
GeV. Discovering the Higgs boson in these models is challenging when the
pseudoscalar is lighter than 10 GeV because it decays dominantly into tau
leptons. In this paper, we discuss discovering the Higgs in a subdominant decay
mode where one of the pseudoscalars decays to a pair of muons. This search
allows for potential discovery of a cascade-decaying Higgs boson with the
complete Tevatron data set or early data at the LHC.
