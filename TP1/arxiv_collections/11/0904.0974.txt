Rapid progress has been made during recent years in the understanding of the
flavour oscillations that occur as neutrinos traverse through supernova. The
previous paradigm has given way and it is now clear that the neutrino signals
we shall receive from future Galactic supernovae will allow us both to peer
inside these extraordinary cosmic events and to probe some of the fundamental
properties of these elusive particles. In this review we aim to distill the
progress that has been made focusing upon the effects of the dynamic density
profile and the emergence of collective flavour oscillations due to neutrino
self-interactions.
