We report the serendipitous discovery of a previously unknown quasar at 10.5"
from Q2225-403 (z=2.410). The observation of the broad emission line of
MgII_2798 and of the surrounding FeII multiplets indicates that the companion
quasar is at z=0.932. The spectrum of Q2225-403 shows a number of absorption
lines, the most noteworthy is the MgII line at the same redshift of the
companion, suggesting that we are probing the gas within the halo ~80 kpc from
the closer quasar. From high resolution NIR images we were able to resolve the
host galaxies of the two quasars. Basing on the known surface density of
quasars in the 2dF survey we estimate that the probability of finding such a
close pair is < ~1 per cent.
