Two-level system fluctuators (TLS's) in the tunnel barrier of a Josephson
junction have recently been demonstrated to cause novel energy splittings in
spectroscopic measurements of superconducting phase qubits. With their strong
coupling to the Josephson junction and relatively long decoherence times, TLS's
can be considered as potential qubits and demonstrate coherent quantum effects.
Here, we study the effective interaction between the TLS qubits that is
mediated by a Josephson junction resonator driven by an external microwave
source. This effective interaction can enable controlled quantum logic gates
between the TLS's. Our study can be extended to other superconducting
resonators coupling with TLS's.
