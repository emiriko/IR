The two-component formulation of quantum electrodynamics with fundamental
mass is studied. We review and update the prediction of the primordial
existence of lepton magnetic moment in framework of two component formulation
of the Maximal Mass Model containing a limiting mass $M$, which is considered
as new universal physical constant. As it well known in the Dirac theory
so-called gyromagnetic factor $g=2$. Quantum electrodynamics together with
electro-weak theory and hadronic contributions predicts deviations from Dirac's
value. It is very important that all these effects \textbf{slightly increase
the $g$-value}. But in our model we have any decreasing of this quantity
$g=2\sqrt{1-m^2/M^2}$, where $m$ - is a lepton mass. The most intriguing
prediction of new approach is the absolute value of this deviation increases
with growth of a lepton mass. In this connection the direct experimental
measurements of $\tau$ - lepton anomalous magnetic moment $a_\tau = (g - 2)/2$
gain in extraordinary importance. The most stringent limit $-0.052 < a_{\tau} <
0.013$ at 95% confidence level, was set by the {\small DELPHI}\cite{delphi}
collaboration. The authors also quote their result in the form of central value
and error $ a_\tau = - 0.018(17).$ To pay attention that the sign of $a_\tau$
is the negative and now we can speak about a qualitative agreement with our
predictions.
