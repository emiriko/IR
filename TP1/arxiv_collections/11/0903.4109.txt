We explicitly construct a quantum circuit which exactly generates random
three-qubit states. The optimal circuit consists of three CNOT gates and
fifteen single qubit elementary rotations, parametrized by fourteen independent
angles. The explicit distribution of these angles is derived, showing that the
joint distribution is a product of independent distributions of individual
angles apart from four angles.
