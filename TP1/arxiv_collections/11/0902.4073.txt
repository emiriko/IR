This paper proposes an algorithm for image processing, obtained by adapting
to image maps the definitions of two well-known physical quantities. These
quantities are the dipole and quadrupole moments of a charge distribution. We
will see how it is possible to define dipole and quadrupole moments for the
gray-tone maps and apply them in the development of algorithms for edge
detection.
