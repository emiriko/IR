The distribution function for the first eigenvalue spacing in the Laguerre
unitary ensemble of finite size may be expressed in terms of a solution of the
fifth Painleve transcendent. The generating function of a certain discontinuous
linear statistic of the Laguerre unitary ensemble can similarly be expressed in
terms of a solution of the fifth Painleve equation. The methodology used to
derive these results rely on two theories regarding differential equations for
orthogonal polynomial systems, one involving isomonodromic deformations and the
other ladder operators. We compare the two theories by showing how either can
be used to obtain a characterization of a more general Laguerre unitary
ensemble average in terms of the Hamiltonian system for Painleve V.
