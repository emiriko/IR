The dynamic interactions between Josephson and pancake vortices in highly
anisotropic superconductors are probed by shaking the former vortices with an
ac magnetic field and measuring the second harmonic Hall response of the latter
vortices with the sensor positioned above the sample. We demonstrate the
efficiency of the proposed measurement method that aims to probe the coupling
between the two vortex species. New experimental data obtained on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8
single crystals reveal interesting features and the possibility to determine
the phase diagram of vortex matter in such superconductors.
