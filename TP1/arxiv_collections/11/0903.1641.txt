We introduce three nested Lie algebras of infinitesimal `isometries' of a
Galilei space-time structure which play the r\^ole of the algebra of Killing
vector fields of a relativistic Lorentz space-time. Non trivial extensions of
these Lie algebras arise naturally from the consideration of
Newton-Cartan-Bargmann automorphisms.
