We investigate the multiplicity fluctuations observed in high-energy nuclear
collisions attributing them to intrinsic fluctuations of temperature of the
hadronizing system formed in such processes. To account for these fluctuations
we replace the usual Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistics by the non-extensive
Tsallis statistics characterized by the nonextensivity parameter q, with |q-1|
being a direct measure of fluctuations. In the limit of vanishing fluctuations,
q --> 1 and Tsallis statistics converges to the usual BG. We evaluate the
nonextensivity parameter q and its dependence on the hadronizing system size
from the experimentally observed collision centrality dependence of the mean
multiplicity, <N>, and its variance, Var(N). We attribute the observed system
size dependence of q to the finiteness of the hadronizing source with q = 1
corresponding to an infinite, thermalized source with a fixed temperature, and
with q > 1 (which is observed) corresponding to a finite source in which both
the temperature and energy fluctuate.
