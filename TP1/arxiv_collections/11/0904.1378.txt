In the recently proposed dark left-right gauge model (DLRM) of particle
interactions, the usual left-handed lepton doublet (nu,e)_L transforming under
SU(2)_L is accompanied by the UNUSUAL right-handed fermion doublet (n,e)_R
transforming under SU(2)_R, where n_R is NOT the Dirac mass partner of nu_L. In
this scenario, whereas nu_L is certainly a neutrino, n_R should be considered a
SCOTINO, i.e. a dark-matter fermion. Variants of this basic idea are discussed,
including its minimal SCOTOGENIC realization.
