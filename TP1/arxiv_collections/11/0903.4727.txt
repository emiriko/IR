A non-perturbative anti-normal quantization of relativistic Yang-Mills fields
with a compact semisimple gauge group entails an infinite discrete bosonic
energy-mass spectrum of gauge bosons in the framework of Gelfand nuclear
triples. The quantum spectrum is bounded from below and has a positive mass
gap. The spectrum is both Poincare and gauge invariant.
