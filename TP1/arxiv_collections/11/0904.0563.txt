We provide a number of schemes for the splitting up of quantum information
among $k$ parties using a $N$-qubit linear cluster state as a quantum channel,
such that the original information can be reconstructed only if all the parties
cooperate. Explicit circuits are provided for these schemes, which are based on
the concept of measurement based locking and unlocking of quantum information.
These are experimentally feasible as they require measurements to be performed
only on product basis.
