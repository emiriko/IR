We show that thermalization and the breakdown of integrability in the one
dimensional Lieb-Liniger model caused by local three-body elastic interactions
is suppressed by pairwise quantum correlations when approaching the strongly
correlated regime. If the relative momentum $k$ is small compared to the
two-body coupling constant $c$ the three-particle scattering state is
suppressed by a factor of $(k/c)^{12}$. This demonstrates that in one
dimensional quantum systems it is not the freeze-out of two body collisions but
the strong quantum correlations which ensures integrability.
