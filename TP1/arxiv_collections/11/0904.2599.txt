A scalable, multiplexed ion trap for quantum information processing is
fabricated and tested. The trap design and fabrication process are optimized
for scalability to small trap size and large numbers of interconnected traps,
and for integration of control electronics and optics. Multiple traps with
similar designs are tested with Cd+, Mg+, and Sr+ ions at room temperature and
with Sr+ at 6 K, with respective ion lifetimes of 90 s, 300 +/- 30 s, 56 +/- 6
s, and 4.5 +/- 1.1 hours. The motional heating rate for Mg+ at room temperature
and a trap frequency of 1.6 MHz is measured to be 7 +/- 3 quanta per
millisecond. For Sr+ at 6 K and 540 kHz the heating rate is measured to be 220
+/- 30 quanta per second.
