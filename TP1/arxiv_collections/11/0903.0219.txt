It is shown that accelerated projective measurements on the vacuum of a free
Dirac spinor field results in an entangled state for an inertial observer. The
physical mechanism at work is the Davies-Unruh effect. The produced state is
always entangled and its entanglement increases as a function of the
acceleration, reaching maximal entanglement in the asymptotic limit of infinite
acceleration where Bell states are produced.
