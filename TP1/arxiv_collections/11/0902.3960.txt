We present phase resolved optical spectroscopy and Doppler tomography of
V1341 Cygni, the optical counterpart to the neutron star low mass X-ray binary
Cygnus X-2. We derive a radial velocity curve for the secondary star, finding a
projected radial velocity semi-amplitude of K2 = 79 +/- 3 km/s, leading to a
mass function of 0.51 +/- 0.06 Msun, ~30% lower than the previous estimate. We
tentatively attribute the lower value of K2 (compared to that obtained by other
authors) to variations in the X-ray irradiation of the secondary star at
different epochs of observations. The limited phase coverage and/or longer
timebase of previous observations may also contribute to the difference in K2.
Our value for the mass function implies a primary mass of 1.5 +/- 0.3 Msun,
somewhat lower than previous dynamical estimates, but consistent with the value
found by analysis of type-I X-ray bursts from this system. Our Doppler
tomography of the broad He II 4686 line reveals that most of the emission from
this line is produced on the irradiated face of the donor star, with little
emission from the accretion disc. In contrast, the Doppler tomogram of the N
III 4640.64 Bowen blend line shows bright emission from near the gas
stream/accretion disc impact region, with fainter emission from the gas stream
and secondary star. This is the first LMXB for which the Bowen blend is
dominated by emission from the gas stream/accretion disc impact region, without
comparable emission from the secondary star. This has implications for the
interpretation of Bowen blend Doppler tomograms of other LMXBs for which the
ephemeris may not be accurately known.
