Metastable helium molecules generated in a discharge near a sharp tungsten
tip operated in either pulsed mode or continuous field-emission mode in
superfluid liquid $^{4}$He are imaged using a laser-induced-fluorescence
technique. By pulsing the tip, a small cloud of He$_{2}^{*}$ molecules is
produced. At 2.0 K, the molecules in the liquid follow the motion of the normal
fluid. We can determine the normal-fluid velocity in a heat-induced counterflow
by tracing the position of a single molecule cloud. As we run the tip in
continuous field-emission mode, a normal-fluid jet from the tip is generated
and molecules are entrained in the jet. A focused 910 nm pump laser pulse is
used to drive a small group of molecules to the vibrational $a(1)$ state.
Subsequent imaging of the tagged $a(1)$ molecules with an expanded 925 nm probe
laser pulse allows us to measure the velocity of the normal fluid. The
techniques we developed demonstrate for the first time the ability to trace the
normal-fluid component in superfluid helium using angstrom-sized particles.
