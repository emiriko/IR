Using distribution p(V/Vm) of V/Vm rather than just mean <V/Vm> in V/Vm-test
leads directly to cosmological number density n(z). Calculation of n(z) from
p(V/Vm) is illustrated using best sample (of 76 quasars) available in 1981,
when method was developed. This is only illustrative, sample being too small
for any meaningful results. Keywords: V/Vm . luminosity volume . cosmological
number density . V/Vm distribution
