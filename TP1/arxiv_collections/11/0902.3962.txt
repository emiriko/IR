We derive a Bell-type inequality for observables with arbitrary spectra. For
the case of continuous variable systems we propose a possible experimental
violation of this inequality, by using squeezed light and homodyne detection
together with methods of quantum-state reconstruction. It is shown that the
violation is also possible for realistic detection efficiencies.
