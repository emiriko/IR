We consider the partial difference equations of the Adler-Bobenko-Suris
classification, which are characterized as multidimensionally consistent. The
latter property leads naturally to the construction of auto-B{\"a}cklund
transformations and Lax pairs for all the equations in this class. Their
symmetry analysis is presented and infinite hierarchies of generalized
symmetries are explicitly constructed.
