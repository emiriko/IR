We investigate the spectroscopy and decays of the charm-strange quarkonium
system in a potential model consisting of a relativistic kinetic energy term, a
linear confining term including its scalar and vector relativistic corrections
and the complete perturbative one-loop quantum chromodynamic short distance
potential. The masses and wave functions of the various states are obtained
using a variational technique, which are then used in a perturbative treatment
of the potential to find the mass spectrum of the $c\bar{s}$ system and
radiative decay widths. Our results compare well with the available data for
the spectrum of $D_s$ states. We include a discussion of the effect of mixing
and an investigation of the Lorentz nature of the confining potential.
