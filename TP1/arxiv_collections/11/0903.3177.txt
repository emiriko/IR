We propose a channel for the possible discovery of new charged leptons at the
Large Hadron Collider. The proposed final state contains three same-sign
leptons, making this new channel practically back- groundless. The method is
illustrated for two different cases: the four-family Standard Model and the
Grand Unified Theory based on the E6 gauge group. An example study taking 250
GeV as the charged lepton mass shows that in both models, about 8 signal events
can be expected at 14 TeV center-of-mass energy with 1 fb^-1 of integrated
luminosity. Although the event yield might not be sufficient for detailed
measurements of the charged lepton properties, it would be sufficient to claim
discovery through a counting experiment.
