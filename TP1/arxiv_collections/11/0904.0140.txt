An analysis of the impact of seismic and volcanic activity was carried out at
selected astronomical sites, namely the observatories of El Teide (Tenerife,
Canary Islands), Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma, Canary Islands), Mauna Kea
(Hawaii) and Paranal (Chile) and the candidate site of Cerro Ventarrones
(Chile). Hazard associated to volcanic activity is low or negligible at all
sites, whereas seismic hazard is very high in Chile and Hawaii. The lowest
geological hazard in both seismic and volcanic activity was found at Roque de
los Muchachos observatory, in the island of La Palma.
