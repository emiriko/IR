We are examining the possibility of the formation of charge order in the
high-temperature superconductor $\mathrm{YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}}$ (YBCO) due to
interaction between the charged oxygen vacancies or di-vacancies. The molecular
dynamics method is used to analyze the displacement fields around these
defects. The distribution of displacements around a single charged oxygen
vacancy and di-vacancy, determination of binding energy of oxygen vacancy in
di-vacancy demonstrate that there is, in principle, the possibility of the
charge order formation in YBCO by charged oxygen vacancies or di-vacancies. It
is shown that the charge order formation first of all should be formed near
crystal lattice defects and that the high-angle grain boundaries (GBs) regions
are preferable places for this formation. The adsorption capability of
high-angle GBs with respect to the stripe embryo formation is determined. It is
shown that there is a proportional dependence between the repetition distance
along the high-angle GBs and an energy advantage of the stripe embryo formation
in GBs.
