We present the technical details of an experimental method to realize a model
system for 2D phase transitions and the glass transition. The system consists
of several hundred thousand colloidal super-paramagnetic particles confined by
gravity at a flat water-air interface of a pending water droplet where they are
subjected to Brownian motion. The dipolar pair potential and therefore the
system temperature is not only known precisely but also directly and
instantaneously controllable via an external magnetic field B. In case of a one
component system of monodisperse particles the system can crystallize upon
application of B whereas in a two component system it undergoes a glass
transition. Up to 10000 particles are observed by video microscopy and image
processing provides their trajectories on all relative length and time scales.
The position of the interface is actively regulated thereby reducing surface
fluctuations to less than one micron and the setup inclination is controlled to
an accuracy of 1 microrad. The sample quality being necessary to enable the
experimental investigation of the 2D melting scenario, 2D crystallization, and
the 2D glass transition, is discussed.
