We show that the mass intervals among the pentaquark baryons $\Theta^{+}$,
$N^{*}(1685)$ and $\Xi_{3/2}^{-}$ proposed to be the members of the SU(3)
antidecuplet are exact integral multiples of the mass difference between a
neutral pion and a muon i.e. 29.318 MeV, in agreement with the general tendency
of the mass differences among elementary particles to be close integral/half
integral multiple of this mass unit. Further our study reveals that the
strength of the SU(3) breaking understood to give members of the same multiplet
different masses takes values, discrete as integral multiple of the mass
difference between a neutral pion and a muon, the first two massive elementary
particles.
