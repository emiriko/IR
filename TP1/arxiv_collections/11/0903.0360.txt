Context. A short duration burst reminiscent of a soft gamma-ray
repeater/anomalous X-ray pulsar behaviour was detected in the direction of LS I
+61 303 by the Swift satellite. While the association with this well known
gamma-ray binary is likely, a different origin cannot be excluded.
  Aims. We explore the error box of this unexpected flaring event and establish
the radio, near-infrared and X-ray sources in our search for any peculiar
alternative counterpart.
  Methods. We carried out a combined analysis of archive Very Large Array radio
data of LS I +61 303 sensitive to both compact and extended emission. We also
reanalysed previous near infrared observations with the 3.5 m telescope of the
Centro Astronomico Hispano Aleman and X-ray observations with the Chandra
satellite.
  Results. Our deep radio maps of the LS I +61 303 environment represent a
significant advancement on previous work and 16 compact radio sources in the LS
I +61 303 vicinity are detected. For some detections, we also identify near
infrared and X-ray counterparts. Extended emission features in the field are
also detected and confirmed. The possible connection of some of these sources
with the observed flaring event is considered. Based on these data, we are
unable to claim a clear association between the Swift-BAT flare and any of the
sources reported here. However, this study represents the most sophisticated
attempt to determine possible alternative counterparts other than LS I +61 303.
