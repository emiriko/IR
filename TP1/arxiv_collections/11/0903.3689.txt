Photoemission data taken with hard x-ray radiation on cleaved single crystals
of the bilayered, colossal magnetoresistant manganite La_(2-2x)Sr_(1+2x)Mn_2O_7
(LSMO) with 0.30<x<0.50 are presented. Making use of the increased
bulk-sensitivity upon hard x-ray excitation it is shown that the core level
footprint of the electronic structure of the LSMO cleavage surface is identical
to that of the bulk. Furthermore, by comparing the core level shift of the
different elements as a function of doping level x, it is shown that
microscopic phase separation is unlikely to occur for this particular manganite
well above the Curie temperature.
