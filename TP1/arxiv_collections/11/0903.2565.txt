We develop some ideas discussed by E. Schucking [arXiv:0803.4128] concerning
the geometry of the gravitational field. First, we address the concept
according to which the gravitational acceleration is a manifestation of the
spacetime torsion, not of the curvature tensor. It is possible to show that
there are situations in which the geodesic acceleration of a particle may
acquire arbitrary values, whereas the curvature tensor approaches zero. We
conclude that the spacetime curvature does not affect the geodesic
acceleration. Then we consider the the Pound-Rebka experiment, which relates
the time interval $\Delta \tau_1$ of two light signals emitted at a position
$r_1$, to the time interval $\Delta \tau_2$ of the signals received at a
position $r_2$, in a Schwarzschild type gravitational field. The experiment is
determined by four spacetime events. The infinitesimal vectors formed by these
events do not form a parallelogram in the (t,r) plane. The failure in the
closure of the parallelogram implies that the spacetime has torsion. We find
the explicit form of the torsion tensor that explains the nonclosure of the
parallelogram.
