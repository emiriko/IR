We point out how, in certain models, the same combination of New Physics
couplings occur in the amplitudes for both D0-anti-D0 mixing and the rare
decays D0 -> l+l-. If the New Physics dominates and is responsible for the
observed mixing, then a very simple correlation exists between the magnitudes
of each; in fact the rates for the decay D0 -> l+l- are completely fixed by the
mixing. Observation of D0 -> l+l- in excess of the Standard Model prediction
could identify New Physics contributions to D0-anti-D0 mixing.
