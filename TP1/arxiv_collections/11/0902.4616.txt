We report the detection of a transit egress by the ~ 3.9-Jupiter-mass planet
HD 80606b, an object in a highly-eccentric orbit (e ~ 0.93) about its parent
star of approximately solar type. The astrophysical reality of the signal of
variability in HD 80606 is confirmed by observation with two independent
telescope systems, and checks against several reference stars in the field.
Differential photometry with respect to the nearby comparison star HD 80607
provides a precise light curve. Modelling of the light curve with a full
eccentric-orbit model indicates a planet/star-radius ratio of 0.1057 +/-
0.0018, corresponding to a planet radius of 1.029 R_J for a solar-radius parent
star; and a precise orbital inclination of 89.285 +/- 0.023 degrees, giving a
total transit duration of 12.1 +/- 0.4 hours. The planet hence joins HD 17156b
in a class of highly eccentric transiting planets, in which HD 80606b has both
the longest period and most eccentric orbit. The recently reported discovery of
a secondary eclipse of HD 80606b by the Spitzer Space Observatory permits a
combined analysis with the mid-time of primary transit in which the orbital
parameters of the system can be tightly constrained. We derive a transit
ephemeris of T_tr = HJD (2454876.344 +/- 0.011) + (111.4277 +/- 0.0032) E.
