Born-Infeld deformation strategy to smooth theories having divergent
solutions is applied to the teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity. The
equivalence between teleparallelism and General Relativity is exploited to
obtain a deformed theory of gravity based on second order differential
equations, since teleparallel Lagrangian is built just from first derivatives
of the vierbein. We show that Born-Infeld teleparallelism cures the initial
singularity in a spatially flat FRW universe; moreover, it provides a natural
inflationary stage without resorting to an inflaton field. The Born-Infeld
parameter bounds the dynamics of Hubble parameter H(t) and establishes a
maximum attainable spacetime curvature.
