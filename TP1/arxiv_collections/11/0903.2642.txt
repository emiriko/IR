We propose a discrete path integral formalism over graphs fundamental to
quantum mechanics (QM) based on our interpretation of QM called Relational
Blockworld (RBW). In our approach, the transition amplitude is not viewed as a
sum over all field configurations, but is a mathematical machine for measuring
the symmetry of the discrete differential operator and source vector of the
discrete action. Therefore, we restrict the path integral to the row space of
the discrete differential operator, which also contains the discrete source
vector, in order to avoid singularities. In this fashion we obtain the
two-source transition amplitude over a "ladder" graph with N vertices. We
interpret this solution in the context of the twin-slit experiment.
