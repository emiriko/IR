The inner views of all our applications are predetermined by the designers;
only some non-significant variations are allowed with the help of adaptive
interface. In several programs you can find some moveable objects, but it is an
extremely rare thing. However, the design of applications on the basis of
moveable and resizable objects opens an absolutely new way of programming; such
applications are much more effective in users' work, because each user can
adjust an application to his purposes. Programs, using adaptive interface, only
implement the designer's ideas of what would be the best reaction to any of the
users' doings or commands. Applications on moveable elements do not have such
predetermined system of rules; they are fully controlled by the users. This
article describes and demonstrates the new way of applications' design.
