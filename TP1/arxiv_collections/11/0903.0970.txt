Strong particulate gels are widely believed to behave poroelastically in
compression, e.g. in sedimentation, even though they consolidate irreversibly
because of the stickiness of the particles. Particulate gels are usually
adhesive as well as cohesive and so wall effects are to be expected in general
[Michaels & Bolger (1962)]. These are rarely manifest on process engineering
scales, although they can be important in the laboratory and with formulated
products in small containers. When the assumption of non-linear poroelasticity
is combined with the idea that adhesive failure (yield) is brittle, relatively
speaking, a prescription emerges for the ratio of shear to compressive strength
S and how this varies with density. S is predicted to be of order unity at the
gel-point and then to increase rapidly thereafter. The predictions are
consistent with the experimental data available for both dilute and
concentrated gels, although more data would be welcome. A critique of a recent
paper by Condre et al. (2007) on wall effects in very dilute gels is given in
which it is argued, amongst other things, that it is not necessary to invoke
granular in order to account for their results, simple adhesion suffices.
