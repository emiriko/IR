The interplay between the torsional potential energy and the scaling of the
1-4 van der Waals and Coulomb interactions determines the stiffness of flexible
molecules. In molecular simulations often ad-hoc values for the scaling factor
(SF) are adopted without adequate justification. In this letter we demonstrate
for the first time that the precise value of the SF has direct consequences on
the critical properties and mechanisms of systems undergoing a phase
transition. By analyzing the melting of n-alkanes (hexane C6, dodecane C12,
tetracosane C24) on graphite, we show that the SF is not a universal feature,
that it monotonically decreases with the molecular length, and that it drives a
cross-over between two distinct mechanisms for melting in such systems.
