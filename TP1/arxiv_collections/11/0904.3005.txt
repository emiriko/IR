We present non equilibrium molecular dynamics experiments of the unfolding
and refolding of an alanine decapeptide in vacuo subject to a Nose-Hoover
thermostat. Forward (unfolding) and reverse (refolding) work distribution are
numerically calculated for various duration times of the non equilibrium
experiments. Crooks theorem is accurately verified for all non equilibrium
regimes and the time asymmetry of the process is measured using the recently
proposed Jensen-Shannon divergence [E.H. Fend, G. Crooks, Phys. Rev. Lett, 101,
090602] . Results on the alanine decapeptide are found similar to recent
experimental data on m-RNA molecule, thus evidencing the universal character of
the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The patent non-Markovianity of the process is
rationalized by assuming that the observed forward and reverse distributions
can be each described by a combination of two normal distributions satisfying
the Crooks theorem, representative of two mutually exclusive linear events.
Such bimodal approach reproduce with surprising accuracy the observed non
Markovian work distributions.
