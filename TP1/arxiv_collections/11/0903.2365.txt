It has been observed that exact solutions for electromagnetic (EM)
excitations of the Kerr-Schild (KS) geometry form outgoing beams which have
very strong back reaction to metric and break the black hole horizon. As a
result, interaction of a black hole with nearby electromagnetic field and
electromagnetic vacuum has to cover the horizon by a set of fluctuating
microholes. We integrate and analyze the Debney-Kerr-Schild equations for
electromagnetic excitations of a black-hole and obtain that the exact solutions
for outgoing radiation contain two related but radically different components
which shed light on a possible semi-classical mechanism of black-hole
evaporation: a) first component consists of the singular beam pulses which
perforate horizon, breaking its impenetrability, and b) another component is
regular and responsible for the loss of mass similar to the known Vaidya
`shining star' radiation. We show also that the mysterious twosheeted twistor
structure of the Kerr-Schild geometry corresponds to a holographic structure of
quantum black hole spacetimes predicted by Stephens, t' Hooft and Whiting. The
resulting Kerr-Schild geometry of fluctuating twistor-beams takes an
intermediate position between the classical and quantum gravity.
