Planar black holes with Galilean asymptotics have been proposed as the
holographic dual of a non-relativistic conformal field theory at finite
temperature. I show that these objects can undergo a phase transition at low
temperature to a new type of soliton with the same asymptotic structure. The
strength of the chemical potential is induced by the scale of the soliton.
