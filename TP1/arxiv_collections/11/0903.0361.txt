Time-delay systems are an important class of dynamical systems which provide
a solid mathematical framework to deal with many application domains of
interest ranging from biology, chemical, electrical, and mechanical
engineering, to economics. However, the inherent complexity of such systems
poses serious difficulties to control design, when control objectives depart
from the standard ones investigated in the current literature, e.g.
stabilization, regulation, and etc. In this paper we propose one approach to
control design, which is based on the construction of symbolic models, where
each symbolic state and each symbolic label correspond to an aggregate of
continuous states and to an aggregate of input signals in the original system.
The use of symbolic models offers a systematic methodology for control design
in which constraints coming from software and hardware, interacting with the
physical world, can be integrated. The main contribution of this paper is in
showing that incrementally input-to-state stable time-delay systems do admit
symbolic models that are approximately bisimilar to the original system, with a
precision that can be rendered as small as desired. An algorithm is also
presented which computes the proposed symbolic models. When the state and input
spaces of time-delay systems are bounded, which is the case in many realistic
situations, the proposed algorithm is shown to terminate in a finite number of
steps.
