We present analytical and numerical treatments for evaluating the
time-of-flight momentum distribution for the stationary states of a two-boson
system trapped in a quartic double-well potential, paying particular attention
to the Tonks and noninteracting regimes. We find that the time-of-flight
distributions can serve as a valuable tool in profiling the states of this
system, and provide the tof plots for low-energy excitations using a
nonadaptive finite element method that is more efficient than traditional
finite difference methods.
