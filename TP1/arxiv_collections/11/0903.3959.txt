Let $H$ be a quasitriangular quasi-Hopf algebra, we construct a braided group
$\underline{H}$ in the quasiassociative category of left $H$-modules.
Conversely, given any braided group $B$ in this category, we construct a
quasi-Hopf algebra $B\rtimes H$ in the category of vector spaces. We generalise
the transmutation and bosonisation theory of [10] to the quasi case. As
examples, we bosonise the octonion algebra to an asoociative one, obtain the
twisted quantum double $D^{\phi}(G)$ of a finite group as a bosonisation, and
obtain its transmutation. Finally, we show that $\underline{H}\rtimes H$ is
isomorphic to $H_\Rcal\blackbowtie H$ as quasi-Hopf algebras.
