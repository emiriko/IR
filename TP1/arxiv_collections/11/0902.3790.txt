Assuming the features commonly ascribed to dark matter, we discuss our
glimpse of the possibility that dark matter as a light transmitting medium
played a role that accounts for the discordant inferences about the dynamical
behaviour of light, in which some optical experiments cannot detect the earth's
motion in space, while others definitely can. In a converse way, the mentioned
laboratory and astronomical observations provide an accessible experimental
proof for the existence of a transparent, non-baryonic earth-bound medium which
does not occupy the whole of universal space, dark matter being a possible
candidate medium.
