The superconducting penetration depth, $\lambda(T)$, has been measured in
RFeAsO$_{0.9}$F$_{0.1}$ (R=La,Nd) single crystals (R-1111). In Nd-1111, we find
an upturn in $\lambda(T)$ upon cooling and attribute it to the paramagnetism of
the Nd ions, similar to the case of the electron-doped cuprate Nd-Ce-Cu-O.
After the correction for paramagnetism, the London penetration depth variation
is found to follow a power-law behavior, $\Delta \lambda_L(T)\propto T^{2}$ at
low temperatures. The same $T^2$ variation of $\lambda(T)$ was found in
non-magnetic La-1111 crystals. Analysis of the superfluid density and of
penetration depth anisotropy over the full temperature range is consistent with
two-gap superconductivity. Based on this and on our previous work, we conclude
that both the RFeAsO (1111) and BaFe$_2$As$_2$ (122) families of pnictide
superconductors exhibit unconventional two-gap superconductivity.
