We report the unequivocal demonstration of mid-infrared mode-locked pulses
from a semiconductor laser. The train of short pulses was generated by actively
modulating the current and hence the optical gain in a small section of an
edge-emitting quantum cascade laser (QCL). Pulses with pulse duration at
full-width-at-half-maximum of about 3 ps and energy of 0.5 pJ were
characterized using a second-order interferometric autocorrelation technique
based on a nonlinear quantum well infrared photodetector. The mode-locking
dynamics in the QCLs was modelled and simulated based on Maxwell-Bloch
equations in an open two-level system. We anticipate our results to be a
significant step toward a compact, electrically-pumped source generating
ultrashort light pulses in the mid-infrared and terahertz spectral ranges.
