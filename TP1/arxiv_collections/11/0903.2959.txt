In this contribution accelerator solutions for polarized beams and their
impact on physics measurements are discussed. Focus are physics requirements
for precision polarimetry near the interaction point and their realization with
polarized sources. Based on the ILC baseline programme as described in the
Reference Design Report (RDR), recent developments are discussed and evaluated
taking into account physics runs at beam energies between 100 GeV and 250 GeV,
as well as calibration runs on the Z-pole and options as the 1TeV upgrade and
GigaZ.
