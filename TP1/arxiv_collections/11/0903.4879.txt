I review constraints on solar system-bound dark matter, and discuss the
possibility that dark matter could be gravitationally bound to the earth and
other planets. I briefly survey various empirical constraints on such
planet-bound dark matter, and discuss effects it could produce if present,
including anomalous planetary heating and flyby velocity changes.
