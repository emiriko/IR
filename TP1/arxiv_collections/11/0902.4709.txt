According to Thurston's stability theorem, every group of C^1 diffeomorphisms
of the closed interval is locally indicable (.e., every finitely generated
subgroup factors through Z). We show that, even for finitely generated groups,
the converse of this statement is not true. More precisely, we show that the
semi-direct product between F_2 an Z^2, although locally indicable, does not
embed into Diff_+^1 (]0,1[). (Here F_2 is any free subgroup of SL(2,Z), and its
action on Z^2 is the projective one.) Moreover, we show that for every
non-solvable subgroup G of SL(2,Z), the semi-direct product between G and Z^2
does not embed into Diff^1_+(S^1).
