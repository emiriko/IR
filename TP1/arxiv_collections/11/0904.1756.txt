Volatility modelling has become a significant area of research within
Financial Mathematics. Wiener process driven stochastic volatility models have
become popular due their consistency with theoretical arguments and empirical
observations. However such models lack the ability to take into account long
term and fundamental economic factors e.g. credit crunch.
  Regime switching models with mean reverting stochastic volatility are a new
class of stochastic volatility models that capture both short and long term
characteristics. We propose a new general method of pricing options for these
new class of stochastic volatility models using Fouque's perturbation based
option pricing method.
  Using empirical data, we compare our option pricing method to Black-Scholes
and Fouque's standard option pricing method and show that our pricing method
provides lower relative error compared to the other two methods.
