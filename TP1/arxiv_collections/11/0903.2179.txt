A non-local box is an abstract device into which Alice and Bob input bits x
and y respectively and receive outputs a and b respectively, where a, b are
uniformly distributed and the parity of a+b equals xy. Such boxes have been
central to the study of quantum or generalized non-locality as well as the
simulation of non-signaling distributions. In this paper, we start by studying
how many non-local boxes Alice and Bob need in order to compute a Boolean
function f. We provide tight upper and lower bounds in terms of the
communication complexity of the function both in the deterministic and
randomized case. We then proceed to show that the study of non-local box
complexity has interesting applications for classical computation as well. In
particular, we look at secure function evaluation, and study the question posed
by Beimel and Malkin of how many Oblivious Transfer calls Alice and Bob need in
order to securely compute a function f. We show that this question is related
to the non-local box complexity of the function and conclude by greatly
improving their bounds. Finally, another consequence of our results is that
traceless two-outcome measurements on maximally entangled states can be
simulated with 3 non-local boxes, while no finite bound was previously known.
