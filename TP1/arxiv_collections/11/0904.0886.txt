Our previous work on quantum mechanics in Hilbert spaces of finite dimensions
N is applied to elucidate the deep meaning of Feynman's path integral pointed
out by G. Svetlichny. He speculated that the secret of the Feynman path
integral may lie in the property of mutual unbiasedness of temporally proximal
bases. We confirm the corresponding property of the short-time propagator by
using a specially devised N x N -approximation of quantum mechanics in L^2(R)
applied to our finite-dimensional analogue of a free quantum particle.
