In our work: 0903.2612, we calculate the production rate of single top-Higgs
boson in the TC2 model which is a modified version of the original
top-technicolor model. The similar process was discussed in
arXiv:hep-ph/9905347v2. The TC2 model, as we discussed in the introduction part
remedies some shortcomings and loophole of the old version. The top-Higgs in
the TC2 model is a mixture of the top-Higgs of the toptechnicolor model and
that of the ETC model, thus a parameter $\epsilon$ is introduced to denote the
mixture. Moreover, we vary the mass range of the top-Higgs within 300 to 800
GeV while in arXiv:hep-ph/9905347v2, the mass range was taken as 200 to 400
GeV. In the work, our numerical results show that the production rate of single
top-Higgs in the TC2 model is very close to that in the toptecnicolor model
within the mass range of 200 to 400 GeV. This manifests that change from the
original toptechnicolor model to the new TC2 version does not much affect the
production rate of the top-Higgs even though the two top-Higgs in the two
models are different. Beyond the 400 GeV, even the TC2 model predicts a
negligible production rate at LHC. Since the phenomenological change is indeed
not obvious, there is not much new to report. Even though the two models are
somehow different, we believe that the result is not worth publishing.
Therefore we decide to withdraw our manuscript.
