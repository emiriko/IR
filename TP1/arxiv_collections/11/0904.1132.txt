Magnetically active stars are the sites of efficient particle acceleration
and plasma heating, processes that have been studied in detail in the solar
corona. Investigation of such processes in young stellar objects is much more
challenging due to various absorption processes. There is, however, evidence
for violent magnetic energy release in very young stellar objects. The impact
on young stellar environments (e.g., circumstellar disk heating and ionization,
operation of chemical networks, photoevaporation) may be substantial. Hard
X-ray devices like those carried on Simbol-X will establish a basis for
detailed studies of these processes.
