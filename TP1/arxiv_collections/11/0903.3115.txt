We unveil the temperature-dependent electroweak phase transition in new
extensions of the Standard Model in which the electroweak symmetry is
spontaneously broken via strongly coupled, nearly-conformal dynamics achieved
by the means of multiple matter representations. In particular, we focus on the
low energy effective theory introduced to describe Ultra Minimal Walking
Technicolor at the phase transition. Using the one-loop effective potential
with ring improvement, we identify regions of parameter space which yield a
strong first order transition. A striking feature of the model is the existence
of a second phase transition associated to the electroweak-singlet sector. The
interplay between these two transitions leads to an extremely rich phase
diagram.
