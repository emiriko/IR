We present a microscopic theory for interacting graphene armchair nanoribbon
quantum dots. Long range interaction processes are responsible for Coulomb
blockade and spin-charge separation. Short range ones, arising from the
underlying honeycomb lattice of graphene, smear the spin-charge separation and
induce exchange correlations between bulk electrons - delocalized on the ribbon
- and single electrons localized at the two ends. As a consequence, entangled
end-bulk states where the bulk spin is no longer a conserved quantity occur.
Entanglement's signature is the occurrence of negative differential conductance
effects in a fully symmetric set-up due to symmetry-forbidden transitions.
