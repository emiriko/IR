The spatial 't Hooft loop measures the colour electric flux in SU(N)/Z(N)
gauge theory. It is a closed loop of Dirac Z(N) flux and has strength k=1,
2,.., N-1. It is analyzed for generic k and small gauge coupling in the high
temperature phase of {\cal N} =1, 2 and 4 SUSY theory up and including cubic
order. In one loop order no qualitative difference with gluodynamics shows.
However the two loop order shows a logarithmic divergence appear in the centre
of the wall. This is because the gluinos become bosonic in the centre and
acquire long wavelength excitations. We discuss the cure for this divergence,
due to a gluino zero mode. The physics of Casimir scaling is explained. The
cubic order can be obtained from gluodynamics by simple rescalings of the Debye
masses and the Casimir parameter $k/N_c$.
