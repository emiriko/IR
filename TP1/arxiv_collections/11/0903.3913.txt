Buckling and barrelling instabilities in the uniaxial compressions of an
elastic rectangle have been studied by many authors under lubricated end
conditions. However, in practice it is very difficult to realize such
conditions due to friction. Here, we study the compressions of a
two-dimensional nonlinearly elastic rectangle under clamped end conditions.
