The accelerating Friedmann flat universe, filled with an ideal fluid with a
linear (oscillating) inhomogeneous equation of state (EoS) depending on time,
is reviewed. The equations of motions are solved. It is shown that in some
cases there appears a quasi-periodic universe, which repeats the cycles of
phantom-type space acceleration.
