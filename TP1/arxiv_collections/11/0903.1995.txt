Experimental results on Bi2FeCrO6 (BFCO) epitaxial films deposited by laser
ablation on SrTiO3 substrates are presented. It has been theoretically
predicted using first-principles density functional theory that BFCO is
ferrimagnetic (with a magnetic moment of 2muB per formula unit) and
ferroelectric (with a polarization of ~80 microC/cm2 at 0K). The crystal
structure investigated using X-ray diffraction shows that the films are
epitaxial with a high degree of crystallinity. Chemical analysis carried out by
X-ray Microanalysis and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy indicates the correct
cationic stoichiometry in the BFCO layer, namely (Bi:Fe:Cr = 2:1:1).
Cross-section high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images together
with selected area electron diffraction confirm the crystalline quality of the
epitaxial BFCO films with no identifiable foreign phase or inclusion. The
multiferroic character of BFCO is proven by piezoresponse force microscopy
(PFM) and magnetic measurements showing that the films exhibit ferroelectric
and magnetic hysteresis at room temperature. The local piezoelectric
measurements show the presence of ferroelectric domains and their switching at
the sub-micron scale.
