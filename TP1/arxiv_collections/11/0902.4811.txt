The Snyder model of a noncommutative geometry due to a minimal scale $\ell$,
e.g. the Planck or the Compton scale, yields $\ell^2$-shift within the Einstein
Hamiltonian constraint, and $\gamma^5$-term in the free Dirac equation
violating CP symmetry manifestly.
  In this paper the Dirac equation is reconsidered. In fact, there is no any
reasonable cause for modification of the Minkowski hyperbolic geometry of a
momentum space. It is the consistency -- in physics phase space, spacetime
(coordinates), and momentum space (dynamics) are independent mathematical
structures. It is shown that the modified Dirac equation yields the kinetic
mass generation mechanism for the left- and right-handed Weyl chiral fields,
and realizes the idea of neutrinos receiving mass due to CP violation. It is
shown that the model is equivalent to the gauge field theory of composed two
2-flavor massive fields. The global chiral symmetry spontaneously broken into
the isospin group leads to the chiral condensate of massive neutrinos. This
result is beyond the Standard Model, but in general can be included into the
theory of elementary particles and fundamental interactions.
