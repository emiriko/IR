We study the concurrence of arbitrary multipartite mixed quantum states. An
explicit lower bound of the concurrence is derived, which detects quantum
entanglement of some states better than some separability criteria, and gives
sufficient conditions for distilling GHZ states from tripartite states. An
interesting relations between the lower bound of the concurrence for bipartite
states and for tripartite states has been presented.
