For three points $\vec{u}$,$\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ in the $n$-dimensional
space $\F_q^n$ over the finite field $\F_q$ of $q$ elements we give a natural
interpretation of an acute angle triangle defined by this points. We obtain an
upper bound on the size of a set $\cZ$ such that all triples of distinct points
$\vec{u}, \vec{v}, \vec{w} \in \cZ$ define acute angle triangles. A similar
question in the real space $\cR^n$ dates back to P. Erd{\H o}s and has been
studied by several authors.
