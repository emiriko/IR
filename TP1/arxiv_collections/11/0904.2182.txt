We argue that theories of strong electroweak symmetry breaking sector
necessarily contain new spin 0 states at the TeV scale in the tbar-t and
tbar-b/bbar-t channels, even if the third generation quarks are not composite
at the TeV scale. These states couple sufficiently strongly to third generation
quarks to have significant production at LHC via gg \to X or gb \to X. The
existence of narrow resonances in QCD suggests that the strong electroweak
breaking sector contains narrow resonances that decay to tbar-t or
tbar-b/bbar-t, with significant branching fractions to 3 or more longitudinal W
and Z bosons. These may give new "smoking gun" signals of strong electroweak
symmetry breaking.
