We first consider the Hamiltonian formulation of $n=3$ systems in general and
show that all dynamical systems in ${\mathbb R}^3$ are bi-Hamiltonian. An
algorithm is introduced to obtain Poisson structures of a given dynamical
system. We find the Poisson structures of a dynamical system recently given by
Bender et al. Secondly, we show that all dynamical systems in ${\mathbb R}^n$
are $(n-1)$-Hamiltonian. We give also an algorithm, similar to the case in
${\mathbb R}^3$, to construct a rank two Poisson structure of dynamical systems
in ${\mathbb R}^n$. We give a classification of the dynamical systems with
respect to the invariant functions of the vector field $\vec{X}$ and show that
all autonomous dynamical systems in ${\mathbb R}^n$ are super-integrable.
