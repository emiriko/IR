This is an improved remake of a previous work submitted with the same title.
An epistemologicalphysical, strictly qualitative discipline, IQM (infra-quantum
mechanics), is constructed independently of the mathematical formalism of QM.
IQM emerges under exclusively the constraints imposed by: the cognitive
situation of a human being who decides to construct communicable and consensual
knowledge on microstates; general requirements of human conceptualization. IMQ
brings into evidence how the mathematical formalism of QM manages to signify.
It explicates an integrated expression of a radically new type of descriptional
form, transferred on the registering devices of macroscopic apparatuses and
primordially statistical. IMQ is then considered globally and its relations
with space, time, geometry, consensus, as well as with Einstein's theories, are
specified. It appears that: there exists an order of progressive
constructability of our conceptualizations of physical reality; this order
withstands inclusion of concepts constructed inside macroscopic physics, into
the primordial transferred representation of microstates; consequently the aim
of directly unifying Einstein's theories, with QM, appears to be impossible.
Bell's theorem on locality expresses exclusively this impossibility. Causality
appears to be a modelizing concept that cannot be implemented into our
primordial representations of physical entities.
