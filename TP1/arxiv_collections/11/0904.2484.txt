The two-photon decay widths of scalar mesons \sigma(600), f_0(980) and
a_0(980) as well a_0 -> \rho(\omega)\gamma and f_0 -> \rho(\omega)\gamma are
calculated in the framework of the local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The
contributions of the quark loops (Hartree-Fock approximation) and the meson
loops (next 1/Nc -approximation where Nc is the number of colors) are taken
into account. These contributions, as we show, are the values of the same order
of magnitude. For the f_0 decay the K-loop contribution turns out to play the
dominant role. The results for two-gamma decays are in satisfactory agreement
with modern experimental data. The predictions for a_0 -> \rho(\omega)\gamma
and f_0 -> \rho(\omega)\gamma widths are given.
