The paper deals with sigma-games on grid graphs (in dimension 2 and more) and
conditions under which any completely symmetric configuration of lit vertices
can be reached -- in particular the completely lit configuration -- when
starting with the all-unlit configuration. The answer is complete in dimension
2. In dimension greater than or equal to 3, the answer is complete for the
sigma^+ -game, and for the sigma^- -game if at least one of the sizes is even.
The case sigma^-, dimension greater than or equal to 3 and all sizes odd
remains open.
