A low energy non-unitary leptonic mixing matrix is a generic feature of many
extensions of the Standard Model. In such a case, the task of future precision
neutrino oscillation experiments is more ambitious than measuring the three
mixing angles and the leptonic (Dirac) CP-phase, i.e., the accessible
parameters of a unitary leptonic mixing matrix. A non-unitary mixing matrix has
13 parameters that affect neutrino oscillations, out of which four are
CP-violating. In the scheme of Minimal Unitarity Violation (MUV) we analyse the
potential of a Neutrino Factory for determining or constraining the parameters
of the non-unitary leptonic mixing matrix, thereby testing the origin of
CP-violation in the lepton sector.
