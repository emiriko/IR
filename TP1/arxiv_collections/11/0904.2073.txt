In an extra dimensional EW model in M_4 X S_1 there is no distinction
mathematically with the standard model analog as far as the degrees of freedom
of the two models along with the masses and more importantly the mass ratio
relation in the zero mode limit. In this paper we present a theoretical
construct of the same geometry but with the addition of an external magnetic
flux permeating the extra coordinate. This will give all of the charged fields
in the model an additional phase with nontrivial periodicity. This rather
important addition leads to very interesting and mathematically rich physics.
Here we will present the generalized theory for the addition of first
generation leptons to this theory.
