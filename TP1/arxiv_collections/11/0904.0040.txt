Quantum Hall states that result from interaction induced lifting of the
eight-fold degeneracy of the zeroth Landau level in bilayer graphene are
considered. We show that at even filling factors electric charge is injected
into the system in the form of charge $2e$ skyrmions. This is a rare example of
binding of charges in a system with purely repulsive interactions. We calculate
the skyrmion energy and size as a function of the Zeeman interaction, and
discuss signatures of the charge $2e$ skyrmions in the scanning tunneling
microscopy experiments.
