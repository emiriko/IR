Numerical studies of the two-dimensional d-p model using the Gutzwiller
ansatz have exhibited the incommensurate antiferromagnetic state coexisting
with superconductivity in the under- and lightly doped regions. Our results are
based on the variational Monte Carlo method for the three-band Hubbard model
with d and p orbitals. We obtained the finite superconducting condensation
energy for the coexistent sate at the doping rate $x=1/8$, 1/12, and 1/16, up
to the systems of 256 unit cells with 768 atoms (oxygen and copper atoms). The
phase diagram for the hole-doped case is consistent with recent results
reported for layered high temperature cuprates.
