Pre-decoupling magnetic fields affect the scalar modes of the geometry and
produce observable effects which can be constrained also through the use of
current (as opposed to forthcoming) data stemming from the Cosmic Microwave
Background observations. The dependence of the temperature and polarization
angular power spectra upon the parameters of an ambient magnetic field is
encoded in the scaling properties of a set of basic integrals whose derivation
is simplified in the limit of small angular scales. The magnetically-induced
distortions patterns of the relevant observables can be computed analytically
by employing scaling considerations which are corroborated by numerical
results.
