For $f$ an entire transcendental map with a univalent Baker domain $U$ of
hyperbolic type I, we study pinching deformations in $U$, the support of this
deformation being certain laminations in the grand orbit of $U$. We show that
pinching along a lamination that contains the geodesic $\lambda_{\infty}$ (See
Section 3.1) does not converges. However, pinching at a lamination that does
not contains such $\lambda_{\infty}$, converges and converges to a unique map
$F$ if: the Julia set of $f$, $J(f)$ is connected, the postcritical set of $f$
is a positive (plane) distance away from $J(f)$, and it is thin at $\infty$. We
show that $F$ has a simply connected wandering domain that stays away from the
postcritical set. We interpret these results in terms of the Teichm\"uller
space of $f$, $Teich(f)$, included in $M_{f}$ the marked space of topologically
equivalent maps to $f$.
