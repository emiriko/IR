We report neutron scattering measurements on single crystals of
BaFe$_{1.92}$Co$_{0.08}$As$_2$. The magnetic Bragg peak intensity is reduced by
6 % upon cooling through T$_C$. The spin dynamics exhibit a gap of 8 meV with
anisotropic three-dimensional (3d) interactions. Below T$_C$ additional
intensity appears at an energy of $\sim$4.5(0.5) meV similar to previous
observations of a spin resonance in other Fe-based superconductors. No further
gapping of the spin excitations is observed below T$_C$ for energies down to 2
meV. These observations suggest the redistribution of spectral weight from the
magnetic Bragg position to a spin resonance demonstrating the direct
competition between static magnetic order and superconductivity.
