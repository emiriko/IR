Graphene is the nature's thinnest elastic membrane, with exceptional
mechanical and electrical properties. We report the direct observation and
creation of one-dimensional (1D) and 2D periodic ripples in suspended graphene
sheets, using spontaneously and thermally induced longitudinal strains on
patterned substrates, with control over their orientations and wavelengths. We
also provide the first measurement of graphene's thermal expansion coefficient,
which is anomalously large and negative, ~ -7x10^-6 K^-1 at 300K. Our work
enables novel strain-based engineering of graphene devices.
