The cross section for resonant ion-pair formation in the collision of
low-energy electrons with HF^+ is calculated by the solution of the
time-dependent Schrodinger equation with multiple coupled states using a wave
packet method. A diabatization procedure is proposed to obtain the electronic
couplings between quasidiabatic potentials of ^1Sigma^+ symmetry for HF. By
including these couplings between the neutral states, the cross section for
ion-pair formation increases with about two orders of magnitude compared with
the cross section for direct dissociation. Qualitative agreement with the
measured cross section is obtained. The oscillations in the calculated cross
section are analyzed. The cross section for ion-pair formation in electron
recombination with DF^+ is calculated to determine the effect of isotopic
substitution.
