Inclusive jet production data are important for constraining the gluon
distribution in the global QCD analysis of parton distribution functions. With
the addition of recent CDF and D0 Run II jet data, we study a number of issues
that play a role in determining the up-to-date gluon distribution and its
uncertainty, and produce a new set of parton distributions that make use of
that data. We present in detail the general procedures used to study the
compatibility between new data sets and the previous body of data used in a
global fit. We introduce a new method in which the Hessian matrix for
uncertainties is ``rediagonalized'' to obtain eigenvector sets that
conveniently characterize the uncertainty of a particular observable.
