Using the data observed by the Solar Optical Telescope/Spectro-Polarimeter
aboard the Hinode satellite, the horizontal and vertical fields are derived
from the wavelength-integrated measures of Zeeman-induced linear and circular
polarizations. The quiet intranetwork regions are pervaded by horizontal
magnetic elements. We categorize the horizontal intranetwork magnetic elements
into two types: one is the non-isolated element which is accompanied by the
vertical magnetic elements during its evolution; another is the isolated
element which is not accompanied by the vertical magnetic elements. We identify
446 horizontal intranetwork magnetic elements, among them 87 elements are
isolated and 359 are non-isolated. Quantitative measurements reveal that the
isolated elements have relatively weaker horizontal magnetic fields, almost
equal size, and shorter lifetime comparing with the non-isolated elements. Most
non-isolated horizontal intranetwork magnetic elements are identified to
associate with the emergence of Omega-shaped flux loops. A few non-isolated
elements seem to indicate scenarios of submergence of Omega loops or emergence
of U-like loops. There is a positive correlation between the lifetime and the
size for both the isolated and non-isolated HIFs. It is also found that there
is also positive correlation between the lifetime and the magnetic flux density
for non-isolated HIFs, but no correlation for isolated HIFs. Even though the
horizontal elements show lower magnetic flux density, they could carry the
total magnetic flux in the order of magnitude close to 10^25 Mx to the solar
surface each day.
