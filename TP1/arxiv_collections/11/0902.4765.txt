The time evolution of a charged spin 1/2 particle interacting with a magnetic
field is analyzed in the framework of the complex spectral theory, based on
Prigogine's principles that provide a rigorous description of irreversibility.
A detailed survey of the irreversible relaxation process of the spin 1/2
particle is carried out on the basis of the subdynamics theory. We obtain the
results for the Markovian and the non-Markovian evolution of the charged
particle.
