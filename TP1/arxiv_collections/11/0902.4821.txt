We report a direct correlation between carrier mobility and Raman topography
of epitaxial graphene (EG) grown on silicon carbide (SiC). We show the Hall
mobility of material on the Si-face of SiC [SiC(0001)] is not only highly
dependent on thickness uniformity but also on monolayer strain uniformity. Only
when both thickness and strain are uniform over a significant fraction (> 40%)
of the device active area does the mobility exceed 1000 cm2/V-s. Additionally,
we achieve high mobility epitaxial graphene (18,100 cm2/V-s at room
temperature) on the C-face of SiC [SiC(000-1)] and show that carrier mobility
depends strongly on the graphene layer stacking. These findings provide a means
to rapidly estimate carrier mobility and provide a guide to achieve very high
mobility in epitaxial graphene. Our results suggest that ultra-high mobilities
(>50,000 cm2/V-s) are achievable via the controlled formation of uniform,
rotationally faulted epitaxial graphene.
