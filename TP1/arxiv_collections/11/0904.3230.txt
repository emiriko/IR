Atmospheric scattering of light emitted by an air shower not only attenuates
direct fluorescence light from the shower, but also contributes to the observed
shower light. So far only direct and singly-scattered Cherenkov photons have
been taken into account in routine analyses of the observed optical image of
air showers. In this paper a Monte Carlo method of evaluating the contribution
of multiply scattered light to the optical air shower image is presented, as
well as results of simulations and a parameterization of scattered light
contribution to measured shower signal.
