Emergent gravity views spacetime as an entity emergent from a more complete
theory of interacting fundamental constituents valid at much finer resolution
or higher energies, usually assumed to be above the Planck energy. In this view
general relativity is an effective theory valid only at long wavelengths and
low energies. For any presumed known theory for the microscopic structure of
spacetime, we describe common tasks of emergent gravity (`top-down'), namely,
identifying the conditions and processes or mechanisms whereby the familiar
macroscopic spacetime emerges with high probability and reasonable robustness.
Going in the opposite direction (`bottom-up') is the task of quantum gravity,
i.e., finding a theory for the microscopic structure of spacetime, which, in
this new view, cannot come from quantizing the metric or connection forms
because they are the collective variables which are meaningful only for the
macroscopic theory, i.e., general relativity. We suggest pathways to move `up'
(in energy) from the given macroscopic conditions of classical gravity and
quantum field theory to the domain closer to the micro-macro interface where
spacetime emerged and places to look for clues or tell-tale signs at low energy
where one could infer indirectly some salient features of the micro-structure
of spacetime.
