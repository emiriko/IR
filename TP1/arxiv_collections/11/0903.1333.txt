Photometry of the A0 V main-sequence star HD 106797 with AKARI and
Gemini/T-ReCS is used to detect excess emission over the expected stellar
photospheric emission between 10 and 20 micron, which is best attributed to hot
circumstellar debris dust surrounding the star. The temperature of the debris
dust is derived as Td ~ 190 K by assuming that the excess emission is
approximated by a single temperature blackbody. The derived temperature
suggests that the inner radius of the debris disk is ~ 14 AU. The fractional
luminosity of the debris disk is 1000 times brighter than that of our own
zodiacal cloud. The existence of such a large amount of hot dust around HD
106797 cannot be accounted for by a simple model of the steady state evolution
of a debris disk due to collisions, and it is likely that transient events play
a significant role. Our data also show a narrow spectral feature between 11 and
12 micron attributable to crystalline silicates, suggesting that dust heating
has occurred during the formation and evolution of the debris disk of HD
106797.
