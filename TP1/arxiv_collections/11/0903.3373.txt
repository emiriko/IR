We identify the nonlinear evolution equation in impact-parameter space for
the "Supercritical Pomeron" in Reggeon Field Theory as a 2-dimensional
stochastic Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovski-Piscounov equation. It exactly preserves
unitarity and leads in its radial form to an high energy traveling wave
solution corresponding to an ""universal" behaviour of the impact-parameter
front profile of the elastic amplitude; Its rapidity dependence and form depend
only on one parameter, the noise strength, independently of the initial
conditions and of the non-linear terms restoring unitarity. Theoretical
predictions are presented for the three typical distinct regimes corresponding
to zero, weak and strong noise.
