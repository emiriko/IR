We performed magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements under high
pressures of up to 19 GPa for FeTe0.92. The compound shows an anomaly in
magnetization and resistivity at atmospheric pressure due to a structural
distortion accompanied by a magnetic transition. We also observed magnetic and
resistive anomalies under high pressure, suggesting that two pressure-induced
phases exist at a low temperature. Unlike in FeAs-based compounds, no
superconductivity was detected under high pressures of up to 19 GPa, although
the anomaly at atmospheric pressure was suppressed by applying pressure.
