The aim of this paper is to prove coding theorems for the wiretap channel
coding problem and secret key agreement problem based on the the notion of a
hash property for an ensemble of functions. These theorems imply that codes
using sparse matrices can achieve the optimal rate. Furthermore, fixed-rate
universal coding theorems for a wiretap channel and a secret key agreement are
also proved.
