We investigate the three flavor Nambu-Jona Lasinio model of neutral quark
matter at zero temperature and finite density, keeping into account the scalar,
the pseudoscalar and the Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft interactions as well as the
repulsive vector plus axial-vector interaction terms (vector extended NJL,
VENJL in the following). We focus on the effect of the vector interaction on
the chiral restoration at finite density in neutral matter. We also study the
evolution of the charged pseudoscalar meson energies as a function of the quark
chemical potential.
