We calculate the production rates of the second Kaluza-Klein (KK) photon
$\gamma^{(2)}$ and Z boson $Z^{(2)}$ at the LHC including all significant
processes in the minimal Universal Extra Dimension (MUED) model. For
discrimination of the MUED model from other TeV scale models at the LHC,
$\gamma^{(2)}$ and $Z^{(2)}$ play a crucial role. In order to discuss the
discrimination and calculate their production rates, we derive KK number
violating operators including the contribution of the top Yukawa coupling.
Using these operators, we accurately calculate branching ratios of second KK
particles. In addition we find that these KK number violating operators provide
new processes for $\gamma^{(2)}$ and $Z^{(2)}$ productions, such as cascade
decay from second KK quarks produced through these operators. They have large
contributions to their total production rates. In particular, these production
processes give the dominant contribution for $\gamma^{(2)}$ production for $1/R
\gtrsim 800$ GeV. As a result, with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb$^{-1}$,
the number of produced $\gamma^{(2)}$ and $Z^{(2)}$ are estimated as 10$^6$ -
10$^2$ for the compactification scale between 400 GeV and 2000 GeV.
