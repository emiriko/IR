For years, astrophysicists, plasma fusion and fluid physicists have puzzled
over Rayleigh-Taylor turbulent mixing layers. In particular, strong
discrepancies in the growth rates have been observed between experiments and
numerical simulations. Although two phenomenological mechanisms (mode-coupling
and mode-competition) have brought some insight on these differences,
convincing theoretical arguments are missing to explain the observed values. In
this paper, we provide an analytical expression of the growth rate compatible
with both mechanisms and is valide for a self-similar, low Atwood
Rayleigh-Taylor turbulent mixing subjected to a constant or time-varying
acceleration. The key step in this work is the introduction of {\it foliated}
averages and {\it foliated} turbulent spectra highlighted in our three
dimensional numerical simulations. We show that the exact value of the
Rayleigh-Taylor growth rate not only depends upon the acceleration history but
is also bound to the power-law exponent of the {\it foliated} spectra at large
scales.
