We solve the standard Lifshitz-Slyozov (LS) model with conservation of total
particles in the limit of small super-saturation. The new element is an
effective initial condition that follows from the initial exhaustion of
nucleation as described in a previous paper [Farjoun and Neu, Phys. Rev. E 78].
The effective initial condition is characterized by a narrow distribution of
cluster-sizes, all much larger than critical. In the subsequent solution, one
of the LS similarity solutions emerges as the long-time limit, as expected. But
our solution tells more. In particular, there is a "growth" era prior to what
is usually called "coarsening". During "growth" the clusters (all of nearly the
same size much larger than critical) eventually exhaust the super-saturation
(the exhaustion of nucleation in the previous era results from only a small
decrease in super-saturation). This allows the critical size to catch up to the
clusters, and the traditional "coarsening" begins: Subcritical clusters
dissolve and fuel the growth of the remaining super-critical clusters. Our
analysis tracks the evolution of cluster sizes during growth and coarsening by
complimentary use of asymptotic and numerical methods. We establish
characteristic times and cluster sizes associated with growth and coarsening
from physical parameters and the initial super-saturation. The emerging
distribution is discontinuous at the largest cluster size, and our model
selects the discontinuous LS similarity solution as the long time limit. There
are strong indications that the smooth similarity solution proposed in the
original LS paper emerges on a, yet longer, late-coarsening time-scale.
