The recent demonstration of current singularity formation by Low et al.
assumes that potential fields will remain potential under simple expansion or
compression (Low 2006, 2007; Janse & Low 2009). An explicit counterexample to
their key assumption is constructed. Our findings suggest that their results
may need to be reconsidered.
