We investigate the recently proposed label-propagation algorithm (LPA) for
identifying network communities. We reformulate the LPA as an equivalent
optimization problem, giving an objective function whose maxima correspond to
community solutions. By considering properties of the objective function, we
identify conceptual and practical drawbacks of the label propagation approach,
most importantly the disparity between increasing the value of the objective
function and improving the quality of communities found. To address the
drawbacks, we modify the objective function in the optimization problem,
producing a variety of algorithms that propagate labels subject to constraints;
of particular interest is a variant that maximizes the modularity measure of
community quality. Performance properties and implementation details of the
proposed algorithms are discussed. Bipartite as well as unipartite networks are
considered.
