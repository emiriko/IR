We have observed strong photoluminescence from a single CdSe quantum dot
embedded in a ZnSe nanowire. Exciton, biexciton and charged exciton lines have
been identified unambiguously using photon correlation spectroscopy. This
technique has provided a detailed picture of the dynamics of this new system.
This type of semi conducting quantum dot turns out to be a very efficient
single photon source in the visible. Its particular growth technique opens new
possibilities as compared to the usual self-asssembled quantum dots.
