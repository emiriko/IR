The formation and evolution process and magnetic configuration of solar
prominences remain unclear. In order to study the formation process of
prominences, we examine continuous observations of a prominence in NOAA AR
10953 with the Solar Optical Telescope on the \emph{Hinode} satellite. As
reported in our previous Letter, we find a signature suggesting that a helical
flux rope emerges from below the photosphere under a pre-existing prominence.
Here we investigate more detailed properties and photospheric indications of
the emerging helical flux rope, and discuss their relationship to the formation
of the prominence. Our main conclusions are: (1) A dark region with absence of
strong vertical magnetic fields broadens and then narrows in Ca \textsc{ii}
H-line filtergrams. This phenomenon is consistent with the emergence of the
helical flux rope as photospheric counterparts. The size of the flux rope is
roughly 30,000 km long and 10,000 km wide. The width is larger than that of the
prominence. (2) No shear motion or converging flows are detected, but we find
diverging flows such as mesogranules along the polarity inversion line. The
presence of mesogranules may be related to the emergence of the helical flux
rope. (3) The emerging helical flux rope reconnects with magnetic fields of the
pre-existing prominence to stabilize the prominence for the next several days.
We thus conjecture that prominence coronal magnetic fields emerge in the form
of helical flux ropes that contribute to the formation and maintenance of the
prominence.
