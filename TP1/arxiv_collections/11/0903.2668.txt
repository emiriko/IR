We present the analysis and results of photometric and spectroscopic catalog
combined with X-ray data of two non-relaxed clusters CL 0024+1654 (z=0.4) and
RX J0152.7-1357 (z=0.8). Using the Spearman correlation analysis we quantify
the correlation between morphology, color, and star formation rate of each
galaxy with its surrounding number density, mass density, and temperature of
Intracluster Medium (ICM). Although our results show that the two clusters
exhibit a weaker correlation compared with relaxed clusters, it still confirms
the significant effect of the ICM in varying the star formation rates in the
galaxies. Various physical mechanisms have been suggested to explain the
relation between the properties of galaxies and their environments for example:
ram pressure stripping, mergers etc. Nonetheless, using this analysis alone, it
is difficult to identify the dominant environmental mechanism(s) operating in
clusters of galaxies and the role of the initial condition.
