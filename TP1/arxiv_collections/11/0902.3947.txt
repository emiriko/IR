A new generation of (unpolarized) dynamical parton distribution functions of
the nucleon is determined. After introducing basic elements of perturbative
QCD, the dynamical model is discussed and compared with the approach to parton
distributions used by most other groups ("standard"). Parton distributions sets
(with uncertainties) at different orders (LO, NLO, NNLO), using different
factorization schemes (\overline{MS}, DIS) and different treatments of heavy
quark masses (FFNS, VFNS) are extracted and compared. The astrophysical
implications of the dynamical predictions are outlined before focusing on
collider phenomenology. There, the relevance and perturbative stability of the
longitudinal structure function of the nucleon is studied, and the role of
heavy quark flavors in high-energy colliders is analyzed. In addition, it is
shown how isospin violations in the nucleon help to explain the so-called
"NuTeV anomaly".
