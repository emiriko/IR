We present a no-go theorem that it is impossible in general to construct a
holographic description of each meson with the quark-antiquark valence degree
of freedom only with fixed (conserved) quantum number L in 3+1 dimensions and
that would satisfy at the same time manifest chiral symmetry in the ultraviolet
and would not violate unitarity.
