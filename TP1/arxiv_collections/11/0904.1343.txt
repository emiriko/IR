In this paper we propose new non-relativistic p+1 dimensional theory. This
theory is defined in such a way that the potential term obeys the principle of
detailed balance where the generating action corresponds to p-brane action.
This condition ensures that the norm of the vacuum wave functional of p+1
dimensional theory is equal to the partition function of p-brane theory.
