The Fermi and Rashba energies of surface states in the Bi_xPb_{1-x}/Ag(111)
alloy can be tuned simultaneously by changing the composition parameter x. We
report on unconventional Fermi surface spin textures observed by spin and
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy {that are correlated with a
topological transition of the Fermi surface occurring at x=0.5. We show that
the surface states remain fully spin polarized upon alloying and that the spin
polarization vectors are approximately tangential to the constant energy
contours. We discuss the implications of the topological transition for the
transport of spin.
