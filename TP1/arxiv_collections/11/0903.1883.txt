We investigate the damping of the baryon acoustic oscillations in the matter
power spectrum due to the quasinonlinear clustering and redshift-space
distortions by confronting the models with the observations of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey luminous red galaxy sample. The chi-squared test suggests
that the observed power spectrum is better matched by models with the damping
of the baryon acoustic oscillations rather than the ones without the damping.
