Bubble and droplet motion in binary mixtures is studied in weak heat and
diffusion fluxes and in gravity by solving the linearized hydrodynamic
equations supplemented with appropriate surface boundary conditions. Without
gravity, the velocity field is induced by evaporation and condensation at the
interface and by the Marangoni effect due to a surface tension gradient. In
pure fluids, the latter nearly vanishes since the interface temperature tends
to the coexistence temperature $T_{\rm cx}(p)$ even in heat flow. In binary
mixtures, the velocity field can be much enhanced by the Marangoni effect above
a crossover concentration $c^*$ inversely proportional to the radius $R$ of the
bubble or droplet. Here $c^*$ is usually very small for large $R$ for
non-azeotropic mixtures. The temperature and concentration deviations are also
calculated.
