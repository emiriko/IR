An effective field theory developed for systems interacting through
short-range interactions can be applied to systems of cold atoms with a large
scattering length and to nucleons at low energies. It is therefore the ideal
tool to analyze the universal properties associated with the Efimov effect in
three- and four-body systems. In this "progress report", we will discuss recent
results obtained within this framework and report on progress regarding the
inclusion of higher order corrections associated with the finite range of the
underlying interaction.
