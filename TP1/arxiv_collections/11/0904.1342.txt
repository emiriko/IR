Using density functional theory, we have investigated the electronic and
magnetic properties of finite-size as well as infinitely periodic
organometallic vanadium-borazine systems for their possible applications in
spintronics devices. From our calculations, we find the finite-size
vanadium-borazine systems to be structurally more stable in comparison to their
isoelectronic benzene counterparts. All the finite-size vanadium-borazine
systems are found to be ferromagnetically stabilized, with the infinite
one-dimensional wire exhibiting robust half-metallic behaviour. The finite-size
clusters are also found to exhibit efficient spin filter properties when
coupled to graphene electrodes.
