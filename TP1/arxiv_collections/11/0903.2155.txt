We present a new grid of stellar model calculations for stars on the
Asymptotic Giant Branch between 1.0 and 6.0 M_sun. Our grid consists of 5
chemical mixtures between Z=0.0005 and Z=0.04, with both solar-like and
$\alpha$-element enhanced metal ratios. We treat consistently the
carbon-enhancement of the stellar envelopes by using opacity tables with
varying C/O-ratio and by employing theoretical mass loss rates for carbon
stars. The low temperature opacities have been calculated specifically for this
project. For oxygen stars we use an empirical mass loss formalism. The third
dredge-up is naturally obtained by including convective overshooting. Our
models reach effective temperatures in agreement with earlier synthetic models,
which included approximative carbon-enriched molecular opacities and show good
agreement with empirically determined carbon-star lifetimes. A fraction of the
models could be followed into the post-AGB phase, for which we provide models
in a mass range supplementing previous post-AGB calculations. Our grid
constitutes the most extensive set of AGB-models, calculated with the latest
physical input data and treating carbon-enhancement due to the third dredge-up
most consistently.
