Stochastic solutions are obtained for the Maxwell-Vlasov equation in the
approximation where magnetic field fluctuations are neglected and the
electrostatic potential is used to compute the electric field. This is a
reasonable approximation for plasmas in a strong external magnetic field. Both
Fourier and configuration space solutions are constructed.
