The emergence of chaotic motion is discussed for hard-point like and soft
collisions between two particles in a one-dimensional box. It is known that
ergodicity may be obtained in hard-point like collisions for specific mass
ratios $\gamma=m2/m1$ of the two particles and that Lyapunov exponents are
zero. However, if a Yukawa interaction between the particles is introduced, we
show analytically that positive Lyapunov exponents are generated due to double
collisions close to the walls. While the largest finite-time Lyapunov exponent
changes smoothly with $\gamma$, the number of occurrences of the most probable
one, extracted from the distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents over
initial conditions, reveals details about the phase-space dynamics. In
particular, the influence of the integrable and pseudointegrable dynamics
without Yukawa interaction for specific mass ratios can be clearly identified
and demonstrates the sensitivity of the finite-time Lyapunov exponents as a
phase-space probe. Being not restricted to two-dimensional problems such as
Poincar\'e sections, the number of occurrences of the most probable Lyapunov
exponents suggests itself as a suitable tool to characterize phase-space
dynamics in higher dimensions. This is shown for the problem of two interacting
particles in a circular billiard.
