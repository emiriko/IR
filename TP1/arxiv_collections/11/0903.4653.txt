We present a possibility to switch the chirality of a spin vortex occurring
in a magnetic nanodisk by applying a uniform in-plane field pulse, based on
optimizing its strength and duration. The related spin-dynamical process,
investigated by micromagnetic simulations, consists of several stages. After
applying the field, the original vortex is expelled from the disk, after which
two C-shaped states oscillate between each other. The essence of the method is
based on turning the field off at a suitably chosen moment for which the
orientation of the C-state will evolve into the nucleation of a vortex with the
desirable chirality. This idea simply uses the information about the original
chirality present inside the nanodisk during the dynamic process before losing
it in saturation, and can thus be regarded as analogous to the recent studies
on the polarity switching.
