Data from the Large Electron Positron collider (LEP) at CERN on hadron
production in gamma-gamma interactions exceed the predictions of the standard
model by an order of magnitude at the highest observed transverse momenta in
three channels. The amplitude for the process is asymptotically proportional to
the sum of the squares of the charges of quarks. The data are suggestive of
models where quarks have unit charges, or larger, and where partons have
substructure. A previously proposed model of electro-strong interactions
includes both these features. Definitive measurements could be made with either
of the linear electron-positron colliders that have been proposed, viz. the
International Linear Collider (ILC) or the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC).
However, an electron-electron collider employing the recently developed plasma
wakefield acceleration technique could provide the most affordable option. An
independent check of the multi-muon events that were recently reported at
Fermilab could also be made with this type of collider.
