The cross section for dissociative recombination of BeH^+ is calculated by
solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation in the local complex
potential approximation. The effects of couplings between resonant states and
the Rydberg states converging to the ground state of the ion are studied. The
relevant potentials, couplings and autoionization widths are extracted using ab
initio electron scattering and structure calculations, followed by a
diabatization procedure. The calculated cross sections shows a sizable
magnitude at low energy, followed by a high-energy peak centered around 1 eV.
The electronic couplings between the neutral states induce oscillations in the
cross section. Analytical forms for the cross sections at low collision
energies are given.
