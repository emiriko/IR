We propose a non-classical multi-player entangled state which eliminates the
need for communication, yet can solve problems (that require coordination)
better than classical approaches. For the entangled state, we propose a slater
determinant of all allowed states of a filled band in a condensed matter system
-- the integer quantum Hall state at filling factor 1. Such a state gives the
best solution (i.e., best Nash equilibrium) for some classical stochastic
problems where classical solutions are far from ideal.
