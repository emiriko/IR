We present the effective low-energy theory for interacting 1D quantum wires
subject to Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Under a one-loop renormalization group
scheme including all allowed interaction processes for not too weak Rashba
coupling, we show that electron-electron backscattering is an irrelevant
perturbation. Therefore no gap arises and electronic transport is described by
a modified Luttinger liquid theory. As an application of the theory, we discuss
the RKKY interaction between two magnetic impurities. Interactions are shown to
induce a slower power-law decay of the RKKY range function than the usual 1D
noninteracting $\cos(2k_F x)/|x|$ law. Moreover, in the noninteracting Rashba
wire, the spin-orbit coupling causes a twisted (anisotropic) range function
with several different spatial oscillation periods. In the interacting case, we
show that one special oscillation period leads to the slowest decay, and
therefore dominates the RKKY interaction for large separation.
