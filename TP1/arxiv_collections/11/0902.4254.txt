We calculate the Casimir force between a Ge plate and a Ge spherical lens
with neglected and included free charge carriers. Computations with included
carriers are performed using the Drude, plasma, and diffusion models. It is
shown that the plasma and the Drude models lead to almost identical
computational results, while the results obtained using the diffusion model are
sandwiched between those obtained with neglected charge carriers and with
charge carriers described by the plasma or Drude models.
