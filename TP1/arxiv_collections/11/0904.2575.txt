Scaling laws and universality are often associated with systems exhibiting
emergent phenomena possessing a characteristic energy scale. We report
nonequilibrium transport measurements on two different types of single-molecule
transistor (SMT) devices in the Kondo regime. The conductance at low bias and
temperature adheres to a scaling function characterized by two parameters. This
result, analogous to that reported recently in semiconductor dots with Kondo
temperatures two orders of magnitude lower, demonstrates the universality of
this scaling form. We compare the extracted values of the scaling coefficients
to previous experimental and theoretical results.
