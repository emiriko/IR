Bohr's model agreed with the hydrogen spectrum results, but did not agree
with the spectrum of Helium. Here we show that Bohr's model-based methods can
calculate the experimental value (-79.005 eV) of Helium ground state energy
correctly. we suppose the orbital planes of the two electrons are perpendicular
to each other. By a computational method, we calculate the Coulomb force among
the particles, and the number of de Broglie's waves contained in the short
segment at short time intervals. Our results demonstrate that two electrons of
Helium are actually moving around, not as electron clouds.
