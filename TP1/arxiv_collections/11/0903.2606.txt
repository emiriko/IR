We have performed a structure function analysis of the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer All Sky Monitor data to search for variability in 24 blazars using
data trains that each exceed 12 years. Although 20 of them show nominal periods
though this technique, the great majority of these `periods' are clearly
related to yearly variations arising from the instrument.Nonetheless, an
apparently real periodic component of about 17 days was detected for the blazar
AO 0235+164 and it was confirmed by discrete correlation function and
periodogram analyses. For 1ES 2321+419 a component of variability with a near
periodicity of about 420 days was detected by all of these methods. We discuss
several possible explanations for these nearly periodic components and conclude
that they most likely arise from the intersections of a shock propagating down
a relativistic jet that possesses a helical structure.
