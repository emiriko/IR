Interest in the influence of the neutron-to-proton (N/Z) ratio on
multifragmenting nuclei has demanded an improvement in the capabilities of
multi-detector arrays as well as the companion analysis methods. The particle
identification method used in the NIMROD-ISiS 4 $\pi$ array is described.
Performance of the detectors and the analysis method are presented for the
reaction of 86Kr+64Ni at 35MeV/u.
