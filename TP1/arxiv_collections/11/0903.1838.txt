The phenomenon of Fermi acceleration is addressed for a dissipative bouncing
ball model with external stochastic perturbation. It is shown that the
introduction of energy dissipation (inelastic collisions of the particle with
the moving wall) is a sufficient condition to break down the process of Fermi
acceleration. The phase transition from bounded to unbounded energy growth in
the limit of vanishing dissipation is characterized.
