A program calculating Bhabha scattering at high energy colliders is
considered for porting to the EGEE Grid infrastructure. The program code, which
is a result of the aITALC project, is ported by using a master-worker operating
scheme. The job submission, execution and monitoring are implemented using the
GridWay metascheduler. The unattended execution of jobs turned out to be
complete and rather efficient, even when pre-knowledge of the grid is absent.
While the batch of jobs remains organized at the user's side, the actual
computation was carried out within the phenogrid virtual organization. The
scientific results support the use of the small angle Bhabha scattering for the
luminosity measurements of the International Linear Collider project.
