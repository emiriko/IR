We investigate the quantum coherent dynamics of an externally driven
effective two-level system subjected to a slow Ohmic environment characteristic
of biomolecular protein-solvent reservoirs in photosynthetic light harvesting
complexes. By means of the numerically exact quasi adiabatic propagator path
integral (QUAPI) method we are able to include non-Markovian features of the
environment and show the dependence of the quantum coherence on the
characteristic bath cut-off frequency omega_c as well as on the driving
frequency omega_l and the field amplitude A. Our calculations extend from the
weak coupling regime to the incoherent strong coupling regime. In the latter
case, we find evidence for a resonant behaviour, beyond the expected behaviour,
when the reorganization energy E_r coincides with the driving frequency.
Moreover, we investigate how the coherent destruction of tunneling within the
two-level system is influenced by the non-Markovian environment.
