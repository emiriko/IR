Recent observations show that planet can reside in close binary systems with
stellar separation of only about 20 AU. However, planet formation in such close
binary systems is a challenge to current theory. One of the major theoretical
problems occurs in the intermediate stage-planetesimals accretion into
planetary embryos-during which the companion's perturbations can stir up the
relative velocites(dV) of planetesimals and thus slow down or even cease their
growth. However, all previous studies assumed a 2-dimentional (2D) disk and a
coplanar binary orbit. Extending previous studies by including a 3D gas disk
and an inclined binary orbit with small relative inclination of i_B=0.1-5 deg,
we numerically investigate the conditions for planetesimal accretion at 1-2 AU,
an extension of the habitable zone(1-1.3 AU), around alpha Centauri A in this
paper. Inclusion of the binary inclination leads to: (1) differential orbital
phasing is realized in the 3D space, and thus different-sized bodies are
separated from each other; (2) total impact rate becomes lower, and impacts
mainly occur between similar-sized bodies; (3) accretion is more favored, but
the balance between accretion and erosion remains uncertain, and the "possible
accretion region" extends up to 2AU when assuming an optimistic Q*(critical
specific energy that leads to catastrophic fragmentation); and (4) impact
velocities (dV) are significantly reduced but still much larger than their
escape velocities, which infers that planetesimals grow by means of type II
runaway mode. As a conclusion, inclusion of a small binary inclination is a
promising mechanism that favors accretion, opening a possibility that planet
formation in close binary systems can go through the difficult stage of
planetesimals accretion into planetary embryos.
