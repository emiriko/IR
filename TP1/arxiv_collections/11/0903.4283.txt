Leak detection systems range from simple, visual line walking and checking
ones to complex arrangements of hard-ware and software. No one method is
universally applicable and operating requirements dictate which method is the
most cost effective. The aim of the paper is to review the basic techniques of
leak detection that are currently in use. The advantages and disadvantages of
each method are discussed and some indications of applicability are outlined.
