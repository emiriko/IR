We describe a fully-automatic 3D-segmentation technique for brain MR images.
Using Markov random fields the segmentation algorithm captures three important
MR features, i.e. non-parametric distributions of tissue intensities,
neighborhood correlations and signal inhomogeneities. Detailed simulations and
real MR images demonstrate the performance of the segmentation algorithm. The
impact of noise, inhomogeneity, smoothing and structure thickness is analyzed
quantitatively. Even single echo MR images are well classified into gray
matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, scalp-bone and background. A
simulated annealing and an iterated conditional modes implementation are
presented.
