We study the problem of determination of asset prices in an incomplete market
proposing three different but related scenarios. One scenario uses a market
game approach whereas the other two are based on risk sharing or regret
minimizing considerations. Dynamical schemes modeling the convergence of the
buyer's and of the seller's prices to a unique price are proposed.
