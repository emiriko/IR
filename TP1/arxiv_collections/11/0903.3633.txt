A Fermi-Fermi mixture of 40K and 6Li does not exhibit the Efimov effect in a
free space, but the Efimov effect can be induced by confining only 40K in one
dimension. Here the Efimov's three-body parameter is controlled by the
confinement length. We show that the three-body recombination rate in such a
system in the dilute limit has a characteristic logarithmic-periodic dependence
on the effective scattering length with the scaling factor 22.0 and can be
expressed by formulas similar to those for identical bosons in three
dimensions. The ultracold mixture of 40K and 6Li in the 1D-3D mixed dimensions
is thus a promising candidate to observe the Efimov physics in fermions.
