The Simon-Gutowitz bidirectional traffic model (Phys. Rev. E 57, 2441 (1998))
is revisited in this letter. We found that passing cars get stuck with oncoming
cars before returning to their home lanes. This provokes the occurrence of wide
jams on both lanes. We have rectified the rules for lane changing. Then, the
wide jams disappear and the revisited model can describe well the realistic
bidirectional traffic.
