I provide an overview of the empirical mass-loss rates of hot and cool
luminous stars. Stellar species included in this talk are luminous OB stars,
Wolf-Rayet stars, asymptotic giant branch stars, and red supergiants. I discuss
the scaling of mass loss with stellar properties, with special emphasis on the
influences of chemical abundances. Observational errors and systematic
uncertainties are still substantial and vary with stellar type. These
uncertainties are a major impediment for the construction of reliable stellar
evolution models.
