The accelerated expansion of the universe has now been confirmed by several
independent observations including those of high redshift type Ia supernovae,
and the cosmic microwave background combined with the large scale structure of
the Universe. In this work we introduce families of analytical solutions for
the scale factor different from the current literature. The knowledge of the
scale factor behavior might shed some light on these questions since the entire
evolution of a homogeneous isotropic Universe is contained in the scale factor.
We use different parameters for these solutions and with these parameters we
stablish a connection with the equation of state for different dark energy
scenarios.
