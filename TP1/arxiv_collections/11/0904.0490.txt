The lowest temptation level (T = 1) is considered a trivial case for the
Prisoner's Dilemma. Here, we show that this statement is true only for a very
particular case, where the players interact with only one player. Otherwise, if
the players interact with more than one player, the system presents the same
possible behaviors observed for $T > 1$. In the steady state, the system can
reach the cooperative, chaotic or defective phases, when adopting the Darwinian
Evolutionary Strategy and the cooperative or quasi-regular phases, adopting the
Pavlovian Evolutionary Strategy.
