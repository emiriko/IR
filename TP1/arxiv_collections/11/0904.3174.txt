Charge formations on superconducting layers and creation of the longitudinal
plasma wave in the stack of intrinsic Josephson junctions change crucially the
superconducting current through the stack. Investigation of the correlations of
superconducting currents in neighboring Josephson junctions and the charge
correlations in neighboring superconducting layers allows us to predict the
additional features in the current--voltage characteristics. The charge
autocorrelation functions clearly demonstrate the difference between harmonic
and chaotic behavior in the breakpoint region. Use of the correlation functions
gives us a powerful method for the analysis of the current--voltage
characteristics of coupled Josephson junctions.
