We report on the influence of hyperfine interaction on the optical
orientation of singly charged excitons X+ and X- in self-assembled InAs/GaAs
quantum dots. All measurements were carried out on individual quantum dots
studied by micro-photoluminescence at low temperature. We show that the
hyperfine interaction leads to an effective partial spin relaxation, under
50kHz modulated excitation polarization, which becomes however strongly
inhibited under steady optical pumping conditions because of dynamical nuclear
polarization. This optically created magnetic-like nuclear field can become
very strong (up to ~4 T) when it is generated in the direction opposite to a
longitudinally applied field, and exhibits then a bistability regime. This
effect is very well described by a theoretical model derived in a perturbative
approach, which reveals the key role played by the energy cost of an electron
spin flip in the total magnetic field. Eventually, we emphasize the
similarities and differences between X+ and X- trions with respect to the
hyperfine interaction, which turn out to be in perfect agreement with the
theoretical description.
