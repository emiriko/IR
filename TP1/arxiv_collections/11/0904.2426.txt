In this article statistical bounds for certain output characteristics of the
$M/GI/1/n$ and $GI/M/1/n$ loss queueing systems are derived on the basis of
large samples of an input characteristic of these systems, such as service time
in the $M/GI/1/n$ queueing system or interarrival time in the $GI/M/1/n$
queueing system. The analysis of this article is based on application of
Kolmogorov's statistics for empirical probability distribution functions.
