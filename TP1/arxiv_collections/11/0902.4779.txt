Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) consist of a collection of wireless mobile
nodes which dynamically exchange data without reliance on a fixed base station
or a wired backbone network, which makes routing a crucial issue for the design
of a ad hoc networks. In this paper we discussed a hybrid multipath routing
protocol named MP-OLSR. It is based on the link state algorithm and employs
periodic exchange of messages to maintain topology information of the networks.
In the mean time, it updates the routing table in an on-demand scheme and
forwards the packets in multiple paths which have been determined at the
source. If a link failure is detected, the algorithm recovers the route
automatically. Concerning the instability of the wireless networks, the
redundancy coding is used to improve the delivery ratio. The simulation in NS2
shows that the new protocol can effectively improve the performance of the
networks.
