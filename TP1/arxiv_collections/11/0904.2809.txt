We investigate the entanglement of assistance which quantifies capabilities
of producing pure bipartite entangled states from a pure tripartite state. The
lower bound and upper bound of entanglement of assistance are obtained. In the
light of the upper bound, monogamy constraints are proved for arbitrary n-qubit
states.
