We study fully occupied lattice systems of classical magnetic dipoles which
point along random axes. Only dipolar interactions are considered. From
tempered Monte Carlo simulations, we obtain numerical evidence that supports
the following conclusions: in three dimensions, (a) there is an equilibrium
spin glass phase at temperatures below $T_c$, where $k_BT_c= (0.86\pm
0.07)\varepsilon_d $ and $\varepsilon_d$ is a nearest neighbor dipole-dipole
interaction energy, (b) in the spin glass phase the overlap parameter is
approximately given by $\sqrt{1-T/T_c}$, and (c) the correlation length $\xi$
diverges at $T_c$ with a critical exponent $\nu =1.5\pm0.5$; in two dimensions
$\xi$ diverges at or near T=0 and $\nu=3\pm1$.
