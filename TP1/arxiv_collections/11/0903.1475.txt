Here we study how mutations which change physical properties of cell proteins
(stability) impact population survival and growth. In our model the genotype is
presented as a set of N numbers, folding free energies of cells N proteins.
Mutations occur upon replications so that stabilities of some proteins in
daughter cells differ from those in parent cell by random amounts drawn from
experimental distribution of mutational effects on protein stability. The
genotype-phenotype relationship posits that unstable proteins confer lethal
phenotype to a cell and in addition the cells fitness (duplication rate) is
proportional to the concentration of its folded proteins. Simulations reveal
that lethal mutagenesis occurs at mutation rates close to 7 mutations per
genome per replications for RNA viruses and about half of that for DNA based
organisms, in accord with earlier predictions from analytical theory and
experiment. This number appears somewhat dependent on the number of genes in
the organisms and natural death rate. Further, our model reproduces the
distribution of stabilities of natural proteins in excellent agreement with
experiment. Our model predicts that species with high mutation rates, tend to
have less stable proteins compared to species with low mutation rate.
