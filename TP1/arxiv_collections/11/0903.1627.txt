In 1938, Morse and Hedlund proved that the subword complexity function of an
infinite word is either bounded or at least linearly growing. In 1982,
Ehrenfeucht and Rozenberg proved that this gap property holds for the subword
complexity function of any language. The aim of the present paper is to present
a self-contained, compact proof of Ehrenfeucht and Rozenberg's result.
