We investigate the use of a non-degenerate parametric oscillator (NDPO) as a
source for quantum lithography, for which the light can have high-flux and
strong non-classical features. This builds on the proposal of Boto, et al. [A.
N. Boto, et al., PRL (85), 2733 (2000)], for etching simple patterns on
multi-photon absorbing materials with sub-Rayleigh resolution, using special
two-mode entangled states of light. An NDPO has two outgoing modes
differentiated by polarization or direction of propagation, but sharing the
same optical frequency. We derive analytical expressions for the multi-photon
absorption rates when the NDPO is operated below, near, and above its
threshold. The resulting interference patterns are characterized by an
effective wavelength half that for the illuminating modes. We compare our
results with those for the case of a high-gain optical amplifier source, and
discuss the relative merit of the NDPO.
