Electronic transport across n-Si-alkyl monolayer/Hg junctions is, at reverse
and low forward bias, independent of alkyl chain-length from 18 down to 1 or 2
carbons! This and further recent results indicate that electron transport is
minority, rather than majority carrier-dominated, occurs via generation and
recombination, rather than (the earlier assumed) thermionic emission and, as
such is rather insensitive to interface properties. The (m)ethyl results show
that binding organic molecules directly to semiconductors provides
semiconductor/metal interface control options, not accessible otherwise.
