There are several new features in production, oscillations and detection of
the atmospheric neutrinos of low energies, E<100 MeV. The flavor ratio, r, of
muon to electron neutrino fluxes is substantially smaller than 2 and decreases
with energy, significant part of events is due to the decay of invisible muons
at rest, etc. Oscillations in two-layer medium (atmosphere - earth) should be
taken into account. We derive analytical and semi-analytical expressions for
the oscillation probabilities of these "sub-subGeV" neutrinos. The energy
spectra of the e-like events in water cherenkov detectors are computed and
dependence of the spectra on the 2-3 mixing angle, the 1-3 mixing and
CP-violation phase are studied. We find that variations of 2-3 mixing angle in
the presently allowed region change the number of e-like events by about 15 -
20 % as well as to distortion of the energy spectrum. The 1-3 mixing and
CP-violation can lead to ~10% effects. Detailed study of the sub-subGeV
neutrinos will be possible in future Megaton-scale detectors.
