We report theoretical values for the unscreened plasma frequencies Omega_p of
several Fe pnictides obtained from DFT based calculations within the LDA and
compare them with experimental plasma frequencies obtained from reflectivity
data. The sizable renormalization observed for all considered compounds points
to the presence of many-body effects beyond the LDA. From the large empirical
background dielectric constant of about 12-15, we estimate a large arsenic
polarizability of about 9.5 +- 1.2 Angstroem^3 where the details depend on the
polarizabilities of the remaining ions taken from the literature. This large
polarizability can significantly reduce the value of the Coulomb repulsion U_d
about 4 eV on iron known from iron oxides to a level of 2 eV or below. In
general, this result points to rather strong polaronic effects as suggested by
G.A. Sawatzky et al., in Refs. arXiv:0808.1390 and arXiv:0811.0214 (Berciu et
al.). Possible consequences for the conditions of a formation of bipolarons are
discussed, too. From the extrapolated muon spin rotation penetration depth data
at T= 0 and the experimental Omega_p we estimate the total coupling constant
lambda_tot for the el-boson interaction within the Eliashberg-theory adopting a
single band approximation. For LaFeAsO_0.9F_0.1 a weak to intermediately strong
coupling regime and a quasi-clean limit behaviour are found. For a pronounced
multiband case we obtain a constraint for various intraband coupling constants
which in principle allows for a sizable strong coupling in bands with either
slow electrons or holes.
