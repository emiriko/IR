Let $A_i$ for $i=1, 2$ be an expansive dilation, respectively, on ${\mathbb
R}^n$ and ${\mathbb R}^m$ and $\vec A\equiv(A_1, A_2)$. Denote by ${\mathcal
A}_\infty(\rnm; \vec A)$ the class of Muckenhoupt weights associated with $\vec
A$. The authors introduce a class of anisotropic singular integrals on $\mathbb
R^n\times\mathbb R^m$, whose kernels are adapted to $\vec A$ in the sense of
Bownik and have vanishing moments defined via bump functions in the sense of
Stein. Then the authors establish the boundedness of these anisotropic singular
integrals on $L^q_w(\mathbb R^n\times\mathbb R^m)$ with $q\in(1, \infty)$ and
$w\in\mathcal A_q(\mathbb R^n\times\mathbb R^m; \vec A)$ or on $H^p_w(\mathbb
R^n\times\mathbb R^m; \vec A)$ with $p\in(0, 1]$ and $w\in\mathcal
A_\infty(\mathbb R^n \times\mathbb R^m; \vec A)$. These results are also new
even when $w=1$.
