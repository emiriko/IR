This note represents the further progress in understanding the determination
of the genetic code by Golden mean (Rakocevic, 1998). Three classes of amino
acids that follow from this determination (the 7 "golden" amino acids, 7 of
their complements, and 6 non-complements) are observed now together with two
further possible splittings into 4 x 5 and 5 x 4 amino acids.
