The hard X-ray synchrotron emission from pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) probes
energetic particles, closely related to the pulsar injection power at the
present time. INTEGRAL has disclosed the yet poorly known population of hard
X-ray pulsar/PWN systems. We summarize the properties of the class, with
emphasys on the first hard X-ray bow-shock (CTB 80 powered by PSR B1951+32),
and highlight some prospects for the study of Pulsar Wind Nebulae with the
Simbol-X mission.
