We express quantum computations (with measurements) using the arrow calculus
extended with monadic constructions. This framework expresses quantum
programming using well-understood and familiar classical patterns for
programming in the presence of computational effects. In addition, the five
laws of the arrow calculus provide a convenient framework for equational
reasoning about quantum computations that include measurements.
