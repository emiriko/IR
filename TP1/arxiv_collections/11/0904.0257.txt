We report on the vortex dynamics of a single crystal of the
non-centrosymmetric heavy-fermion superconductor CePt$_{3}$Si. Decays of the
remnant magnetization display a clean logarithmic time dependence with rates
that follow the temperature dependence expected from the Kim-Anderson theory.
The creep rates are lower than observed in any other centrosymmetric
superconductor and are not caused by high critical currents. On the contrary,
the critical current in CePt$_{3}$Si is considerably lower than in other
superconductors with strong vortex pinning indicating that an alternative
impediment on the flux line motion might be at work in this superconductor.
