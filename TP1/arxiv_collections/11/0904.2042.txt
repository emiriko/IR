The anomaly cancelation method proposed by Wilczek et al. is applied to the
black holes of topologically massive gravity (TMG) and topologically massive
gravito-electrodynamics (TMGE). Thus the Hawking temperature and fluxes of the
ACL and ACGL black holes are found. The Hawking temperatures obtained agree
with the surface gravity formula. Both black holes are rotating and this gives
rise to appropriate terms in the effective U(1) gauge field of the reduced
(1+1)-dimensional theory. It is found that the terms in this U(1) gauge field
correspond exactly to the correct angular velocities on the horizon of both
black holes as well as the correct electrostatic potential of the ACGL black
hole. So the results for the Hawking fluxes derived here from the anomaly
cancelation method, are in complete agreement with the ones obtained from
integrating the Planck distribution.
