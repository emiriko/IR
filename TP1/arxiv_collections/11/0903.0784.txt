We analyze the quantum ground state structure of a specific model of
itinerant, strongly interacting lattice fermions. The interactions are tuned to
make the model supersymmetric. Due to this, quantum ground states are in
one-to-one correspondence with cohomology classes of the so-called independence
complex of the lattice. Our main result is a complete description of the
cohomology, and thereby of the quantum ground states, for a two-dimensional
square lattice with periodic boundary conditions. Our work builds on results by
J. Jonsson, who determined the Euler characteristic (Witten index) via a
correspondence with rhombus tilings of the plane. We prove a theorem, first
conjectured by P. Fendley, which relates dimensions of the cohomology at grade
n to the number of rhombus tilings with n rhombi.
