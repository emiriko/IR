If new CP violating physics contributes to neutral meson mixing, but its
contribution to CP violation in decay amplitudes is negligible, then there is a
model independent relation between four (generally independent) observables
related to the mixing: The mass splitting (x), the width splitting (y), the CP
violation in mixing (1-|q/p|), and the CP violation in the interference of
decays with and without mixing (\phi). For the four neutral meson systems, this
relation can be written in a simple approximate form: y tan\phi ~ x(|q/p|-1).
This relation is already tested (successfully) in the neutral K system. It
provides predictions for the B_s and D systems. The success or failure of these
relations will probe the physics that is responsible for the CP violation.
