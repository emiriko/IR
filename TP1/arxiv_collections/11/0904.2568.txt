This paper describes the MegaPipe image processing pipeline at the Canadian
Astronomical Data Centre (CADC). The pipeline takes multiple images from the
MegaCam mosaic camera on CFHT and combines them into a single output image.
MegaPipe takes as input detrended MegaCam images and does a careful astrometric
and photometric calibration on them. The calibrated images are then resampled
and combined into image stacks. MegaPipe is run on PI data by request, data
from large surveys (the CFHT Legacy Survey and the Next Generation Virgo
Survey) and all non-proprietary MegaCam data in the CFHT archive. The stacked
images and catalogs derived from these images are available through the CADC
website. Currently, 1500 square degrees have been processed.
