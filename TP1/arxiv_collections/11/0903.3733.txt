We describe a hybrid evolutionary algorithm that can simultaneously search
for multiple supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) inspirals in LISA data. The
algorithm mixes evolutionary computation, Metropolis-Hastings methods and
Nested Sampling. The inspiral of SMBHBs presents an interesting problem for
gravitational wave data analysis since, due to the LISA response function, the
sources have a bi-modal sky solution. We show here that it is possible not only
to detect multiple SMBHBs in the data stream, but also to investigate
simultaneously all the various modes of the global solution. In all cases, the
algorithm returns parameter determinations within $5\sigma$ (as estimated from
the Fisher Matrix) of the true answer, for both the actual and antipodal sky
solutions.
