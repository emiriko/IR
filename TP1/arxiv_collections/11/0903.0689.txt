Polarized neutron diffraction experiments have been performed on multiferroic
materials $R$Mn$_{2}$O$_{5}$ ($R=$Ho, Er) under electric fields in the
ferroelectric commensurate (CM) and the low-temperature incommensurate (LT-ICM)
phases, where the former has the highest electric polarization and the latter
has reduced polarization. It is found that, after cooling in electric fields
down to the CM phase, the magnetic chirality is proportional to the electric
polarization. Also we confirmed that the magnetic chirality can be switched by
the polarity of the electric polarization in both the CM and LT-ICM phases.
These facts suggest an intimate coupling between the magnetic chirality and the
electric polarization. However, upon the transition from the CM to LT-ICM
phase, the reduction of the electric polarization is not accompanied by any
reduction of the magnetic chirality, implying that the CM and LT-ICM phases
contain different mechanisms of the magnetoelectric coupling.
