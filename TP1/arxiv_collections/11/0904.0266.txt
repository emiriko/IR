Using an [OIII]5007 on-band/off-band filter technique, we identify 109
planetary nebulae (PNe) candidates in M 82, using the FOCAS instrument at the
8.2m Subaru Telescope. The use of ancillary high-resolution HST ACS H-alpha
imaging aided in discriminating PNe from contaminants such as supernova
remnants and compact HII regions. Once identified, these PNe reveal a great
deal about the host galaxy; our analysis covers kinematics, stellar
distribution, and distance determination. Radial velocities were determined for
94 of these PNe using a method of slitless spectroscopy, from which we obtain a
clear picture of the galaxy's rotation. Overall, our results agree with those
derived by CO(2-1) and HI measurements that show a falling, near-Keplerian
rotation curve. However, we find a subset of our PNe that appear to lie far
above the plane (~1 kpc), yet these objects appear to be rotating as fast as
objects close to the plane. These objects will require further study to
determine if they are members of a halo population, or if they can be
interpreted as a manifestation of a thickened disk as a consequence of a past
interaction with M 81. In addition, [OIII]5007 emission line photometry of the
PNe allows the construction of a planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF).
Our PNLF distance determination for M 82 yields a larger distance than those
derived using the TRGB, using Cepheid variable stars in nearby group member M
81, or using the PNLF of M 81. We show that this inconsistency most likely
stems from our inability to completely correct for internal extinction imparted
by this dusty, starburst galaxy. (Abridged)
