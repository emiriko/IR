Direct photons are important probes in high energy collisions. They play an
important role in determining the parton distribution function directly inside
a proton as well as the nature of the matter formed in heavy ion collisions.
However fragmentation photons play the role of prominent background in
identifying the direct photons. In the present work we developed a new method
based on the transverse energy balance of jets for enrichment of direct photon
candidates in pp collisions. This method can reject 35% of the background
photons (fragmentation) which can not be suppressed by isolation. Efficiency of
detection of direct photon decrease by 10% in the method.
