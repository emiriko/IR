We analyze the full counting statistics (FCS) of a single-site quantum dot
coupled to a local Holstein phonon for arbitrary transmission and weak
electron-phonon coupling. We identify explicitly the contributions due to
quasielastic and inelastic transport processes in the cumulant generating
function and discuss their influence on the transport properties of the dot. We
find that in the low-energy sector, the inelastic term causes a sign change in
the shot noise correction at certain universal values of the transmission.
Furthermore, we show that when the correction to the current due to inelastic
processes vanishes, all odd order cumulants vanish as well.
