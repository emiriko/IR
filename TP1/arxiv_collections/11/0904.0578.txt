This paper describes a resolution based Description Logic reasoning system
called DLog. DLog transforms Description Logic axioms into a Prolog program and
uses the standard Prolog execution for efficiently answering instance retrieval
queries. From the Description Logic point of view, DLog is an ABox reasoning
engine for the full SHIQ language. The DLog approach makes it possible to store
the individuals in a database instead of memory, which results in better
scalability and helps using description logic ontologies directly on top of
existing information sources.
