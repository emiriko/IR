By performing a derivative expansion on a class of boosted Born-Infeld-AdS_5
black branes, we study the hydrodynamics of the dual field theory - in the
spirit of AdS/CFT correspondence. We determine the fluid dynamical
stress-energy tensor to first order, and find that the ratio of the shear
viscosity to entropy density conforms to the universal value of $1/4\pi$ to all
orders of the inverse of the Born-Infeld parameter.
