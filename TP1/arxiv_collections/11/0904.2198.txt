We study spin and charge currents pumped by precessing magnetization of a
single ferromagnetic layer within F|I|N or F|I|F (F-ferromagnet; I-insulator;
N-normal-metal) multilayers of nanoscale thickness attached to two normal metal
electrodes with no applied bias voltage between them. Both simple
one-dimensional model, consisting of a single precessing spin and a potential
barrier as the "sample," and realistic three-dimensional devices are
investigated. In the rotating reference frame, where the magnetization appears
to be static, these junctions are mapped onto a four-terminal dc circuit whose
effectively half-metallic ferromagnetic electrodes are biased by the frequency
$\hbar \omega/e$ of microwave radiation driving magnetization precession at the
ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) conditions. We show that pumped spin current in
F|I|F junctions, diminished behind the tunnel barrier and increased in the
opposite direction, is filtered into charge current by the second $F$ layer to
generate dc pumping voltage of the order of $\sim 1$ $\mu$V (at FMR frequency
$\sim 10$ GHz) in an open circuit. In F|I|N devices, several orders of
magnitude smaller charge current and the corresponding dc voltage appear
concomitantly with the pumped spin current due to barrier induced asymmetry in
the transmission coefficients connecting the four electrodes in the rotating
frame picture of pumping.
