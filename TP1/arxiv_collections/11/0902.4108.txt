Numerous phenomenological parallels have been drawn between f- and d-
electron systems in an attempt to understand their display of unconventional
superconductivity. The microscopics of how electrons evolve from participation
in large moment antiferromagnetism to superconductivity in these systems,
however, remains a mystery. Knowing the origin of Cooper paired electrons in
momentum space is a crucial prerequisite for understanding the pairing
mechanism. Of especial interest are pressure-induced superconductors CeIn3 and
CeRhIn5 in which disparate magnetic and superconducting orders apparently
coexist - arising from within the same f-electron degrees of freedom. Here we
present ambient pressure quantum oscillation measurements on CeIn3 that
crucially identify the electronic structure - potentially similar to high
temperature superconductors. Heavy pockets of f-character are revealed in
CeIn3, undergoing an unexpected effective mass divergence well before the
antiferromagnetic critical field. We thus uncover the softening of a branch of
quasiparticle excitations located away from the traditional spin-fluctuation
dominated antiferromagnetic quantum critical point. The observed Fermi surface
of dispersive f-electrons in CeIn3 could potentially explain the emergence of
Cooper pairs from within a strong moment antiferromagnet.
