We offer a solution to a long-standing problem in the physics of networks,
the creation of a plausible, solvable model of a network that displays
clustering or transitivity -- the propensity for two neighbors of a network
node also to be neighbors of one another. We show how standard random graph
models can be generalized to incorporate clustering and give exact solutions
for various properties of the resulting networks, including sizes of network
components, size of the giant component if there is one, position of the phase
transition at which the giant component forms, and position of the phase
transition for percolation on the network.
