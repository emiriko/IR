Clusters of galaxies provide a closed box within which one can determine the
chemical evolution of the gaseous baryons with cosmic time. We studied this
metallicity evolution in the hot X-ray emitting baryons through an analysis of
XMM-Newton observations of 29 galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.3 < z <
1.3. Taken alone, this data set does not show evidence for significant
evolution. However, when we also include a comparable sample of 115 clusters
observed with Chandra (Maughan et al. 2008) and a lower redshift sample of 70
clusters observed with XMM at z < 0.3 (Snowden et al. 2008), there is
definitive evidence for a decrease in the metallicity. This decrease is
approximately a factor of two from z = 0 to z \approx 1, over which we find a
least-squares best-fit line Z(z) / Z_{\odot} = (0.46 \pm 0.05) - (0.38 \pm
0.03)z. The greatest uncertainty in the evolution comes from poorly constrained
metallicities in the highest redshift bin.
