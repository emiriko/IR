We show that using mid-IR color selection to find active galactic nuclei
(AGN) is as effective in dense stellar fields such as the Magellanic Clouds as
it is in extragalactic fields with low stellar densities using comparisons
between the Spitzer Deep, Wide-Field Survey data for the NOAO Deep Wide Field
Survey Bootes region and the SAGE Survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We use
this to build high purity catalogs of ~ 5000 AGN candidates behind the
Magellanic Clouds. Once confirmed, these quasars will expand the available
astrometric reference sources for the Clouds and the numbers of quasars with
densely sampled, long-term (>decade) monitoring light curves by well over an
order of magnitude and potentially identify sufficiently bright quasars for
absorption line studies of the interstellar medium of the Clouds.
