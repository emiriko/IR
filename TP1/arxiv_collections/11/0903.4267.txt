The semantic technologies pose new challenge for the way in which we built
and operate systems. They are tools used to represent significances,
associations, theories, separated from data and code. Their goal is to create,
to discover, to represent, to organize, to process, to manage, to ratiocinate,
to represent, to share and use the significances and knowledge to fulfill the
business, personal or social goals.
