Point source searches with neutrino telescopes like IceCube are normally
restricted to one hemisphere, due to the selection of up-going events as a way
of rejecting the atmospheric muon background. In this work we show that the
down-going region above the horizon can be included in the search by
suppressing the background through energy-sensitive selection procedures. This
approach increases the reach to the EeV regime of the signal spectrum, which
was previously not accessible due to the absorption of neutrinos with energies
above a PeV inside the Earth. We present preliminary results of this analysis,
which for the first time includes up-going as well as down-going muon events in
a combined approach. We used data collected with IceCube in a configuration of
22 strings. No significant excess above the atmospheric background is observed.
While other analyses provided results for the Northern hemisphere, this new
approach extends the field of view to a large part of the Southern sky, which
was previously not covered with IceCube.
