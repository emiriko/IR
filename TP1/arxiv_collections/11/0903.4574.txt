We present a complete derivation of two-particle states of the
one-dimensional extended Hubbard model involving attractive or repulsive
on-site and nearest-neighbour interactions. We find that this system possesses
scattering resonances and two families of energy-dependent interaction-bound
states which are not present in the Hubbard model with the on-site interaction
alone.
