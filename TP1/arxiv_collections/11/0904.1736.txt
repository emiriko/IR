We prove a Weyl-type fractal upper bound for the spectrum of the damped wave
equation, on a negatively curved compact manifold. It is known that most of the
eigenvalues have an imaginary part close to the average of the damping
function. We count the number of eigenvalues in a given horizontal strip
deviating from this typical behaviour; the exponent that appears naturally is
the `entropy' that gives the deviation rate from the Birkhoff ergodic theorem
for the geodesic flow. A Weyl-type lower bound is still far from reach; but in
the particular case of arithmetic surfaces, and for a strong enough damping, we
can use the trace formula to prove a result going in this direction.
