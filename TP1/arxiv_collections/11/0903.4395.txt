A specific theoretical framework is important for designing and conducting an
experiment, and for interpretation of its results. The field of gravitational
physics is expanding, and more clarity is needed. It appears that some popular
notions, such as `inflation' and `gravity is geometry', have become more like
liabilities than assets. A critical analysis is presented and the ways out of
the difficulties are proposed.
