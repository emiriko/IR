We give a pedagogical introduction into an old, but unfortunately not
commonly known formulation of GR in terms of self-dual two-forms due to in
particular Jerzy Plebanski. Our presentation is rather explicit in that we show
how the familiar textbook solutions: Schwarzschild, Volkoff-Oppenheimer, as
well as those describing the Newtonian limit, a gravitational wave and the
homogeneous isotropic Universe can be obtained within this formalism. Our
description shows how Plebanski formulation gives quite an economical
alternative to the usual metric and frame-based schemes for deriving Einstein
equations.
