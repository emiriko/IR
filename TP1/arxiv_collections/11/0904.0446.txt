A GOES-West (GOES-11) imager microburst algorithm that employs brightness
temperature differences between band 3, band 4, and split window band 5 has
been developed to supplement the sounder-derived microburst products. Band 3 is
intended to indicate mid to upper-level moisture content and advection while
band 5 indicates low-level moisture content. Large BTDs between bands 3 and 5
imply a large relative humidity gradient between the mid-troposphere and the
surface, a condition favorable for strong convective downdraft generation due
to evaporational cooling of precipitation in the deep sub-cloud layer. In
addition, small BTDs between bands 4 and 5 indicate a relatively dry surface
layer with solar heating in progress. This paper provides further assessment of
the GOES imager microburst product, case studies demonstrating effective
operational use of the microburst products, and validation results for the 2008
convective season over Arizona.
