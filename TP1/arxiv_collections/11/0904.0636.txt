This unit describes strategies for studying the proteomes of organelles,
which is one example of targeted proteomics. It relies heavily on previously
published units dealing with organelle preparation, protein solubilization, and
proteomics techniques. A specific commentary for organelle proteomics is
provided. Specific protocols for the isolation of nuclei from various sources
(cell cultures, tissues) are also provided.
