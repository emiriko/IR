Calculations of the pairing interaction in multi-band models of the Fe
superconductors show that it is attractive in both the $A_{1g}$ (s-wave) and
$B_{1g}$ (d-wave) channels. This raises the possibility that these materials
may have collective excitonic modes. Here, assuming an s-wave groundstate, we
investigate the d-wave collective excitonic mode and its coupling to the Raman
scattering.
