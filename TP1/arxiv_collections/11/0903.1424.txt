We consider the transfer of quantum information down a single-mode quantum
transmission line. Such quantum channel is modeled as a damped harmonic
oscillator, the interaction between the information carriers -a train of N
qubits- and the oscillator being of the Jaynes-Cummings kind. Memory effects
appear if the state of the oscillator is not reset after each channel use. We
show that the setup without resetting is convenient in order to increase the
transmission rates, both for the transfer of quantum and classical private
information. Our results can be applied to the micromaser.
