2008 marks the 100th anniversary of the discovery of astrophysical magnetic
fields, when George Ellery Hale recorded the Zeeman splitting of spectral lines
in sunspots. With the introduction of Babcock's photoelectric magnetograph it
soon became clear that the Sun's magnetic field outside sunspots is extremely
structured. The field strengths that were measured were found to get larger
when the spatial resolution was improved. It was therefore necessary to come up
with methods to go beyond the spatial resolution limit and diagnose the
intrinsic magnetic-field properties without dependence on the quality of the
telescope used. The line-ratio technique that was developed in the early 1970s
revealed a picture where most flux that we see in magnetograms originates in
highly bundled, kG fields with a tiny volume filling factor. This led to
interpretations in terms of discrete, strong-field magnetic flux tubes embedded
in a rather field-free medium, and a whole industry of flux tube models at
increasing levels of sophistication. This magnetic-field paradigm has now been
shattered with the advent of high-precision imaging polarimeters that allow us
to apply the so-called "Second Solar Spectrum" to diagnose aspects of solar
magnetism that have been hidden to Zeeman diagnostics. It is found that the
bulk of the photospheric volume is seething with intermediately strong, tangled
fields. In the new paradigm the field behaves like a fractal with a high degree
of self-similarity, spanning about 8 orders of magnitude in scale size, down to
scales of order 10 m.
