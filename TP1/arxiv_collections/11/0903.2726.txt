We present results of deep 150 MHz observations with the GMRT which show
several extended radio sources with a range of morphologies. These sources have
then further followed up at higher frequencies (610 and 1400 MHz) with the
GMRT. GMRT J0137+4121 was a candidate double--double radio galaxy for which we
have also used the VLA-A array at C band to resolve the core. These
observations have allowed us to determine that this source is a normal radio
galaxy with a core and a one sided jet. Prominent amongst the other extended
sources is the giant radio galaxy, 4C39.04.
