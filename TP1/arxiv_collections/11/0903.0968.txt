Parametric excitation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can be realized by
periodically changing the interaction strength between the atoms. Above some
threshold strength, this excitation modulates the condensate density. We show
that when the condensate is trapped in a potential well of irregular shape,
density waves can be strongly concentrated ("scarred") along the shortest
periodic orbits of a classical particle moving within the confining potential.
While single-particle wave functions of systems whose classical counterpart is
chaotic may exhibit rich scarring patterns, in BEC, we show that nonlinear
effects select mainly those scars that are locally described by stripes.
Typically, these are the scars associated with self retracing periodic orbits
that do not cross themselves in real space. Dephasing enhances this behavior by
reducing the nonlocal effect of interference.
