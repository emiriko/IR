Experimental signals of non-linear magneto-optical resonances at D1
excitation of natural rubidium in a vapor cell have been obtained and described
with experimental accuracy by a detailed theoretical model based on the optical
Bloch equations. The D1 transition of rubidium is a challenging system to
analyze theoretically because it contains transitions that are only partially
resolved under Doppler broadening. The theoretical model took into account all
nearby transitions, the coherence properties of the exciting laser radiation,
and the mixing of magnetic sublevels in an external magnetic field and also
included averaging over the Doppler profile. Great care was taken to obtain
accurate experimental signals and avoid systematic errors. The experimental
signals were reproduced very well at each hyperfine transition and over a wide
range of laser power densities, beam diameters, and laser detunings from the
exact transition frequency. The bright resonance expected at the F_g=1 -->
F_e=2 transition of Rb-87 has been observed. A bright resonance was observed at
the F_g=2 --> F_e=3 transition of Rb-85, but displaced from the exact position
of the transition due to the influence of the nearby F_g=2 --> F_e=2
transition, which is a dark resonance whose contrast is almost two orders of
magnitude larger than the contrast of the bright resonance at the F_g=2 -->
F_e=3 transition. Even in this very delicate situation, the theoretical model
described in detail the experimental signals at different laser detunings.
