We show that our recently published Arithmetic Model of the genetic code
based on Godel Encoding is robust against symmetry transformations, specially
Rumer s one U > G, A > C, and constitutes a link between the degeneracy
structure and the chemical composition of the 20 canonical amino acids. As a
result, several remarkable atomic patterns involving hydrogen, carbon, nucleon
and atom numbers are derived. This study has no obvious practical
application(s) but could, we hope, add some new knowledge concerning the
physico-mathematical structrure of the genetic code.
