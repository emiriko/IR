We experimentally and theoretically analyze the propagation of weak signal
field pulses under the conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) in hot Rb vapor, and study the effects of resonant four-wave mixing
(FWM). In particular, we demonstrate that in a double-$\Lambda$ system, formed
by the strong control field with the weak resonant signal and a far-detuned
Stokes field, both continuous-wave spectra and pulse propagation dynamics for
the signal field depend strongly on the amplitude of the seeded Stokes field,
and the effect is enhanced in optically dense atomic medium. We also show that
the theory describing the coupled propagation of the signal and Stokes fields
is in good agreement with the experimental observations.
