Photons cannot be localized in a sharply defined region. The expectation
value of their energy density and the photon number density can only be
approximately localized, leaving an exponential tail. We show that one may
sharply localize either electric or magnetic (but not both) footprints of
photons, and only momentarily. In the course of time evolution this
localization is immediately destroyed. However, the coherent states, like their
classical counterparts, can be localized without any limitations. The main tool
in our analysis is a set of space-dependent photon creation and annihilation
operators defined without any reference to the mode decomposition.
