We present an update of our calculations of the decay constants of the D,
D_s, B, and B_s mesons in unquenched 2+1 flavor QCD. We use the MILC library of
improved staggered gauge ensembles at lattice spacings 0.09, 0.12, and 0.15 fm,
clover heavy quarks with the Fermilab normalizations, and improved staggered
light valence quarks.
