In this paper we propose to associate a temporal two-component wave-function
to the decay process of meson particles. This simple quantum model provides a
good estimation of the CP symmetry violation parameter. This result is based on
our previous paper ("Two-Level Friedrichs model and Kaonic phenomenology",
Physics Letters A 362, 100-104 (2007)) where we have shown that the two-level
Friedrichs Hamiltonian model makes it possible to provide a qualitatively
correct phenomenological model of kaons physics. In this previous paper, we
derived a violation parameter that is 14 times larger than the measured
quantity. In the present paper we improve our estimation of the violation and
obtain the right order of magnitude. The improvement results from a
renormalized superposition of the probability amplitudes describing short and
long exponential decays. The renormalization occurs because the amplitudes that
we are dealing with are associated to the decay rate, and not to the integrated
decay rate or survival probability as is usually the case in standard
approaches to CP-violation. We also compare with recent experimental data for
the mesons D and B and also there the agreement between our model and
experimental data is quite satisfying.
