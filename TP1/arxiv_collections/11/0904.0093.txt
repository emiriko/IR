Within the framework of the kinetic energy driven superconductivity, the
electromagnetic response in cuprate superconductors is studied in the linear
response approach. The kernel of the response function is evaluated and
employed to calculate the local magnetic field profile, the magnetic field
penetration depth, and the superfluid density, based on the specular reflection
model for a purely transverse vector potential. It is shown that the low
temperature magnetic field profile follows an exponential decay at the surface,
while the magnetic field penetration depth depends linearly on temperature,
except for the strong deviation from the linear characteristics at extremely
low temperatures. The superfluid density is found to decrease linearly with
decreasing doping concentration in the underdoped regime. The problem of gauge
invariance is addressed and an approximation for the dressed current vertex,
which does not violate local charge conservation is proposed and discussed.
