Ratio-dependent predator-prey models have been increasingly favored by field
ecologists where predator-prey interactions have to be taken into account the
process of predation search. In this paper we study the conditions of the
existence and stability properties of the equilibrium solutions in a
reaction-diffusion model in which predator mortality is neither a constant nor
an unbounded function, but it is increasing with the predator abundance. We
show that analytically at a certain critical value a diffusion driven (Turing
type) instability occurs, i.e. the stationary solution stays stable with
respect to the kinetic system (the system without diffusion). We also show that
the stationary solution becomes unstable with respect to the system with
diffusion and that Turing bifurcation takes place: a spatially non-homogenous
(non-constant) solution (structure or pattern) arises. A numerical scheme that
preserve the positivity of the numerical solutions and the boundedness of prey
solution will be presented. Numerical examples are also included.
