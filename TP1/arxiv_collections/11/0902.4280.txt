We have performed an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study
of Nd$_{1.85}$Ce$_{0.15}$CuO$_{4}$ (NCCO) in order to elucidate the origin of
the high-energy kink (HEK) observed in the high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductors
(HTSCs). The energy scale of the HEK in NCCO is large compared with that in
hole-doped HTSCs, consistent with previous ARPES studies. From measurement in a
wide momentum region, we have demonstrated that between the hole- and
electron-doped HTSCs the energy position of the HEK is shifted approximately by
the amount of the chemical potential difference. Also, we have found that
around $(\pi, 0)$ the HEK nearly coincides with the band bottom while around
the node the band reaches the incoherent region and the HEK appears at the
boundary between the coherent and incoherent regions.
