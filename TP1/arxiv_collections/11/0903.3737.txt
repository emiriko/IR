We discuss the relation between the treatments of the higher twist nuclear
effects in eA DIS based on the pQCD collinear approximation and the light-cone
path integral formalism. We show that in the collinear approximation the N=1
rescattering contribution to the gluon emission vanishes. It is demonstrated
that the nonzero gluon spectrum obtained by Guo, Wang and Zhang is a
consequence of unjustified neglect of some terms in the collinear expansion.
