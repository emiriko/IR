Using one-range addition theorems for noninteger n Slater type orbitals and
Coulomb-Yukawa like correlated interaction potentials with noninteger indices
obtained by the author with the help of complete orthonormal sets of
exponential type orbitals, the series of expansion formulas are established for
the potential produced by molecule, and the potential energy of interaction
between molecules through the radius vectors of nuclei of molecules, and the
linear combination coefficients of molecular orbitals. The formulae obtained
are useful especially for the study of interaction between atomic-molecular
systems containing any number of closed and open shells when the
Hartree-Fock-Roothaan and explicitly correlated methods are employed. The
relationships obtained are valid for the arbitrary values of indices and
screening constants of orbitals and correlated interaction potentials.
