We offer a new proof of Furstenberg and Katznelson's density version of the
Hales-Jewett Theorem:
  For any $\delta > 0$ there is some $N_0 \geq 1$ such that whenever $A
\subseteq [k]^N$ with $N \geq N_0$ and $|A|\geq \delta k^N$, $A$ contains a
\textbf{combinatorial line}: that is, for some $I \subseteq [N]$ nonempty and
$w_0 \in [k]^{[N]\setminus I}$ we have
  A \supseteq \{w: w|_{[N]\setminus I} = w_0, w|_I = \rm{const.}\}.
  Following Furstenberg and Katznelson, we first show that this result is
equivalent to a `multiple recurrence' assertion for a class of probability
measures enjoying a certain kind of stationarity. However, we then give a quite
different proof of this latter assertion through a reduction to an infinitary
removal lemma in the spirit of Tao's work on infinite random hypergraphs (and
also its recent re-interpretation in a new proof of the multidimensional
Szemeredi Theorem by the present author). This reduction is based on a
structural analysis of these stationary laws closely analogous to the classical
representation theorems for various partial exchangeable stochastic processes
in the sense of Hoover, Aldous and Kallenberg. However, the underlying
combinatorial arguments used to prove this theorem are rather different from
those required to work with exchangeable arrays, and involve crucially an
observation that arose during ongoing work by a collaborative team of authors
to give a purely finitary proof of the above theorem.
