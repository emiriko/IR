The current status of the Standard Model predictions for the muon anomalous
magnetic moment is described. Various contributions expected in the Standard
Model are discussed. After the reevaluation of the leading-order hadronic term
based on the new \ep data, the theoretical prediction is more than three
standard deviations lower than the experimental value.
