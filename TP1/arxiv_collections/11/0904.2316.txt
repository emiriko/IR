We study the supremum of random Dirichlet polynomials
$D_N(t)=\sum_{n=1}^N\varepsilon_n d(n) n^{- s}$, where $(\varepsilon_n)$ is a
sequence of independent Rademacher random variables, and $ d $ is a
sub-multiplicative function. The approach is gaussian and entirely based on
comparison properties of Gaussian processes, with no use of the metric entropy
method.
