We investigate a mechanism for spontaneous R-parity breaking in a class of
extensions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with an extra Abelian
gauge symmetry which is a linear combination of B-L and weak hypercharge. Both
U(1)_X and R-parity are broken by the vacuum expectation value of the
right-handed sneutrinos which is proportional to the soft SUSY masses. In these
models the mechanism for spontaneous R-parity violation can be realized even
with positive soft masses. In this context one has a realistic mechanism for
generating neutrino masses as well as a realistic spectrum. We briefly discuss
the possible collider signals which could be used to test the theory, the
contributions for proton decay and the possibility of a gravitino as a dark
matter candidate.
