The elliptic genera of the K3 surfaces, both compact and non-compact cases,
are studied by using the theory of mock theta functions. We decompose the
elliptic genus in terms of the N=4 superconformal characters at level-1, and
present an exact formula for the coefficients of the massive (non-BPS)
representations using the Poincare-Maass series.
