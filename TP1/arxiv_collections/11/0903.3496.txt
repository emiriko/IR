In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. B 78, 113407 (2008)], Poncharal et al. studied
the Raman spectra of misoriented bilayer graphene. They found that the
blueshift of 2D band of misoriented graphene relative to that of single layer
graphene shows a strong dependence on the excitation laser energy. The
blueshift increases with decreasing excitation energy. This finding contradicts
our explanation of reduction of Fermi velocity of folded/misoriented graphene
[Ni et al. Phys. Rev. B 77, 235403 (2008)]. In this comment, we present more
experimental results from our group as well as from others to show that the
blueshift is indeed only weakly dependent on excitation energy. We therefore
suggest that our explanation of 2D blushift of folded graphene due to reduction
of Fermi velocity is still valid.
