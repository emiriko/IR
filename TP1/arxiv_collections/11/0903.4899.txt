Experiments by several groups during the past decade have shown that a molten
polymer nanofilm subject to a large transverse thermal gradient undergoes
spontaneous formation of periodic nanopillar arrays. The prevailing explanation
is that coherent reflections of acoustic phonons within the film cause a
periodic modulation of the radiation pressure which enhances pillar growth. By
exploring a deformational instability of particular relevance to nanofilms, we
demonstrate that thermocapillary forces play a crucial role in the formation
process. Analytic and numerical predictions show good agreement with the pillar
spacings obtained in experiment. Simulations of the interface equation further
determine the rate of pillar growth of importance to technological
applications.
