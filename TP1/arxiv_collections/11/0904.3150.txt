The mechanism of spin-pumping, described by Tserkovnyak et al., is formally
analyzed in the general case of a magnetic multilayer consisting of two or more
metallic ferromagnetic (FM) films separated by normal metal (NM) layers. It is
shown that the spin-pumping-induced dynamic coupling between FM layers modifies
the linearized Gilbert equations in a way that replaces the scalar Gilbert
damping constant with a nonlocal matrix of Cartesian damping tensors. The
latter are shown to be methodically calculable from a matrix algebra solution
of the Valet-Fert transport equations. As an example, explicit analytical
results are obtained for a 5-layer (spin-valve) of form NM/FM/NM'/FM/NM.
Comparisons with earlier well known results of Tserkovnyak et al. for the
related 3-layer FM/NM/FM indicate that the latter inadvertently hid the tensor
character of the damping, and instead singled out the diagonal element of the
local damping tensor along the axis normal to the plane of the two
magnetization vectors. For spin-valve devices of technological interest, the
influence of the tensor components of the damping on thermal noise or
spin-torque critical currents are strongly weighted by the relative magnitude
of the elements of the nonlocal, anisotropic stiffness-field tensor-matrix, and
for in-plane magnetized spin-valves are generally more sensitive to the
in-plane element of the damping tensor.
