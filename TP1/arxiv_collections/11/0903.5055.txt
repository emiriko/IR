We report results from a search for strangelets (small chunks of Strange
Quark Matter) in lunar soil using the Yale WNSL accelerator as a mass
spectrometer. We have searched over a range in mass from A=42 to A=70 amu for
nuclear charges 5, 6, 8, 9, and 11. No strangelets were found in the
experiment. For strangelets with nuclear charge 8, a concentration in lunar
soil higher than $10^{-16}$ is excluded at the 95% confidence level. The
implied limit on the strangelet flux in cosmic rays is the most sensitive to
date for the covered range and is relevant to both recent theoretical flux
predictions and a strangelet candidate event found by the AMS-01 experiment.
