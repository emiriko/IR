We study the reduced fidelity between local states of lattice systems
exhibiting topological order. By exploiting mappings to spin models with
classical order, we are able to analytically extract the scaling behavior of
the reduced fidelity at the corresponding quantum phase transitions out of the
topologically ordered phases. Our results suggest that the reduced fidelity,
albeit being a local measure, generically serves as a faithful marker of a
topological quantum phase transition.
