We prove the Bisognano-Wichmann and CPT theorems for massive particles
obeying braid group statistics in three-dimensional Minkowski space. We start
from first principles of local relativistic quantum theory, assuming Poincare
covariance and asymptotic completeness. The particle masses must be isolated
points in the mass spectra of the corresponding charged sectors, and may only
be finitely degenerate.
