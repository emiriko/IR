The characterization and conditional preparation of multi-photon quantum
states requires the use of photon number resolving detectors. We study the use
of detectors based on multiple avalanche photodiode pixels in this context. We
develop a general model that provides the positive operator value measures for
these detectors. The model incorporates the effect of cross-talk between pixels
which is unique to these devices. We validate the model by measuring coherent
state photon number distributions and reconstructing them with high precision.
Finally, we evaluate the suitability of such detectors for quantum state
tomography and entanglement-based quantum state preparation, highlighting the
effects of dark counts and cross-talk between pixels.
