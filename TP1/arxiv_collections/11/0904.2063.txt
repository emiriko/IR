The Elko field of Ahluwalia and Grumiller is a quantum field for massive
spin-1/2 particles. It has been suggested as a candidate for dark matter. We
discuss our attempts to interpret the Elko field as a quantum field in the
sense of Weinberg. Our work suggests that one should investigate quantum fields
based on representations of the full Poincar\'e group which belong to one of
the non-standard Wigner classes.
