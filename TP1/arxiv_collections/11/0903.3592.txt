We report a novel class of polymer nanocomposite composed of organic
nanoparticles dispersed in polymer matrix, with the particle sizes of 30-120 nm
in radius. The organic nanoparticles were formed by the self-assembly of
protonated poly(4-vinyl-pyridine)-r-poly(acrylonitrile) and amphiphilic metanil
yellow dye molecules through electrostatic interactions in aqueous solution. A
strongly broadened Raman shift band was probed, suggesting the presence of
enhanced optoelectronic property from the polymer nanocomposite. Here, using
random-copolymer polyelectrolytes and mesogenic amphiphiles as the designed
building blocks for self-assembly, a new approach is acutally provided to
fabricate organic nanoparticles.
