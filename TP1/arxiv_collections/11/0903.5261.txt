A new framework for deriving equations of motion for constrained quantum
systems is introduced, and a procedure for its implementation is outlined. In
special cases the framework reduces to a quantum analogue of the Dirac theory
of constrains in classical mechanics. Explicit examples involving spin-1/2
particles are worked out in detail: in one example our approach coincides with
a quantum version of the Dirac formalism, while the other example illustrates
how a situation that cannot be treated by Dirac's approach can nevertheless be
dealt with in the present scheme.
