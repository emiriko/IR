The antiferromagnetic molecular wheel Fe18 of eighteen exchange-coupled
Fe(III) ions has been studied by measurements of the magnetic torque, the
magnetization, and the inelastic neutron scattering spectra. The combined data
show that the low-temperature magnetism of Fe18 is very accurately described by
the Neel-vector tunneling (NVT) scenario, as unfolded by semiclassical theory.
In addition, the magnetic torque as a function of applied field exhibits
oscillations that reflect the oscillations in the NVT tunnel splitting with
field due to quantum phase interference.
