Epitaxial thin films of charge-ordered Pr$_{0.625}$Ca$_{0.375}$MnO$_{3}$ have
been studied using variable temperature Scanning tunneling microscopy and
spectroscopy (STM/STS). The as grown films were found to be granular while the
annealed films show atomic terraces at all temperatures and are found to be
electronically homogeneous in 78-300K temperature range. At high temperatures
(T$>$T$_{CO}\approx$ 230 K) the local tunnel spectra of the annealed films show
a depression in the density of states (DOS) near Fermi energy implying a
pseudogap with a significant DOS at E$_F$. The gap feature becomes more robust
with cooling with a sharp jump in DOS at E$_F$ at T$_{CO}$ and with a gap value
of $\sim$0.3 eV at 78K. At low temperatures we find a small but finite DOS at
E$_F$ indicative of some delocalized carriers in the CO phase together with an
energy gap. This is consistent with bulk transport, which shows weakening of
the activation gap with cooling below 200K, and indicates the presence of two
types of carriers at low temperatures.
