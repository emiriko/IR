We study directed transport of overdamped particles in a periodically rocked
random sawtooth potential. Two transport regimes can be identified which are
characterized by a nonzero value of the average velocity of particles and a
zero value, respectively. The properties of directed transport in these regimes
are investigated both analytically and numerically in terms of a random
sawtooth potential and a periodically varying driving force. Precise conditions
for the occurrence of transition between these two transport regimes are
derived and analyzed in detail.
