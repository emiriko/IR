The A/Z dependence of projectile fragmentation at relativistic energies has
been studied with the ALADIN forward spectrometer at SIS. A stable beam of
124Sn and radioactive beams of 124La and 107Sn at 600 MeV per nucleon have been
used in order to explore a wide range of isotopic compositions. Chemical
freeze-out temperatures are found to be nearly invariant with respect to the
A/Z of the produced spectator sources, consistent with predictions for expanded
systems. Small Coulomb effects (\Delta T \approx 0.6 MeV) appear for residue
production near the onset of multifragmentation.
