The phase diagrams of isotropic and anisotropic triangular lattices with
local Coulomb interactions are evaluated within cluster dynamical mean field
theory. As a result of partial geometric frustration in the anisotropic
lattice, short range correlations are shown to give rise to reentrant behavior
which is absent in the fully frustrated isotropic limit. The qualitative
features of the phase diagrams including the critical temperatures are in good
agreement with experimental data for the layered organic charge transfer salts
kappa-(BEDT-TTF)_2Cu[N(CN)_2]Cl and kappa-(BEDT-TTF)_2Cu_2(CN)_3.
