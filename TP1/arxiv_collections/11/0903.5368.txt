New type of quantum kinetic equations of the Fermi particles are derived. The
Bogolyubov's type of dispersion relation, which is valid for the Bose fluid, is
disclosed. Model of neutral Bose atoms in dense strongly coupled plasmas with
attractive interaction is discussed. A set of fluid equations describing the
quantum plasmas is obtained. Furthermore, the equation of state of a degenerate
Fermi plasma is derived.
