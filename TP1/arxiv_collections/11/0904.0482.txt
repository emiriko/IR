We study spin-dependent conductance in a system composed of a ferromagnetic
(FM) Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) tip coupled to a metallic host surface
with an adatom. The Kondo resonance is taken into account via the
Doniach-Sunjic spectral function. For short lateral tip-adatom distances and
due to the interplay between Kondo physics, quantum interfering effects and the
ferromagnetism of the tip, a spin-splitting of the Fano-Kondo line shape arises
in the conductance. A strong enhancement of the Fano-Kondo profile for the
majority spin component of the FM tip is observed. When the tip is placed on
the adatom, this gives a conductance 100 % polarized for a particular range of
bias voltage. The system thus can be used as a powerful generator of spin
polarized currents.
