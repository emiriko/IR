An ion, atom, molecule or macro-particle in a trap can exhibit large motional
oscillations due to the Doppler-affected radiation pressure by a laser,
blue-detuned from an absorption line of a particle. This oscillator can be
nearly thresholdless, but under certain conditions it may exhibit huge
hysteretic excitation. Feasible applications include a "Foucault pendulum" in a
trap, a rotation sensor, single atom spectroscopy, isotope separation, etc.
