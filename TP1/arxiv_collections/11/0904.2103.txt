We present the results of a search for a high-energy axion emission signal
from 7Li (0.478 MeV) and D(p,gamma)3He (5.5 MeV) nuclear transitions using a
low-background gamma-ray calorimeter during Phase I of the CAST experiment.
These so-called "hadronic axions" could provide a solution to the long-standing
strong-CP problem and can be emitted from the solar core from nuclear M1
transitions. This is the first such search for high-energy pseudoscalar bosons
with couplings to nucleons conducted using a helioscope approach. No excess
signal above background was found.
