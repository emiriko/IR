Loop-mediated processes characterized by dynamical scale M indirectly measure
space-time dimension d at this scale. Assuming the latter to be scale-dependent
d=d(L) and taking as examples B-oscillations and muon (g-2) experimental
results we address the question about constraints put by this data on 4-d(L).
It is shown that sensitivity is lost for 1/L around 350 GeV, and any value of
d(L) between 2 and 5 at this scale is compatible with the data.
