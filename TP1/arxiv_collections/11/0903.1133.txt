Recently, several claims have been made that certain fundamental problems of
distributed computing, including Leader Election and Distributed Consensus,
begin to admit feasible and efficient solutions when the model of distributed
computation is extended so as to apply quantum processing. This has been
achieved in one of two distinct ways: (1) by initializing the system in a
quantum entangled state, and/or (2) by applying quantum communication channels.
In this paper, we explain why some of these prior claims are misleading, in the
sense that they rely on changes to the model unrelated to quantum processing.
On the positive side, we consider the aforementioned quantum extensions when
applied to Linial's well-established LOCAL model of distributed computing.
  For both types of extensions, we put forward valid proof-of-concept examples
of distributed problems whose round complexity is in fact reduced through
genuinely quantum effects, in contexts which do not depend on the anonymity of
nodes.
  Finally, we show that even the quantum variants of the LOCAL model have
non-trivial limitations, captured by a very simple (purely probabilistic)
notion which we call "physical locality" (PLOCAL). While this is strictly
weaker than the "computational locality" of the classical LOCAL model, it
nevertheless implies that for many distributed combinatorial optimization
problems, such as Maximal Independent Set, the best currently known lower time
bounds cannot be broken by applying quantum processing, in any conceivable way.
