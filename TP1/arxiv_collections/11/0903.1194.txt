We demonstrate numerically that proton-proton (pp) scattering observables can
be determined directly by standard short range methods using a screened pp
Coulomb force without renormalization. In examples the appropriate screening
radii are given. We also numerically investigate solutions of the 3-dimensional
Lippmann-Schwinger (LS) equation for a screened Coulomb potential alone in the
limit of large screening radii and confirm analytically predicted properties
for off-shell, half-shell and on-shell Coulomb t-matrices. These 3-dimensional
solutions will form a basis for a novel approach to include the pp Coulomb
interaction into the 3N Faddeev framework.
