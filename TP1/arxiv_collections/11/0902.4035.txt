Motivated by a two-bump (or 1-peak plus 1-hump) structure in the ATIC data,
we perform a statistical analysis fitting the PAMELA and ATIC data to a dark
matter model, in which the dark matter particle can undergo both annihilation
and decay. Using a chi-square analysis we show that both data can be
simultaneously fitted better with such a double-action dark matter particle. We
use an existing neutrino mass model in literature to illustrate the idea.
