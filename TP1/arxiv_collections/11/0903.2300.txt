Using the Madelung fluid picture of Schr\"odinger equation for a single free
particle moving in one spatial dimension, we shall specify a class of wave
functions whose quantum probability density is being trapped by the quantum
potential it itself generates. The global convexity of the quantum potential
generated by the initial self-trapped wave function will then be shown to
further localize the quantum probability density through a self-generated
focusing equation for a finite interval of time.
