We derive slow-roll conditions for thawing quintessence. We solve the
equation of motion of $\phi$ for a Taylor expanded potential (up to the
quadratic order) in the limit where the equation of state $w$ is close to -1 to
derive the equation of state as a function of the scale factor. We find that
the evolution of $\phi$ and hence $w$ are described by only two parameters. The
expression for $w(a)$, which can be applied to general thawing models,
coincides precisely with that derived recently by Dutta and Scherrer for
hilltop quintessence. The consistency conditions of $|w+1|\ll 1$ are derived.
The slow-roll conditions for freezing quintessence are also derived.
