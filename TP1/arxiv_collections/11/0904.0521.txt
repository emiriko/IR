The Brown-Kucha\v{r} mechanism is applied in the case of General Relativity
coupled with the Schutz' model for a perfect fluid. Using the canonical
formalism and manipulating the set of modified constraints one is able to
recover the definition of a time evolution operator, i.e. a physical
Hamiltonian, expressed as a functional of gravitational variables and the
entropy.
