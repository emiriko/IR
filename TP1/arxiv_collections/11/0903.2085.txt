Cadabra is a powerful computer program for the manipulation of tensor
equations. It was designed for use in high energy physics but its rich
structure and ease of use lends itself well to the routine computations
required in General Relativity. Here we will present a series of simple
examples showing how Cadabra may be used, including verifying that the
Levi-Civita connection is a metric connection and a derivation of the Gauss
equation between induced and ambient curvatures.
