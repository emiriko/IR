We present results on the system size dependence of high transverse momentum
di-hadron correlations at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV as measured by STAR at
RHIC. Measurements in d+Au, Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions reveal similar jet-like
correlation yields at small angular separation ($\Delta\phi\sim0$,
$\Delta\eta\sim0$) for all systems and centralities. Previous measurements have
shown that the away-side yield is suppressed in heavy-ion collisions. We
present measurements of the away-side suppression as a function of transverse
momentum and centrality in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions. The suppression is found
to be similar in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at a similar number of
participants. The results are compared to theoretical calculations based on the
parton quenching model and the modified fragmentation model. The observed
differences between data and theory indicate that the correlated yields
presented here will provide important constraints on medium density profile and
energy loss model parameters.
