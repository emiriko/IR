This note focuses on the large-N behaviour of the Hard Wall model of QCD and
clarifies the AdS/QCD dictionary formulated on the basis of the AdS/CFT
correspondence. It is shown how short-distance studies performed in the
framework of the AdS/QCD Soft Wall model allow one to determine unambiguously
the chiral symmetry breaking function in the Hard Wall model. Especially, the
different forms of the field/operator prescription are emphasized. The large-N
behaviour of the Hard Wall model is then checked considering the vector and
gravitational form factors of the pion in the chiral limit.
