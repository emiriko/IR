We consider the two-pion decay of the $\rho$-meson, the $^3S_1q\bar q$-state
of the constituent quarks -- the decay being determined by the transition
$q\bar q\to \pi\pi$ contains information about confinement interactions. One
can specify in this decay two types of transitions: ({\bf i}) the
bremsstrahlung radiation of a pion $q\to q+\pi$ (or $\bar q\to\bar q+\pi$) with
the subsequent fusion $q\bar q\to \pi$, and ({\bf ii}) the direct transition
$q\bar q\to \pi\pi$. We demonstrate how in the amplitudes of the corresponding
transitions the quark singularities have to disappear, {\it i.e.} what is the
way the quark confinement at relatively short distances can be realized. We
calculate and estimate the contributions of processes with bremsstrahlung
radiation of the pion and of the direct transition $q\bar q\to \pi\pi$. The
estimates demonstrate that the processes involving the direct transition $q\bar
q\to \pi\pi$ are necessary, but they cannot be determined unambiguously by the
decay $\rho(775)\to \pi\pi$. We conclude that for the determination of the
$q\bar q\to \pi\pi$ transition more complete data on the resonance decays into
the $\pi\pi$ channels are required than those available at the moment.
