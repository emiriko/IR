The main objective of this work is to investigate the role played by Lower
Centaurus Crux (LCC) and Upper Centaurus Lupus (UCL), both subcomponents of the
Scorpio Centaurus OB association (Sco-Cen), in the formation of the groups beta
Pictoris, TW Hydrae and the eta Chamaeleontis cluster. The dynamical evolution
of all the stellar groups involved and of the bubbles and shells blown by LCC
and UCL are calculated and followed from the past to the present. This leads to
a formation scenario in which (1) the groups beta Pictoris, TW Hydrae were
formed in the wake of the shells created by LCC and UCL, (2) the young cluster
eta Chamaeleontis was born as a consequence of the collision of the shells of
LCC and UCL, and (3) the formation of Upper Scorpius (US), the other main
subcomponent of the Sco-Cen association, may have been started by the same
process that created eta Chamaeleontis.
