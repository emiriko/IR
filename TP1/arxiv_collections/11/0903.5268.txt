It is well known that the electron transfer (ET) reaction in
donor-bridge-acceptor systems is much influenced by the bridge conformational
changes. However, the importance of the dynamical contribution to the ET rate
is still under debate. In this study, we investigate the significance of the
dynamical non-Condon effect on the ET rate in the coherent resonant tunneling
regime. To deal with the resonance, we generalize the time-dependent Fermi's
golden rule expression for the ET rate in the $T$-matrix framework. The
dynamical effect is thereby expressed in terms of the time correlation function
of the non-Hermitian $T$-matrix. We discuss the property of the quantum time
correlation function of the non-Hermitian $T$-matrix and construct the
semiclassical approximation. Then we perform a computational study using
classical equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical
calculations. It is shown that the ET rate can be significantly enhanced by the
dynamical non-Condon effects.
