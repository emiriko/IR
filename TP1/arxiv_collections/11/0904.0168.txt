We report four-color WBVR photoelectric photometry of the close binary system
(CBS) HZ HER/HER X-1 made in 1986-1994. Our photometry usually covered at least
two 35d precession periods during each of the 1986-1990, 1992, and 1994
observing seasons. The accuracy and duration of our 10-year long photoelectric
observations of the star with an x-ray source made it possible to study its
long-term behavior. We refine some of the "fine" photometric effects on the
light curves of the CBS and try to interpret them in terms of the model of mass
transfer from the optical component of the CBS to the accretion disk (AD) of
the neutron star (NS).
