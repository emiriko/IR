CRISP (Crisp Imaging Spectro-polarimeter), the new spectropolarimeter at the
Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, opens a new perspective in solar polarimetry. With
better spatial resolution (0.13") than Hinode in the Fe I 6302 A line and
similar polarimetric sensitivity reached through postprocessing, CRISP
complements the SP spectropolarimeter onboard Hinode. We present some of the
data which we obtained in our June 2008 campaign and preliminary results from
LTE inversions of a pore containing umbral dots.
