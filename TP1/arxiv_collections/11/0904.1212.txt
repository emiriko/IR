We reconsider the possibility of violating the generalized second law of
thermodynamics in theories with spontaneous Lorentz violation. It has been
proposed that this may be accomplished in particular with a black hole immersed
in a ghost condensate background, which may be taken to break Lorentz
invariance without appreciably distorting the space-time geometry. In this
paper we show that there in fact exist solutions explicitly describing flow of
negative energy into these black holes, allowing for violation of the second
law in a very simple way. This second law violation is independent of any
additional assumptions such as couplings of the ghost condensate to secondary
fields, and suggests that violation of the null energy condition may be the
true source of pathology in these theories.
