The quarkonium states in a quark-gluon plasma is examined with the potential
implied by AdS/CFT duality. Both the vanila AdS-Schwarzschild metric and the
one with an infrared cutoff are considered. The calculated dissociation
temperatures for $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ are found to agree with the lattice
results within a factor of two.
