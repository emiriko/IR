We consider homoclinic solutions of fourth order equations $$ u^{""} +
\beta^2 u^{"} + V_u (u)=0 {in} \R ,$$ where $V(u)$ is either the suspension
bridge type $V(u)=e^u-1-u$ or Swift-Hohenberg type $ V(u)= {1/4}(u^2-1)^2$. For
the suspension bridge type equation, we prove existence of a homoclinic
solution for {\em all} $ \beta \in (0, \beta_*)$ where $ \beta_{*}= 0.7427...$.
For the Swift-Hohenberg type equation, we prove existence of a homoclinic
solution for each $\beta \in (0, \beta_{*})$, where $\beta_{*}=0.9342...$. This
partially solves a conjecture of Chen--McKenna \cite{YCM1}.
