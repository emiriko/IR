The temperature distributions in current-carrying carbon nanotubes have been
measured with a scanning thermal microscope. The obtained temperature profiles
reveal diffusive and dissipative electron transport in multi-walled nanotubes
and in single-walled nanotubes when the voltage bias was higher than the
0.1-0.2 eV optical phonon energy. Over ninety percent of the Joule heat in a
multi-walled nanotube was found to be conducted along the nanotube to the two
metal contacts. In comparison, about eighty percent of the Joule heat was
transferred directly across the nanotube-substrate interface for single-walled
nanotubes. The average temperature rise in the nanotubes is determined to be in
the range of 5 to 42 K per micro watt Joule heat dissipation in the nanotubes.
