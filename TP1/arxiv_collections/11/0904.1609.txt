A range of quantum optics experiments is discussed in which the apparatus can
be modified by detector outcomes during the course of any run. Starting with a
single beamsplitter network, we work our way through a series of more complex
scenarios, culminating with a proposed self-intervening experiment which could
provide evidence for the existence of the Heisenberg cut, the supposed boundary
between classical and quantum physics.
