We propose a new multi-scale molecular dynamics simulation method which can
achieve high accuracy and high sampling efficiency simultaneously without
aforehand knowledge of the coarse grained (CG) potential and test it for a
biomolecular system. Based on the resolution exchange simulations between
atomistic and CG replicas, a self-learning strategy is introduced to
progressively improve the CG potential by an iterative way. Two tests show
that, the new method can rapidly improve the CG potential and achieve efficient
sampling even starting from an unrealistic CG potential. The resulting free
energy agreed well with exact result and the convergence by the method was much
faster than that by the replica exchange method. The method is generic and can
be applied to many biological as well as non-biological problems.
