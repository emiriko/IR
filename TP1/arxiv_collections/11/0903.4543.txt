New quantum distance is introduced as a half-sum of several singular values
of difference between two density operators. This is, up to factor, the metric
induced by so-called Ky Fan norm. The partitioned trace distances enjoy similar
properties to the standard trace distance, including the unitary invariance,
the strong convexity and the close relations to the classical distances. The
partitioned distances cannot increase under quantum operations of certain kind
including bistochastic maps. All the basic properties are re-formulated as
majorization relations. Possible applications to quantum information processing
are briefly discussed.
