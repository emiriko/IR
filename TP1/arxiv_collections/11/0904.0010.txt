This is a study of a monochromatic planar perturbation impinging upon a
canonical acoustic hole. We show that acoustic hole scattering shares key
features with black hole scattering. The interference of wavefronts passing in
opposite senses around the hole creates regular oscillations in the scattered
intensity. We examine this effect by applying a partial wave method to compute
the differential scattering cross section for a range of incident wavelengths.
We demonstrate the existence of a scattering peak in the backward direction,
known as the glory. We show that the glory created by the canonical acoustic
hole is approximately 170 times less intense than the glory created by the
Schwarzschild black hole, for equivalent horizon-to-wavelength ratios. We hope
that direct experimental observations of such effects may be possible in the
near future.
