The multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) model has been employed to
calculate the expectation values for the hyperfine splittings of the 5d96s2
2D3/2 and 5d96s2 2D5/2 levels of atomic gold. One-, two-, and three-body
electron correlation effects involving all 79 electrons have been included in a
systematic manner. The approximation employed in this study is equivalent to a
Complete Active Space (CAS) approach. Calculated electric field gradients,
together with experimental values of the electric quadrupole hyperfine
structure constants, allow us to extract a nuclear electric quadrupole moment
