The two-dimensional mapping of the phonon dispersions around the $K$ point of
graphite by inelastic x-ray scattering is provided. The present work resolves
the longstanding issue related to the correct assignment of transverse and
longitudinal phonon branches at $K$. We observe an almost degeneracy of the
three TO, LA and LO derived phonon branches and a strong phonon trigonal
warping. Correlation effects renormalize the Kohn anomaly of the TO mode, which
exhibits a trigonal warping effect opposite to that of the electronic band
structure. We determined the electron--phonon coupling constant to be
166$\rm(eV/\AA)^2$ in excellent agreement to $GW$ calculations. These results
are fundamental for understanding angle-resolved photoemission,
double--resonance Raman and transport measurements of graphene based systems.
