We present the results of an investigation of both the magnetic and
structural phase transitions in a high quality single crystalline sample of the
undoped, iron pnictide compound BaFe$_2$As$_2$. Both phase transitions are
characterized via neutron diffraction measurements which reveal simultaneous,
continuous magnetic and structural orderings with no evidence of hysteresis,
consistent with a single second order phase transition. The onset of long-range
antiferromagnetic order can be described by a simple power law dependence
$\phi(T)^2\propto(1-\frac{T}{T_N})^{2\beta}$ with $\beta=0.103\pm0.018$; a
value near the $\beta=0.125$ expected for a two-dimensional Ising system.
Biquadratic coupling between the structural and magnetic order parameters is
also inferred along with evidence of three-dimensional critical scattering in
this system.
