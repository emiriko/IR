We have studied the behaviour of the nuclear modification factor as a
function of centrality, chemical baryon potential and thermal freeze out
temperature using the data coming from the Fast Hadron Freezeout Generator.
Considering two ways of NMF definition, namely the ratio of meson yields and
ratio of baryons yield, we considered two associates effects (for percolation
cluster formation) to identify it; appearance of the anomalous nuclear
transparency and light nuclei production. In this paper we have used the
behaviour of nuclear modification factor as a function of different physical
parameters to get the information of the behavior of nuclear transparency
effect and the nuclear coalescence in freezeout state. We have chosen different
generators for this purpose. Here we have used the simulated data for Au-Au
collisions at RHIC energies coming from the FASTMC Model. This model is very
good in freezeout state.
