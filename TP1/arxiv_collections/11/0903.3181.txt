Approximate analytical closed energy formulas for semirelativistic
Hamiltonians of the form $\sigma\sqrt{\bm p^{2}+m^2}+V(r)$ are obtained within
the framework of the auxiliary field method. This method, which is equivalent
to the envelope theory, has been recently proposed as a powerful tool to get
approximate analytical solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. Various shapes
for the potential $V(r)$ are investigated: power-law, funnel, square root, and
Yukawa. A comparison with the exact results is discussed in detail.
