This is the first paper in a sequence devoted to giving manifestly
non-negative formulas for generalized exponents of small representations in all
types. The main part of this paper illustrates the overall structure of the
argument on root systems of type A and discusses the relationship with the
Lascoux-Schutzenberger charge formula.
