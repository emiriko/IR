Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) is one of the five payloads aboard the
Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)'s ASTROSAT space mission. The science
objectives of UVIT are broad, extending from individual hot stars, star-forming
regions to active galactic nuclei. Imaging performance of UVIT would depend on
several factors in addition to the optics, e.g. resolution of the detectors,
Satellite Drift and Jitter, image frame acquisition rate, sky background,
source intensity etc. The use of intensified CMOS-imager based photon counting
detectors in UVIT put their own complexity over reconstruction of the images.
All these factors could lead to several systematic effects in the reconstructed
images. A study has been done through numerical simulations with artificial
point sources and archival image of a galaxy from GALEX data archive, to
explore the effects of all the above mentioned parameters on the reconstructed
images. In particular the issues of angular resolution, photometric accuracy
and photometric-nonlinearity associated with the intensified CMOS-imager based
photon counting detectors have been investigated. The photon events in image
frames are detected by three different centroid algorithms with some energy
thresholds. Our results show that in presence of bright sources, reconstructed
images from UVIT would suffer from photometric distortion in a complex way and
the presence of overlapping photon events could lead to complex patterns near
the bright sources. Further the angular resolution, photometric accuracy and
distortion would depend on the values of various thresholds chosen to detect
photon events.
