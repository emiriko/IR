We use the theory of large deviations to study the pricing of
investment-grade tranches of synthetic CDO's. In this paper, we consider a
heterogeneous pool of names. Our main tool is a large-deviations analysis which
allows us to precisely study the behavior of a large amount of idiosyncratic
randomness. Our calculations allow a fairly general treatment of correlation.
