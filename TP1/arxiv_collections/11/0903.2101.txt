The framework used to prove the multiplicative law deformation of the algebra
of Feynman-Bender diagrams is a \textit{twisted shifted dual law} (in fact,
twice). We give here a clear interpretation of its two parameters. The crossing
parameter is a deformation of the tensor structure whereas the superposition
parameters is a perturbation of the shuffle coproduct of Hoffman type which, in
turn, can be interpreted as the diagonal restriction of a superproduct. Here,
we systematically detail these constructions.
