After a discussion on several limiting cases where General Relativity turns
into less sophisticated theories, we find that in the correct thermodynamical
and cosmological weak field limit of Einstein's field equations the entropy of
the Universe is R^(3/2) -- dependent, where R stands for the radius of the
causally related Universe. Thus, entropy grows in the Universe, contrary to
Standard Cosmology prediction.
