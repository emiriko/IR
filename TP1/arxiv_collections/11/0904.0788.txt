In the last ten years, the field of proteomics has expanded at a rapid rate.
A range of exciting new technology has been developed and enthusiastically
applied to an enormous variety of biological questions. However, the degree of
stringency required in proteomic data generation and analysis appears to have
been underestimated. As a result, there are likely to be numerous published
findings that are of questionable quality, requiring further confirmation
and/or validation. This manuscript outlines a number of key issues in proteomic
research, including those associated with experimental design, differential
display and biomarker discovery, protein identification and analytical
incompleteness. In an effort to set a standard that reflects current thinking
on the necessary and desirable characteristics of publishable manuscripts in
the field, a minimal set of guidelines for proteomics research is then
described. These guidelines will serve as a set of criteria which editors of
PROTEOMICS will use for assessment of future submissions to the Journal.
