We study a simple version of the AdS/CFT (anti-de Sitter spacetime/Conformal
Field Theory) correspondence, where operators have integer conformal
dimensions. In this model, bulk causality follows from boundary analyticity,
even in nontrivial black hole backgrounds that break the underlying conformal
symmetry. This allows a natural set of quasi-local bulk observables to be
constructed. Estimates of finite central charge corrections to semiclassical
correlators are made. These corrections are used to determine the regime of
validity of effective field theory in the bulk spacetime. The results are
consistent with black hole complementarity.
