We present new L-band spectra of 13 outbursting Be stars obtained with ISAAC
at the ESO Paranal observatory. These stars can be classified in three groups
depending on the presence/absence of emission lines and the strength of
Br$\alpha$ and Pf$\gamma$ emission lines relative to those of Humphreys lines
from transitions 6--14 to the end of the series. These groups are
representative of circumstellar envelopes with different optical depths. For
the group showing Br$\alpha$ and Pf$\gamma$ lines stronger than Humphreys
lines, the Humphreys decrement roughly follow the Menzel case-B for optically
thin conditions. For the group showing comparable Br$\alpha$, Pf$\gamma$ and
Humphreys emission line strengths, the Humphreys decrements moves from an
optically thin to an optically thick regime at a transition wavelength which is
characteristic for each star, but typically is located around 3.65--3.75 $\mu$m
(transitions 6--19 and 6--17). Higher order Humphreys lines probe optically
thin inner regions even in the optically thicker envelopes. We find evidence of
larger broadening in the infrared emission lines compared with optical lines,
probably reflecting larger vertical velocity fields near the star. The
existence of the aforementioned groups is in principle consistent with the
proposed description by de Wit et al. (2006) for Be star outbursts in terms of
the ejection of an optically thick disk that expands and becomes optically thin
before dissipation into the interstellar medium. Time resolved L-band
spectroscopy sampling the outburst cycle promises to be an unique tool for
testing Be star disk evolution.
