The dependence of the superconducting transition temperature Tc of CaC6 has
been determined as a function of hydrostatic pressure in both helium-loaded gas
and diamond-anvil cells to 0.6 and 32 GPa, respectively. Following an initial
increase at the rate +0.39(1) K/GPa, Tc drops abruptly from 15 K to 4 K at 10
GPa. Synchrotron x-ray measurements to 15 GPa point to a structural transition
near 10 GPa from a rhombohedral to a higher symmetry phase.
