One of the main open problems in the field of transport in strongly
interacting nanostructures is the understanding of currents beyond the linear
response regime. In this work, we consider the single-impurity Anderson model
and use the adaptive time-dependent density matrix renormalization group
(tDMRG) method to compute real-time currents out of equilibrium. We first focus
on the particle-hole symmetric point where Kondo correlations are the strongest
and then extend the study of the nonequilibrium transport to the mixed-valence
regime. As a main result, we present accurate data for the current-voltage
characteristics of this model.
