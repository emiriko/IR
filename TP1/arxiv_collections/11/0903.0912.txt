Let X be a non-empty finite set, E be a finite dimensional euclidean vector
space and G a finite subgroup of O(E), the orthognal group of E. Suppose
GG={U_i | i in X} is a finite set of linear lines in E and an orbit of G on
which its operation is twice transitive. Then GG is an equiangular set of
lines, which means that we can find a real number "c", and generators u_i of
the lines U_i (i in X) such that forall i,j in X, ||u_i||=1, and if i is
different from j then (u_i|u_j)=\gve_{i,j}.c, with \gve_{i,j} in {-1,+1\} Let
Gamma be the simple graph whose set of vertices is X, two of them, say i and j,
being linked when \gve_{i,j} = -1. In this article we first explore the
relationship between double transitivity of G and geometric properties of
Gamma. Then we construct several graphs associated with a twice transitive
group G, in particular any of Paley's graphs is associated with a
representation of G=PSL_2(q) on a set of q+1 equiangular lines in a vector
space whose dimension is (q+1)/2.
