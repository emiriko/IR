A new class of exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell system is found in
closed form. This is achieved by choosing a generalised form for one of the
gravitational potentials and a particular form for the electric field
intensity. For specific values of the parameters it is possible to write the
new series solutions in terms of elementary functions. We regain well known
physically reasonable models. A physical analysis indicates that the model may
be used to describe a charged sphere. The influence of the electromagnetic
field on the gravitational interaction is highlighted.
