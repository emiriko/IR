Just fourteen years ago the Solar System represented the only known planetary
system in the Galaxy, and conceptions of planet formation were shaped by this
sample of one. Since then, 320 planets have been discovered orbiting 276
individual stars. This large and growing ensemble of exoplanets has informed
theories of planet formation, placed the Solar System in a broader context, and
revealed many surprises along the way. In this review I provide an overview of
what has been learned from studies of the occurrence, orbits and physical
structures of planets. After taking a look back at how far the field has
advanced, I will discuss some of the future directions of exoplanetary science,
with an eye toward the detection and characterization of Earth-like planets
around other stars.
