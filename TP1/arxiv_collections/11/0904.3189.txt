We study the local density of states at and around a substituting impurity
and use these results to compute current versus bias characteristic curves of
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experiments done on the surface of
graphene. This allow us to detect the presence of substituting impurities on
graphene. The case of vacancies is also analyzed. We find that the shape and
magnitude of the STM characteristic curves depend on the position of the tip
and on the nature of the defect, with the strength of the binging between the
impurity and the carbon atoms playing an important role. Also the nature of the
last atom of the tip has an influence on the shape of the characteristic curve.
