In this paper, we study the period map of a certain one-parameter family of
quartic K3 surfaces with an S5-action. We construct automorphic forms on the
period domain as the pull-backs of theta constants of genus 2 by a modular
embedding. Using these automorphic forms, we give an explicit presentation of
the inverse period map.
