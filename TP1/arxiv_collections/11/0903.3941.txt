A dark sector -- a new non-Abelian gauge group Higgsed or confined near the
GeV scale -- can be spectacularly probed in low-energy e+e- collisions. A
low-mass dark sector can explain the annual modulation signal reported by
DAMA/LIBRA and the PAMELA, ATIC, and INTEGRAL observations by generating small
mass splittings and new interactions for weak-scale dark matter. Some of these
observations may be the first signs of a low-mass dark sector that collider
searches can definitively confirm. Production and decay of O(GeV)-mass dark
states is mediated by a Higgsed Abelian gauge boson that mixes kinetically with
hypercharge. Existing data from BaBar, BELLE, CLEO-c, and KLOE may contain
thousands of striking dark-sector events with a high multiplicity of leptons
that reconstruct mass resonances and possibly displaced vertices. We discuss
the production and decay phenomenology of Higgsed and confined dark sectors and
propose e+e- collider search strategies. We also use the DAMA/LIBRA signal to
estimate the production cross-sections and decay lifetimes for dark-sector
states.
