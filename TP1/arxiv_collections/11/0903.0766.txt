Thermal balances and complete investigation of air flow along a uniformly
heated vertical black thick steel plate (1000 to 8000 W/m\^2) have been
obtained by means of a thermoanemometric method and infrared pyrometry. Several
physical models have been solved with a commercial CFD (FLUENT) and the
numerical results are compared with the experimental values.
