To improve unstructured P2P system performance, one wants to minimize the
number of peers that have to be probed for the shortening of the search time. A
solution to the problem is to employ a replication scheme, which provides high
hit rate for target files. Replication can also provide load balancing and
reduce access latency if the file is accessed by a large population of users.
This paper briefly describes various replication schemes that have appeared in
the literature and also focuses on a novel replication technique called
Q-replication to increase availability of objects in unstructured P2P networks.
The Q-replication technique replicates objects autonomously to suitable sites
based on object popularity and site selection logic by extensively employing
Q-learning concept.
