We construct the analogue of the plactic monoid for the super semistandard
Young tableaux over a signed alphabet. This is done by developing a
generalization of the Knuth's relations. Moreover we get generalizations of
Greene's invariants and Young-Pieri rule. A generalization of the symmetry
theorem in the signed case is also obtained. Except for this last result, all
the other results are proved without restrictions on the orderings of the
alphabets.
