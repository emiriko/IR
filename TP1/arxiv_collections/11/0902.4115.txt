Recent developments of dynamic x-ray characterization experiments of dense
matter are reviewed, with particular emphasis on conditions relevant to
interiors of terrestrial and gas giant planets. These studies include
characterization of compressed states of matter in light elements by x-ray
scattering and imaging of shocked iron by radiography. Several applications of
this work are examined. These include the structure of massive "Super Earth"
terrestrial planets around other stars, the 40 known extrasolar gas giants with
measured masses and radii, and Jupiter itself, which serves as the benchmark
for giant planets.
