We compute the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to the
first five moments of six event shape variables related to three-particle final
states in electron-positron annihilation; the thrust, the heavy jet mass, the
C-parameter, the wide and total jet broadenings and the three-to-two-jet
transition parameter in the Durham algorithm Y3. The NNLO corrections to the
first moment are moderate for all event shapes, while the renormalisation scale
dependence of the theoretical prediction is substantially reduced compared to
the previously existing NLO results. From a comparison with data from JADE and
OPAL, we observe that the energy dependence of the moments of the wide jet
broadening and Y3 can be largely explained without any non-perturbative power
corrections, while the other observables exhibit a clear need for power-like
contributions at low centre-of-mass energy.
