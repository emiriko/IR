An unconventional Cosmographical model for a generation of fermion and week
boson masses without electro-weak Higgs bosons is outlined. It is based on a
rich, non perturbative vacuum structure taken to be an object of qualitative
phenomenology. Numerous far reaching and astonishing consequences are
discussed.
