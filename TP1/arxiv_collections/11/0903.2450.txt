We carry out extensive Monte Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional (3D)
uniformly frustrated XY model with uncorrelated randomly perturbed couplings,
as a model for the equilibrium behavior of an extreme type-II superconductor
with quenched uncorrelated random point vortex pinning, in the presence of a
uniform applied magnetic field. We map out the resulting phase diagram as a
function of temperature T and pinning strength p for a fixed value of the
vortex line density. At low p we find a sharp first order vortex lattice
melting phase boundary separating a vortex lattice from a vortex liquid. As p
increases, it appears that this first order transition smears out over a finite
temperature interval, due to the effects of the random pinning, in agreement
with several recent experiments. At large p we find a second order transition
from vortex liquid to vortex glass.
