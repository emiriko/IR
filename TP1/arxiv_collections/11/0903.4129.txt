The level of holographic noise expected to be observed in interferometric
gravitational wave detectors such as GEO600 is re-examined. It is demonstrated
that earlier estimates are based on assumed linear diffractive behavior of
Planck radiation. Since nonlinear effects, such as self-focusing, are expected
to appear at much lower energies, the expected level of holographic noise must
be reduced by many orders of magnitude.
