We investigate the dynamics of a glass forming 2D colloidal mixture and show
the existence of collective motions of the particles. We introduce a mean
square displacement MSD with respect to the nearest neighbors which shows
remarkable deviations from the usual MSD quantifying the individual motion of
our particles. Combined with the analysis of the self part of the Van Hove
function this indicates a coupled motion of particles with their cage as well
as intra cage hopping processes.
