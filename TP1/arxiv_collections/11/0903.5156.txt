We demonstrate that the framework of bounded quantum reference frames has
application to building quantum-public-key cryptographic protocols and proving
their security. Thus, the framework we introduce can be seen as a public-key
analogue of the framework of Bartlett et al. (Phys. Rev. A 70, 032307), where a
private shared reference frame is shown to have cryptographic application. The
protocol we present in this paper is an identification scheme, which, like a
digital signature scheme, is a type of authentication scheme. We prove that our
protocol is both reusable and secure under the honest-verifier assumption.
Thus, we also demonstrate that secure reusable quantum-public-key
authentication is possible to some extent.
