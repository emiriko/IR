We investigate the network topologies of an ensemble of telechelic polymers.
The telechelic polymers serve as links between nodes, which consist of
aggregates of their telechelic endgroups. Our analysis shows that the degree
distribution is bimodal and consists of two Poissonian distributions with
different average degrees. The number of nodes in each of them as well as the
distribution of links depends on temperature. By comparing the eigenvalue
spectra of the simulated network gels with those of reconstructed networks, the
most likely ttopology at each temperature is determined.
