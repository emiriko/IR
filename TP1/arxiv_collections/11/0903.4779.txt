We consider a family of spherical three dimensional spacelike slices embedded
in the Schwarzschild solution. The mean curvature is constant on each slice but
can change from slice to slice. We give a simple expression for an everywhere
positive lapse and thus we show how to construct foliations. There is a barrier
preventing the mean curvature from becoming large, and we show how to avoid
this so as to construct a foliation where the mean curvature runs all the way
from zero to infinity. No foliation exists where the mean curvature goes from
minus to plus infinity. There are slicings, however, where each slice passes
through the bifurcation sphere $R = 2M$ and the lapse only vanishes at this one
point, and is positive everywhere else, while the mean curvature does run from
minus to plus infinity. Symmetric foliations of the extended Schwarzschild
spacetime degenerate at a critical point, where we show that the lapse function
exponentially approaches zero.
