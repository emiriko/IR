We study the decay of interface induced structural and electronic relaxation
effects in epitaxial LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures. The results are based on
first-principles band structure calculations for a multilayer configuration
with an ultrathin LaAlO3 layer sandwiched between bulk-like SrTiO3 layers. We
carry out the structure optimization for the heterointerface and investigate
the electronic states of the conducting interface layer, which is found to
extend over two SrTiO3 unit cells. The decay of atomic displacements is
analyzed as a function of the distance to the interface, and the resulting
exponential law is evaluated quantitatively.
