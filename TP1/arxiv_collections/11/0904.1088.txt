We propose a new, precise integrality conjecture for the colored Kauffman
polynomial of knots and links inspired by large N dualities and the structure
of topological string theory on orientifolds. According to this conjecture, the
natural knot invariant in an unoriented theory involves both the colored
Kauffman polynomial and the colored HOMFLY polynomial for composite
representations, i.e. it involves the full HOMFLY skein of the annulus. The
conjecture sheds new light on the relationship between the Kauffman and the
HOMFLY polynomials, and it implies for example Rudolph's theorem. We provide
various non-trivial tests of the conjecture and we sketch the string theory
arguments that lead to it.
