The stability and collapse of fundamental unstaggered bright solitons in the
discrete Schrodinger equation with the nonpolynomial on-site nonlinearity,
which models a nearly one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in a
deep optical lattice, are studied in the presence of the long-range
dipole-dipole (DD) interactions. The cases of both attractive and repulsive
contact and DD interaction are considered. The results are summarized in the
form of stability/collapse diagrams in the parametric space of the model, which
demonstrate that the the attractive DD interactions stabilize the solitons and
help to prevent the collapse. Mobility of the discrete solitons is briefly
considered too.
