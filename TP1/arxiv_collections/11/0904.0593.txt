We show that the Arnold tongues of the family of double standard maps
f_{a,b}(x) = 2x + a + (b/pi) sin(2 pi x), are connected. This proof is
accomplished in the complex domain by means of quasiconformal techniques and
depends partly upon the fact that the complexification of f_{a,b} has only one
critical point taking symmetry into account.
