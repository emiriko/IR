We have studied the zero-temperature statistics of charge transfer between
the two edges of Quantum Hall liquids with filling factors $\nu_{0,1}=1/(2
m_{0,1}+1)$ forming Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The known Bethe ansatz
solution for symmetric interferometer is used to obtain the cumulant-generating
function of charge at constant voltage $V$ between the edges. Its low-$V$
behavior can be interpreted in terms of electron tunneling, while its large-$V$
asymptotics reproduces the $m$-state dynamics ($m\equiv 1+m_{0}+m_{1}$) of
quasiparticles with fractional (for $m>1$) charge and statistics. We also
analyze the transition region between electrons and quasiparticles.
