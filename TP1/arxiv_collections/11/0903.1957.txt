We address a number of aspects of the arrival time problem defined using a
complex potential of step function form. We concentrate on the limit of a weak
potential, in which the resulting arrival time distribution function is closely
related to the quantum-mechanical current. We first consider the analagous
classical arrival time problem involving an absorbing potential, and this sheds
some light on certain aspects of the quantum case. In the quantum case, we
review the path decomposition expansion (PDX), in which the propagator is
factored across a surface of constant time, so is very useful for potentials of
step function form. We use the PDX to derive the usual scattering wave
functions and the arrival time distribution function. This method gives a
direct and geometrically appealing account of known results (but also points
the way to how they can be extended to more general complex potentials). We use
these results to carry out a decoherent histories analysis of the arrival time
problem, taking advantage of a recently demonstrated connection between pulsed
measurements and complex potentials. We obtain very simple and plausible
expressions for the class operators (describing the amplitudes for crossing the
origin during intervals of time) and show that decoherence of histories is
obtained for a wide class of initial states (such as simple wave packets and
superpositions of wave packets). We find that the decoherent histories approach
gives results with a sensible classical limit that are fully compatible with
standard results on the arrival time problem. We also find some interesting
connections between backflow and decoherence.
