We study light scattering by spheres made of negative refractive index
materials. We demonstrate that scattering efficiency of the light does not
always obey the well-known Rayleigh's law $Q_{\rm sca}\sim1/\lambda^4$ for
small values of size parameter, but could be wavelength independent $Q_{\rm
sca}\sim const$, or even increase with the wavelength as $Q_{\rm
sca}\sim\lambda^2$. In addition, it is found that spheres with radius
comparable with the input wavelength may exhibit suppression of the scattering
in any directions, particularly in forward one. It can be considered as
analogues of Brewster's angles for spheres.
