Based on the renormalizable theory of gravitation recently proposed by
Horava, we present a simple scenario to generate almost scale-invariant,
super-horizon curvature perturbations. The anisotropic scaling with dynamical
critical exponent z=3 implies that the amplitude of quantum fluctuations of a
free scalar field generated in the early epoch of the expanding universe is
insensitive to the Hubble expansion rate and, thus, scale-invariant. Those
fluctuations are later converted to curvature perturbations by the curvaton
mechanism or/and the modulated decay of heavy particles/oscillating fields.
This scenario works, for example, for power law expansion a\propto t^p with
p>1/3 and, thus, does not require inflation. Also, this scenario does not rely
on any additional assumptions such as the detailed balance condition.
