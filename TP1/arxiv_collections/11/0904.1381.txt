The percolation of a liquid through a porous material is investigated with
the help of equations of the Onsager type. An expression is derived for the
molecular attraction, starting from Sutherland's potential approximation to the
van der Waals interaction. Then appropriate Onsager equations incorporating
this molecular attraction are written from transport theory considerations, in
terms of dimensionless variables. As an application, the system of self-similar
equations so derived is applied to a simplified situation.
