Lie group methods are used for the study of various issues related to
symmetries and exact solutions of the barotropic vorticity equation. The Lie
symmetries of the barotropic vorticity equations on the $f$- and
$\beta$-planes, as well as on the sphere in rotating and rest reference frames,
are determined. A symmetry background for reducing the rotating reference frame
to the rest frame is presented. The one- and two-dimensional inequivalent
subalgebras of the Lie invariance algebras of both equations are exhaustively
classified and then used to compute invariant solutions of the vorticity
equations. This provides large classes of exact solutions, which include both
Rossby and Rossby--Haurwitz waves as special cases. We also discuss the
possibility of partial invariance for the $\beta$-plane equation, thereby
further extending the family of its exact solutions. This is done in a more
systematic and complete way than previously available in literature.
