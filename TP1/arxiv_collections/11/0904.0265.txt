A model based on Fick's law of diffusion as a phenomenological description of
the molecular motion, and on the coupled mode theory, is developped to describe
single-beam surface relief grating formation in azopolymers thin films. It
allows to explain the mechanism of spontaneous patterning, and
self-organization. It allows also to compute the surface relief profile and its
evolution in time with good agreement with experiments.
