This review discusses how low-energy, valence excitations created by swift
electrons can render information on the optical response of structured
materials with unmatched spatial resolution. Electron microscopes are capable
of focusing electron beams on sub-nanometer spots and probing the target
response either by analyzing electron energy losses or by detecting emitted
radiation. Theoretical frameworks suited to calculate the probability of energy
loss and light emission (cathodoluminescence) are revisited and compared with
experimental results. More precisely, a quantum-mechanical description of the
interaction between the electrons and the sample is discussed, followed by a
powerful classical dielectric approach that can be in practice applied to more
complex systems. We assess the conditions under which classical and
quantum-mechanical formulations are equivalent. The excitation of collective
modes such as plasmons is studied in bulk materials, planar surfaces, and
nanoparticles. Light emission induced by the electrons is shown to constitute
an excellent probe of plasmons, combining sub-nanometer resolution in the
position of the electron beam with nanometer resolution in the emitted
wavelength. Both electron energy-loss and cathodoluminescence spectroscopies
performed in a scanning mode of operation yield snap shots of plasmon modes in
nanostructures with fine spatial detail as compared to other existing imaging
techniques, thus providing an ideal tool for nanophotonics studies.
