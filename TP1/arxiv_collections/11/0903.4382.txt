Size-Change Termination is an increasingly-popular technique for verifying
program termination. These termination proofs are deduced from an abstract
representation of the program in the form of "size-change graphs".
  We present algorithms that, for certain classes of size-change graphs, deduce
a global ranking function: an expression that ranks program states, and
decreases on every transition. A ranking function serves as a witness for a
termination proof, and is therefore interesting for program certification. The
particular form of the ranking expressions that represent SCT termination
proofs sheds light on the scope of the proof method. The complexity of the
expressions is also interesting, both practicaly and theoretically.
  While deducing ranking functions from size-change graphs has already been
shown possible, the constructions in this paper are simpler and more
transparent than previously known. They improve the upper bound on the size of
the ranking expression from triply exponential down to singly exponential (for
certain classes of instances). We claim that this result is, in some sense,
optimal. To this end, we introduce a framework for lower bounds on the
complexity of ranking expressions and prove exponential lower bounds.
