We study theoretically the two interacting one-dimensional helical modes at
the edges of the quantum spin Hall systems. A new type of inter-edge correlated
liquid (IECL) without the spin gap is found. This liquid shows the diverging
density wave (DW) and superconductivity (SC) correlations much stronger than
those of the spinfull electrons. Possible experimental observations are also
discussed.
