In the double beta decay experiment NEMO~3 a precise knowledge of the
background in the signal region is of outstanding importance. This article
presents the methods used in NEMO~3 to evaluate the backgrounds resulting from
most if not all possible origins. It also illustrates the power of the combined
tracking-calorimetry technique used in the experiment.
