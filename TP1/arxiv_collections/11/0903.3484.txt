In this review given at the Hot and Cool: Bridging Gaps in Massive Star
Evolution conference, I present the state of the art in red supergiant star
atmosphere modelling. The last generation of hydrostatic 1D LTE MARCS models
publicly released in 2008 have allowed great achievements in the past years,
like the calibration of effective temperature scales. I rapidly describe this
release, and then I discuss in some length the impact of the opacity sampling
approximation on the thermal structure of models and on their emergent spectra.
I also insist on limitations inherent to these models. Estimates of collisional
and radiative time scales for electronic transitions in e.g. TiO suggest that
non-LTE effects are important, and should be further investigated. Classical 1D
models are not capable either to provide the large and non-gaussian velocity
fields we know exist in red supergiants atmospheres. I therefore also present
current efforts in 3D radiative hydrodynamical simulation of RSGs. I show that
line profiles and shifts are predicted by these simulations, without the need
for fudge micro- and macroturbulence velocities. This is a great progress,
although line depths and widths are slightly too shallow. This is probably
caused by the simplified grey radiative transfer used in these heavy
simulations. Future non-grey 3D simulations should provide a better fit to
observations in terms of line strengths and widths.
