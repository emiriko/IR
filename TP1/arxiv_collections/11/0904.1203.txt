We present the 250, 350, and 500 micron detection of bright submillimeter
emission in the direction of the Bullet Cluster measured by the Balloon-borne
Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST). The 500 micron centroid is
coincident with an AzTEC 1.1 mm point-source detection at a position close to
the peak lensing magnification produced by the cluster. However, the 250 micron
and 350 micron centroids are elongated and shifted toward the south with a
differential shift between bands that cannot be explained by pointing
uncertainties. We therefore conclude that the BLAST detection is likely
contaminated by emission from foreground galaxies associated with the Bullet
Cluster. The submillimeter redshift estimate based on 250-1100 micron
photometry at the position of the AzTEC source is z_phot = 2.9 (+0.6 -0.3),
consistent with the infrared color redshift estimation of the most likely IRAC
counterpart. These flux densities indicate an apparent far-infrared luminosity
of L_FIR = 2E13 Lsun. When the amplification due to the gravitational lensing
of the cluster is removed, the intrinsic far-infrared luminosity of the source
is found to be L_FIR <= 10^12 Lsun, consistent with typical luminous infrared
galaxies.
