We investigate the physics of a charged scalar particle moving in conformally
flat spacetime with the conformal factor depending only on time in the
framework of quantum electrodynamics (QED). In particular, we show that the
radiation-reaction force derived from QED agrees with the classical counterpart
in the limit $\hbar \to 0$ using the fact that to lowest order in $\hbar$ the
charged scalar field theory with mass $m$ in conformally flat spacetime with
conformal factor $\Omega(t)$, which we call Model B, is equivalent to that in
flat spacetime with a time-dependent mass $m\Omega(t)$, which we call Model A,
at tree level in this limit. We also consider the one-loop QED corrections to
these two models in the semi-classical approximation. We find nonzero one-loop
corrections to the mass and Maxwell's equations in Model A at order
$\hbar^{-1}$. This does not mean, however, that the corresponding one-loop
corrections in Model B are nonzero because the equivalence of these models
through a conformal transformation breaks down at one loop. We find that the
one-loop corrections vanish in the limit $\hbar \to 0$ in Model B.
