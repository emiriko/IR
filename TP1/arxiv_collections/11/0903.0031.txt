New approach to design a dynamic model of genes with multiple autonomous
regulatory modules by evolution in silico is proposed. The approach is based on
Genetic Algorithms, enforced by new crossover operators, especially worked out
for these purposes. The approach exploits the subbasin-portal architecture of
the fitness functions suitable for this kind of evolutionary modeling. The
effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on a series of benchmark tests.
