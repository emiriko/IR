We present the results of a deep, wide-field transit survey targeting Hot
Jupiter planets in the Lupus region of the Galactic plane conducted over 53
nights concentrated in two epochs separated by a year. Using the Australian
National University 40-inch telescope at Siding Spring Observatory (SSO), the
survey covered a 0.66 sq. deg. region close to the Galactic Plane (b=11 deg.)
and monitored a total of 110,372 stars (15.0<V<22.0). Using difference imaging
photometry, 16,134 light curves with a photometric precision of sigma<0.025 mag
were obtained. These light curves were searched for transits, and four
candidates were detected that displayed low-amplitude variability consistent
with a transiting giant planet. Further investigations, including spectral
typing and radial velocity measurements for some candidates, revealed that of
the four, one is a true planetary companion (Lupus-TR-3), two are blended
systems (Lupus-TR-1 and 4), and one is a binary (Lupus-TR-2). The results of
this successful survey are instructive for optimizing the observational
strategy and follow-up procedure for deep searches for transiting planets,
including an upcoming survey using the SkyMapper telescope at SSO.
