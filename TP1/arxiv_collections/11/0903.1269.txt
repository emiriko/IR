Recent experiments showed that the shear modulus of solid 4He stiffens in the
same temperature range (below 200 mK) where mass decoupling and supersolidity
have been inferred from torsional oscillator measurements. The two phenomena
are clearly related and crystal defects, particularly dislocations, appear to
be involved in both. We have studied the effects of annealing and the effects
of applying large stresses on the elastic properties of solid 4He, using both
acoustic resonances and direct low-frequency and low-amplitude measurements of
the shear modulus. Both annealing and stressing affect the shear modulus, as
expected if dislocations are responsible. However, it is the high temperature
modulus which is affected; the low temperature behavior is unchanged and
appears to reflect the intrinsic modulus of solid helium. We interpret this
behavior in terms of dislocations which are pinned by isotopic 3He impurities
at low temperatures and so have no effect on the shear modulus. At higher
temperatures they become mobile and weaken the solid. Stressing the crystal at
low temperatures appears to introduce new defects or additional pinning sites
for the dislocation network but these effects can be reversed by heating the
crystal above 500 mK. This is in contrast to dislocations produced during
crystal growth, which are only annealed at temperatures close to melting.
