We propose a model of binary opinion in which the opinion of the individuals
change according to the state of their neighbouring domains. If the
neighbouring domains have opposite opinions, then the opinion of the domain
with the larger size is followed. Starting from a random configuration, the
system evolves to a homogeneous state. The dynamical evolution show novel
scaling behaviour with the persistence exponent $\theta \simeq 0.235$ and
dynamic exponent $z \simeq1.02 \pm 0.02$. Introducing disorder through a
parameter called rigidity coefficient $\rho$ (probability that people are
completely rigid and never change their opinion), the transition to a
heterogeneous society at $\rho = 0^{+}$ is obtained. Close to $\rho =0$, the
equilibrium values of the dynamic variables show power law scaling behaviour
with $\rho$. We also discuss the effect of having both quenched and annealed
disorder in the system.
