In supernova cores, nuclear "pasta" phases such as triangular lattice of
rod-like nuclei and layered structure of slab-like nuclei are considered to
exist. However, it is still unclear whether or not they are actually formed in
collapsing supernova cores. Using {\it ab-initio} numerical simulations called
the Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD), we here solve this problem by
demonstrating that a lattice of rod-like nuclei is formed from a bcc lattice by
compression. We also find that, in the transition process, the system undergoes
zigzag configuration of elongated nuclei, which are formed by a fusion of two
original spherical nuclei.
