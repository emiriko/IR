We investigate theoretically the Seebeck effect in materials close to a
ferromagnetic quantum critical point to explain anomalous behaviour at low
temperatures. It is found that the main effect of spin fluctuations is to
enhance the coefficient of the leading $T$-linear term, and a quantum critical
behaviour characterized by a spin-fluctuation temperature appears in the
temperature dependence of correction terms as in the specific heat.
