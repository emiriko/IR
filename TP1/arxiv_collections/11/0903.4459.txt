We introduce a notion of morphism of CohFT algebras, based on the analogy
with A-infinity morphisms. We discuss a "quantization" of the classical Kirwan
morphism to a morphism of CohFT algebras from the equivariant quantum
cohomology of a G-variety to the quantum cohomology of its git or symplectic
quotient, and an example relating to the orbifold quantum cohomology of a
compact toric orbifold. Finally we identify the space of Cartier divisors on
the moduli space of scaled marked curves; these appear in the splitting axiom.
