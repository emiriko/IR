A parameterization strategy for molecular models on the basis of force fields
is proposed, which allows a rapid development of models for small molecules by
using results from quantum mechanical (QM) ab initio calculations and
thermodynamic data. The geometry of the molecular models is specified according
to the atom positions determined by QM energy minimization. The electrostatic
interactions are modeled by reducing the electron density distribution to point
dipoles and point quadrupoles located in the center of mass of the molecules.
Dispersive and repulsive interactions are described by Lennard-Jones sites, for
which the parameters are iteratively optimized to experimental vapor-liquid
equilibrium (VLE) data, i.e. vapor pressure, saturated liquid density, and
enthalpy of vaporization of the considered substance. The proposed modeling
strategy was applied to a sample set of ten molecules from different substance
classes. New molecular models are presented for iso-butane, cyclohexane,
formaldehyde, dimethyl ether, sulfur dioxide, dimethyl sulfide, thiophene,
hydrogen cyanide, acetonitrile, and nitromethane. Most of the models are able
to describe the experimental VLE data with deviations of a few percent.
