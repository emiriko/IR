The near-isotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is considered to
be the strongest indication for the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe, a
cornerstone of most cosmological analysis. We derive new theorems which extend
the Ehlers-Geren-Sachs result that an isotropic CMB implies that the universe
is either stationary or homogeneous and isotropic, and its generalisation to
the almost isotropic case. We discuss why the theorems do not apply to the real
universe, and why the CMB observations do not imply that the universe would be
nearly homogeneous and isotropic.
