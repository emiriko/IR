We perform a systematic study of the phenomenology associated to models where
the dark matter consists in the neutral component of a scalar SU(2)_L n-uplet,
up to n=7. If one includes only the pure gauge induced annihilation
cross-sections it is known that such particles provide good dark matter
candidates, leading to the observed dark matter relic abundance for a
particular value of their mass around the TeV scale. We show that these values
actually become ranges of values -which we determine- if one takes into account
the annihilations induced by the various scalar couplings appearing in these
models. This leads to predictions for both direct and indirect detection
signatures as a function of the dark matter mass within these ranges. Both can
be largely enhanced by the quartic coupling contributions. We also explain how,
if one adds right-handed neutrinos to the scalar doublet case, the results of
this analysis allow to have altogether a viable dark matter candidate,
successful generation of neutrino masses, and leptogenesis in a particularly
minimal way with all new physics at the TeV scale.
