We study the finite-temperature thermodynamics of a unitary Fermi gas. The
chemical potential, energy density and entropy are given analytically with the
quasi-linear approximation. The ground state energy agrees with previous
theoretical and experimental results. Recently, the generalized exclusion
statistics is applied to the discussion of the finite-temperature unitary Fermi
gas thermodynamics. A concrete comparison between the two different approaches
is performed. Emphasis is made on the behavior of the entropy per particle. In
physics, the slope of entropy gives the information for the effective fermion
mass $m^*/m$ in the low temperature strong degenerate region. Compared with
$m^*/m \approx 0.70<1$ given in terms of the generalized exclusion statistics,
our quasi-linear approximation determines $m^*/m\approx 1.11>1$.
