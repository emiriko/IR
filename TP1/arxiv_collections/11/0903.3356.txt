We consider the case of bulk photons in a Lorentz violating brane background,
with an asymmetric warping between space and time warp factors. A perturbative
analysis, in a previous work, gave an energy dependent phase (or group)
velocity of light: $V_{ph}(\omega)=V_{ph}(0)-C_G \:\omega^2 \quad (C_G>0)$,
which was derived up to second order of time independent perturbation theory.
In this paper, we go beyond the perturbative result and we study the
nonperturbative behavior of the phase velocity for larger energies, by solving
numerically an eigenvalue problem for the wave function of the zero mode (4D
photon). In particular we see that $V_{ph}(\omega)$ is in general a
monotonically decreasing function which tends asymptotically to a final value
$V_{ph}(\infty)$. We compare with the results of perturbation theory and we
obtain a very good agreement in the range of small energies. We also present a
wave function analysis and we see that in the nonperturbative sector of the
theory (very high energies), the zero mode and the massive KK modes tend to
decouple from matter localized on the TeV brane.
