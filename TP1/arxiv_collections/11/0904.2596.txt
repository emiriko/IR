The paper assesses stationary probability distributions in out of equilibrium
systems. In the phenomenology proposed, no free energy can be well defined.
Fluctuations of Landau free energy couplings arise when the intrinsic chemical
potential leads to intrinsic disorder. The relaxation is shown to take the form
of a geometrical random process. Systems of this kind show criticality features
as well as that of first order transitions, which encapsulate in the form of a
generalized static fluctuation dissipation relation. This will help determine
three classes of distributions, which are, by defining a Hurst exponent for the
relaxation rate: the regular Maxwell-Boltzmann for all H < 1/2; the usual scale
free universal distributions with power law tails for H in ]1/2,1]; and a new
class. The latter lies in the intermediate case, when H = 1/2. The distribution
functions are scale free close to the origin, and cross-over to a
Maxwell-Boltzmann asymptotic behavior, with both the scaling exponent and an
effective temperature that depend on the magnitude of the intrinsic disorder.
