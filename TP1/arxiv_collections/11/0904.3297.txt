We present an extension of the antenna subtraction formalism at NLO to
include massive final state fermions. The basic ingredients to the subtraction
terms, the NLO massive final-final antenna functions are derived and integrated
over the corresponding factorised phase space. Those antenna functions account
for all soft, collinear and quasi-collinear limits of the QCD matrix elements
involving massive fermions in the final state.
