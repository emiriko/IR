The emission of warm dust dominates the mid-infrared spectra of active
galactic nuclei (AGN). Only interferometric observations provide the necessary
angular resolution to resolve the nuclear dust and to study its distribution
and properties. The investigation of dust in AGN cores is hence one of the main
science goals for the MID-infrared Interferometric instrument MIDI at the VLTI.
As the first step, the feasibility of AGN observations was verified and the
most promising sources for detailed studies were identified. This was carried
out in a "snapshot survey" with MIDI using Guaranteed Time Observations. In the
survey, observations were attempted for 13 of the brightest AGN in the
mid-infrared which are visible from Paranal. The results of the three
brightest, best studied sources have been published in separate papers. Here we
present the interferometric observations for the remaining 10, fainter AGN. For
8 of these, interferometric measurements could be carried out. Size estimates
or limits on the spatial extent of the AGN-heated dust were derived from the
interferometric data of 7 AGN. These indicate that the dust distributions are
compact, with sizes on the order of a few parsec. The derived sizes roughly
scale with the square root of the luminosity in the mid-infrared, s ~ sqrt(L),
with no clear distinction between type 1 and type 2 objects. This is in
agreement with a model of nearly optically thick dust structures heated to T ~
300 K. For three sources, the 10 micron feature due to silicates is tentatively
detected either in emission or in absorption. Based on the results for all AGN
studied with MIDI so far, we conclude that in the mid-infrared the differences
between individual galactic nuclei are greater than the generic differences
between type 1 and type 2 objects.
