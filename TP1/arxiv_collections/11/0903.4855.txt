Decays of B mesons to states involving tau leptons can be used as a tool to
search for the effects of new physics, such as those involving a charged Higgs
boson. The experimental status of the decays B -> tau nu and B -> D^(*) tau nu
is discussed, together with limits on new physics effects from current results.
