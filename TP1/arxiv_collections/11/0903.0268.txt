Jets and outflows produced during star-formation are observed on many scales:
from the "micro-jets" extending a few hundred Astronomical Units to the
"super-jets" propagating to parsecs distances. Recently, a new "class" of
short-lived (hundreds of nano-seconds) centimetre-long jets has emerged in the
laboratory as a complementary tool to study these complex astrophysical flows.
Here I will discuss and review the recent work done on "simulating"
protostellar jets in the laboratory using z-pinch machines.
