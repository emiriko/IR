Motivated by recent experiments on thin films of the ferromagnetic insulator
yttrium-iron garnet (YIG), we have developed an efficient microscopic approach
to calculate the spin-wave spectra of these systems. We model the
experimentally relevant magnon band of YIG using an effective quantum
Heisenberg model on a cubic lattice with ferromagnetic nearest neighbor
exchange and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. After a bosonization of the
spin degrees of freedom via a Holstein-Primakoff transformation and a
truncation at quadratic order in the bosons, we obtain the spin-wave spectra
for experimentally relevant parameters without further approximation by
numerical diagonalization, using efficient Ewald summation techniques to carry
out the dipolar sums. We compare our numerical results with two different
analytic approximations and with predictions based on the phenomenological
Landau-Lifshitz equation.
