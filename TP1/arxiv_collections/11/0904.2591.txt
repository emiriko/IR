We suggest a theory of the Field-Induced Charge-Density-Wave (FICDW) phases,
generated by high magnetic fields in quasi-low-dimensional conductors. We
demonstrate that, in layered quasi-one-dimensional conductors, the
corresponding critical magnetic fields ratios are universal and do not depend
on any fitting parameter. In particular, we find that $H_1/H_0 = 0.73, \
H_2/H_0 = 0.59, H_3/H_0 = 0.49, H_4/H_0 = 0.42$, where $H_n$ is a critical
field of a phase transition between the FICDW phases with numbers $n$ and
$n+1$. The suggested theory is in very good qualitative and quantitative
agreements with the existing experimental data in $\alpha$-(ET)$_2$KHg(SCN)$_4$
material.
