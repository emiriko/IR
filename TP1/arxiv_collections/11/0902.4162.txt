The Carina Nebula is one of the youngest, most active sites of massive star
formation in our Galaxy. In this nebula, we have discovered a bright X-ray
source that has persisted for ~30 years. The soft X-ray spectrum, consistent
with kT ~128 eV blackbody radiation with mild extinction, and no counterpart in
the near- and mid-infrared wavelengths indicate that it is a ~1e6-year-old
neutron star housed in the Carina Nebula. Current star formation theory does
not suggest that the progenitor of the neutron star and massive stars in the
Carina Nebula, in particular Eta Carinae, are coeval. This result suggests that
the Carina Nebula experienced at least two major episodes of massive star
formation. The neutron star may be responsible for remnants of high energy
activity seen in multiple wavelengths.
