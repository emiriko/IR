Two-color finite density QCD is free from the sign problem, and it is thus
regarded as a good model to check the validity of the analytic continuation
method. We study the method in terms of the corresponding chiral random matrix
model. It is found that at temperatures slightly higher than the pseudo
critical temperature, the ratio type of extrapolated function works well in
accordance with the results of the Monte Carlo simulations.
