Gossez type (D) operators are defined in non-reflexive Banach spaces and
share with the subdifferential a topological related property, characterized by
bounded nets. In this work we present new properties and characterizations of
these operators. The class (NI) was defined after Gossez defined the class (D)
and seemed to generalize the class (D). One of our main results is the proof
that these classes, type (D) and (NI), are identical.
