[abridged] Theoretical investigations have suggested the presence of
Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs, with masses in the 100-10000 Msun range)
in the cores of some Globular Clusters (GCs). In this paper we present the
first application of a new technique to determine the presence or absence of a
central IMBH in globular clusters that have reached energy equipartition via
two-body relaxation. The method is based on the measurement of the radial
profile for the average mass of stars in the system, using the fact that a
quenching of mass segregation is expected when an IMBH is present. Here we
measure the radial profile of mass segregation using main-sequence stars for
the globular cluster NGC 2298 from resolved source photometry based on HST-ACS
data. The observations are compared to expectations from direct N-body
simulations of the dynamics of star clusters with and without an IMBH. The mass
segregation profile for NGC 2298 is quantitatively matched to that inferred
from simulations without a central massive object over all the radial range
probed by the observations, that is from the center to about two half-mass
radii. Profiles from simulations containing an IMBH more massive than ~ 300-500
Msun (depending on the assumed total mass of NGC 2298) are instead inconsistent
with the data at about 3 sigma confidence, irrespective of the IMF and binary
fraction chosen for these runs. While providing a null result in the quest of
detecting a central black hole in globular clusters, the data-model comparison
carried out here demonstrates the feasibility of the method which can also be
applied to other globular clusters with resolved photometry in their cores.
