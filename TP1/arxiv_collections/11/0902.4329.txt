We propose realistic methods to detect local spin polarization, which utilize
a quantum dot side coupled to the target system. By choosing appropriate states
in the dot, we can put spin selectivity to the dot and detect spins in the
target with small disturbance. We also present an experiment which realizes one
of the proposed spin detection schemes in magnetic fields.
