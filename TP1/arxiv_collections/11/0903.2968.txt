Semi-classical methods of statistical mechanics can incorporate essential
quantum effects by using effective quantum potentials. An ideal Fermi gas
interacting with an impurity is represented by a classical fluid with effective
electron-electron and electron-impurity quantum potentials. The
electron-impurity quantum potential is evaluated at weak coupling, leading to a
generalization of the Kelbg potential to include both diffraction and
degeneracy effects. The electron-electron quantum potential for exchange
effects only is the same as that discussed earlier by others.
