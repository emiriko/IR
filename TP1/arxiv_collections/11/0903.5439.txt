We have computed dipole strength distributions for nickel and tin isotopes
within the Relativistic Quasiparticle Time Blocking approximation (RQTBA).
These calculations provide a good description of data, including the
neutron-rich tin isotopes $^{130,132}$Sn. The resulting dipole strengths have
been implemented in Hauser-Feshbach calculations of astrophysical neutron
capture rates relevant for r-process nucleosynthesis studies. The RQTBA
calculations show the presence of enhanced dipole strength at energies around
the neutron threshold for neutron rich nuclei. The computed neutron capture
rates are sensitive to the fine structure of the low lying dipole strength,
which emphasizes the importance of a reliable knowledge of this excitation
mode.
