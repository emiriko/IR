A direct visualization of the flux distribution in a Pb film covering a
five-fold Penrose array of Co dots is obtained by mapping the local field
distribution with a scanning Hall probe microscope. We demonstrate that stable
vortex configurations can be found for fields H~0.8H_1, H_1 and 1.6H_1, where
H_1 corresponds to one flux quantum per pinning site. The vortex pattern at
0.8H_1 corresponds to one vacancy in one of the vertices of the thin tiles
whereas at 1.6H_1 the vortex structure can be associated with one interstitial
vortex inside each thick tile. Strikingly, for H=1.6H_1 interstitial and pinned
vortices arrange themselves in ring-like structures ("vortex corrals") which
favor the formation of a giant vortex state at their center.
