Low frequency acoustic vibration and phonon linewidth for CdTe0.68Se0.32
nanoparticle embedded in borosilicate glass are calculated using two different
approaches by considering the elastic continuum model and fixed boundary
condition. The presence of medium significantly affects the phonon peaks and
results into the broadening of the modes. The linewidth is found to depend
inversely on the size, similar to that reported experimentally. The damping
time and quality factor have also been calculated. The damping time that is of
the order of picoseconds decreases with the decrease in size. High value of
quality factor for l=2 normal mode suggests the less loss of energy for this
mode.
