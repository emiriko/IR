We prepare real-life Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing extraction
with the forthcoming Planck satellite data, by studying two systematic effects
related to the foregrounds contamination: the impact of foreground residuals
after a component separation on the lensed CMB map, and of removing a large
contaminated region of the sky. We first use the Generalized Morphological
Component Analysis (GMCA) method to perform a component separation within a
simplified framework which allows a high statistics Monte-Carlo study. For the
second systematic, we apply a realistic mask on the temperature maps and then,
restore them using a recent inpainting technique on the sphere. We investigate
the reconstruction of the CMB lensing from the resultant maps using a quadratic
estimator in the flat sky limit and on the full sphere. We find that the
foreground residuals from the GMCA method does not alter significantly the
lensed signal, nor does the mask corrected with the inpainting method, even in
the presence of point sources residuals.
