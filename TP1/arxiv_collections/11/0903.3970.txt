We offer a perspective on some recent results obtained in the context of the
group field theory approach to quantum gravity, on top of reviewing them
briefly. These concern a natural mechanism for the emergence of non-commutative
field theories for matter directly from the GFT action, in both 3 and 4
dimensions and in both Riemannian and Lorentzian signatures. As such they
represent an important step, we argue, in bridging the gap between a quantum,
discrete picture of a pre-geometric spacetime and the effective continuum
geometric physics of gravity and matter, using ideas and tools from field
theory and condensed matter analog gravity models, applied directly at the GFT
level.
