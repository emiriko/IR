We present the results of spectroscopic observations of eight globular
cluster candidates in NGC147, a satellite dwarf elliptical galaxy of M31. Our
goal is to make a complete inventory of the globular cluster system of this
galaxy, determine the properties of their stellar populations, and compare
these properties with those of systems of globular clusters in other dwarf
galaxies. The candidates were identified on Canada-France-Hawaii telescope
photographic plates. Medium resolution spectra were obtained with the SCORPIO
spectrograph at the prime focus of the 6m telescope of the Russian Academy of
Sciences. We were able to confirm the nature of all eight candidates, three of
which (GC5, GC7, and GC10) are indeed globular clusters, and to estimate
evolutionary parameters for the two brightest ones and for Hodge II. The bright
clusters GC5 and GC7 appear to have metallicities ([Z/H]~ -1.5- -1.8) that are
lower than the oldest stars in the galaxy. The fainter GC Hodge II has a
metallicity [Z/H]=-1.1 dex, similar to that of the oldest stars in the galaxy.
The clusters GC5 and GC7 have low alpha-element abundance ratios. The mean age
of the globular clusters in NGC147 is 9+-1 Gyr. The frequency, S_n =6.4, and
mass fraction, T=14 of globular clusters in NGC147 appear to be higher than
those for NGC185 and 205. (Abridged)
