We prove an analytic positive lower bound for the geometric distance between
entangled positive partial transpose (PPT) states of a broad class and any
private state that delivers one secure key bit. Our proof holds for any Hilbert
space of finite dimension. Although our result is proven for a specific class
of PPT states, we show that our bound nonetheless holds for all known entangled
PPT states with non-zero distillable key rates whether or not they are in our
special class.
