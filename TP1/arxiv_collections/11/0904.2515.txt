We have quantified collisional losses, decoherence and the collision shift in
a one-dimensional optical lattice clock with bosonic 88Sr. The lattice clock is
referenced to the highly forbidden transition 1S0 - 3P0 at 698 nm, which
becomes weakly allowed due to state mixing in a homogeneous magnetic field. We
were able to quantify three decoherence coefficients, which are due to
dephasing collisions, inelastic collisions between atoms in the upper and lower
clock state, and atoms in the upper clock state only. Based on the measured
coefficients, we determine the operation parameters at which a 1D-lattice clock
with 88Sr shows no degradation due to collisions on the relative accuracy level
of 10-16.
