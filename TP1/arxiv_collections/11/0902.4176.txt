We consider collective excitations in graphene with filled Landau levels
(LL's) in the presence of an external potential due to a single charged donor
D+ or acceptor A- impurity. We show that localized collective modes split off
the magnetoplasmon continuum and, in addition, quasibound states are formed
within the continuum. A study of the evolution of the strengths and energies of
magneto-optical transitions is performed for integer filling factors nu = 1, 2,
3, 4 of the lowest LL. We predict impurity absorption peaks above as well as
below the cyclotron resonance. We show that the single particle electron-hole
symmetry of graphene leads to a duality between the spectra of collective modes
for the D+ and A-. The duality shows up as a set of the D+ and A-
magneto-absorption peaks having same energies, but active in different circular
polarizations.
