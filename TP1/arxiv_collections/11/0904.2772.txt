We study a Chandra X-ray Observatory ACIS-S observation of the Galactic
globular clusterM12. With a 26 ks exposure time, we detect 6 X-ray sources
inside the half-mass radius (2.16 arcminutes) of which two are inside the core
radius (0.72 arcminutes) of the cluster. If we assume these sources are all
associated with globular cluster M12, the luminosity L_{X} among these sources
between 0.3-7.0 keV varies roughly from 10^{30} to 10^{32} ergs s^{-1}. For
identification, we also analyzed the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced
Camera for Surveys (ACS) and Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) data and
identified the optical counterparts to five X-ray sources inside the HST ACS
field of view. According to the X-ray and optical features, we found 2-5
candidate active binaries (ABs) or cataclysmic variables (CVs) and 0-3
background galaxies within the HST ACS field of view. Based on the assumption
that the number of X-ray sources scales with the encounter rate and the mass of
the globular cluster, we expect 2 X-ray source inside M12, and the expectation
is consistent with our observational results. Therefore, the existence of
identified X-ray sources (possible CVs or ABs) in M12 suggests the primordial
origin of X-ray sources in globular clusters which is in agreement with
previous studies.
