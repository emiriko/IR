Ring topology is a simple configuration used to connect processes that
communicate among themselves. A number of network standards such as token ring,
token bus, and FDDI are based on the ring connectivity. This article will
develop an implementation of a ring of processes that communicate among
themselves via pipe links. The processes are nodes in the ring. Each process
reads from its standard input and writes in its standard output. N-1 process
redirects the its standard output to a standard input of the process through a
pipe. When the ring-structure is designed, the project can be extended to
simulate networks or to implement algorithms for mutual exclusion.
