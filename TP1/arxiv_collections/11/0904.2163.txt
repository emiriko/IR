The measurement by the BES collaboration of J/psi -> gamma p pbar decays
indicates an enhancement at the p-pbar threshold. In another experiment BES
finds a peak in the invariant mass of pi-mesons produced in the possibly
related decay J/psi -> gamma pi+ pi- eta'. Using a semi-phenomenological
potential model which describes all the N-Nbar scattering data, we show that
the explanation of both effects may be given by a broad quasi-bound state in
the spin and isospin singlet S wave. The structure of the observed peak is due
to an interference of this quasi-bound state with a background amplitude and
depends on the annihilation mechanism.
