Based on the method which is given in Ref. [Sun et.al. arXiv:0904.0092v1], we
present another $9\times 9$ unitary $\breve{R}-$matrix, solution of the
Yang-Baxter Equation, is obtained in this paper. The entanglement properties of
$\breve{R}-$matrix is investigated, and the arbitrary degree of entanglement
for two-qutrit entangled states can be generated via $\breve{R}$-matrix acting
on the standard basis. A Yang-Baxter Hamiltonian can be constructed from
unitary $\breve{R}-$matrix. Then the geometric properties of this system is
studied. The results showed that the Berry phase of this system can be
represented under the framework of SU(2) algebra.
