We have developed a Prolog visualization system that is intended to support
Prolog programming education. The system uses Logichart diagrams to visualize
Prolog programs. The Logichart diagram is designed to visualize the Prolog
execution flow intelligibly and to enable users to easily correlate the Prolog
clauses with its parts. The system has the following functions. (1) It visually
traces Prolog execution (goal calling, success, and failure) on the Logichart
diagram. (2) Dynamic change in a Prolog program by calling extra-logical
predicates, such as `assertz' and `retract', is visualized in real time. (3)
Variable substitution processes are displayed in a text widget in real time.
