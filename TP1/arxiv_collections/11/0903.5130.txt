The excitation and subsequent proton decay of the isoscalar giant dipole
resonance (ISGDR) in $^{208}$Pb have been investigated via the
$^{208}$Pb($\alpha, \alpha^{\prime}p)^{207}$Tl reaction at 400 MeV. Excitation
of the ISGDR has been identified by the difference-of-spectra method. The
enhancement of the ISGDR strength at high excitation energies observed in the
multipole-decomposition-analysis of the singles
$^{208}$Pb($\alpha,\alpha^{\prime}$) spectra is not present in the excitation
energy spectrum obtained in coincidence measurement. The partial branching
ratios for direct proton decay of ISGDR to low-lying states of $^{207}$Tl have
been determined and the results are compared with predictions of continuum
random-phase-approximation (CRPA) calculations.
