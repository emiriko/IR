For the first time, we calculate the heating rate, attractive conservative
and tangential dissipative fluctuation electromagnetic forces felt by a thick
plate moving parallel to a closely spaced another plate in rest using a
nonrelativistic approximation of fluctuation electrodynamics. These results can
be considered as the high lights when solving general relativistic problem of
the fluctuation electromagnetic interaction in configuration of two perfectly
smooth parallel thick plates in relative motion.
