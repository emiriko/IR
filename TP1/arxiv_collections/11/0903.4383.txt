Using the mixed Lie algebras of Lazard, we extend the results of the first
author on mild groups to the case p=2. In particular, we show that for any
finite set S_0 of odd rational primes we can find a finite set S of odd
rational primes containing S_0 such that the Galois group of the maximal
2-extension of Q unramified outside S is mild. We thus produce a projective
system of such Galois groups which converge to the maximal pro-2-quotient of
the absolute Galois group of $\Q$ unramified at 2 and $\infty$. Our results
also allow results of Alexander Schmidt on pro-p-fundamental groups of marked
arithmetic curves to be extended to the case p=2 over a global field which is
either a function field of odd characteristic or a totally imaginary number
field.
