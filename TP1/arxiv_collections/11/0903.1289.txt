We present mid-infrared spectra of sixteen optically faint sources with 70
micron fluxes in the range 19-38mJy. The sample spans a redshift range of
0.35<z<1.9, with most lying between 0.8<z<1.6, and has infrared luminosities of
10^{12} - 10^{13} solar luminosities. Ten of 16 objects show prominent
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features; four of 16 show weak
PAHs and strong silicate absorption, and two objects have no discernable
spectral features. Compared to samples with 24 micron fluxes >10mJy, the 70\um
sample has steeper IR continua and higher luminosities. The PAH dominated
sources are among the brightest starbursts seen at any redshift, and reside in
a redshift range where other selection methods turn up relatively few sources.
The absorbed sources are at higher redshifts and have higher luminosities than
the PAH dominated sources, and may show weaker luminosity evolution. We
conclude that a 70 micron selection extending to ~20mJy, in combination with
selections at mid-IR and far-IR wavelengths, is necessary to obtain a complete
picture of the evolution of IR-luminous galaxies over 0<z<2.
