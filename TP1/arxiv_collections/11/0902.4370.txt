High purity germanium (HPGe) detectors are ubiquitous in nuclear physics
experiments and are also used in numerous low radioactive background detectors.
The effect of the position of $^{60}$Co and $^{137}$Cs point sources on the
shape of spectra were studied with Monte Carlo and HPGe detector measurements.
We briefly confirm previous work on the position dependence of relative heights
of peaks. Spectra taken with the radiation sources placed at locations around
the detector were then compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S)
goodness-of-fit test. We demonstrate that with this method the Compton
continuum spectral shape has good sensitivity to the radial location of a
point-source, but poor angular resolution. We conclude with a study of the
position reconstruction accuracy as a function of the number of counts from the
source.
