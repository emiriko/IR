This paper introduces a new approach to solve sensor management problems.
Classically sensor management problems can be well formalized as
Partially-Observed Markov Decision Processes (POMPD). The original approach
developped here consists in deriving the optimal parameterized policy based on
a stochastic gradient estimation. We assume in this work that it is possible to
learn the optimal policy off-line (in simulation) using models of the
environement and of the sensor(s). The learned policy can then be used to
manage the sensor(s). In order to approximate the gradient in a stochastic
context, we introduce a new method to approximate the gradient, based on
Infinitesimal Perturbation Approximation (IPA). The effectiveness of this
general framework is illustrated by the managing of an Electronically Scanned
Array Radar. First simulations results are finally proposed.
