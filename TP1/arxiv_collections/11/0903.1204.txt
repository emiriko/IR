In this note is touched upon an application of quantum information science
(QIS) in nanotechnology area. The laws of quantum mechanics may be very
important for nano-scale objects. A problem with simulating of quantum systems
is well known and quantum computer was initially suggested by R. Feynman just
as the way to overcome such difficulties. Mathematical methods developed in QIS
also may be applied for description of nano-devices. Few illustrative examples
are mentioned and they may be related with so-called fourth generation of
nanotechnology products.
