The data on arrival directions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs)
detected with the Yakutsk array are analyzed. The work is induced by the recent
claim of the Pierre Auger collaboration for the significant correlation found
between UHECRs and positions of nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) on the
celestial sphere; and no correlation the HiRes collaboration stands for.
Conflicting data of four giant arrays concern possible extragalactic sources of
UHECRs and appeal to the profound analysis and to the future data from the
Telescope Array/Northern Auger Observatory.
