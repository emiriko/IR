This letter reports the nucleon-nucleon($NN$) interaction obtained from
multi-channel, including hidden color channels, coupling quark model
calculation. The results show that the hidden color channels coupling provides
the intermediate range attraction which is usually assumed to be due to
multi-$\pi$ or $\sigma$ meson exchange and that the short and intermediate
range $NN$ interaction can be described solely by the fundamental quark-gluon
degree of freedom of QCD.
