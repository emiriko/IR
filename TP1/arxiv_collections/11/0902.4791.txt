We present a systematic fit of a model of resonant cyclotron scattering (RCS)
to the X and soft gamma-ray data of four magnetars, including anomalous X-ray
pulsars, and soft gamma repeaters. In this scenario, non-thermal magnetar
spectra in the soft X-rays result from resonant cyclotron scattering of the
thermal surface emission by hot magnetospheric plasma. We find that this model
can successfully account for the soft X-ray emission of magnetars, while an
additional component is still required to model the hard X-ray persistent
magnetar emission recently discovered by INTEGRAL. The latter is an important
component in terms of magnetars' luminosity, and cannot be neglected when
modelling the soft X-ray part of the spectrum.
