Experimental results are presented on anomalous behavior of absorption
currents in PVDF during the stepwise increase of the voltage applied through a
corona. These results, supplemented with the dynamics of the time constant of
the electret potential decay are consistent with a hypothesis assuming deep
trapping of the charge carriers during the polarization buildup in
ferroelectric polymers. Model calculations are made on distribution of the
potential energy at the surface of the polarized crystallites proving that
additional sites for the charge trapping are created there.
