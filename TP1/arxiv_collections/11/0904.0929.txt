A measurement of the inclusive ep scattering cross section is presented in
the region of low momentum transfers, 0.2 GeV^2 < Q^2 < 12 GeV^2, and low
Bjorken x, 5x10^-6 < x < 0.02. The result is based on two data sets collected
in dedicated runs by the H1 Collaboration at HERA at beam energies of 27.6 GeV
and 920 GeV for positrons and protons, respectively. A combination with data
previously published by H1 leads to a cross section measurement of a few
percent accuracy. A kinematic reconstruction method exploiting radiative ep
events extends the measurement to lower Q^2 and larger x. The data are compared
with theoretical models which apply to the transition region from
photoproduction to deep inelastic scattering.
