We study 1S0 pairing gaps in neutron and nuclear matter as well as in finite
nuclei on the basis of microscopic two-nucleon interactions. Special attention
is paid to the consistency of the pairing interaction and normal self-energy
contributions. We find that pairing gaps obtained from low-momentum
interactions depend only weakly on approximation schemes for the normal
self-energy, required in present energy-density functional calculations, while
pairing gaps from hard potentials are very sensitive to the effective-mass
approximation scheme.
