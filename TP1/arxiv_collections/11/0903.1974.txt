In January 2009, multiple short bursts of soft gamma-rays were detected from
the direction of the anomalous X-ray pulsar 1E 1547.0-5408 by different
satellites. Here we report on the observations obtained with the INTEGRAL
SPI-ACS detector during the period with the strongest bursting activity. More
than 200 bursts were detected at energies above 80 keV in a few hours on
January 22. Among these, two remarkably bright events showed pulsating tails
lasting several seconds and modulated at the 2.1 s spin period of 1E
1547.0-5408. The energy released in the brightest of these bursts was of a few
10^43 erg, for an assumed distance of 10 kpc. This is smaller than that of the
three giant flares seen from soft gamma-ray repeaters, but higher than that of
typical bursts from soft gamma-ray repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars.
