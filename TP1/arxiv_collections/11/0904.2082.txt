With the standard system for an SU(2) Higgs field in M_4 X S_1, the top and
bottom component of the Higgs spinor have exactly the same coeficients for the
quadratic and quadric terms. This makes the vacuum degenerate and thus there
are no tunneling effects to zeroth order in radiative corrections of the vector
gauge felds in the standard model with this extra dimensional geometry.
However, if we include an external magnetic flux that permeates our manifold,
then the top component of the Higgs spinor will have an additional term in its
coefficient due to this theoretical flux with the usual charge assignments for
the standard model. This extra term gives rise to two nondegenerate vacuum
states for the resulting potential. We will compute the tunneling probability
per unit time per unit volume between these vacuum states for the zero modes of
our system as well as investigate the masses for the fields of the model using
the false vacuum.
