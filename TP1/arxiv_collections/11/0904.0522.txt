Large amplitude water waves on deep water has long been known in the sea
faring community, and the cause of great concern for, e.g., oil platform
constructions. The concept of such freak waves is nowadays, thanks to satellite
and radar measurements, well established within the scientific community. There
are a number of important models and approaches for the theoretical description
of such waves. By analyzing the scaling behavior of freak wave formation in a
model of two interacting waves, described by two coupled nonlinear Schroedinger
equations, we show that there are two different dynamical scaling behaviors
above and below a critical angle theta_c of the direction of the interacting
waves below theta_c all wave systems evolve and display statistics similar to a
wave system of non-interacting waves. The results equally apply to other
systems described by the nonlinear Schroedinger equations, and should be of
interest when designing optical wave guides.
