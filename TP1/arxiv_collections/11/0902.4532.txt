We describe a scenario for the topology of the magnetic field in penumbrae
that accounts for recent observations showing upflows, downflows, and reverse
magnetic polarities. According to our conjecture, short narrow magnetic loops
fill the penumbral photosphere. Flows along these arched field lines are
responsible for both the Evershed effect and the convective transport. This
scenario seems to be qualitatively consistent with most existing observations,
including the dark cores in penumbral filaments reported by Scharmer et al.
Each bright filament with dark core would be a system of two paired convective
rolls with the dark core tracing the common lane where the plasma sinks down.
The magnetic loops would have a hot footpoint in one of the bright filament and
a cold footpoint in the dark core. The scenario fits in most of our theoretical
prejudices (siphon flows along field lines, presence of overturning convection,
drag of field lines by downdrafts, etc). If the conjecture turns out to be
correct, the mild upward and downward velocities observed in penumbrae must
increase upon improving the resolution. This and other observational tests to
support or disprove the scenario are put forward.
