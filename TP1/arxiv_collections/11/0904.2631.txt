We study non-abelian discrete flavor symmetries, which can appear in
magnetized brane models. For example, $D_4$, $\Delta(27)$ and $\Delta(54)$ can
appear and matter fields with several representations can appear. We also study
the orbifold background, where non-abelian flavor symmetries are broken in a
certain way.
