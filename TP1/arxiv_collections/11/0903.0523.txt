In this paper we review some properties of fuzzy observables, mainly as
realized by commutative positive operator valued measures. In this context we
discuss two representation theorems for commutative positive operator valued
measures in terms of projection valued measures and describe, in some detail,
the general notion of fuzzification. We also make some related observations on
joint measurements.
