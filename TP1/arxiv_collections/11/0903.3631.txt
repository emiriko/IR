In this paper we develop an analytical framework for the study of
electrochemical impedance of mixed ionic and electronic conductors (MIEC). The
framework is based on first-principles and it features the coupling of
electrochemical reactions, surface transport and bulk transport processes. We
utilize this work to analyze two dimensional systems relevant for fuel cell
science via finite element method (FEM). Alternate current Impedance
Spectroscopy (IS) of a ceria symmetric cell is simulated near equilibrium
condition (zero bias) for a wide array of working conditions including
variations of temperature and $H_2$ partial pressure on a two dimensional fuel
cell sample with patterned metal electrodes. The model shows agreement of IS
curves with the experimental literature with the relative error on the
impedance being consistently below 2%. Important two-dimensional effects such
the effects of thickness decrease and the influence of variable electronic and
ionic diffusivities on the impedance spectra are also explored.
