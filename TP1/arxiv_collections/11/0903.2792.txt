In this work, we suggest a parameterized statistical model (the gamma
distribution) for the frequency of word occurrences in long strings of English
text and use this model to build a corresponding thermodynamic picture by
constructing the partition function. We then use our partition function to
compute thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy and the specific heat.
In this approach, the parameters of the word frequency model vary from word to
word so that each word has a different corresponding thermodynamics and we
suggest that differences in the specific heat reflect differences in how the
words are used in language, differentiating keywords from common and function
words. Finally, we apply our thermodynamic picture to the problem of retrieval
of texts based on keywords and suggest some advantages over traditional
information retrieval methods.
