We propose two experiments to probe the Majorana fermion edge states that
occur at a junction between a superconductor and a magnet deposited on the
surface of a topological insulator. Combining two Majorana fermions into a
single Dirac fermion on a magnetic domain wall allows the neutral Majorana
fermions to be probed with charge transport. We will discuss a novel
interferometer for Majorana fermions, which probes their Z_2 phase. This setup
also allows the transmission of neutral Majorana fermions through a point
contact to be measured. We introduce a point contact formed by a
superconducting junction and show that its transmission can be controlled by
the phase difference across the junction. We discuss the feasibility of these
experiments using the recently discovered topological insulator Bi_2 Se_3.
