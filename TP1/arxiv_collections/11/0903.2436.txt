By restricting the motion of high-mobility 2D electron gas to a network of
channels with smooth confinement, we were able to trace, both classically and
quantum-mechanically, the interplay of backscattering, and of the bending
action of a weak magnetic field. Backscattering limits the mobility, while
bending initiates quantization of the Hall conductivity. We demonstrate that,
in restricted geometry, electron motion reduces to two Chalker-Coddington
networks, with opposite directions of propagation along the links, which are
weakly coupled by disorder. Interplay of backscattering and bending results in
the quantum Hall transition in a non-quantizing magnetic field, which decreases
with increasing mobility. This is in accord with scenario of floating up
delocalized states.
