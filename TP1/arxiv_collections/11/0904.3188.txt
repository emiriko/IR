In this Letter we describe a vacuum spherical capacitor that generates a
macroscopic voltage between its spheres harnessing the heat from a single
thermal reservoir at room temperature. The basic idea is trivial and it makes
use of two concentric spherical electrodes with different work functions. We
provide a mathematical analysis of the underlying physical process and discuss
its connections with the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
