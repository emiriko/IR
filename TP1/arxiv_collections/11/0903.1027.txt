We present optical R-band light curves of five SDSS double QSOs (SDSS
J0903+5028, SDSS J1001+5027, SDSS J1206+4332, SDSS J1353+1138, SDSS J1335+0118)
obtained from monitoring at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) between
September 2005 and September 2007. We also present analytical and pixelated
modeling of the observed systems. For SDSS J1206+4332, we measured the time
delay to be 116 days, which, for a Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid model,
corresponds to a Hubble constant of 73 km/s/Mpc. Simultaneous pixeleted
modeling of five other systems for which a time delay has now been previously
measured at the NOT leads to H_0 = 61.5 km/s/Mpc. Finally, by comparing
lightcurves of the two images of each system, suitably shifted by the predicted
or observed time-delays, we found no evidence for microlensing variability over
the course of the monitoring period.
