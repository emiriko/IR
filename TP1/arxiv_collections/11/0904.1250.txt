In this paper, we reconsider the energy and tension laws of the Ricci flat
black hole by taking the contribution of the tension term into account. After
this considering and inspired by the interchange symmetry between the Ricci
flat black hole and the AdS soliton solution which arises from the double
analytic continuation of the time and compact spatial direction, we find out
the analogy of the energy and tension laws of the AdS soliton solution.
Moreover, we also investigate the energy and tension laws of the boosted Ricci
flat black hole, and discuss the boosted AdS soliton solution. However,
although there is the same interchange symmetry between the boosted Ricci flat
black hole and boosted AdS soliton, the analogy of laws of the boosted AdS
soliton solution may be of no sense for the existence of the closed timelike
curves and conical singularity. In spite of that, the conserved charges such as
the energy and momentum of the boosted AdS soliton are well-defined, and an
interesting result is that its energy is lower than that of the static AdS
soliton. On the other hand, note that although the laws obtained above are the
same as those of the asymptotically flat case, the underlying deduced contents
are different. Thus, our results could also be considered as a simple
generalization to the asymptotically AdS case. Moreover, during the
calculation, we find that there may be a new way to define the gravitational
tension which can come from the quasi-local stress tensor of the counter-term
method.
