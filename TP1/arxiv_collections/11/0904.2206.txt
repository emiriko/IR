The long GRB 050730 observed at redshift z ~ 4 allowed the determination of
the elemental abundances for a set of different chemical elements. We use
detailed chemical evolution models taking into account also dust production to
constrain the star formation history of the host galaxy of this long GRB. For
the host galaxy of GRB 050730, we derive also some dust-related quantities and
the the specific star formation rate, namely the star formation rate per unit
stellar mass. We copare the properties of the GRB host galaxy with the ones of
Quasar Damped Lyman Alpha absorbers.
