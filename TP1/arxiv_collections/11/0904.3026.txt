In response to ESO's call for proposals for second generation instruments for
the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), a consortium is currently
developing the VLTI-Spectro-Imager (VSI). In the context of the Phase A study,
a science group has prepared a science case taking advantage of the expected
performances of VSI. Among several science topics, the case of dust making
Wolf-Rayet binaries producing the so-called pinwheel nebulae has been
considered. Here, we review the main specifications of VSI, and we provide
preliminary results expected to illustrate the imaging capabilities of VSI, and
the interest for the study of pinwheel nebulae similar to those formed close to
well-known systems such as WR98a and WR104.
