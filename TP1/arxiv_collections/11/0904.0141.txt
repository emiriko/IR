Warp drives are very interesting configurations in General Relativity: At
least theoretically, they provide a way to travel at superluminal speeds,
albeit at the cost of requiring exotic matter to exist as solutions of
Einstein's equations. However, even if one succeeded in providing the necessary
exotic matter to build them, it would still be necessary to check whether they
would survive to the switching on of quantum effects. Semiclassical corrections
to warp-drive geometries have been analyzed only for eternal warp-drive bubbles
traveling at fixed superluminal speeds. Here, we investigate the more realistic
case in which a superluminal warp drive is created out of an initially flat
spacetime. First of all we analyze the causal structure of eternal and
dynamical warp-drive spacetimes. Then we pass to the analysis of the
renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) of a quantum field in these
geometries. While the behavior of the RSET in these geometries has close
similarities to that in the geometries associated with gravitational collapse,
it shows dramatic differences too. On one side, an observer located at the
center of a superluminal warp-drive bubble would generically experience a
thermal flux of Hawking particles. On the other side, such Hawking flux will be
generically extremely high if the exotic matter supporting the warp drive has
its origin in a quantum field satisfying some form of Quantum Inequalities.
Most of all, we find that the RSET will exponentially grow in time close to,
and on, the front wall of the superluminal bubble. Consequently, one is led to
conclude that the warp-drive geometries are unstable against semiclassical
back-reaction.
