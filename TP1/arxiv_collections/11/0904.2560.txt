Galois rings are regarded as "building blocks" of a finite commutative ring
with identity. There have been many papers on classical error correction codes
over Galois rings published. As an important warm-up before exploring quantum
algorithms and quantum error correction codes over Galois rings, we study the
quantum Fourier transform (QFT) over Galois rings and prove it can be
efficiently preformed on a quantum computer. The properties of the QFT over
Galois rings lead to the quantum algorithm for hidden linear structures over
Galois rings.
