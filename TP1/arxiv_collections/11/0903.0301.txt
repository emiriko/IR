Two-photon annihilate contributions in the process $e^+ + e^- \to p +
\bar{p}$ including $N$ and $\Delta$ intermediate are discussed in a simple
hadronic model. The corrections to the unpolarized cross section and polarized
observables $P_x,P_z$ are presented. The results show the two-photon annihilate
correction to unpolarized cross section is small and its angle dependence
becomes weak at small $s$ after considering the $N$ and $\Delta(1232)$
contributions simultaneously, while the correction to $P_z$ is enhanced.
