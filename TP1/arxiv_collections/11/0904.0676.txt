We continue the study of quivers with potentials and their representations
initiated in the first paper of the series. Here we develop some applications
of this theory to cluster algebras. As shown in the "Cluster algebras IV"
paper, the cluster algebra structure is to a large extent controlled by a
family of integer vectors called g-vectors, and a family of integer polynomials
called F-polynomials. In the case of skew-symmetric exchange matrices we find
an interpretation of these g-vectors and F-polynomials in terms of (decorated)
representations of quivers with potentials. Using this interpretation, we prove
most of the conjectures about g-vectors and F-polynomials made in loc. cit.
