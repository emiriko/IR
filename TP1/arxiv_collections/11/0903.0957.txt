In nuclear collisions, a sizable fraction of the available energy is carried
away by baryons. As the baryon number is conserved, the net-baryon $B-\bar{B}$
retains information on the energy-momentum carried by the incoming nuclei. A
simple and consistent model for net-baryon production in high energy
proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus collisions is presented. The basic
ingredients of the model are valence string formation based on standard PDFs
with QCD evolution and string fragmentation via the Schwinger mechanism. The
results of the model are presented and compared with data at different
centre-of-mass energies and centralities, as well as with existing models.
These results show that a good description of the main features of net-baryon
data is possible in the framework of a simplistic model, with the advantage of
making the fundamental production mechanisms manifest.
