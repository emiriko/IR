A simulation of de-biased population of NEAs is presented. The numerical
integration of modeled orbits reveals geometrical conditions of close
approaching NEAs to the Earth. The population with the absolute magnitude up to
H=28 is simulated during one year. The probability of possible discoveries of
the objects in the Earth vicinity is discussed.
