The intrinsic spin-Hall effects (SHE) in $p$-doped semiconductors [S.
Murakami et al., Science 301, 1348 (2003)] and two-dimensional electron gases
with Rashba spin-orbit coupling [J. Sinova et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 126603
(2004)] have been the subject of many theoretical studies, but their driving
mechanisms have yet to be described in a unified manner. The former effect
arises from the adiabatic topological curvature of momentum space, from which
holes acquire a spin-dependent anomalous velocity. The SHE in the Rashba
system, on the other hand, results from the momentum-dependent spin dynamics in
the presence of an external electric field. The two effects clearly appear to
originate from distinct mechanisms. Our motivation for this article is to
address this apparent disparity and, in particular, to seek a unifying
description of the effects. In this endeavor, we consider the explicit
time-dependence of SHE systems starting with a general spin-orbit model. We
find that by performing a gauge transformation of the general model with
respect to time, a well-defined gauge field appears in time space which has the
physical significance of an effective magnetic field. This magnetic field is
shown to precisely account for the SHE in the Rashba system in the adiabatic
limit. Remarkably, by carefully analyzing the equation of motion of the general
model, this field component is also found to be the origin of the anomalous
velocity due to the momentum space curvature. Our study therefore unifies the
two seemingly disparate intrinsic SHEs under a common adiabatic framework.
