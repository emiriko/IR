The detection of extrasolar planets' atmospheres requires very demanding
observations. For planets that can not be spatially separated from their host
stars, i.e. the vast majority of planets, the transiting planets are the only
ones allowing to probe their atmospheres. This is possible from transmission
spectroscopy or from measurements taken during secondary eclipse. An
alternative is the measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin-effect, which is
sensitive to the size of the planetary radius. Since the radius is
wavelength-dependent due to contributions of strong planetary absorption lines,
this opens a path to probe planetary atmospheres also with ground-based
high-resolution spectroscopy. The major goal of our numerical simulations is to
provide a reliable estimate of the amplitude of the wavelength-dependent
RM-effect. Our numerical simulations provide phase resolved synthetic spectra
modeling the partly eclipsed stellar surface during the transit in detail.
Using these spectra we can obtain RM-curves for different wavelength regions
and for a wavelength-dependent planetary radius. Curves from regions with high
and low contributions of absorption lines within the planetary atmosphere can
be compared. From these differential effects observable quantities are derived.
We applied our simulations to HD209458. Our numerical simulations show that a
detailed treatment of the limb darkening for the synthetic spectra is important
for a precise analysis. Compared to a parameterized limb darkening law,
systematic errors of 6 m/sec occur. The wavelength dependency of the planetary
atmospheres over the NaD-doublet produce a differential effect in the RM-curve
of 1.5 m/sec for a star with a rotation velocity of 4.5 km/sec which increases
to 4 m/sec for twice the rotation velocity.
