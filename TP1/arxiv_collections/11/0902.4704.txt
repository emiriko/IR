High signal-to-noise, representative spectra of star-forming galaxies at z~2,
obtained via stacking, reveal a high-velocity component underneath the narrow
H-alpha and [NII] emission lines. When modeled as a single Gaussian, this broad
component has FWHM > 1500 km/s; when modeled as broad wings on the H-alpha and
[NII] features, it has FWHM > 500 km/s. This feature is preferentially found in
the more massive and more rapidly star-forming systems, which also tend to be
older and larger galaxies. We interpret this emission as evidence of either
powerful starburst-driven galactic winds or active supermassive black holes. If
galactic winds are responsible for the broad emission, the observed luminosity
and velocity of this gas imply mass outflow rates comparable to the star
formation rate. On the other hand, if the broad line regions of active black
holes account for the broad feature, the corresponding black holes masses are
estimated to be an order of magnitude lower than those predicted by local
scaling relations, suggesting a delayed assembly of supermassive black holes
with respect to their host bulges.
