It has been argued by several authors that the space-time curvature observed
in gravitational fields, and the same idea of forms of physical equivalence
different from the Lorentz group, might emerge from the dynamical properties of
the physical flat-space vacuum in a suitable hydrodynamic limit. To explore
this idea, one could start by representing the physical vacuum as a Bose
condensate of elementary quanta and look for vacuum excitations that, on a
coarse grained scale, resemble the Newtonian potential. In this way, it is
relatively easy to match the weak-field limit of classical General Relativity
or of some of its possible variants. The idea that Bose condensates can provide
various forms of gravitational dynamics is not new. Here, I want to emphasize
some genuine quantum field theoretical aspects that can help to understand i)
why infinitesimally weak, 1/r interactions can indeed arise from the same
physical vacuum of electroweak and strong interactions and ii) why, on a
coarse-grained scale, their dynamical effects can be re-absorbed into an
effective curved metric structure.
