Let $K$ be a compact metrizable group and $\Ga$ be a finitely generated group
of commuting automorphisms of $K$. We show that ergodicity of $\Ga$ implies
$\Ga$ contains ergodic automorphisms if center of the action, $Z(\Ga) = \{\ap
\in {\rm Aut}(K) \mid \ap {\rm commutes with elements of \rm} \Ga \}$ has DCC.
To explain that the condition on the center of the action is not restrictive,
we discuss certain abelian groups which in particular, retrieves Theorems of
Berend \cite{Be} and Schmidt \cite{Sc1} proved in this context.
