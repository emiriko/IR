High-pT particle production is suppressed in heavy ion collisions due to
parton energy loss in dense QCD matter. Here we present a systematic comparison
of two different theoretical approximations to parton energy loss calculations:
the opacity expansion and the multiple-soft scattering approximation for the
simple case of a quark traversing a homogeneous piece of matter with fixed
length (the TECHQM 'brick problem'), with focus on the range of parameters that
is relevant for interpreting RHIC measurements of high-pT hadron suppression.
