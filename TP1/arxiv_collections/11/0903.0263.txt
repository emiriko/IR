Recent measurements of kaon decays provide new information about CKM
unitarity, lepton universality, and discrete symmetries. KLOE-2, the proposed
extension of the kaon physics program at Frascati, will extend the world data
set on kaon decays and conduct interference measurements with neutral kaons.
Meanwhile, the decays K \to \pi\nu\bar{\nu} can be directly related to the CKM
matrix elements with minimal theoretical uncertainty, and are the focus of a
series of experiments. Several events of K+ \to \pi+\nu\bar{\nu} have been
observed to date; the goal of the NA62 experiment at CERN is to perform an
O(100)-event measurement in this channel. Initiatives in Japan--the E391a
experiment at KEK, to become E14 at J-PARC--are focused on collecting a few KL
\to \pi0\nu\bar{\nu} events in a first step, while working towards an
O(100)-event measurement. Experiments capable of performing O(1000)-event
measurements in both channels have been discussed.
