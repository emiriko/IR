We propose a protocol of the long-distance atomic state teleportation via
cavity decay, which allows for high-fidelity teleportation even with currently
available optical cavities. The protocol is based on the scheme proposed by
Bose \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\textbf{83}}, 5158 (1999)] but with one
important modification: it employs non-maximally-entangled states instead of
maximally entangled states.
