Utilizing three-terminal tunnel emission of ballistic electrons and holes, we
have developed a method to self-consistently measure the bandgap of
semiconductors and band discontinuities at semiconductor heterojunctions
without any prerequisite material parameter. Measurements are performed on
lattice-matched GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs and GaAs/(AlxGa1-x)0.51In0.49P single-barrier
heterostructures. The bandgaps of AlGaAs and AlGaInP are measured with a
resolution of several meV at 4.2 K. For the GaAs/AlGaAs interface, the measured
Gamma band offset ratio is 60.4:39.6 (+/-2%). For the GaAs/AlGaInP interface,
this ratio varies with the Al mole fraction and is distributed more in the
valence band. A non-monotonic Al composition dependence of the conduction band
offset at the GaAs/AlGaInP interface is observed in the indirect-gap regime.
