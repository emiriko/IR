Monolithic pixel sensors for charged particle detection and imaging
applications have been designed and fabricated using commercially available,
deep-submicron Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) processes, which insulate a thin
layer of integrated full CMOS electronics from a high-resistivity substrate by
means of a buried oxide. The substrate is contacted from the electronics layer
through vias etched in the buried oxide, allowing pixel implanting and reverse
biasing. This paper summarizes the performances achieved with a first prototype
manufactured in the OKI 0.15 micrometer FD-SOI process, featuring analog and
digital pixels on a 10 micrometer pitch. The design and preliminary results on
the analog section of a second prototype manufactured in the OKI 0.20
micrometer FD-SOI process are briefly discussed.
