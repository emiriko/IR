The Quantitative Rescattering Theory (QRS) for high-order harmonic generation
(HHG) by intense laser pulses is presented. According to the QRS, HHG spectra
can be expressed as a product of a returning electron wave packet and the
photo-recombination differential cross section of the {\em laser-free}
continuum electron back to the initial bound state. We show that the shape of
the returning electron wave packet is determined mostly by the laser only. The
returning electron wave packets can be obtained from the strong-field
approximation or from the solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation
(TDSE) for a reference atom. The validity of the QRS is carefully examined by
checking against accurate results for both harmonic magnitude and phase from
the solution of the TDSE for atomic targets within the single active electron
approximation. Combining with accurate transition dipoles obtained from
state-of-the-art molecular photoionization calculations, we further show that
available experimental measurements for HHG from partially aligned molecules
can be explained by the QRS. Our results show that quantitative description of
the HHG from aligned molecules has become possible. Since infrared lasers of
pulse durations of a few femtoseconds are easily available in the laboratory,
they may be used for dynamic imaging of a transient molecule with femtosecond
temporal resolutions.
