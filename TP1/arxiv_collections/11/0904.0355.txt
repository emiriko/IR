Stochastic mass transport models are usually described by specifying hopping
rates of particles between sites of a given lattice, and the goal is to predict
the existence and properties of the steady state. Here we ask the reverse
question: given a stationary state that factorizes over links (pairs of sites)
of an arbitrary connected graph, what are possible hopping rates that converge
to this state? We define a class of hopping functions which lead to the same
steady state and guarantee current conservation but may differ by the induced
current strength. For the special case of anisotropic hopping in two dimensions
we discuss some aspects of the phase structure. We also show how this case can
be traced back to an effective zero-range process in one dimension which is
solvable for a large class of hopping functions.
