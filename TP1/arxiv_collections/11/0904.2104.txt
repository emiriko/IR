We prove Haag duality property of any translation invariant pure state on
$\clb = \otimes_{\IZ}M_d(C), \;d \ge 2$, where $M_d(C)$ is the set of $d \times
d$ dimensional matrices over field of complex numbers. We also prove a
necessary and sufficient condition for a translation invariant factor state to
be pure on $\clb$. This result makes it possible to study such a pure state
with additional symmetry. We prove that exponentially decaying two point
spacial correlation function of a real lattice symmetric reflection positive
translation invariant pure state is a split state. Further there exists no
translation invariant pure state on $\clb$ that is real, lattice symmetric,
refection positive and $su(2)$ invariant when $d$ is an even integer. This in
particular says that Heisenberg iso-spin anti-ferromagnets model for 1/2-odd
integer spin degrees of freedom admits spontaneous symmetry breaking at it's
ground states
