We propose a new framework unifying cold dark matter (CDM) and Modified
Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) to solve their respective problems on galactic scales
and large scale structure formation. In our framework the dark matter clusters
on large scales but not on galactic scales. This environment dependence of the
dark matter behaviors is controlled by a vector field, which also produces the
MOND effects in galaxies. We find that in this framework only a single mass
scale needs to be introduced to produce the phenomena of CDM, MOND and also
dark energy.
