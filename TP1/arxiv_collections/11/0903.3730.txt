We present here a compactly formulated application of the previously posted
general formalism of the reflection of Gaussian beams at a dielectric interface
({arXiv:0710.1643v2 [physics.optics]}). Specifically, we calculate the
Goos-H\"{a}nchen shift near Brewster incidence, for an air-glass plane
interface.
