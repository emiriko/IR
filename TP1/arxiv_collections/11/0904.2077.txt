In this paper we investigate the freely propagating fields behind the results
in [6]. In [6] we calculated the magnetic dipole moment of the muon and the
electric dipole moments of the muon, electron and the neutron (in a simple
quark model) to first order in loop corrections in both S$_1$ and S$_1
\backslash \, \boldsymbol{Z}_2$. In these calculations in [6] we investigated
the effect of fields possibly generated by higher dimensional superconducting
cosmic strings [4] that interact with the charged fields on the manifold. In
comparing the results in [6] with standard model precision tests for the
electric and magnetic dipole moments of the various fermions in the model, we
were able to obtain upper limits on the compactification size as well as an
upper limit for the new $b$ parameter. Recall that in [5] we presented the
theory for [6] in $M_4 \, \bigotimes$ S$_1 \backslash \, \boldsymbol{Z}_2$
where, in [6], we allowed for external magnetic fields, that could be produced
by light charged particles traveling near superconducting cosmic strings, to
permeate the extra dimensional space. These fields affected the charged
particles in the model resulting in a novel mechanism for parity violation in
QED processes along with other phenomenological and theoretical implications
[6].
