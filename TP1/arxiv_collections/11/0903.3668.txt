Heavy colored scalar particles appear in a variety of new physics (NP) models
and could be produced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Knowing the total
production cross section is important for searching for these states and
establishing bounds on their masses and couplings. Using soft-collinear
effective theory, we derive a factorization theorem for the process $pp\to SX$,
where $S$ is a color-octet scalar, that is applicable to any NP model provided
the dominant production mechanism is gluon-gluon fusion. The factorized result
for the inclusive cross section is similar to that for the Standard Model Higgs
production, however, differences arise due to color exchange between initial
and final states. We provide formulae for the total cross section with large
(partonic) threshold logarithms resummed to next-to-leading logarithm (NLL)
accuracy. The resulting $K$-factors are similar to those found in Higgs
production. We apply our formalism to the Manohar-Wise model and find that the
NLL cross section is roughly 2 times (3 times) as large as the leading order
cross section for a color-octet scalar of mass of 500 GeV (3 TeV). A similar
enhancement should appear in any NP model with color-octet scalars.
