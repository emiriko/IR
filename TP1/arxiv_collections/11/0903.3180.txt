For long memory time series models with uncorrelated but dependent errors, we
establish the asymptotic normality of the Whittle estimator under mild
conditions. Our framework includes the widely used FARIMA models with
GARCH-type innovations. To cover nonstationary fractionally integrated
processes, we extend the idea of Abadir, Distaso and Giraitis (2007, Journal of
Econometrics 141, 1353-1384) and develop the nonstationarity-extended Whittle
estimation. The resulting estimator is shown to be asymptotically normal and is
more efficient than the tapered Whittle estimator. Finally, the results from a
small simulation study are presented to corroborate our theoretical findings.
