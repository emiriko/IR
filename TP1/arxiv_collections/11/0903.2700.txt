Within the framework of McLaughlin-Scott perturbation theory the
equation-of-motion of the dislocation kink in the pinning potential is
linearized, assuming the simultaneous influence of ac and dc forces. Based on
the equations derived, the probability of kink depinning was studied. The
dependencies of the depinning probability on dc and ac forces are analyzed in
details.
