In orbital-free density functional theory the kinetic potential (KP), the
functional derivative of the kinetic energy density functional, appears in the
Euler equation for the electron density and may be more amenable to simple
approximations. We study properties of two solid-state systems, Al and Si,
using two nonlocal KPs that gave good results for atoms. Very accurate results
are found for Al, but results for Si are much less satisfactory, illustrating
the general need for a better treatment of extended covalent systems. A
different integration pathway in the KP formalism may prove useful in attacking
this fundamental problem.
