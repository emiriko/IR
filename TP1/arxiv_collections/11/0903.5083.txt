If dark matter (DM) annihilation accounts for the tantalizing excess of
cosmic ray electron/positrons, as reported by the PAMELA, ATIC, HESS and FERMI
observatories, then the implied annihilation cross section must be relatively
large. This results, in the context of standard cosmological models, in very
small relic DM abundances that are incompatible with astrophysical
observations. We explore possible resolutions to this apparent conflict in
terms of non-standard cosmological scenarios; plausibly allowing for large
cross sections, while maintaining relic abundances in accord with current
observations.
