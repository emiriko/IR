High resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements have been carried
out on BaFe2As2, a parent compound of the FeAs-based superconductors. In the
magnetic ordering state, there is no gap opening observed on the Fermi surface.
Instead, dramatic band structure reorganization occurs across the magnetic
transition. The appearance of the singular Fermi spots near (pi,pi) is the most
prominent signature of magnetic ordering. These observations provide direct
evidence that the magnetic ordering state of BaFe2As2 is distinct from the
conventional spin-density-wave state. They reflect the electronic complexity in
this multiple-orbital system and necessity in involving the local magnetic
moment in describing the underlying electron structure.
