We investigate wavepacket solutions for time-dependent Schoedinger equation
in the presence of an exponentially decaying potential. Assuming for travelling
wave solutions the phase to be a linear combination of the space and time
coordinates, we obtain two distinct wavepacket solutions for the Schroedinger
equation. The wavepackets counterpropagate in space at a constant velocity
without any distortion or spreading thus retain their initial form at
arbitrarily large distances.
