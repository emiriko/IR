We demonstrate theoretically that using standard external magnetic fields,
one can imprint point-like topological defects to the spin texture of a dilute
Bose-Einstein condensate. Symmetries of the condensate order parameter render
this topological defect to be accompanied with a vortex filament corresponding
to the Dirac string of a magnetic monopole. The vorticity in the condensate
coincides with the magnetic field of a magnetic monopole, providing an ideal
analogue to the monopole studied by Dirac.
