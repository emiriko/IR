Flavour and CP violations that the neutrino-seesaw couplings of types I, II,
and III induce radiatively in the soft massive parameters of the minimal
supersymmetric SU(5) model, made realistic by nonrenormalizable operators, are
analyzed. Effective couplings are used to parametrize the couplings of
renormalizable operators and of the corrections that nonrenormalizable ones
provide at the tree level. It is found that for a limited, but sufficient
accuracy in the calculations of such violations, it is possible to extend the
picture of effective couplings to the quantum level, all the way to the cutoff
scale. The arbitrariness introduced by nonrenormalizable operators is analyzed
in detail. It is shown that it can be drastically reduced in the Yukawa sector
if the effective Yukawa couplings involving colored triplet Higgs bosons are
tuned to suppress the decay rate of the proton. In the supersymmetry-breaking
sector, the usual requirement of independence of flavour and field type for the
mechanism of mediation of supersymmetry breaking is not sufficient to forbid
arbitrary flavour and CP violations at the tree level. Special conditions to be
added to this requirement, under which such violations can be avoided, are
identified. Depending on how and whether these conditions are implemented,
different phenomenological scenarios emerge. Flavour and CP violations of soft
massive parameters induced by neutrino-seesaw couplings are discussed
explicitly for the simplest scenario, in which no such violations are present
at the tree level. Guidelines for studying them in other, less simple scenarios
are given. Lists of all renormalization group equations needed for their
calculations are provided for each of the three types of seesaw mechanism, at
all energies between the TeV scale and Planck scale.
