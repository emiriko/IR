Excess heat generated in integrated circuits is one of the major problems of
modern electronics. Surface phonon-polariton scattering is shown here to be the
dominant mechanism for hot charge carrier energy dissipation in a nanotube
device fabricated on a polar substrate, such as $SiO_2$. Using microscopic
quantum models the Joule losses were calculated for the various energy
dissipation channels as a function of the electric field, doping, and
temperature. The polariton mechanism must be taken into account to obtain an
accurate estimate of the effective thermal coupling of the non-suspended
nanotube to the substrate, which was found to be 0.1-0.2 W/m.K even in the
absence of the bare phononic thermal coupling.
