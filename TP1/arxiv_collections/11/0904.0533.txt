Some early-type stars are detectable radio emitters; their spectra can
present both thermal and non-thermal contributions. Here I review the public
radio data on OB stars, focusing on the non-thermal sources. The analysis of
the statistical results gives rise to many open questions that are expected to
be addressed, at least in part, with the upgrades of current radio telescopes
and the upcoming new generation instruments.
