We present the exact solution of a Brownian inchworm model of a
self-propelled elastic dimer which has recently been proposed in [K. V. Kumar
\textit{et al}, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{77}, 020102(R) (2008)] as a unifying model
for the propulsion mechanisms of DNA helicase, polar rods on a vibrated
surface, crawling keratocytes, and Myosin VI.
