Neutrino-telescopes like Super-Kamiokande and IceCube have started to explore
the neutrino fluxes from WIMP annihilations in the Sun. The non-observation of
a signal can put constraints on the WIMP properties. We here focus on the
neutrino signal from WIMP annihilation in the Sun and show that under
reasonable assumptions, the non-observation of a signal from IceCube puts a
much tighter constraint on the spin-dependent WIMP-proton scattering
cross-section than current direct detection experiments like COUPP and KIMS.
For the spin-independent scattering cross-section, the limits from IceCube and
current direct detection experiments like XENON10 and CDMS place similar
constraints. We here go through the assumptions being made and the
uncertainties that arise in converting from limits on the muon flux from the
Sun to limits on the WIMP-proton cross-section, and present our results as easy
to use conversion factors.
