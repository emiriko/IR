A quantum-thermal annealing method using a cluster-flip algorithm is studied
in the two-dimensional spin-glass model. The temperature (T) and the transverse
field (Gamma) are decreased simultaneously with the same rate along a linear
path on the T-Gamma plane. We found that the additional pulse of the transverse
field to the frozen local spins produces a good approximate solution with a low
computational cost.
