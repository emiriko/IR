Numerical simulations of magneto-convection and analysis of solar magnetogram
data provide empirical probability density functions (PDFs) for the
line-of-sight component of the magnetic field. In this paper, we theoretically
explore effects of several types of PDFs on polarized Zeeman line formation. We
also propose composite PDFs to account for randomness in both field strength
and orientation. Such PDFs can possibly mimic random fields at the solar
surface.
