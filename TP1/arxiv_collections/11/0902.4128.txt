In this study, it is generalized the concept of Lagrangian mechanics with
constraints to complex case. To be beginning, it is considered a Kaehlerian
manifold as a velocity-phase space. Then a non-holonomic constraint is given by
1-form on it. If the form is closed, it is found that the constraint is
(locally) holonomic. In the result, complex analogous of some topics in
constrained Lagrangian mechanical system is concluded.
