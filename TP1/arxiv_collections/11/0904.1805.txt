To quantify the operational risk capital charge under the current regulatory
framework for banking supervision, referred to as Basel II, many banks adopt
the Loss Distribution Approach. There are many modeling issues that should be
resolved to use the approach in practice. In this paper we review the
quantitative methods suggested in literature for implementation of the
approach. In particular, the use of the Bayesian inference method that allows
to take expert judgement and parameter uncertainty into account, modeling
dependence and inclusion of insurance are discussed.
