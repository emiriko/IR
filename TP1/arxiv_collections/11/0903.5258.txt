We consider the propagation of solitons in media with an imprinted transverse
periodic or parabolic refractive index modulation when the modulation depth
slightly fluctuates along the propagation direction. We find that, under
suitable spectral resonance conditions, small transverse soliton oscillations
may get parametrically amplified.
