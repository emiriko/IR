We express the covariant actions of a super p-brane and the corresponding
equations of motion, in the flat and curved superspaces, in terms of the Nambu
(p+1)-brackets. These brackets make the (p+1)-algebra structure of super
p-brane manifest. For the flat superspace, this reconstruction of the action
also allows reformulating it in terms of two sets of differential forms.
