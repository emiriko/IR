In this paper we have defined two functions that have been used to construct
different fractals having fractal dimensions between 1 and 2. More precisely,
we can say that one of our defined functions produce the fractals whose fractal
dimension lies in [1.58, 2) and rest function produce the fractals whose
fractal dimension lies in (1, 1.58]. Also we tried to calculate the amount of
increment of fractal dimension in accordance with base of the number systems.
And in switching of fractals from one base to another, the increment of fractal
dimension is constant, which is 1.58, its quite surprising!
