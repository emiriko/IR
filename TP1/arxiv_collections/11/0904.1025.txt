Assuming Galactic positrons do not go far before annhilating, a difference
between the observed 511 keV annihilation flux distribution and that of
positron production, expected from beta-plus decay in Galactic iron
nucleosynthesis, was evoked as evidence of a new source and a signal of dark
matter. We show, however, that the dark mater sources can not account for the
observed positronium fraction without extensive propagation. Yet with such
propagation, standard nucleosynthetic sources can fully account for the spatial
differences and the positronium fraction, leaving no signal for dark mater to
explain.
