The behaviour of neurons under the influence of periodic external input has
been modelled very successfully by circle maps. The aim of this note is to
extend certain aspects of this analysis to a much more general class of forcing
processes. We apply results on the fibred rotation number of randomly forced
circle maps to show the uniqueness of the asymptotic firing frequency of
ergodically forced pacemaker neurons. The details of the analysis are carried
out for the forced leaky integrate-and-fire model, but the results should also
remain valid for a large class of further models.
