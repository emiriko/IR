The discovery of three planetary companions around HR 8799 (Marois et al.
2008) marked a significant epoch in direct imaging of extrasolar planets. Given
the importance of this system, we re-analyzed H band images of HR 8799 obtained
with the Subaru 36-elements adaptive optics (AO) in July 2002. The low-order AO
imaging combined with the classical PSF-subtraction methods even revealed the
extrasolar planet, HR 8799b. Our observations in 2002 confirmed that it has
been orbiting HR 8799 in a counter-clockwise direction. The flux of HR 8799b
was consistent with those in the later epochs within the uncertainty of 0.25
mag, further supporting the planetary mass estimate by Marois et al. (2008).
