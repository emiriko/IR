Using the Chamseddine--Connes approach of the noncommutative action on
spectral triples, we show that there are no tadpoles of any order for compact
spin manifolds without boundary, and also consider a case of a chiral boundary
condition. Using pseudodifferential techniques, we track zero terms in spectral
actions.
