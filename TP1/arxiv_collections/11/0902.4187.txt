Nonclassical properties of light propagating through the turbulent atmosphere
are studied. We demonstrate by numerical simulation that the probability
distribution of the transmission coefficient, which characterizes the effects
of the atmosphere on the quantum state of light, can be reconstructed by
homodyne detection. Nonclassical photon-statistics and, more generally,
nonclassical Glauber-Sudarshan functions appear to be more robust against
turbulence for weak light fields rather than for bright ones.
