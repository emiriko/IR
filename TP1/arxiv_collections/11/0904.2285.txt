We shortly review the construction of knowledge by intrinsic observers.
Intrinsic observers are embedded in a system and are inseparable parts thereof.
The intrinsic viewpoint has to be contrasted with an extrinsic, "God's eye"
viewpoint, from which the system can be observed externally without in any way
changing it. This epistemological distinction has concrete, formalizable
consequences. One consequence is the emergence of "complementarity" for
intrinsic observers, even if the underlying system is totally deterministic
(computable). Another consequence is the appearence of time and inertial frames
for intrinsic observers. The necessary operational techniques are developed in
the context of Cellular Automata. We finish with a somewhat speculative
question. Given space-time frames generated by clocks which use sound waves for
synchronization; why could supersonic travel not cause time paradoxes?
