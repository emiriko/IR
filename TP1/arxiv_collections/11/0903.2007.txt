We compute the critical Josephson current through a single-molecule junction.
As a model for a molecule with a bistable conformational degree of freedom, we
study an interacting single-level quantum dot coupled to a two-level system and
weakly connected to two superconducting electrodes. We perform a lowest-order
perturbative calculation of the critical current and show that it can
significantly change due to the two-level system. In particular, the
\pi-junction behavior, generally present for strong interactions, can be
completely suppressed.
