In this paper we obtain the linear Weyl gravity in de Sitter background. Its
linear form in five-dimensional ambient space notation has also been obtained.
From the group theoretical point of view, we show that this conformal invariant
fourth order theory in its linear form does not transform as an unitary
irreducible representation of the de Sitter group.
