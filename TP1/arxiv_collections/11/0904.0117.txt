First principle FLAPW-GGA calculations have been performed with the purpose
to understand the electronic properties for the newly synthesized tetragonal
(space group P4/nmm) layered iron arsenide-oxide: Sr4Sc2Fe2As2O6 doped with
titanium. The total and partial densities of states, low-temperature electron
specific heat and molar Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility have been obtained
and discussed for Sr4ScTiFe2As2O6 in comparison with parent phase
Sr4Sc2Fe2As2O6.
  Our results show that the insertion of Ti into Sc sublattice of iron
arsenide-oxide phase Sr4Sc2Fe2As2O6 leads to principal change of its electronic
structure; in result the insulating so-called "charge reservoirs', i.e.
perovskite-based [Sr4Sc2O6] blocks became conducting. This situation differs
essentially from the known picture for all others Fe-As superconductors where
the conducting [Fe2As2] blocks are separated by isolating blocks.
