In this paper we introduce doubly symmetric functions, arising from the
equivalence of particular linear combinations of Schur functions and hook Schur
functions. We study algebraic and combinatorial aspects of doubly symmetric
functions, in particular as they form a subalgebra of the algebra of symmetric
functions. This subalgebra is generated by the odd power sum symmetric
functions. One consequence is that a Schur function itself is doubly symmetric
if and only if it is the Schur function of a staircase shape.
