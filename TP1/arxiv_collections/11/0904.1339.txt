We study the category of perfect cdg-modules over a curved algebra, and in
particular the category of B-branes in an affine Landau-Ginzburg model. We
construct an explicit chain map from the Hochschild complex of the category to
the closed state space of the model, and prove that this is a quasi-isomorphism
from the Borel-Moore Hochschild complex. Using the lowest-order term of our map
we derive Kapustin and Li's formula for the correlator of an open-string state
over a disc.
