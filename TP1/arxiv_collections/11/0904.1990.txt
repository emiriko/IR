Nonseparable panel models are important in a variety of economic settings,
including discrete choice. This paper gives identification and estimation
results for nonseparable models under time homogeneity conditions that are like
"time is randomly assigned" or "time is an instrument." Partial identification
results for average and quantile effects are given for discrete regressors,
under static or dynamic conditions, in fully nonparametric and in
semiparametric models, with time effects. It is shown that the usual, linear,
fixed-effects estimator is not a consistent estimator of the identified average
effect, and a consistent estimator is given. A simple estimator of identified
quantile treatment effects is given, providing a solution to the important
problem of estimating quantile treatment effects from panel data. Bounds for
overall effects in static and dynamic models are given. The dynamic bounds
provide a partial identification solution to the important problem of
estimating the effect of state dependence in the presence of unobserved
heterogeneity. The impact of $T$, the number of time periods, is shown by
deriving shrinkage rates for the identified set as $T$ grows. We also consider
semiparametric, discrete-choice models and find that semiparametric panel
bounds can be much tighter than nonparametric bounds.
Computationally-convenient methods for semiparametric models are presented. We
propose a novel inference method that applies in panel data and other settings
and show that it produces uniformly valid confidence regions in large samples.
We give empirical illustrations.
