We investigate the appearance of vortices and vortex lattices in
two-dimensional, anisotropic and rotating Bose-Einstein condensates. Once the
anisotropy reaches a critical value, the positions of the vortex cores in the
ground state are no longer given by an Abrikosov lattice geometry, but by a
linear arrangement. Using a variational approach, we determine the critical
stirring frequency for a single vortex as well as the equilibrium positions of
a small number of vortices.
