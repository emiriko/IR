We present results for all leading-twist azimuthal spin asymmetries in
semi-inclusive lepton-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering due to T-even
transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution functions on the basis of a
light-cone constituent quark model. Attention is paid to discuss the range of
applicability of the model, especially with regard to the scale dependence of
the observables and the transverse-momentum dependence of the distributions. We
find good agreement with available experimental data and present predictions to
be further tested by future CLAS, COMPASS and HERMES data.
