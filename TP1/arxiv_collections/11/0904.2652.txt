We present an algorithm (CaSPA) which accounts for the effects of periodic
boundary conditions in the calculation of size of percolating aggregated
clusters. The algorithm calculates the gyration tensor, allowing for a mixture
of infinite (macroscale) and finite (microscale) principle moments.
Equilibration of a triblock copolymer system from a disordered initial
configuration to a hexagonal phase is examined using the algorithm.
