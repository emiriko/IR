In a simple model of a continuous random walk a particle moves in one
dimension with the velocity fluctuating between V and -V. If V is associated
with the thermal velocity of a Brownian particle and allowed to be position
dependent, the model accounts readily for the particle's drift along the
temperature gradient and recovers basic results of the conventional
thermophoresis theory.
