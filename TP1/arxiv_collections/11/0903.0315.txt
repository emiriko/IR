Recent measurements of Fermi surface with de Haas-van Alphen oscillations in
LaFePO showed a shrinking of the Fermi pockets with respect to first-principle
LDA calculations, suggesting an energy shift of the hole and electrons bands
with respect to LDA. We show that these shifts are a natural consequence of the
strong particle-hole asymmetry of electronic bands in pnictides, and that they
provide an indirect experimental evidence of a dominant interband scattering in
these systems.
