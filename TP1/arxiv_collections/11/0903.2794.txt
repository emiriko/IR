We show that the positron excess measured by the PAMELA experiment in the
region between 10 and 100 GeV may well be a natural consequence of the standard
scenario for the origin of Galactic cosmic rays. The 'excess' arises because of
positrons created as secondary products of hadronic interactions inside the
sources, but the crucial physical ingredient which leads to a natural
explanation of the positron flux is the fact that the secondary production
takes place in the same region where cosmic rays are being accelerated.
Therefore secondary positrons (and electrons) participate in the acceleration
process and turn out to have a very flat spectrum, which is responsible, after
propagation in the Galaxy, for the observed positron 'excess'. This effect
cannot be avoided though its strength depends on the values of the
environmental parameters during the late stages of evolution of supernova
remnants.
