Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can be captured by heavenly
objects, like the Sun. Under the process of being captured by the Sun, they
will build up a population of WIMPs around it, that will eventually sink to the
core of the Sun. It has been argued with simpler estimates before that this
halo of WIMPs around the Sun could be a strong enough gamma ray source to be a
detectable signature for WIMP dark matter. We here revisit the problem using
detailed Monte Carlo simulations and detailed composition and structure
information about the Sun to estimate the size of the gamma ray flux. Compared
to earlier estimates, we find that the gamma ray flux from WIMP annihilations
in the Sun halo would be negligible and no current or planned detectors would
even be able to detect this flux.
