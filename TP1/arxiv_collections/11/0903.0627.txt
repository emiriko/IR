In this paper we initiate the study of SSB in 3+1 dimensional rotating,
charged, asymptotically AdS black holes. The theory living on their boundary, R
x S^2, has the interpretation of a 2+1 dimensional rotating holographic
superconductor. We study the appearance of a marginal mode of the condensate as
the temperature is decreased. We find that the transition temperature depends
on the rotation. At temperatures just below T_c, the transition temperature at
zero rotation, there exists a critical value of the rotation, which destroys
the superconducting order. This behaviour is analogous to the emergence of a
critical applied magnetic field and we show that the superconductor in fact
produces the expected London field in the planar limit.
