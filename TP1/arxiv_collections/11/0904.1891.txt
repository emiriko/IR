Let ${\mathcal E}$ be a holomorphic vector bundle on a complex manifold $X$
such that $\dim_{{\mathbb C}}X=n$. Given any continuous, basic Hochschild
$2n$-cocycle $\psi_{2n}$ of the algebra ${\rm Diff}_n$ of formal holomorphic
differential operators, one obtains a $2n$-form $f_{{\mathcal
E},\psi_{2n}}(\mathcal D)$ from any holomorphic differential operator
${\mathcal D}$ on ${\mathcal E}$. We apply our earlier results [J. Noncommut.
Geom. 2 (2008), 405-448; J. Noncommut. Geom. 3 (2009), 27-45] to show that
$\int_X f_{{\mathcal E},\psi_{2n}}({\mathcal D})$ gives the Lefschetz number of
$\mathcal D$ upto a constant independent of $X$ and ${\mathcal E}$. In
addition, we obtain a "local" result generalizing the above statement. When
$\psi_{2n}$ is the cocycle from [Duke Math. J. 127 (2005), 487-517], we obtain
a new proof as well as a generalization of the Lefschetz number theorem of
Engeli-Felder. We also obtain an analogous "local" result pertaining to B.
Shoikhet's construction of the holomorphic noncommutative residue of a
differential operator for trivial vector bundles on complex parallelizable
manifolds. This enables us to give a rigorous construction of the holomorphic
noncommutative residue of $\mathcal D$ defined by B. Shoikhet when ${\mathcal
E}$ is an arbitrary vector bundle on an arbitrary compact complex manifold $X$.
Our local result immediately yields a proof of a generalization of Conjecture
3.3 of [Geom. Funct. Anal. 11 (2001), 1096-1124].
