Stars and planets are the fundamental objects of the Universe. Their
formation processes, though related, may differ in important ways. Stars almost
certainly form from gravitational collapse and probably have formed this way
since the first stars lit the skies. Although it is possible that planets form
in this way also, processes involving accretion in a circumstellar disk have
been favored. High fidelity high resolution images may resolve the question;
both processes may occur in some mass ranges. The questions to be answered in
the next decade include:
  By what process do planets form, and how does the mode of formation determine
the character of planetary systems?
  What is the distribution of masses of planets? In what manner does the
metallicity of the parent star influence the character of its planetary system?
  In this paper we discuss the observations of planetary systems from birth to
maturity, with an emphasis on observations longward of 100 $\mu$m which may
illuminate the character of their formation and evolution. Advantages of this
spectral region include lower opacity, availability of extremely high
resolution to reach planet formation scales and to perform precision astrometry
and high sensitivity to thermal emission.
