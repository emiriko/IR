While adhering to the formalism of Special and General Relativity, this paper
considers the interpretation of clock rates and the rating of clocks in detail.
We also pay particular attention to the crucial requirement of reciprocity
between inertial frames. Our overriding concern is to bring out a distinction
between clocks which run slow (slowly) in the everyday sense and those which
record a smaller time interval between specific event pairs - while running at
the standard rate. The day by day application of relativistic formalism is not
affected, but the underlying physics is changed.
