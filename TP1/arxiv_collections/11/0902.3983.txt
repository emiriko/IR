Spectra of the geometric collective model of atomic nuclei are analyzed to
identify chaotic correlations among nonrotational states. The model has been
previously shown to exhibit a high degree of variability of regular and chaotic
classical features with energy and control parameters. Corresponding signatures
are now verified also on the quantum level for different schemes of
quantization and with a variable classicality constant.
