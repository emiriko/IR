We study the temperature evolution of the non-linear oscillatory
magnetoresistance in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron system subject to
a strong dc electric field. We find that the decay of the oscillation amplitude
with increasing temperature originates primarily from increasing quantum
scattering rate entering the Dingle factor. We attribute this behavior to
electron-electron interaction effects.
