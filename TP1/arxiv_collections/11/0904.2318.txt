In a recent Comment [arXiv:0904.0454] on our Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102,
056404 (2009); arXiv:0809:0950], Phillips criticizes one specific issue
discussed in our paper, concerning the spectral weight transfer, among our
wide-ranging clarifications of the filling-control Mott transition. Here we
show that all his criticisms have nothing to do with our contributions. Our
nontrivial finding on this particular aspect is a very quick, non-linear
increase in the spectral weight just above the chemical potential caused by
tiny doping to the Mott insulator, which is indeed unprecedented in the
literature. We call attention to its novelty in comparison with the
perturbation theory, and reemphasize our picture for the quick weight transfer,
that is, an avalanchine screening of doublon-holon binding energy.
