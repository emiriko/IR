Equilibrium numerical data on the three dimensional bimodal interaction Ising
spin glass up to size L=48 show that corrections to scaling, which are known to
be strong, behave in a non-monotonic manner with size. Extrapolation to the
infinite size thermodynamic limit is difficult; however the large L data
indicate that the ordering temperature Tc lies significantly higher than the
values which have been estimated from previous numerical work limited to
smaller sizes. In view of the present results it is at the least premature to
conclude that the three dimensional bimodal and Gaussian Ising spin glasses lie
in the same universality class.
