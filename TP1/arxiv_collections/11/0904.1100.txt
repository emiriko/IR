Searching for extrasolar planets by direct detection is extremely challenging
for current instrumentation. Indirect methods, that measure the effect of a
planet on its host star, are much more promising and have indeed led to the
discovery of nearly all extrasolar systems known today. While the most
successful method thus far is the radial velocity technique, new
interferometric instruments like PRIMA at the VLTI will enable us to carry out
astrometric measurements accurate enough to detect extrasolar planets and to
determine all orbital parameters, including their orbit inclination and true
mass. In this article I describe the narrow-angle astrometry technique, how it
will be realized with PRIMA, what kind of planets we can find, and what kind of
preparatory observations are required.
