The nonlinear development of streaming instabilities in the current layers
formed during magnetic reconnection with a guide field is explored. Theory and
3-D particle-in-cell simulations reveal two distinct phases. First, the
parallel Buneman instability grows and traps low velocity electrons. The
remaining electrons then drive two forms of turbulence: the parallel
electron-electron two-stream instability and the nearly-perpendicular lower
hybrid instability. The high velocity electrons resonate with the turbulence
and transfer momentum to the ions and low velocity electrons.
