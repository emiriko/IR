Using scanning tunnelling microscopy at 400mK, we have obtained maps of
around 100 vortices in SnMo6S8 from 2 - 9T. The orientational and positional
disorder at 5 and 9T show that these are the first large-scale images of a
vortex glass. At higher temperature a magnetisation peak effect is observed,
whose upper boundary coincides with a lambda anomaly in the specific heat. Our
data favour a kinetic glass description of the vortex melting transition,
indicating that vortex topological disorder persists at fields and temperatures
far below the peak effect in low-Tc superconductors.
