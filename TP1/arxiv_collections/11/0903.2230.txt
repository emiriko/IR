Analogous to a model that predicts the linear scaling of the binding energy
of a nucleus from the number of nucleons, a simple model was developed to
account for the observed linear variation of the quantum-chemically computed
total electronic energy of the fully-optimized structures of a homologous
series of polymers. This model was tested with both ab-initio DFT and molecular
mechanics methods on the ortho-fused spiral-benzenes. Both methods predict
linear scaling of total polymer energy with increasing number of repeating
units added. Since this is also the case for the linear ortho-fused
zigzag-benzenes and other polymers, it is postulated that the model is
applicable to polymers in general. It may, therefore, be used to predict
physical properties of long-chain polymers.
