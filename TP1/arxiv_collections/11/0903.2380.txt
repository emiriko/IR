We study the possibility of constructing non-BPS charged black holes in 5D
Poincare supergravity by partially violating superconformal Killing spinor
equations. However, solutions to these modified first order equations are
inconsistent with the second order equations of motion beyond the near horizon
region. Instead we find, for special prepotentials, that the consistent
asymptotically flat extension of the non-BPS near horizon solution is generated
by a symmetry transformation that leaves the two-derivative action invariant.
