The influence of carrier density on magnetism in a zigzag graphene nanoribbon
is studied in a $\pi$-orbital Hubbard-model mean-field approximation.
Departures from half-filling alter the magnetism, leading to states with charge
density variation across the ribbon and parallel spin-alignment on opposite
edges. Finite carrier densities cause the spin-density near the edges to
decrease steadily, leading eventually to the absence of magnetism. At low
doping densities the system shows a tendency to multiferroic order in which
edge charges and spins are simultaneously polarized.
