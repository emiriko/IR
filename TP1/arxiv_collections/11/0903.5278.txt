We report experimental evidence identifying acoustic phonons as the principal
source of the excitation-induced-dephasing (EID) responsible for the intensity
damping of quantum dot excitonic Rabi rotations. The rate of EID is extracted
from temperature dependent Rabi rotation measurements of the ground-state
excitonic transition, and is found to be in close quantitative agreement with
an acoustic-phonon model.
