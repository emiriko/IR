Starting from Maxwell's equations, we use the reductive perturbation method
to derive a second-order and a third-order nonlinear Schroedinger equation,
describing ultra-short solitons in nonlinear left-handed metamaterials. We find
necessary conditions and derive exact bright and dark soliton solutions of
these equations for the electric and magnetic field envelopes.
