For the first order Metal Insulator Transitions we show that together with
the d.c conductance zero there is a second critical point, where the dielectric
constant becomes zero and further turns negative. At this point the metallic
reflectivity sharply increases. The two points can be separated by a Phase
Separation State in a 3D disordered system, but may tend to merge in 2D. For
illustration we evaluate the dielectric function in a simple effective medium
approximation and show that at the second point it turns negative. We reproduce
the experimental data on a typical Mott insulator like MnO, demonstrating the
presence of the two points clearly. We discuss other experiments for studies of
the phase separation state and a similar phase separation in superconductors
with insulating inclusions.
