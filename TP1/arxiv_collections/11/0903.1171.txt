We study energy weighted sum rules of the pion and kaon propagator in nuclear
matter at finite temperature. The sum rules are obtained from matching the
Dyson form of the meson propagator with its spectral Lehmann representation at
low and high energies. We calculate the sum rules for specific models of the
kaon and pion self-energy. The in-medium spectral densities of the K and anti-K
mesons are obtained from a chiral unitary approach in coupled channels which
incorporates the S- and P-waves of the kaon-nucleon interaction. The pion
self-energy is determined from the P-wave coupling to particle-hole and
Delta-hole excitations, modified by short range correlations. The sum rules for
the lower energy weights are fulfilled satisfactorily and reflect the
contributions from the different quasi-particle and collective modes of the
meson spectral function. We discuss the sensitivity of the sum rules to the
distribution of spectral strength and their usefulness as quality tests of
model calculations.
