The atomic structure and elastic properties of silicon carbide nanowires of
different shapes and effective sizes were studied using density functional
theory and classical molecular dynamics. The surface relaxation led to surface
reconstruction with splitting of the wire geometry to hexagonal (surface) and
cubic (bulk) phases. Theoretical calculations of effective Young's modulus and
strain energies allowed us to explain the key experimental data of the SiC
nanowires of different types.
