Plasma instabilities (e.g., Buneman, Weibel and other two-stream
instabilities) excited in collisionless shocks are responsible for particle
(electron, positron, and ion) acceleration. Using a new 3-D relativistic
particle-in-cell code, we have investigated the particle acceleration and shock
structure associated with an unmagnetized relativistic electron-positron jet
propagating into an unmagnetized electron-positron plasma. The simulation has
been performed using a long simulation system in order to study the nonlinear
stages of the Weibel instability, the particle acceleration mechanism, and the
shock structure. Cold jet electrons are thermalized and slowed while the
ambient electrons are swept up to create a partially developed hydrodynamic
(HD) like shock structure. In the leading shock, electron density increases by
a factor of 3.5 in the simulation frame. Strong electromagnetic fields are
generated in the trailing shock and provide an emission site. We discuss the
possible implication of our simulation results within the AGN and GRB context.
