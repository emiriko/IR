A possible topological interpretation of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter is
proposed. Classically, by generalizing the Holst action to torsional
spacetimes, we construct a precise analogy between the Barbero--Immirzi
parameter and the $\theta$-angle of Yang-Mills gauge theories, where the role
of the Pontryagin class is played by a well known topological term containing
the Holst modification, the Nieh--Yan density. Quantum mechanically, the same
analogy requires to study the large gauge sector of the theory. In particular,
it is argued that the large sector of the gauge group can be correlated with
the Nieh-Yan density, while the Barbero-Immirzi parameter plays the role of the
free angular parameter of the large gauge transformations.
