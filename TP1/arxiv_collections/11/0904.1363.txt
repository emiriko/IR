Within the context of a $5D$ space-time, we construct a unified theory of
gravity and electromagnetism from which the Einstein field equations and
Maxwell equations emerge, with homogenous Maxwell equations appearing
naturally. We also introduce a well-defined five dimensional energy-momentum
tensor consistent with our unification scheme. A correction term appears in
Maxwell equations which can be used to explain the recently discovered galactic
magnetic fields.
