Gels in soft-matter systems are an important nonergodic state of matter. We
study a colloid-polymer mixture which is quenched by increasing the polymer
concentration, from a fluid to a gel. Using confocal microscopy, we study both
the static structure and dynamics in three dimensions (3D). Between the
dynamically arrested gel and ergodic fluid comprised of isolated particles we
find an intermediate 'cluster fluid' state, where the 'bonds' between the
colloidal particles have a finite lifetime. The local dynamics are reminiscent
of a fluid, while the local structure is almost identical to that of the gel.
Simultaneous real-time local structural analysis and particle tracking in 3D at
the single-particle level yields the following interesting information.
Particles in the clusters move in a highly correlated manner, but, at the same
time, exhibit significant dynamical heterogeneity, reflecting the enhanced
mobility near the free surface. Deeper quenching eventually leads to a gel
state where the 'bond' lifetime exceeds that of the experiment, although the
local structure is almost identical to that of the 'cluster fluid'.
