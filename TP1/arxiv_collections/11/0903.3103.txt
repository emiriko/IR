In this work, we first show that feature selection methods other than
boosting can also be used for training an efficient object detector. In
particular, we introduce Greedy Sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis (GSLDA)
\cite{Moghaddam2007Fast} for its conceptual simplicity and computational
efficiency; and slightly better detection performance is achieved compared with
\cite{Viola2004Robust}. Moreover, we propose a new technique, termed Boosted
Greedy Sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis (BGSLDA), to efficiently train a
detection cascade. BGSLDA exploits the sample re-weighting property of boosting
and the class-separability criterion of GSLDA.
