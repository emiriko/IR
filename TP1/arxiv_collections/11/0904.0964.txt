InGaAsP/InP quantum wells (QW) ridge waveguide lasers were fabricated for the
evaluation of Ga+ Focused Ion Beam (FIB) milling of mirrors. Electrical and
optical proprieties were investigated. A 7% increment in threshold current, a
17% reduction in external quantum efficiency and 15 nm blue shift in the
emission spectrum were observed after milling as compared to the as cleaved
facet result. Annealing in inert atmosphere partially revert these effects
resulting in 4% increment in threshold current, 11% reduction in external
efficiency and 13 nm blue shift with the as cleaved result. The current-voltage
behavior after milling and annealing shows a very small increase in leakage
current indicating that optical damage is the main effect of the milling
process.
