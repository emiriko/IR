We present very low temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and
Spectroscopy (STM/S) measurements of a W based amorphous thin film grown with
focused-ion-beam. In particular, we address the superconducting properties
close to the border, where the thickness of the superconducting film decreases,
and the Au substrate emerges. When approaching the Au substrate, the
superconducting tunneling conductance strongly increases around the Fermi
level, and the quasiparticle peaks do not significantly change its position.
Under magnetic fields, the vortex lattice is observed, with vortices positioned
very close to the Au substrate.
