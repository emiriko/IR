The gravity-scalar field system in spherical symmetry provides a natural
setting for exploring gravitational collapse and its aftermath in quantum
gravity. In a canonical approach, we give constructions of the Hamiltonian
operator, and of semiclassical states peaked on constraint free data. Such
states provide explicit examples of physical states. We also show that
matter-gravity entanglement is an inherent feature of physical states, whether
or not there is a black hole.
