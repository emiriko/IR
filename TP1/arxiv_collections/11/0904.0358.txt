The Sun is unique amongst stars in having a precisely determined age which
does not depend on the modelling of stellar evolution. Furthermore, other
global properties of the Sun are known to much higher accuracy than for any
other star. Also, helioseismology has provided detailed determination of the
solar internal structure and rotation. As a result, the Sun plays a central
role in the development and test of stellar modelling. Here I discuss solar
modelling and its application to tests of asteroseismic techniques for stellar
age determination.
