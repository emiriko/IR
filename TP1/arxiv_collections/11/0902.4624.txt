The spectrum of baryons with two heavy quarks is predicted, assuming a
configuration of a light quark and a heavy diquark. The masses are computed
within a semirelativistic quark model, using a potential obtained in the
framework of the AdS/QCD correspondence. All the parameters defining the model
are determined fitting the meson spectrum. The obtained mass of \Xi_{cc} is in
agreement with the measurements.
