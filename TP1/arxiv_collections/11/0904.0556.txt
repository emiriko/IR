We investigate the solvent mediated interactions between nanoparticles
adsorbed at a liquid-vapor interface in comparison to the solvent mediated
interactions in the bulk liquid and vapor phases of a Lennard-Jones solvent.
Molecular dynamics simulation data for the latter are in good agreement with
results from integral equations in the reference functional approximation and a
simple geometric approximation. Simulation results for the solvent mediated
interactions at the interface differ markedly from the interactions of the
particles in the corresponding bulk phases. We find that at short interparticle
distances the interactions are considerably more repulsive than those in either
bulk phase. At long interparticle distances we find evidence for a long-ranged
attraction. We discuss these observations in terms of interfacial interactions,
namely, the three-phase line tension that would operate at short distances, and
capillary wave interactions for longer interparticle distances.
