Locally-gated single-layer graphene sheets have unusual discrete energy
states inside the potential barrier induced by a finite-width gate. These
states are localized outside the Dirac cone of continuum states and are
responsible for novel quantum transport phenomena. Specifically, the
longitudinal (along the barrier) conductance exhibits oscillations as a
function of barrier height and/or width, which are both controlled by a nearby
gate. The origin of these oscillations can be traced back to singularities in
the density of localized states. These graphene conductance-oscillations
resemble the Shubnikov-de-Haas (SdH) magneto-oscillations; however, here these
are driven by an electric field instead of a magnetic field.
