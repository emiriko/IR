Humans have the ability to regcognize the real world from different facets.
Faceted exploration is a mechanism for browsing and understanding large-scale
resources in information network by multiple facets. This paper proposes an
Emerging Resource Space Model, whose schema is a partially ordered set of
concepts with subclassOf relation and each resource is categorized by multiple
concepts. Emering Resource Space (ERS) is a class of resources characterized by
a concept set. ERSes compose a lattice (ERSL) via concept association. A series
of exploration operations is proposed to guide users to explore through ERSL
with more demanding and richer semantics than current faceted navigation. To
fulfill instant response during faceted exploration, we devise an efficient
algorithm for mining and indexing ERSL. The proposed model can effectively
support faceted exploration in various applications from personal information
management to large-scale information sharing.
