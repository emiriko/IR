Cooling forces result from the retarded dipole interaction between an
illuminated particle and its reflection. For a one-dimensional example, we find
cooling times of milliseconds and limiting temperatures in the millikelvin
range. The force, which may be considered the prototype for cavity-mediated
cooling, may be enhanced by plasmon and geometric resonances at the mirror.
