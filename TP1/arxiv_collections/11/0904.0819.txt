(abridged) We present 24 and 70 micron MIPS observations of 70 A through
M-type dwarfs with estimated ages from 8 Myr to 1.1 Gyr, as part of a Spitzer
guaranteed time program. Our sample is selected from stars with common youth
indicators such as lithium abundance, X-ray activity, chromospheric activity,
and rapid rotation. We compare our MIPS observations to empirically derived
K-[24] colors as a function of the stellar effective temperature to identify 24
and 70 micron excesses.
  We confirm the previously published 70 micron excesses for HD 92945, HD
112429, and AU Mic. We present the discovery of 70 micron excesses for five
stars: HD 7590, HD 10008, HD 59967, HD 73350, and HD 135599. We also present
the detection of 24 micron excesses for ten stars: HD 10008, GJ 3400A, HD
73350, HD 112429, HD 123998, HD 175742, AT Mic, BO Mic, HD 358623 and Gl 907.1.
We find that large 70 micron excesses are less common around stars with
effective temperatures of less than 5000 K (3.7%) than around stars with
effective temperatures between 5000 K and 6000 K (21.4%), despite the cooler
stars having a younger median age in our sample (12 vs.340 Myr). We find that
the previously reported excess for TWA 13A at 70 microns is due to a nearby
background galaxy.
  In the Appendix, we present an updated analysis of dust grain removal
time-scales due to grain-grain collisions and radiation pressure,
Poynting-Robertson drag, stellar wind drag and planet-dust dynamical
interaction.
