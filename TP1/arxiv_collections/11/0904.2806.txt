We have studied the effect of tensile strain on the superconductivity in FeSe
films. 50 nm, 100 nm, and 200 nm FeSe films were grown on MgO, SrTiO$_3$, and
LaAlO$_3$ substrates by using a pulsed laser deposition technique. X-ray
diffraction analysis showed that the tetragonal phase is dominant in all of our
FeSe films. The 50 nm FeSe films on MgO and SrTiO$_3$ are under tensile strain,
while the 50 nm FeSe film on LaAlO$_3$ and the other thick FeSe films are
unstrained. Superconducting transitions have been observed in unstrained FeSe
films with T$_{onset}$ $\approx$ 8 K, which is close to the bulk value.
However, no sign of superconductivity has been observed in FeSe films under
tensile strain down to 5 K. There is evidence to show that tensile strain
suppresses superconductivity in FeSe films.
