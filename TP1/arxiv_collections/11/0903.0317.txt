We show how easy it is to get the Sommerfeld enhancement for a Yukawa
potential, for definite partial waves, beyond the S wave analyzed in previous
literature. In particular, we report results for the P wave (for which there is
a resonant pattern and the enhancement can be of several orders of magnitude
even far from the resonance) that could be relevant for the analysis of
experimental cosmic rays data possibly signaling the annihilation of dark
matter particles.
