We report on the first in-beam gamma-ray spectroscopy study of the very
neutron-rich nucleus 46S. The N=30 isotones 46S and 48Ar were produced in a
novel way in two steps that both necessarily involve nucleon exchange and
neutron pickup reactions, 9Be(48Ca,48K)X followed by 9Be(48K,48Ar+gamma)X at
85.7 MeV/u mid-target energy and 9Be(48Ca,46Cl)X followed by
9Be(46Cl,46S+gamma)X at 87.0 MeV/u mid-target energy, respectively. The results
are compared to large-scale shell-model calculations in the sdpf shell using
the SDPF-NR effective interaction and Z-dependent modifications.
