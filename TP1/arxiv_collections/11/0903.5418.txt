Recently, a number of interesting relations have been discovered between
generalised Pauli/Dirac groups and certain finite geometries. Here, we
succeeded in finding a general unifying framework for all these relations. We
introduce gradually necessary and sufficient conditions to be met in order to
carry out the following programme: Given a group $\vG$, we first construct
vector spaces over $\GF(p)$, $p$ a prime, by factorising $\vG$ over appropriate
normal subgroups. Then, by expressing $\GF(p)$ in terms of the commutator
subgroup of $\vG$, we construct alternating bilinear forms, which reflect
whether or not two elements of $\vG$ commute. Restricting to $p=2$, we search
for ``refinements'' in terms of quadratic forms, which capture the fact whether
or not the order of an element of $\vG$ is $\leq 2$. Such
factor-group-generated vector spaces admit a natural reinterpretation in the
language of symplectic and orthogonal polar spaces, where each point becomes a
``condensation'' of several distinct elements of $\vG$. Finally, several
well-known physical examples (single- and two-qubit Pauli groups, both the real
and complex case) are worked out in detail to illustrate the fine traits of the
formalism.
