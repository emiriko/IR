Two general problems arise when interpreting the recent cosmic ray data as
signals of Dark Matter (DM) annihilation: (i) the required cross section is too
large by O(100), and (ii) the annihilation products seem to be mostly leptonic.
We propose to address these two problems by assuming that the couplings of DM
to leptons grow with time. This can be achieved by a dynamic localization of DM
in extra dimensions. A possible outcome of this proposal is a time (red-shift)
dependent annihilation signal, in terms of strength and dominant final states.
