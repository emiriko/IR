Within the framework of potential scattering theory we derive an analytical
two-potential formula for the on-shell partial wave scattering amplitude. This
formula embodies a large number of possible applications, including long range
Coulomb forces as well as short distance singular potentials. As an example
illustrating the use of the formula we analyze the determination of the strong
proton-proton scattering s-wave phase shift from the experimentally determined
Coulomb phase when the one pion exchange and two pion exchange chiral
potentials are taken into account and analyze the relevant scales of the
problem.
