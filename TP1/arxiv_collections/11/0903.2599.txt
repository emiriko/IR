We discuss a Hilbert space method that allows to prove analytical
well-posedness of a class of linear strongly damped wave equations. The main
technical tool is a perturbation lemma for sesquilinear forms, which seems to
be new. In most common linear cases we can furthermore apply a recent result
due to Crouzeix--Haase, thus extending several known results and obtaining
optimal analyticity angle.
