Within the Regge approach, we calculated the exclusive $f_1(1285)$ meson
photoproduction cross section at energy of few GeV. The calculation shows that
the cross section is sizable, being in the range of 100 nb, and much larger
than the the expected cross section of the $\eta(1295)$ meson photoproduction
at the same energy. These two facts make possible to use this reaction to study
the poor known properties of the $f_1(1285)$ meson in the JLab kinematics.
