In the present study we attempt to incorporate the philosophical dialogue
about physical reality into the instructional process of quantum mechanics.
Taking into account that both scientific realism and constructivism represent,
on the basis of a rather broad spectrum, prevalent philosophical currents in
the domain of science education, the compatibility of their essential
commitments is examined against the conceptual structure of quantum theory. It
is argued in this respect that the objects of science do not simply constitute
'personal constructions' of the human mind for interpreting nature, as
individualist constructivist consider, neither do they form products of a
'social construction', as sociological constructivist assume; on the contrary,
they reflect objective structural aspects of the physical world. A realist
interpretation of quantum mechanics, we suggest, is not only possible but also
necessary for revealing the inner meaning of the theory's scientific content.
It is pointed out, however, that a viable realist interpretation of quantum
theory requires the abandonment or radical revision of the classical conception
of physical reality and its traditional metaphysical presuppositions. To this
end, we put forward an alternative to traditional realism interpretative
scheme, that is in harmony with the findings of present-day quantum theory, and
which, if adequately introduced into the instructional process of contemporary
physics, is expected to promote the conceptual reconstruction of learners
towards an appropriate view of nature.
