We compare a recent lattice determination of the nucleon distribution
amplitudes with other approaches and models. We study the nucleon distribution
amplitudes up to twist 6 in next-to leading conformal spin and we also
investigate conformal d-wave contributions to the leading twist distribution
amplitude. With the help of light-cone sum rules one can relate the
distribution amplitudes to the form factors of the nucleon or the $ N \to
\Delta$ transition at intermediate values of the momentum transfer. We compare
our results with experimental data in the range 1 GeV$^2 \leq Q^2 \leq 10$
GeV$^2$. Keeping in mind that we are working only in LO QCD and NLO-QCD
corrections might be sizeable we already obtain a surprisingly good agreement
for the nucleon form factors $G_M^n$, $G_M^p$, $G_A^p$ and $G_T^p$ and for the
$N \to \Delta$ transition form factor ratios $R_{EM}$ and $R_{SM}$.
