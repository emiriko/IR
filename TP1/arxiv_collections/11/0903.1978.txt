We have investigated a single charged microgel in aqueous solution with a
combined simulational model and Poisson-Boltzmann theory. In the simulations we
use a coarse-grained charged bead-spring model in a dielectric continuum, with
explicit counterions and full electrostatic interactions under periodic and
non-periodic boundary conditions. The Poisson-Boltzmann model is that of a
single charged colloid confined to a spherical cell where the counterions are
allowed to enter the uniformly charged sphere. We compare the simulational
results to those of the Poisson-Boltzmann solution and find good agreement,
i.e., for the number of confined counterions within the gel. We then proceed to
investigate the origin of the differences between the results these two models
give, and performed a variety of simulations which were designed to test for
the influence of charge correlations, excluded volume interactions, and thermal
fluctuations in the strands of the gel. Our results support the applicability
of the Poisson-Boltzman cell model to study ionic properties of small microgels
under dilute conditions.
