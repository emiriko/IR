We investigate resonant active-sterile neutrino oscillations emergent from
the interplay between matter, CPT- and Lorentz-violating coefficients with
different energy dependences. Novel and experimentally accessible resonant
neutrino oscillation phenomenologies are predicted and possible implications
for observed, but yet unexplained, neutrino oscillation anomalies such as LSND
and MiniBooNE are discussed.
