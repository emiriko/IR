Magnetoconductivity of the disordered two- and three-dimensional
superconductors is addressed at the onset of superconducting transition. In
this regime transport is dominated by the fluctuation effects and we account
for the interaction corrections coming from the Cooper channel. In contrast to
many previous studies we consider strong magnetic fields and various
temperature regimes, which allow to resolve the existing discrepancies with the
experiments. Specifically, we find saturation of the fluctuations induced
magneto-conductivity for both two- and three-dimensional superconductors at
already moderate magnetic fields and discuss possible dimensional crossover at
the immediate vicinity of the critical temperature. The surprising observation
is that closer to the transition temperature weaker magnetic field provides the
saturation. It is remarkable also that interaction correction to
magnetoconductivity coming from the Cooper channel, and specifically the so
called Maki-Thompson contribution, remains to be important even away from the
critical region.
