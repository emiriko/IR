We present a generic method for improving the effectiveness of heavy particle
searches in hadronic channels at the Large Hadron Collider. By selectively
removing, or pruning, protojets from the substructure provided by a k_T-style
jet algorithm, we improve the mass resolution for heavy decays and decrease the
QCD background. We show that the protojets removed are typical of soft
radiation and underlying event contributions, and atypical of accurately
reconstructed heavy particles.
