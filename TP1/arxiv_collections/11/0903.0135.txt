We experimentally demonstrate electromagnetically induced transparency and
light storage with ultracold 87Rb atoms in a Mott insulating state in a three
dimensional optical lattice. We have observed light storage times of about 240
ms, to our knowledge the longest ever achieved in ultracold atomic samples.
Using the differential light shift caused by a spatially inhomogeneous far
detuned light field we imprint a "phase gradient" across the atomic sample,
resulting in controlled angular redirection of the retrieved light pulse.
