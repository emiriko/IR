The total entropy production fluctuations are studied in some exactly
solvable models. For these systems, the detailed fluctuation theorem holds even
in the transient state, provided initially the system is prepared in thermal
equilibrium. The nature of entropy production during the relaxation of a system
to equilibrium is analyzed. The averaged entropy production over a finite time
interval gives a better bound for the average work performed on the system than
that obtained from the well known Jarzynski equality. Moreover, the average
entropy production as a quantifier for information theoretic nature of
irreversibility for finite time nonequilibrium processes is discussed.
