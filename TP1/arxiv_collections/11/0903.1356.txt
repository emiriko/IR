The main point of this communication is that there is a small non-negligible
amount of eddies-outliers/very strong events (comprising a significant subset
of the tails of the PDF of velocity increments in the nominally-defined
inertial range) for which viscosity/dissipation is of utmost importance at
whatever high Reynolds number. These events contribute significantly to the
values of higher-order structure functions and their anomalous scaling. Thus
the anomalous scaling is not an attribute of the conventionally-defined
inertial range, and the latter is not a well-defined concept. The claim above
is supported by an analysis of high-Reynolds-number flows in which among other
things it was possible to evaluate the instantaneous rate of energy
dissipation.
