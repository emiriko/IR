Action of solar wind on arbitrarily shaped interplanetary dust particle is
investigated. The final relativistically covariant equation of motion of the
particle contains both orbital evolution and change of particle's mass.
Non-radial solar wind velocity vector is also included. The covariant equation
of motion reduces to the Poynting-Robertson effect in the limiting case when
spherical particle is treated, the speed of the incident solar wind corpuscles
tends to the speed of light and the corpuscles spread radially from the Sun.
The results of quantum mechanics have to be incorporated into the physical
considerations, in order to obtain the limiting case. The condition for the
solar wind effect on motion of spherical interplanetary dust particle is
$\vec{p}'_{out}$ $=$ (1 $-$ $\sigma'_{pr} / \sigma'_{tot}$) $\vec{p}'_{in}$,
where $\vec{p}'_{in}$ and $\vec{p}'_{out}$ are incoming and outgoing radiation
momenta (per unit time) measured in the proper frame of reference of the
particle; $\sigma'_{pr}$ and $\sigma'_{tot}$ are solar wind pressure and total
scattering cross sections.
  Real flux density of solar wind energy produces shift of perihelion of
interplanetary dust particles. This result significantly differs from the
standard treatment of the action of the solar wind on dust particles, when
analogy with the Poynting-Robertson effect is stressed. Moreover, the evolution
of the shift of perihelion depends on orbital position of the parent body at
the time of ejection of the particle.
