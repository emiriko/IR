We report classical and tight-binding molecular dynamics simulations of the
C$_{60}$ fullerene and cubane molecular crystal in order to investigate
intermolecular dynamics and polymerization processes. Our results show that,
for 200 K and 400 K, cubane molecules remain basically fixed, presenting only
thermal vibrations, while C$_{60}$ fullerenes show rotational motions.
Fullerenes perform "free" rotational motions at short times ($\lesssim$ 1 ps),
small amplitude hindered rotational motions (librations) at intermediate times,
and rotational diffusive dynamics at long times ($\gtrsim$ 10 ps). The
mechanisms underlying these dynamics are presented. Random copolymerization
among cubanes and fullerenes were observed when temperature is increased,
leading to the formation of a disordered structure. Changes in the radial
distribution function and electronic density of states indicate the coexistence
of amorphous and crystalline phases. The different conformational phases that
cubanes and fullerenes undergo during the copolymerization process are
discussed.
