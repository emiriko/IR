The superconducting gap in FeAs-based superconductor SmFeAs(O1-xFx) (x = 0.15
and 0.30) and the temperature dependence of the sample with x = 0.15 have been
measured by Andreev reflection spectroscopy. The intrinsic superconducting gap
is independent of contacts while many other "gap-like" features vary
appreciably for different contacts. The determined gap value of 2D = 13.34
+/-0.47 meV for SmFeAs(O0.85F0.15) gives 2D/kBTC = 3.68, close to the BCS
prediction of 3.53. The superconducting gap decreases with temperature and
vanishes at TC, in a manner similar to the BCS behavior but dramatically
different from that of the nodal pseudogap behavior in cuprate superconductors.
