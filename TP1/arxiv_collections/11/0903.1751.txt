Various implementations of the Unitarity method have been developed to
compute one-loop amplitudes in gauge theories. In this paper we present an
implementation which uses canonical forms to generate the rational coefficients
of the basis integral functions. As an example, we present the results for the
N=1 contribution to seven gluon scattering in closed, rational, analytic form.
