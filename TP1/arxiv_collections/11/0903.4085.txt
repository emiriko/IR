Controllable point junctions between different quantum Hall phases are a
necessary building block for the development of mesoscopic circuits based on
fractionally-charged quasiparticles. We demonstrate how particle-hole duality
can be exploited to realize such point-contact junctions. We show an
implementation for the case filling factors $\nu=1$ and $\nu^*\le1$ in which
both the fractional filling $\nu^*$ and the coupling strength can be finely and
independently tuned. A peculiar crossover from insulating to conducting
behavior as $\nu^*$ goes from 1/3 to 1 is observed. These results highlight the
key role played on inter-edge tunneling by local charge depletion at the point
contact.
