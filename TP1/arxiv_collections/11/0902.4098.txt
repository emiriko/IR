Constructing and studying distributed control systems requires the analysis
of the Laplacian spectra and the forest structure of directed graphs. In this
paper, we present some basic results of this analysis partially obtained by the
present authors. We also discuss the application of these results to
decentralized control and touch upon some problems of spectral graph theory.
