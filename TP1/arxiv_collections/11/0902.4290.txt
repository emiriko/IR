We study global dynamics of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system for flows
of two types of ions through a narrow tubular-like membrane channel. As the
radius of the cross-section of the three-dimensional tubular-like membrane
channel approaches zero, a one-dimensional limiting PNP system is derived. This
one-dimensional limiting system differs from previous studied one-dimensional
PNP systems in that it encodes the defining geometry of the three-dimensional
membrane channel. To justify this limiting process, we show that the global
attractors of the three-dimensional PNP systems are upper semi-continuous to
that of the limiting PNP system. We then examine the dynamics of the
one-dimensional limiting PNP system. For large Debye number, the steady-state
of the one-dimensional limiting PNP system is completed analyzed using the
geometric singular perturbation theory. For a special case, an entropy-type
Lyapunov functional is constructed to show the global, asymptotic stability of
the steady-state.
