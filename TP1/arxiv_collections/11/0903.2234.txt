We present a detailed analysis of exclusive semileptonic decays of Bc meson
involving pseudoscalar and vector mesons in the BSW framework, by investigating
the effects of the flavor dependence on the average transverse quark momentum
inside a meson. Branching ratios of exclusive semileptonic decays of Bc meson
are predicted.
