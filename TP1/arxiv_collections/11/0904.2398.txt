In recent years, a number of experiments have been conducted with the goal of
studying cosmic rays at GeV to TeV energies. This is a particularly interesting
regime from the perspective of indirect dark matter detection. To draw reliable
conclusions regarding dark matter from cosmic ray measurements, however, it is
important to first understand the propagation of cosmic rays through the
magnetic and radiation fields of the Milky Way. In this paper, we constrain the
characteristics of the cosmic ray propagation model through comparison with
observational inputs, including recent data from the CREAM experiment, and use
these constraints to estimate the corresponding uncertainties in the spectrum
of cosmic ray electrons and positrons from dark matter particles annihilating
in the halo of the Milky Way.
