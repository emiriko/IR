It is well-known that for unflavored leptogenesis there is in general no
connection between low and high energy CP violation. We stress that for a
non-unitary lepton mixing matrix this may not be the case. We give an
illustrative example for this connection and show that the non-standard CP
phases that are induced by non-unitarity can be responsible for observable
effects in neutrino oscillation experiments as well as for the generation of
the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Lepton Flavor Violation in decays such as
tau -> mu gamma can also be induced at an observable level. We also comment on
neutrino mass limits from leptogenesis, which get barely modified in case of a
non-unitary mixing matrix.
