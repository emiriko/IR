The optical properties of slab waveguides made of indefinite permittivity
($\vep$) materials (IEM) are considered. In this medium the transverse
permittivity is negative while the longitudinal permittivity is positive. At
any given frequency the waveguide supports an infinite number of transverse
magnetic (TM) eigenmodes. For a slab waveguide with a fixed thickness, at most
only one TM mode is forward-wave. The rest of them are backward waves which can
have very large phase index. At a critical thickness, the waveguide supports
degenerate forward- and backward-wave modes with zero group velocity. Above the
critical thickness, the waveguide supports complex-conjugate decay modes
instead of propagating modes. The presence of loss in IEMs will lift the
degeneracy, resulting in modes with finite group velocity. Feasible realization
is proposed. The performance of IEM waveguide is analyzed and possible
applications are discussed which are supported by numerical calculations. These
slab waveguides can be used to make optical delay lines in optical buffers to
slow down and trap light, to form open cavities, to generate strong
longitudinal electric fields, and as phase shifters in optical integrated
circuits.
