We study a model for leptogenesis in which the total CP asymmetries in the
decays and scatterings involving the SU(2) singlet seesaw neutrinos $N_\alpha$
vanish ($\epsilon_{N_\alpha}=0$). Leptogenesis is possible due to non-vanishing
CP violating lepton flavor asymmetries, realizing a situation in which the
baryon asymmetry is due exclusively to flavor effects. We study the production
of a net lepton asymmetry by solving the Boltzmann equations specific to this
model, and we show that successful leptogenesis can be obtained at a scale as
low as the TeV. We also discuss constraints on the model parameter space
arising from current experimental upper limits on lepton flavor violating
decays.
