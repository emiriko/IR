We report the phenomenological impact of unparticles in the production of
di-jet at the LHC. We compute the scalar, spin-1 and spin-2 unparticle
contributions to the dijet cross sections and present our results in different
kinematical distributions. We find that the scalar unparticle contribution is
dominant over that of the spin-1 and spin-2 unparticles for the same coupling
values.
