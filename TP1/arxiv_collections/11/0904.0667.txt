We propose a scenario of quantum memory for light based on Raman scattering.
The storage medium is a vapor and the different spectral components of the
incoming signal are stored in different atomic velocity classes. One uses
appropriate pulses to reverse the resulting Doppler phase shift and to
regenerate the signal, without distortion, in the backward direction. The
different stages of the protocol are detailed and the recovery efficiency is
calculated in the semi-classical picture. Since the memory bandwidth is
determined by the Raman transition Doppler width, it can be adjusted by
changing the angle of the signal and control beams. The optical depth also
depends on the beam angle. As a consequence the available optical depth can be
optimized, depending on the needed bandwidth. The predicted recovery efficiency
is close to 100% for large optical depth.
