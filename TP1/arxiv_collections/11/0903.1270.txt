Using muon-spin rotation, we studied the in-plane (\lambda_ab) and the out of
plane (\lambda_c) magnetic field penetration depth in SrFe_1.75Co_0.25As_2
(T_c=13.3 K). Both \lambda_ab(T) and \lambda_c(T) are consistent with the
presence of two superconducting gaps with the gap to T_c ratios
2\Delta/k_BT_c=7.2 and 2.7. The penetration depth anisotropy
\gamma_\lambda=\lambda_c/\lambda_ab increases from \gamma_\lambda=2.1 at T_c to
2.7 at 1.6 K. The mean internal field in the superconducting state increases
with decreasing temperature, just opposite to the diamagnetic response seen in
magnetization experiments. This unusual behavior suggests that the external
field induces a magnetic order which is maintained throughout the whole sample
volume.
