The evolution of pressure induced superconductivity in single crystal as well
as polycrystalline samples of BaFe2As2 has been investigated through
temperature dependent electrical resistivity studies in 0-7 GPa pressure range.
While the superconducting transition remains incomplete in polycrystalline
sample, a clear pressure induced superconductivity with zero resistivity at the
expense of magnetic transition, associated with spin density wave (SDW), is
observed in the single crystal sample. The superconducting transition
temperature (TC) is seen to increase upto a moderate pressure of about ~1.5 GPa
and decreases monotonically beyond this pressure. The SDW transition
temperature TSDW decreases rapidly with increasing pressure and vanishes above
~1.5 GPa.
