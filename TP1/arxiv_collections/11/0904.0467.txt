We give a new proof of a celebrated theorem of Dennis Johnson that asserts
that the kernel of the Johnson homomorphism on the Torelli subgroup of the
mapping class group is generated by separating twists. In fact, we prove a more
general result that also applies to "subsurface Torelli groups". Using this, we
extend Johnson's calculation of the rational abelianization of the Torelli
group not only to the subsurface Torelli groups, but also to finite-index
subgroups of the Torelli group that contain the kernel of the Johnson
homomorphism.
