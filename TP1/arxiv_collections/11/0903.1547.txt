We revisited a model for charmonium hybrid meson with a magnetic gluon [Yu.
S. Kalashnikova and A. V. Nefediev, Phys. Rev. D {\bf 77}, 054025 (2008)] and
improved the numerical calculations. These improvements support the hybrid
meson interpretation of X(4260). Within the same model, we computed the hybrid
meson mass with an electric gluon which is resolved to be lighter. Relativistic
effects and coupling channels decreased also the mass.
