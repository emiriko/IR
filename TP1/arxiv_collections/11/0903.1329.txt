Compared to bright star searches, surveys for transiting planets against
fainter (V=12-18) stars have the advantage of much higher sky densities of
dwarf star primaries, which afford easier detection of small transiting bodies.
Furthermore, deep searches are capable of probing a wider range of stellar
environments. On the other hand, for a given spatial resolution and transit
depth, deep searches are more prone to confusion from blended eclipsing
binaries. We present a powerful mitigation strategy for the blending problem
that includes the use of image deconvolution and high resolution imaging. The
techniques are illustrated with Lupus-TR-3 and very recent IR imaging with
PANIC on Magellan. The results are likely to have implications for the CoRoT
and KEPLER missions designed to detect transiting planets of terrestrial size.
