We present follow-up observations of comet 17/P Holmes after its extreme
outburst in brightness, which occurred end of October 2007. We obtained 58
V-band images of the comet between October 2007 and February 2008, using the
Cassegrain-Teleskop-Kamera (CTK) at the University Observatory Jena. We present
precise astrometry of the comet, which yields its most recent Keplerian orbital
elements. Furthermore, we show that the comet's coma expands quite linearly
with a velocity of about 1650km/s between October and December 2007. The
photometric monitoring of comet 17/P Holmes shows that its photometric activity
level decreased by about 5.9mag within 105 days after its outburst.
