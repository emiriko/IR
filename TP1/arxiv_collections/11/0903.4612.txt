We consider the goodness of fit testing problem for stochastic differential
equation with small diffiusion coefficient. The basic hypothesis is always
simple and it is described by the known trend coefficient. We propose several
tests of the type of Cramer-von Mises, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Chi-Square. The
power functions of these tests we study for a special classes of close
alternatives. We discuss the construction of the goodness of fit test based on
the local time and the possibility of the construction of asymptotically
distribution free tests in the case of composite basic hypothesis.
