We study quantum protocols among two distrustful parties. Under the sole
assumption of correctness - guaranteeing that honest players obtain their
correct outcomes - we show that every protocol implementing a non-trivial
primitive necessarily leaks information to a dishonest player. This extends
known impossibility results to all non-trivial primitives. We provide a
framework for quantifying this leakage and argue that leakage is a good measure
for the privacy provided to the players by a given protocol. Our framework also
covers the case where the two players are helped by a trusted third party. We
show that despite the help of a trusted third party, the players cannot amplify
the cryptographic power of any primitive. All our results hold even against
quantum honest-but-curious adversaries who honestly follow the protocol but
purify their actions and apply a different measurement at the end of the
protocol. As concrete examples, we establish lower bounds on the leakage of
standard universal two-party primitives such as oblivious transfer.
