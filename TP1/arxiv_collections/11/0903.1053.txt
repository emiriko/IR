The chemical compositions of stars from the Asymptotic Giant Branch are still
poorly known due to the low temperatures of their atmospheres and therefore the
presence of many molecular transitions hampering the analysis of atomic lines.
One way to overcome this difficulty is by the study of lines in regions free
from molecular contamination. We have chosen some of those regions to study the
chemical abundance of the S-type star GZ Peg. Stellar parameters are derived
from spectroscopic analysis and a metallicity of -0.77 dex is found. Chemical
abundances of 8 elements are reported and an enhancement of s-process elements
is inferred, typical to that of an S-type star.
