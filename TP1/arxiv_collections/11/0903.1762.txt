It is shown that the putting stroke of world class golfers can be described
as the motion of a pendulum driven at twice its natural resonance frequency.
This model minimizes error in the speed of the putter head due to random errors
in the magnitude of the applied forces, providing rational for why great
players have developed this particular putting stroke.
