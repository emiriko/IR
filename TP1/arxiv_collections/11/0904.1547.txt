Minicharged particles arise in many extensions of the Standard Model. Their
contribution to the vacuum polarization modifies Coulomb's law via the Uehling
potential. In this note we argue that tests for electromagnetic fifth forces
can therefore be a sensitive probe of minicharged particles. In the low mass
range <~micro-eV existing constraints from Cavendish type experiments provide
the best model-independent bounds on minicharged particles.
