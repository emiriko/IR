In recent years two intriguing observations have been made for N=4 super
Yang-Mills theory and for superstrings on AdS5xS5: In the planar limit the
computation of the spectrum is vastly simplified by the apparent integrability
of the models. Furthermore, planar scattering amplitudes of the gauge theory
display remarkable features which have been attributed to the appearance of a
dual superconformal symmetry. Here we review the connection of these two
developments from the point of view of the classical symmetry by means of a
super-T-self-duality. In particular, we show explicitly how the charges of
conformal symmetry and of the integrable structure are related to the dual
ones.
