The formalism of the models with Petri networks provides a sound theoretical
base, supported by powerful mathematical methods able to extract information
necessary for the formalism and simulation of the real system that provides
features of competition and synchronization. The paper presents a model based
on a Petri net, in order to extract information relative to the technological
producing process of a food additive.
