Guided by the recently published science case for the future of European
VLBI, EVN2015, a roadmap for the future of the EVN is sketched out in this
paper. The various desired technical improvements are being discussed with an
emphasis on the role of e-VLBI. With this innovation new scientific
capabilities are introduced. In this way the EVN is also positioned as an
interesting platform for exercising new techniques and operational models,
complementary to other SKA pathfinders. In return, the technology development
for the SKA can have a positive impact on the scientific capabilities of VLBI,
for example on the development of a next generation correlator, capable to
process much larger data-rates. The development of cheap, frequency agile
antennas can also be of great importance for VLBI. This adds to the potential
for maintaining a Northern hemisphere, global VLBI array in the SKA era.
