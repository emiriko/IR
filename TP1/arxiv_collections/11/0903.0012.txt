We propose an approach to measuring nonresonant coupled systems, which gives
a parametrically smaller error than the conventional fast projective
measurements. The approach takes into account that, due to the coupling,
excitations are not entirely localized on individual systems. It combines high
spectral selectivity of the detector with temporal resolution and uses the
ideas of the quantum diffusion theory. The results bear on quantum computing
with perpetually coupled qubits.
