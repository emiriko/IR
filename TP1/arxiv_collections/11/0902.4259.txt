We present the results of a photometric and spectroscopic study of the white
dwarf candidate members of the intermediate age open clusters NGC3532 and
NGC2287. Of the nine objects investigated, it is determined that six are
probable members of the clusters, four in NGC3532 and two in NGC2287. For these
six white dwarfs we use our estimates of their cooling times together with the
cluster ages to constrain the lifetimes and masses of their progenitor stars.
We examine the location of these objects in initial mass-final mass space and
find that they now provide no evidence for substantial scatter in initial
mass-final mass relation as suggested by previous investigations. Instead, we
demonstrate that, when combined with current data from other solar metalicity
open clusters and the Sirius binary system, they hint at an IFMR that is
steeper in the initial mass range 3M$_{\odot}$$\simless$M$_{\rm
init}$$\simless$4M$_{\odot}$ than at progenitor masses immediately lower and
higher than this. This form is generally consistent with the predictions of
stellar evolutionary models and can aid population synthesis models in
reproducing the relatively sharp drop observed at the high mass end of the main
peak in the mass distribution of white dwarfs.
