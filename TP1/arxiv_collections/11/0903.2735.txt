Linear (spectro) polarimetry is usually performed using separate photon flux
measurements after spatial or temporal polarization modulation. Such classical
polarimeters are limited in sensitivity and accuracy by systematic effects and
noise. We describe a spectral modulation principle that is based on encoding
the full linear polarization properties of light in its spectrum. Such spectral
modulation is obtained with an optical train of an achromatic quarter-wave
retarder, an athermal multiple-order retarder, and a polarizer. The emergent
spectral modulation is sinusoidal with its amplitude scaling with the degree of
linear polarization and its phase scaling with the angle of linear
polarization. The large advantage of this passive setup is that all
polarization information is, in principle, contained in a single spectral
measurement, thereby eliminating all differential effects that potentially
create spurious polarization signals. Since the polarization properties are
obtained through curve fitting, the susceptibility to noise is relatively low.
We provide general design options for a spectral modulator and describe the
design of a prototype modulator. Currently, the setup in combination with a
dedicated retrieval algorithm can be used to measure linear polarization
signals with a relative accuracy of 5%.
