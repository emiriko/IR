In this paper, we present a nonparametric method to estimate the
heterogeneity of a random medium from the angular distribution of intensity
transmitted through a slab of random material. Our approach is based on the
modeling of forward multiple scattering using Compound Poisson Processes on
compact Lie groups. The estimation technique is validated through numerical
simulations based on radiative transfer theory.
