We study population dynamics of a trapped spin-1 Bose gas above the
Bose-Einstein transition temperature. Starting from the semiclassical kinetic
equation for a spin-1 gas, we derive a coupled rate equations for the
populations of internal states. Solving the rate equations, we discuss the
dynamical evolution of spin populations. We also estimate the characteristic
timescale in which the system reaches equilibrium. Finally, we briefly discuss
how the presence of the condensate will affect the population dynamics.
