Quantum communication places stringent requirements on single-photon sources.
Here we report a theoretical study of the cavity Purcell enhancement of two
diamond point defects, the nickel-nitrogen (NE8) and silicon-vacancy (SiV)
centers, for high-performance, near on-demand single-photon generation. By
coupling the centers strongly to high-finesse optical photonic-bandgap cavities
with modest quality factor Q = O(10^4) and small mode volume V = O(\lambda^3),
these system can deliver picosecond single-photon pulses at their zero-phonon
lines with probabilities of 0.954 (NE8) and 0.812 (SiV) under a realistic
optical excitation scheme. The undesirable blinking effect due to transitions
via metastable states can also be suppressed with O(10^{-4}) blinking
probability. We analyze the application of these enhanced centers, including
the previously-studied cavity-enhanced nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, to
long-distance BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) in fiber-based, open-air
terrestrial and satellite-ground setups. In this comparative study, we show
that they can deliver performance comparable with decoy state implementation
with weak coherent sources, and are most suitable for open-air communication.
