We prove that if $T$ is an $\mathbb R$-tree with a minimal free isometric
action of $F_N$, then the $Out(F_N)$-stabilizer of the projective class $[T]$
is virtually cyclic.
  For the special case where $T=T_+(\phi)$ is the forward limit tree of an
atoroidal iwip element $\phi\in Out(F_N)$ this is a consequence of the results
of Bestvina, Feighn and Handel, via very different methods.
  We also derive a new proof of the Tits alternative for subgroups of
$Out(F_N)$ containing an iwip (not necessarily atoroidal): we prove that every
such subgroup $G\le Out(F_N)$ is either virtually cyclic or contains a free
subgroup of rank two. The general case of the Tits alternative for subgroups of
$Out(F_N)$ is due to Bestvina, Feighn and Handel.
