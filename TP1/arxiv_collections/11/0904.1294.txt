We study the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation for a pseudoclassical particle
with anomalous magnetic moment in an external, stationary electromagnetic
field. We show that the transformation can be expressed in a closed form for
neutral particles in purely electrostatic fields and for neutral and charged
particles in external magnetostatic fields. The explicit expressions of the
diagonalized Hamiltonians are calculated.
