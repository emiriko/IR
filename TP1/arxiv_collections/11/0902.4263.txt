Motivated by the work of McCarthy and Papadopoulos for subgroups of mapping
class groups, we construct domains of proper discontinuity in the compactified
Outer space and in the projectivized space of geodesic currents for any
"sufficiently large" subgroup of $Out(F_N)$ (that is, a subgroup containing a
hyperbolic iwip).
  As a corollary we prove that for $N\ge 3$ the action of $Out(F_N)$ on the
subset of $\mathbb PCurr(F_N)$ consisting of all projectivized currents with
full support is properly discontinuous.
