We present cross section measurements for Z/gamma*+jets+X production,
differential in the transverse momenta of the three leading jets. The data
sample was collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron proton
anti-proton collider at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV and corresponds to
an integrated luminosity of 1 fb-1. Leading and next-to-leading order
perturbative QCD predictions are compared with the measurements, and agreement
is found within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties. We also make
comparisons with the predictions of four event generators. Two
parton-shower-based generators show significant shape and normalization
differences with respect to the data. In contrast, two generators combining
tree-level matrix elements with a parton shower give a reasonable description
of the the shapes observed in data, but the predicted normalizations show
significant differences with respect to the data, reflecting large scale
uncertainties. For specific choices of scales, the normalizations for either
generator can be made to agree with the measurements.
