The first step, before investigating physical origins of noise in resonators,
is to investigate correlations between external measurement parameters and the
resonator noise. Tests and measurements are mainly performed on an advanced
phase noise measurement system, recently set up. The resonator noise is
examined as a function of the sensitivity to the drive level, the temperature
operating point and the tuning capacitor.
