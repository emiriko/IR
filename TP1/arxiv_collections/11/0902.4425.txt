We study the $N \pi K$ system in order to investigate the possibility of
existence of strangeness +1 resonance(s). The formalism consists of solving the
Faddeev equations with the $N \pi$, $\pi K $ and $K N$ $t$-matrices obtained
from chiral dynamics. The same formalism, which leads to the finding of several
$1/2^+$ resonances in the corresponding three-body $S$ = -1 channels in the
1400-2000 MeV energy region, results into only one broad bump around 1700 MeV
with isospin 0. The amplitudes in isospin 1 and 2 configuration do not have any
resonant structure.
