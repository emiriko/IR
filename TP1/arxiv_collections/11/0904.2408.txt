Two atoms in an ultracold gas are correlated at short inter-atomic distances
due to threshold effects where the potential energy of their interaction
dominates the kinetic energy. The correlations manifest themselves in a
distinct nodal structure of the density matrix at short inter-atomic distances.
Pump-probe spectroscopy has recently been suggested [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103,
260401 (2009)] to probe these pair correlations: A suitably chosen, short
photoassociation laser pulse depletes the ground state pair density within the
photoassociation window, creating a non-stationary wave packet in the
electronic ground state. The dynamics of this non-stationary wave packet is
monitored by time-delayed probe and ionization pulses. Here, we discuss how the
choice of the pulse parameters affects experimental feasibility of this
pump-probe spectroscopy of two-body correlations.
