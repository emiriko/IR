Astrometry can detect rocky planets in a broad range of masses and orbital
distances and measure their masses and three-dimensional orbital parameters,
including eccentricity and inclination, to provide the properties of
terrestrial planets. The masses of both the new planets and the known gas
giants can be measured unambiguously, allowing a direct calculation of the
gravitational interactions, both past and future. Such dynamical interactions
inform theories of the formation and evolution of planetary systems, including
Earth-like planets. Astrometry is the only technique technologically ready to
detect planets of Earth mass in the habitable zone (HZ) around solar-type stars
within 20 pc. These Earth analogs are close enough for follow-up observations
to characterize the planets by infrared imaging and spectroscopy with planned
future missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the
Terrestrial Planet Finder/Darwin. Employing a demonstrated astrometric
precision of 1 microarcsecond and a noise floor under 0.1 micro-arcseconds, SIM
Lite can make multiple astrometric measurements of the nearest 60 F-, G-, and
K-type stars during a five-year mission. SIM Lite directly tests theories of
rocky planet formation and evolution around Sun-like stars and identifies the
nearest potentially habitable planets for later spaceborne imaging, e.g., with
Terrestrial Planet Finder and Darwin. SIM was endorsed by the two recent
Decadal Surveys and it meets the highest-priority goal of the 2008 AAAC
Exoplanet Task Force.
