We have extended Ramsey spectroscopy by stepping the probe frequency during
the two Ramsey excitation pulses to compensate frequency shifts induced by the
excitation itself. This makes precision Ramsey spectroscopy applicable even for
transitions that have Stark and Zeeman shifts comparable to the spectroscopic
resolution. The method enables a new way to evaluate and compensate key
frequency shifts, which benefits in particular, optical clocks based on
magnetic field-induced, spectroscopy, two-photon transitions, or heavily
forbidden transitions.
