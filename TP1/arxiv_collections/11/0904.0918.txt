We show that configurations exist in which the correlation functions and the
degree of violation of Bell-type inequalities in the relativistic
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) experiment have local extrema for some values of
the velocities of the EPR particles. Moreover, this strange behavior can be
observed for both discussed relativistic spin operators and for spin-1/2 as
well as spin-1 particles.
