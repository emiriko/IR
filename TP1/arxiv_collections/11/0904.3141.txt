We "explain", using a Classical approach, how the Universe was created out of
"nothing", i.e., with no input of initial energy nor mass. The inflationary
phase, with exponential expansion, is accounted for, automatically, by our
equation of state for the very early Universe. This is a Universe with
no-initial infinite singularity of energy density.
