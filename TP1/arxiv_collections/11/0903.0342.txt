We give B\"acklund transformations for first and second Painlev\'e
hierarchies. These B\"acklund transformations are generalization of known
B\"acklund transformations of the first and second Painlev\'e equations and
they relate the considered hierarchies to new hierarchies of Painlev\'e-type
equations.
