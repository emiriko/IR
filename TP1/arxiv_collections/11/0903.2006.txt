Monovalent impurities on graphene can be divided into ionically and
covalently bond impurities. The covalent impurities cause universal midgap
states as the carbon atom next to the impurity is effectively decoupled from
the graphene pi-bands. The electronic structure of graphene suppresses
migration of these impurities and making the universal midgap very stable. This
effect is strongest for neutral covalently bond impurities. The ionically bond
impurities have migration barriers of typically less than 0.1eV. An asymmetry
between anions and cations regarding their adsorption sites and topology of
their potential energy landscape is predicted.
