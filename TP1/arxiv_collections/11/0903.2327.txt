Graphene has emerged as an electronic material that is promising for device
applications and for studying two-dimensional electron gases with relativistic
dispersion near two Dirac points. Nonetheless, deviations from Dirac-like
spectroscopy have been widely reported with varying interpretations. Here we
show evidence for strain-induced spatial modulations in the local conductance
of single-layer graphene on SiO2 substrates from scanning tunneling microscopic
(STM) studies. We find that strained graphene exhibits parabolic, U-shaped
conductance vs. bias voltage spectra rather than the V-shaped spectra expected
for Dirac fermions, whereas V-shaped spectra are recovered in regions of
relaxed graphene. Strain maps derived from the STM studies further reveal
direct correlation with the local tunneling conductance. These results are
attributed to a strain-induced frequency increase in the out-of-plane phonon
mode that mediates the low-energy inelastic charge tunneling into graphene.
