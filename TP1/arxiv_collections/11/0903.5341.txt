We register a stochastic sequence affected by one disorder. Monitoring of the
sequence is made in the circumstances when not full information about
distributions before and after the change is available. The initial problem of
disorder detection is transformed to optimal stopping of observed sequence.
Formula for optimal decision functions is derived.
