There is a precise sense in which the requirement of background independence
suffices to uniquely select the kinematics of loop quantum gravity (LQG).
Specifically, the fundamental kinematic algebra of LQG admits a unique
diffeomorphism invariant state. Although this result has been established
rigorously, it comes as a surprise to researchers working with other approaches
to quantum gravity. The goal of this article is to explain the underlying
reasons in a pedagogical fashion using geometrodynamics, keeping the
technicalities at their minimum. This discussion will bring out the
surprisingly powerful role played by diffeomorphism invariance (and covariance)
in non-perturbative, canonical quantum gravity.
