The nonlocal correlations of multipartite entangled states can be reproduced
by a classical model if sufficiently many parties join together or if
sufficiently many parties broadcast their measurement inputs. The maximal
number m of groups and the minimal number k of broadcasting parties that allow
for the reproduction of a given set of correlations quantify their multipartite
nonlocal content. We show how upper-bounds on m and lower-bounds on k can be
computed from the violation of the Mermin-Svetlichny inequalities. While
n-partite GHZ states violate these inequalities maximally, we find that W
states violate them only by a very small amount.
