Current projects for large telescopes demand a proper knowledge of
atmospheric turbulence to design efficient adaptive optics systems in order to
reach large Strehl ratios. However, the proper characterization of the
turbulence above a particular site requires long-term monitoring. Due to the
lack of long-term information on turbulence, high-altitude winds (in particular
winds at the 200 mbar pressure level) were proposed as a parameter for
estimating the total turbulence at a particular site, with the advantage of
records of winds going back several decades. We present the first complete
study of atmospheric adaptive optics parameters above the Teide Observatory
(Canary Islands, Spain) in relation to wind speed. On-site measurements of
CN2(h) profiles (more than 20200 turbulence profiles) from G-SCIDAR
observations and wind vertical profiles from balloons have been used to
calculate the seeing, the isoplanatic angle and the coherence time. The
connection of these parameters to wind speeds at ground and 200 mbar pressure
level are shown and discussed. Our results confirm the well-known high quality
of the Canary Islands astronomical observatories.
