We report high-pressure skin depth measurements on the heavy fermion material
CeIn3 in magnetic fields up to 64 T using a self-resonant tank circuit based on
a tunnel diode oscillator. At ambient pressure, an anomaly in the skin depth is
seen at 45 T. The field where this anomaly occurs decreases with applied
pressure until approximately 1.0 GPa, where it begins to increase before
merging with the antiferromagnetic phase boundary. Possible origins for this
transport anomaly are explored in terms of a Fermi surface reconstruction. The
critical magnetic field at which the Neel ordered phase is suppressed is also
mapped as a function of pressure and extrapolates to the previous ambient
pressure measurements at high magnetic fields and high pressure measurements at
zero magnetic field.
