The Majorana resonant level model (MRLM) describes the universality class of
the two-channel/terminal Kondo model at the Toulouse point as well as of a
resonant level between two half-infinite Tomonaga--Luttinger liquids. We
analyze the time evolution of the electric current and of the population
function after an instantaneous switching on of the tunneling coupling. We find
that the only timescale, which governs the relaxation of the initial dot
preparation is the inverse contact transparency $\Gamma$, whatever the dot
offset energy $\Delta$, applied bias voltage or temperature. The voltage alone
determines the superimposed oscillatory behavior of the observables for weak
detuning $|\Delta|<\Gamma/2$. In the opposite case of strong detuning
$|\Delta|>\Gamma/2$ a beating pattern emerges. For the current the finite
temperature plays the similar role as the hybridization. The dot population
function dynamics approaches that of a resonant ($\Delta=0$) setup upon
increasing the voltage or/and temperature.
