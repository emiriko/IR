The soft diffuse X-ray emission of twelve fields observed with Suzaku are
presented together with two additional fields from previous analyses. All have
galactic longitudes 65 deg < l < 295 deg to avoid contributions from the very
bright diffuse source that extends at least 30 deg from the Galactic center.
The surface brightnesses of the Suzaku nine fields for which apparently
uncontaminated ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS) were available were statistically
consistent with the RASS values, with an upper limit for differences of 17 x
10^{-6} c s^{-1} amin^{-2} in R45}-band. The Ovii and Oviii intensities are
well correlated to each other, and Ovii emission shows an intensity floor at ~2
photons s^{-1} cm^{-2 str^{-1} (LU). The high-latitude Oviii emission shows a
tight correlation with excess of Ovii emission above the floor, with (Oviii
intensity) = 0.5 x [(Ovii intensity) -2 LU], suggesting that temperatures
averaged over different line-of-sight show a narrow distribution around ~0.2
keV. We consider that the offset intensity of Ovii arises from the Heliospheric
solar wind charge exchange and perhaps from the local hot bubble, and that the
excess Ovii (2-7 LU) is emission from more distant parts of the Galaxy. The
total bolometric luminosity of this galactic emission is estimated to be 4 x
10^{39} erg s^{-1}, and its characteristic temperature may be related to the
virial temperature of the Galaxy.
