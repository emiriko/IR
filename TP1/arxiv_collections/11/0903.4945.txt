The crystal and magnetic structures of the three-leg ladder compound Fe3BO5
have been investigated by single crystal x-ray diffraction and neutron powder
diffraction. Fe3BO5 contains two types of three-leg spin ladders. It shows a
charge ordering transition at 283 K, an antiferromagnetic transition at 112 K,
ferromagnetism below 70 K and a weak ferromagnetic behavior below 40K. The
x-ray data reveal a smooth charge ordering and an incomplete charge
localization down to 110K. Below the first magnetic transition, the first type
of ladders orders as ferromagnetically coupled antiferromagnetic chains, while
below 70K the second type of ladders orders as antiferromagnetically coupled
ferromagnetic chains.
