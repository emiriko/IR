Dynamically Adaptive Systems (DAS) are systems that modify their behavior and
structure in response to changes in their surrounding environment. Critical
mission systems increasingly incorporate adaptation and response to the
environment; examples include disaster relief and space exploration systems.
These systems can be decomposed in two parts: the adaptation policy that
specifies how the system must react according to the environmental changes and
the set of possible variants to reconfigure the system. A major challenge for
testing these systems is the combinatorial explosions of variants and
envi-ronment conditions to which the system must react. In this paper we focus
on testing the adaption policy and propose a strategy for the selection of
envi-ronmental variations that can reveal faults in the policy. Artificial
Shaking Table Testing (ASTT) is a strategy inspired by shaking table testing
(STT), a technique widely used in civil engineering to evaluate building's
structural re-sistance to seismic events. ASTT makes use of artificial
earthquakes that simu-late violent changes in the environmental conditions and
stresses the system adaptation capability. We model the generation of
artificial earthquakes as a search problem in which the goal is to optimize
different types of envi-ronmental variations.
