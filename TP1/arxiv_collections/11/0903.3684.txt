The last stable orbit (LSO) of a compact object (CO) is an important boundary
condition when performing numerical analysis of orbit evolution. Although the
LSO is already well understood for the case where a test-particle is in an
elliptical orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) and for the case of a
circular orbit about a Kerr black hole (KBH) of normalised spin, S (|J|/M^2,
where J is the spin angular momentum of the KBH); it is worthwhile to extend
our knowledge to include elliptical orbits about a KBH. This extension helps to
lay the foundation for a better understanding of gravitational wave (GW)
emission. The mathematical developments described in this work sprang from the
use of an effective potential (V) derived from the Kerr metric, which
encapsulates the Lense-Thirring precession. That allowed us to develop a new
form of analytical expression to calculate the LSO Radius for circular orbits
(R_LSO) of arbitrary KBH spin. We were then able to construct a numerical
method to calculate the latus rectum (l_LSO) for an elliptical LSO.
  Abstract Formulae for E^2 (square of normalised orbital energy) and L^2
(square of normalised orbital angular momentum) in terms of eccentricity, e,
and latus rectum, l, were previously developed by others for elliptical orbits
around an SBH and then extended to the KBH case; we used these results to
generalise our analytical l_LSO equations to elliptical orbits. LSO data
calculated from our analytical equations and numerical procedures, and those
previously published, are then compared and found to be in excellent agreement.
