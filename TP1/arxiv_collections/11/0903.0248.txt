In this letter we analyze the efficacy of the entangled output of
Pati-Braunstein deletion machine [3] as a teleportation channel. We analyze the
possibility of it violating the Bell's inequality. Interestingly we find that
for all values of the input parameter$\alpha$ the state does not violate the
Bell's inequality but when used as a teleportation channel can give a fidelity
higher than the classical optimum (i.e 2/3).
