We demonstrate that strong inter-orbital interaction is very efficient to
achieve superconductivity due to magnetic fluctuations in the iron pnictides.
Fermi surface states that are coupled by the antiferromagnetic wave vector are
often of different orbital nature, causing pair-hopping interactions between
distinct Fe-3d orbitals to become important. Performing a self-consistent FLEX
calculation below $T_{c}$ we determine the superconducting order parameter as
function of intra- and inter-orbital couplings. We find an $s^{\pm}$-pairing
state with $T_{c}\simeq80\mathrm{K}$ for realistic parameters.
