Short-wave perturbations in a relaxing medium, governed by a special
reduction of the Ostrovsky evolution equation, and later derived by Whitham,
are studied using the gradient-holonomic integrability algorithm.The
bi-Hamiltonicity and complete integrability of the corresponding dynamical
system is stated and an infinite hierarchy of commuting to each other
conservation laws of dispersive type are found. The two- and four-dimensional
invariant reductions are studied in detail. The well defined regularization of
the model is constructed and its Lax type integrability is discussed.
