We have found an isolated polar disk galaxy in what appears to be a
cosmological wall situated between two voids. This void galaxy is unique as its
polar disk was discovered serendipitously in an HI survey of SDSS void
galaxies, with no optical counterpart to the HI polar disk. Yet the HI mass in
the disk is comparable to the stellar mass in the galaxy. This suggests slow
accretion of the HI material at a relatively recent time. There is also a hint
of a warp in the outer parts of the HI disk. The central, stellar disk appears
relatively blue, with faint near UV emission, and is oriented (roughly)
parallel to the surrounding wall, implying gas accretion from out of the voids.
The considerable gas mass and apparent lack of stars in the polar disk, coupled
with the general underdensity of the environment, supports recent theories of
cold flow accretion as an alternate formation mechanism for polar disk
galaxies.
