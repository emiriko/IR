CONTEXT: The study of pulsation in Pre--Main--Sequence intermediate-mass
stars represents an important tool for deriving information on fundamental
stellar parameters and internal structure, as well as for testing current
theoretical models. Interest in this class of variable stars has significantly
increased during the last decade and about 30 members are presently known in
the literature. AIMS: We have constructed the frequency spectrum of the
oscillations in V346 Ori. We apply asteroseismic tools to these data to
estimate the intrinsic parameters (mass, luminosity, effective temperature) of
V346 Ori and to obtain information on its internal structure. METHODS: CCD time
series photometry in the Johnson V filter has been obtained for a total of
145.7 h of observations distributed over 36 nights. The resulting light curves
have been subjected to a detailed frequency analysis using updated numerical
techniques. Photometric and spectroscopic data have also been acquired to
determine reliable estimates of the stellar properties. RESULTS: We have
identified 13 oscillation frequencies, 6 of which with higher significance.
These have been compared with the predictions of non-radial adiabatic models.
The resulting best fit model has a mass of 2.1$\pm$0.2 $M_{\odot}$, luminosity
$\log{L/L_{\odot}}=1.37^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$, and effective temperature
7300$\pm$200 K. These values are marginally consistent with the association of
V346 Ori to Orion OB1a. Alternatively, V346 Ori could be placed at a slightly
larger distance than previously estimated.
