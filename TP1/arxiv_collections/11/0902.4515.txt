We review baryons in the D4-D8 holographic model of low energy QCD, with the
large $N_c$ and the large 't Hooft coupling limit. The baryon is identified
with a bulk soliton of a unit Pontryagin number, which from the
four-dimensional viewpoint translates to a heavily modified Skyrmion dressed by
condensates of spin one mesons. We explore classical properties and find that
the baryon in the holographic limit is amenable to an effective field theory
description. We also present a simple method to capture all leading and
subleading interactions in the $1/N_c$ and the derivative expansions. An
infinitely predictive model of baryon-meson interactions is thus derived,
although one may trust results only for low energy processes, given various
approximations in the bulk. We showcase a few comparisons to experiments, such
the leading axial couplings to pions, the leading vector-like coupling, and a
qualitative prediction of the electromagnetic vector dominance that involves
the entire tower of vector mesons. (This article is an expanded version of a
