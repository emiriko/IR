MWC 778 is an unusual and little-studied young stellar object located in the
IC 2144 nebula. Recent spectroscopy by Herbig and Vacca (2008) suggested the
presence of an edge-on circumstellar disk around it. We present near-infrared
adaptive optics imaging polarimetry and mid-infrared imaging which directly
confirm the suspected nearly-edge-on disk around MWC 778 (i ~ 70-80 degrees)
plus reveal a more extensive envelope pierced by bipolar outflow cavities. In
addition, our mid-infrared images and near-infrared polarization maps detect a
spiral-shaped structure surrounding MWC 778, with arms that extend beyond 6" on
either side of the star.
  Although MWC 778 has previously been classified as an Herbig Ae/Be star, the
properties of its central source (including its spectral type) remain fairly
uncertain. Herbig & Vacca (2008) suggested an F or G spectral type based on the
presence of metallic absorption lines in the optical spectrum, which implies
that MWC 778 may belong to the fairly rare class of Intermediate-Mass T Tauri
Stars (IMTTSs) which are the evolutionary precursors to Herbig Ae/Be objects.
Yet its integrated bolometric luminosity, > 750 L_sun (for an assumed distance
of 1 kpc) is surprisingly high for an F or G spectral type, even for an IMTTS.
We speculate on several possible explanations for this discrepancy, including
its true distance being much closer than 1 kpc, the presence of a binary
companion, and/or a non-stellar origin for the observed absorption lines.
