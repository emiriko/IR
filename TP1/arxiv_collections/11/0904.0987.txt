Landau's Fermi Liquid parameters are calculated for non-superfluid pure
neutron matter in the presence of a strong magnetic field at zero temperature.
The particle-hole interactions in the system, where a net magnetization may be
present, are characterized by these parameters in the framework of a multipolar
formalism. We use either zero- or finite-range effective nuclear forces to
describe the nuclear interaction. Using the obtained Fermi Liquid parameters,
the effect of a strong magnetic field on some bulk magnitudes such as
isothermal compressibility and spin susceptibility is also investigated.
