In this paper, we calculated the binding energy per baryon of the $\Lambda$
hypernuclei systemically, using the relativistic mean field theory (RMF) in a
statistic frame. Some resemble properties are found among most of the
hypernuclei found in experiments. The data show that a $\Lambda$ hypernucleus
will be more stable, if it is composed of a $\Lambda$ hyperon adding to a
stable normal nuclear core, or a $\Lambda$ hyperon replacing a neutron in a
stable normal nuclear core. According to our calculations, existences of some
new $\Lambda$ hypernuclei are predicted under the frame of RMF.
