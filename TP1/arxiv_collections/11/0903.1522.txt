We propose a novel approach to incorporate the proton-proton (pp) Coulomb
force into the three-nucleon (3N) Faddeev calculations. The main new ingredient
is a 3-dimensional screened pp Coulomb t-matrix obtained by a numerical
solution of the 3-dimensional Lippmann-Schwinger (LS) equation. We demonstrate
numerically and provide analytical insight that the elastic proton-deuteron
(pd) observables can be determined directly from the resulting on shell 3N
amplitude increasing the screening radius. The screening limit exists without
the need of renormalisation not only for observables but for the elastic pd
amplitude itself.
