A complete method is proposed to compute a certified, or ambient isotopic,
meshing for an implicit algebraic surface with singularities. By certified, we
mean a meshing with correct topology and any given geometric precision. We
propose a symbolic-numeric method to compute a certified meshing for the
surface inside a box containing singularities and use a modified
Plantinga-Vegter marching cube method to compute a certified meshing for the
surface inside a box without singularities. Nontrivial examples are given to
show the effectiveness of the algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first
method to compute a certified meshing for surfaces with singularities.
