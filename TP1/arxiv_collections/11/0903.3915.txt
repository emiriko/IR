A non-equilibrium Green function formalism (NEGF) is used to study the
conductance of a side-gated quantum point contact (QPC) in the presence of
lateral spin-orbit coupling (LSOC). A small difference of bias voltage between
the two side gates (SGs) leads to an inversion asymmetry in the LSOC between
the opposite edges of the channel. In single electron modeling of transport,
this triggers a spontaneous but insignificant spin polarization in the QPC.
However, the spin polarization of the QPC is enhanced substantially when the
effect of electron-electron interaction is included. The spin polarization is
strong enough to result in the occurrence of a conductance plateau at 0.5G0 (G0
= 2e2/h) in the absence of any external magnetic field. In our simulations of a
model QPC device, the 0.5 plateau is found to be quite robust and survives up
to a temperature of 40K. The spontaneous spin polarization and the resulting
magnetization of the QPC can be reversed by flipping the polarity of the source
to drain bias or the potential difference between the two SGs. These numerical
simulations are in good agreement with recent experimental results for
side-gated QPCs made from the low band gap semiconductor InAs.
