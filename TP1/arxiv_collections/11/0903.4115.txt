We have searched for the decay phi -> K0 K0bar gamma, by detecting K_s pairs
plus a photon and with the K_s-mesons decaying to pi^+ pi^-, in a sample of
about 1.5x 10^9 phi-decays collected by the KLOE experiment at DAFNE. The
reaction proceeds through the intermediate states f_0(980) gamma, a_0(980)
gamma. We find five events with 3.2 events expected from background processes.
We obtain the upper limit: BR (phi -> K0 K0bar gamma) < 1.9x10^-8 at 90% C.L. .
