This paper gives detailed information on the structure of the infrared
singularities for the process e+ e- --> 3 jets at next-to-next-to-leading order
in perturbation theory. Particular emphasis is put on singularities associated
to soft gluons. The knowledge of the singularity structure allows the
construction of appropriate subtraction terms, which in turn can be implemented
into a numerical Monte Carlo program.
