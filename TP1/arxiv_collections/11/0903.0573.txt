The spherical Radon-Dunkl transform $R_\kappa$, associated to weight
functions invariant under a finite reflection group, is introduced, and some
elementary properties are obtained in terms of $h$-harmonics. Several inversion
formulas of $R_\kappa$ are given with the aid of spherical Riesz-Dunkl
potentials, the Dunkl operators, and some appropriate wavelet transforms.
