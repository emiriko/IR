Paired states, trions and quarteting states in one-dimensional SU(4)
attractive fermions are investigated via exact Bethe ansatz calculations. In
particular, quantum phase transitions are identified and calculated from the
quarteting phase into normal Fermi liquid, trionic states and spin-2 paired
states which belong to the universality class of linear field-dependent
magnetization in the vicinity of critical points. Moreover, unified exact
results for the ground state energy, chemical potentials and complete phase
diagrams for isospin $S=1/2, 1, 3/2$ attractive fermions with external fields
are presented. Also identified are the magnetization plateaux of $m^z=M_s/3$
and $m^z=2M_s/3$, where $M_s$ is the magnetization saturation value. The
universality of finite-size corrections and collective dispersion relations
provides a further test ground for low energy effective field theory.
