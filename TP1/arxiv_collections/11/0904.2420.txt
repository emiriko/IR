We propose a quantum storage scheme independent of the current time-control
schemes, and study a "quantum data bus" (transmission line resonator) in a
hybrid system consisting of a circuit QED system integrated with a cold
molecular ensemble. Here, an effective interaction between charge qubit and
molecule is mediated by the off-resonate field in the data bus.
Correspondingly, the charge state can be mapped into the collective quasi-spin
state of the molecular ensemble via the standard dark state based adiabatic
manipulation.
