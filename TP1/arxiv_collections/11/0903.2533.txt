Studies of collective human behavior in the social sciences, often grounded
in details of actions by individuals, have much to offer `social' models from
the physical sciences concerning elegant statistical regularities. Drawing on
behavioral studies of social influence, we present a parsimonious, stochastic
model, which generates an entire family of real-world right-skew socio-economic
distributions, including exponential, winner-take-all, power law tails of
varying exponents and power laws across the whole data. The widely used
Albert-Barabasi model of preferential attachment is simply a special case of
this much more general model. In addition, the model produces the continuous
turnover observed empirically within those distributions. Previous preferential
attachment models have generated specific distributions with turnover using
arbitrary add-on rules, but turnover is an inherent feature of our model. The
model also replicates an intriguing new relationship, observed across a range
of empirical studies, between the power law exponent and the proportion of data
represented.
