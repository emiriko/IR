We study a scenario that a U(1) hidden gaugino constitutes the dark matter in
the Universe and decays into a lepton and slepton pair through a mixing with a
U(1)B-L gaugino. We find that the dark-matter decay can account for the recent
PAMELA and ATIC anomalies in the cosmic-ray positrons and electrons without an
overproduction of antiprotons.
