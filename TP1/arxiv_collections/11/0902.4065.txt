A ribbon is a double structure on P^1. The geometry of a ribbon is closely
related to that of a smooth curve. In this note we consider linear series on
ribbons. Our main result is an explicit determinantal description for the locus
W^{r}_{2n} of degree 2n line bundles with at least (r+1)-dimensional sections
on a ribbon. We also discuss some results of Clifford and Brill-Noether type.
