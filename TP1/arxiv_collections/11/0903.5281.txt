Mechanisms proposed to explain the jet-related correlation of long range in
rapidity (the ridge) observed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions are reviewed.
Limitations of a model using the combined effect of transverse flow and a
direction bias of partons suffering energy loss are discussed. The influence of
the time scale of the correlation mechanism on the rapidity range is
investigated.
