In this paper the problem of classification of integrable natural Hamiltonian
systems with $n$ degrees of freedom given by a Hamilton function which is the
sum of the standard kinetic energy and a homogeneous polynomial potential $V$
of degree $k>2$ is investigated. It is assumed that the potential is not
generic. Except for some particular cases a potential $V$ is not generic, if it
admits a nonzero solution of equation $V'(\vd)=0$. The existence of such
solution gives very strong integrability obstructions obtained in the frame of
the Morales-Ramis theory. This theory gives also additional integrability
obstructions which have the form of restrictions imposed on the eigenvalues
$(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n)$ of the Hessian matrix $V''(\vd)$ calculated at a
non-zero $\vd\in\C^n$ satisfying $V'(\vd)=\vd$. Furthermore, we show that
similarly to the generic case also for nongeneric potentials some universal
relations between $(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_{n})$ calculated at various solutions
of $V'(\vd)=\vd$ exist. We derive them for case $n=k=3$ applying the
multivariable residue calculus. We demonstrate the strength of the obtained
results analysing in details the nongeneric cases for $n=k=3$. Our analysis
cover all the possibilities and we distinguish those cases where known methods
are too weak to decide if the potential is integrable or not. Moreover, for
$n=k=3$ thanks to this analysis a three-parameter family of potentials
integrable or super-integrable with additional polynomial first integrals which
seemingly can be of an arbitrarily high degree with respect to the momenta was
distinguished.
