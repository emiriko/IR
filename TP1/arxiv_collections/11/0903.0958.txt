Let $A$ be a finite dimensional hereditary algebra over an algebraically
closed field $k$, $A^{(m)}$ be the $m$-replicated algebra of $A$ and
$\mathscr{C}_{m}(A)$ be the $m$-cluster category of $ A$. We investigate
properties of complements to a faithful almost complete tilting
$A^{(m)}$-module and prove that the $m$-cluster mutation in
$\mathscr{C}_{m}(A)$ can be realized in ${\rm mod} A^{(m)}$, which generalizes
corresponding results on duplicated algebras established in [Z1].
