The proximity effect of a C-type antiferromagnet (C-AFM) with the spin
canting at low temperature is investigated in the hybrid
Nd0.35Sr0.65MnO3(NSCO)/YBa2Cu3O7(YBCO) oxide system through magnetic and
transport measurements. It is found that the onset of a spin-canted state
destroys partially the superconducting order parameter. Interestingly, due to
the instability of this spin-canted state, zero-resistivity recovers at the
offset of spin canting. Our result demonstrates clearly the high sensitivity of
superconducting order parameter to a modulation of internal field.
