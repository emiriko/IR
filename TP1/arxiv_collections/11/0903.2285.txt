We present Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (MRFM) measurements of
Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) in a 50 nm thick permalloy film, tilted with
respect to the direction of the external magnetic field. At small probe-sample
distances the MRFM spectrum breaks up into multiple modes, which we identify as
local ferromagnetic resonances confined by the magnetic field of the MRFM tip.
Micromagnetic simulations support this identification of the modes and show
they are stabilized in the region where the dipolar tip field has a component
anti-parallel to the applied field.
