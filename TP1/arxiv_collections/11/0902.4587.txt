Three properties of matrices: the spark, the mutual incoherence and the
restricted isometry property have recently been introduced in the context of
compressed sensing. We study these properties for matrices that are Kronecker
products and show how these properties relate to those of the factors. For the
mutual incoherence we also discuss results for sums of Kronecker products.
