In this paper we study the relation of radio emission to X-ray spectral and
variability properties for a large sample of black hole X-ray binary systems.
This is done to test, refine and extend -- notably into the timing properties
-- the previously published `unified model' for the coupling of accretion and
ejection in such sources. In 14 outbursts from 11 different sources we find
that in every case the peak radio flux, on occasion directly resolved into
discrete relativistic ejections, is associated with the bright hard to soft
state transition near the peak of the outburst. We also note the association of
the radio flaring with periods of X-ray flaring during this transition in most,
but not all, of the systems. In the soft state, radio emission is in nearly all
cases either undetectable or optically thin, consistent with the suppression of
the core jet in these states and `relic' radio emission from interactions of
previously ejected material and the ambient medium. However, these data cannot
rule out an intermittent, optically thin, jet in the soft state. In attempting
to associate X-ray timing properties with the ejection events we find a close,
but not exact, correspondence between phases of very low integrated X-ray
variability and such ejections. In summary we find no strong evidence against
the originally proposed model, confirming and extending some aspects of it with
a much larger sample, but note that several aspects remain poorly tested.
