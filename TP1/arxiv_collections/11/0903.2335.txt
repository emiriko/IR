Band calculations for the hole doped La$_2$CuO$_4$ system show that
artificial periodicities of Ba dopants can give the material different
properties than from a uniform distribution of dopants. A periodicity within
the planes make static pseudogaps which could be tuned to raise the
density-of-states (DOS) at $E_F$ and the superconducting $T_C$.
  A periodic doping dependence perpendicular to the CuO planes can increase the
matrix element for spin fluctuations.
