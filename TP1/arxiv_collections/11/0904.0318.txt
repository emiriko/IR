We present a complete study of R-parity violating supersymmetric effects in
thirteen exclusive and inclusive semi-leptonic $b \to (s,d) \nu \bar{\nu}$
decays, including $B^+_u\to K^{(*)+}\nu\bar{\nu}$, $B^0_d\to
K^{(*)0}\nu\bar{\nu}$, $B^0_s\to \phi\nu\bar{\nu}$, $B^0_d\to
\pi^0(\rho^0)\nu\bar{\nu}$, $B^+_u\to \pi^+(\rho^+)\nu\bar{\nu}$, $B^0_s\to
K^{(*)0}\nu\bar{\nu}$ and $B \to X_{s,d} \nu \bar{\nu}$ decay modes, and we
find those thirteen modes are very sensitive to the constrained R-parity
violating couplings. We derive stringent bounds on relevant R-parity violating
couplings, which are based on all existent experimental upper limits of
involved semi-leptonic decays. In addition, we also investigate the
sensitivities of the branching ratios and di-neutrino invariant mass spectra to
the survived R-parity violating coupling spaces. Since the experimental bounds
would become much better soon through Super-B, we expect that future
experiments will greatly strengthen our bounds.
