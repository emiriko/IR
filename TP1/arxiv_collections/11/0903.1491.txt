We investigate the possibility of unconventional spin density wave (SDW) in
the attractive Hubbard model with finite spin polarization. We show that
pairing and density fluctuations induce the transverse d-wave SDW near the
half-filling. This novel SDW is related to the d-wave superfluidity induced by
antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, in the sense that they are connected with
each other through Shiba's attraction-repulsion transformation. Our results
predict the d-wave SDW in real systems, such as cold Fermi atom gases with
population imbalance and compounds involving valence skipper elements.
