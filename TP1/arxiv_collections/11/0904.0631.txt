Glycosylation is a highly complex process to produce a diverse repertoire of
cellular glycans that are attached to proteins and lipids. Glycans are involved
in fundamental biological processes, including protein folding and clearance,
cell proliferation and apoptosis, development, immune responses, and
pathogenesis. One of the major types of glycans, N-linked glycans, is formed by
sequential attachments of monosaccharides to proteins by a limited number of
enzymes. Many of these enzymes can accept multiple N-linked glycans as
substrates, thereby generating a large number of glycan intermediates and their
intermingled pathways. Motivated by the quantitative methods developed in
complex network research, we investigated the large-scale organization of such
N-linked glycosylation pathways in mammalian cells. The N-linked glycosylation
pathways are extremely modular, and are composed of cohesive topological
modules that directly branch from a common upstream pathway of glycan
synthesis. This unique structural property allows the glycan production between
modules to be controlled by the upstream region. Although the enzymes act on
multiple glycan substrates, indicating cross-talk between modules, the impact
of the cross-talk on the module-specific enhancement of glycan synthesis may be
confined within a moderate range by transcription-level control. The findings
of the present study provide experimentally-testable predictions for
glycosylation processes, and may be applicable to therapeutic glycoprotein
engineering.
