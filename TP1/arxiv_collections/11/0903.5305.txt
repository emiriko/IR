Leptogenic supersymmetry is a scenario characterized by cascade decays with
copious lepton production. Leptogenic models have striking signatures that can
be probed by the LHC even in the 10 TeV run with as little as 200 pb^-1 of
data, provided the squark masses are about 1 TeV. Leptogenic supersymmetry
spectrum arises in several well-motivated models and its signatures are
long-lived sleptons, numerous isolated leptons, abundant Higgs production,
rather energetic jets, and no missing energy. The Higgs can be discovered in
the h->b bbar mode via the 4 leptons+4 jets channel because the leptons
accompanying Higgs production suppress the background. The superparticle masses
in leptogenic supersymmetry can be measured efficiently due to lack of missing
energy and high lepton multiplicity. We estimate that 1 fb^-1 of integrated
luminosity is sufficient to determine the light Higgs, neutralinos, charginos,
slepton, sneutrino and squark masses in a 14 TeV run.
