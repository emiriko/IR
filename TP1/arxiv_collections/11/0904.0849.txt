Calcium cobaltite thin films with a ratio Ca/Co=1 were grown on (101)-NdGaO3
substrate by the pulsed laser deposition technique. The structure of the
deposited metastable phase is solved using a precession electron diffraction 3D
dataset recorded from a cross-sectional sample. It is shown that an ordered
oxygen-deficient Ca2Co2O5+d perovskite of the brownmillerite-type with lattice
parameters a= 0.546nm, b=1.488nm and c=0.546nm (SG: Ibm2) has been stabilized
using the substrate induced strain. The structure and microstructure of this
metastable cobaltite is further discussed and compared to related bulk
materials based on our transmission electron microscopy investigations
