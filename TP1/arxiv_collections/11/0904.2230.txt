We have used the STACEE high-energy gamma-ray detector to look for fast
blue-green laser pulses from the vicinity of 187 stars. The STACEE detector
offers unprecedented light-collecting capability for the detection of
nanosecond pulses from such lasers. We estimate STACEE's sensitivity to be
approximately 10 photons per square meter at a wavelength of 420 nm. The stars
have been chosen because their characteristics are such that they may harbor
habitable planets and they are relatively close to Earth. Each star was
observed for 10 minutes and we found no evidence for laser pulses in any of the
data sets.
