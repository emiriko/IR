We suggest that the radio emission from the dwarf nova SS Cyg during outburst
comes from magnetic activity that formed a corona (similar to coronae found in
magnetically active stars), rather than from jets. We base our claim on the
recent results of Laor & Behar, who found that when the ratio between radio and
X-ray flux of accretion disks in radio-quiet quasars is as in active stars,
Lr/Lx=10^{-5}, then most of the radio emission comes from coronae. Using
observations from the literature we find that for SS Cyg during outburst
Lr/Lx<10^{-5}. This does not mean jets are not launched during outbursts. On
the contrary, if the magnetic activity in erupting accreting disks is similar
to that in stars, then mass ejection, e.g., as in coronal mass ejection, is
expected. Hence magnetic flares similar to those in active stars might be the
main mechanism for launching jets in a variety of systems, from young stellar
objects to massive black holes.
