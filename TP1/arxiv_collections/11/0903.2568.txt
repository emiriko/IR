We propose a new type of cooling mechanism for ultra-cold fermionic atom
ensembles, which capitalizes on the energy dependence of inelastic collisions
in the presence of a Feshbach resonance. We first discuss the case of a single
magnetic resonance, and find that the final temperature and the cooling rate is
limited by the width of the resonance. A concrete example, based on a p-wave
resonance of $^{40}$K, is given. We then improve upon this setup by using both
a very sharp optical or radio-frequency induced resonance and a very broad
magnetic resonance and show that one can improve upon temperatures reached with
current technologies.
