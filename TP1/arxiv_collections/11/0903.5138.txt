We study the radiative decay into $\gamma$ and a baryon of the SU(3) decuplet
of ten resonances that are dynamically generated from the interaction of vector
mesons with baryons of the decuplet. We obtain quite different partial decay
widths for the various resonances, and for different charge states of the same
resonance, suggesting that the experimental investigation of these radiative
decays should bring much information on the nature of these resonances.
