Nonlinear ionic screening theory for heterogeneously charged spheres is
developed in terms of a mode-decomposition of the surface charge. A far-field
analysis of the resulting electrostatic potential leads to a natural
generalization of charge renormalization from purely monopolar to dipolar,
quadropolar, etc., including mode-couplings. Our novel scheme is generally
applicable to large classes of surface heterogeneities, and is explicitly
applied here to Janus spheres with differently charged upper and lower
hemispheres, revealing strong renormalization effects for all multipoles.
