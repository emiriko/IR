The linear response of a nonrelativistic superfluid baryon system on an
external weak field is investigated while taking into account of the
Fermi-liquid interactions. We generalize the theory developed by Leggett for a
superfluid Fermi-liquid at finite temperature to the case of timelike momentum
transfer typical of the problem of neutrino emission from neutron stars. A
space-like kinematics is also analysed for completeness and compared with known
results. We use the obtained response functions to derive the neutrino energy
losses caused by recombination of broken pairs in the electrically neutral
superfluid baryon matter. We find that the dominant neutrino radiation occurs
through the axial-vector neutral currents. The emissivity is found to be of the
same order as in the BCS approximation, but the details of its temperature
dependence are modified by the Fermi-liquid interactions. The role of
electromagnetic correlations in the pairing case of protons interacting with
the electron background is discussed in the conclusion.
