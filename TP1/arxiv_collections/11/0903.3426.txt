One of the most exciting discoveries in strongly correlated systems has been
the existence of a superconducting dome on heavy fermions close to the quantum
critical point where antiferromagnetic order disappears. It is hard even for
the most skeptical not to admit that the excitations which bind the electrons
in the Cooper pairs have a magnetic origin. As a system moves away from an
antiferromagnetic quantum critical point, (AFQCP) the correlation length of the
fluctuations decreases and the system goes into a local quantum critical
regime. The attractive interaction mediated by the non-local part of these
excitations vanishes and this allows to obtain an upper bound to the
superconducting dome around an AFQCP.
