The photocatalytic degradation of tylosin has been studied using immobilized
titanium dioxide as catalyst. T he processes of degradation and reduction of
tylosin was examined, and the activity is dominantly dependent on the surface
coverage of the catalysts, The Langmuir-Hinshelwood model is satisfactorily
obeyed at initial time and in the course of the reaction. These results suggest
the feasibility of a photocatalytic system on the elimination of such
antibiotic.
