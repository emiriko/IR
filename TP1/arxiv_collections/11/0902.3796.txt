Modern cosmology has sharpened questions posed for millennia about the origin
of our cosmic habitat. The age-old questions have been transformed into two
pressing issues primed for attack in the coming decade: How did the Universe
begin? and What physical laws govern the Universe at the highest energies? The
clearest window onto these questions is the pattern of polarization in the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which is uniquely sensitive to primordial
gravity waves. A detection of the special pattern produced by gravity waves
would be not only an unprecedented discovery, but also a direct probe of
physics at the earliest observable instants of our Universe. Experiments which
map CMB polarization over the coming decade will lead us on our first steps
towards answering these age-old questions.
