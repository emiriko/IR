Heat capacity, resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility measurements confirm
bulk superconductivity in single crystals of BaIr$_2$P$_2$ (T$_c$=2.1K) and
BaRh$_2$P$_2$ (T$_c$ = 1.0 K). These compounds form in the ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ (122)
structure so they are isostructural to both the Ni and Fe pnictides but not
isoelectronic to either of them. This illustrates the importance of structure
for the occurrence of superconductivity in the 122 pnictides. Additionally, a
comparison between these and other ternary phosphide superconductors suggests
that the lack of interlayer $P-P$ bonding favors superconductivity. These
stoichiometric and ambient pressure superconductors offer an ideal playground
to investigate the role of structure for the mechanism of superconductivity in
the absence of magnetism.
