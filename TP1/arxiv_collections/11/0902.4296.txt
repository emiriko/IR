We analyze the quantum penny flip game using geometric algebra and so
determine all possible unitary transformations which enable the player Q to
implement a winning strategy. Geometric algebra provides a clear visual picture
of the quantum game and its strategies, as well as providing a simple and
direct derivation of the winning transformation, which we demonstrate can be
parametrized by two angles. For comparison we derive the same general winning
strategy by conventional means using density matrices.
