We study in detail the zero set of a regular function of a quaternionic or
octonionic variable. By means of a division lemma for convergent power series,
we find the exact relation existing between the zeros of two octonionic regular
functions and those of their product. In the case of octonionic polynomials, we
get a strong form of the fundamental theorem of algebra. We prove that the sum
of the multiplicities of zeros equals the degree of the polynomial and obtain a
factorization in linear polynomials.
