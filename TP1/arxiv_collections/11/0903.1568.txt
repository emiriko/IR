Magnetic fluctuations in an unconventional superconductor (U-SC) can
distinguish between distinct proposals for the symmetry of the order parameter.
Motivated thereby, we undertake a study magnetic fluctuations in Iron
pnictides, tracking their evolution from the incoherent normal, pseudogapped
metal, to the U-SC state. Within our proposal of extended-s-plus s_{xy} inplane
gap with proximity-induced out-of-plane line nodes, (i) we describe the
evolution of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, from a non-Korringa form in the
normal state, to a power-law form in the U-SC in good agreement with
experiment, and (ii) we predict a sharp resonance in the U-SC state along
(\pi,\pi), but not along (\pi/2,0), along with modulated c-axis intensity in
inelastic neutron scattering work as a specific and testable manifestation of
our proposal.
