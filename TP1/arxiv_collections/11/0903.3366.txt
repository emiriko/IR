Nuclear matter calculations based on low-momentum interactions derived from
chiral nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon effective field theory interactions
and fit only to few-body data predict realistic saturation properties with
controlled uncertainties. This is promising for a unified description of nuclei
and to develop a universal density functional based on low-momentum
interactions.
