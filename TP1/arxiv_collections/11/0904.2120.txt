We evaluate the influence of thermal fluctuations on superconducting rings
that enclose a magnetic flux, using the time-dependent Ginzburg--Landau (TDGL)
or the Kramer--Watts-Tobin (KWT) model, while thermal fluctuations are
accounted for by means of Langevin terms. This method is applicable in
situations where previous methods are not, such as nonuniform loops, rings with
large width to radius ratio and loops with large coherence length to perimeter
ratio. We evaluate persistent currents, position and statistical behavior of
flux-induced vortices and lifetime of metastable fluxoid states. The influence
of nonuniformity on the persistent current does not depend strongly on the
details of the cross-section profile; it depends mainly on its first harmonic,
but not only on it. As a consequence of nonuniformity the maximum of the
persistent current shifts to smaller fluxes and the passage between fluxoid
states remains non-hysteretic down to lower temperatures than in the case of a
uniform sample. Our results using TDGL agree remarkably well with recent
measurements of the persistent current in superconducting rings and with
measurements of the position of a vortex that mediates between fluxoid states
in an asymmetric disk with a hole; they could also provide a plausible
explanation for unexpectedly short measured lifetimes of metastable states.
Comparison between TDGL and KWT indicates that they lead to the same results
for the persistent current, whereas KWT leads to larger lifetimes than TDGL.
