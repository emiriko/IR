In this work, low temperature thermodynamic behaviour in the context of
dissipative diamagnetism with anomalous coupling is analyzed. We find that
finite dissipation substitutes the zero-coupling result of exponential decay of
entropy by a power law behaviour at low temperature. For Ohmic bath, entropy
vanishes linearly with temperature, $T$, in conformity with Nernst's theorem.
It is also shown that entropy decays faster in the presence of anomalous
coupling than that of the usual coordinate-coordinate coupling. It is observed
that velocity-velocity coupling is the most advantageous coupling scheme to
ensure the third law of thermodynamics. It is also revealed that different
thermodynamic functions are independent of magnetic field at very low
temperature for various coupling schemes discussed in this work.
