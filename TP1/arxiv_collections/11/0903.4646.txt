We report measurements of the CKM angles beta/phi_1 and alpha/phi_2 done by
the BABAR and Belle experiments. Both experiments have collected large data
samples, corresponding to a total of more than 1 billion of BBbar pairs, at the
e^+e^- asymmetric-energy colliders PEP-II (SLAC) and KEK-B (KEK), respectively.
