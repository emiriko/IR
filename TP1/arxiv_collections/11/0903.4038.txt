The results of the ab initio FLAPW-GGA calculations of the band structure of
the newly synthesized tetragonal (space group P4/nmm) layered iron
phosphide-oxide: 17K superconductor Sr4Sc2Fe2P2O6 are presented. For
Sr4Sc2Fe2P2O6 the optimized structural data, the energy bands, total and
partial densities of states, Fermi surface topology, low-temperature electron
specific heat and molar Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility have been determined
and discussed in comparison with hypothetical isostructural iron arsenide-oxide
phase Sr4Sc2Fe2As2O6 and related layered FeAs and FeP superconductors.
