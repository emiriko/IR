We present numerical simulations of orbiting black holes for around twelve
cycles, using a high-order multipatch approach. Unlike some other approaches,
the computational speed scales almost perfectly for thousands of processors.
Multipatch methods are an alternative to AMR (adaptive mesh refinement), with
benefits of simplicity and better scaling for improving the resolution in the
wave zone. The results presented here pave the way for multipatch evolutions of
black hole-neutron star and neutron star-neutron star binaries, where high
resolution grids are needed to resolve details of the matter flow.
