Let $(X, \{w_j \}_{j=1}^m, \{p_j \}_{j=1}^m)$ ($2 \leq m < \infty$) be a
contractive iterated function system (IFS), where $X$ is a compact subset of
${\Bbb{R}}^d$. It is well known that there exists a unique nonempty compact set
$K$ such that $K=\bigcup_{j=1}^m w_j(K)$. Moreover, the Ruelle operator on
$C(K)$ determined by the IFS $(X, \{w_j \}_{j=1}^m, \{p_j \}_{j=1}^m)$ ($2 \leq
m < \infty$) has been introduced in \cite{FL}. In the present paper, the Ruelle
operators determined by the infinite conformal IFSs are discussed. Some
separation properties for the infinite conformal IFSs are investigated by using
the Ruelle operator.
