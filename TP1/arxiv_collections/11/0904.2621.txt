We present a time series of synoptic images of the linearly-polarized v=1,
J=1-0 SiO maser emission toward the Mira variable, TX Cam. These data comprise
43 individual epochs at an approximate biweekly sampling over an optical
pulsation phase range of 0.68 to 1.82. The images have an angular resolution of
~500 microarcsec and were obtained using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA),
operating in the 43 GHz band in spectral-line, polarization mode. We have
previously published the total intensity time series for this pulsation phase
range; this paper serves to present the linearly-polarized image sequence and
an associated animation representing the evolution of the linear polarization
morphology over time. We find a predominantly tangential polarization
morphology, a high degree of persistence in linear polarization properties over
individual component lifetimes, and stronger linear polarization in the inner
projected shell than at larger projected shell radii. We present an initial
polarization proper motion analysis examining the possible dynamical influence
of magnetic fields in component motions in the extended atmospheres of
late-type, evolved stars.
