Let A be a locally compact group topologically generated by d elements and
let k>d. Consider the action, by pre-composition, of Aut(F_k) on the set of
marked, k-generated, dense subgroups D_{k,A} := {h:F_k --> A | h(F_k) is dense
in A}. We prove the ergodicity of this action for two families of simple,
totally disconnected locally compact groups. (i) A = PSL(2,K) where K is a
non-Archimedean local field (of characteristic not equal to 2), (ii) A =
Aut^{0}(T) - the group of orientation preserving automorphisms of a
(q+1)-regular tree, for q > 1.
  In contrast, a recent result of Minsky's shows that the same action is not
ergodic when A = PSL(2,R) or A = PSL(2,C). Therefore if K is a local field
(with characteristic different than 2) the action of Aut(F_k) on D_{k,PSL(2,K)}
is ergodic, for every k>2, if and only if K is non-Archimedean.
  Ergodicity implies that every "measurable property" either holds or fails to
hold for almost every k-generated dense subgroup of A.
