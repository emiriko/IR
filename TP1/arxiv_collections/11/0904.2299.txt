An isolated HI cloud with peculiar properties has recently been discovered by
Dedes, Dedes, & Kalberla (2008, A&A, 491, L45) with the 300-m Arecibo
telescope, and subsequently imaged with the VLA. It has an angular size of ~6',
and the HI emission has a narrow line profile of width ~ 3 km/s.
  We explore the possibility that this cloud could be associated with a
circumstellar envelope ejected by an evolved star.
  Observations were made in the rotational lines of CO with the IRAM-30m
telescope, on three positions in the cloud, and a total-power mapping in the HI
line was obtained with the Nancay Radio Telescope.
  CO was not detected and seems too underabundant in this cloud to be a
classical late-type star circumstellar envelope. On the other hand, the HI
emission is compatible with the detached-shell model that we developed for
representing the external environments of AGB stars.
  We propose that this cloud could be a fossil circumstellar shell left over
from a system that is now in a post-planetary-nebula phase. Nevertheless, we
cannot rule out that it is a Galactic cloud or a member of the Local Group,
although the narrow line profile would be atypical in both cases.
