We develop a strong-coupling perturbation theory for the extended
Bose-Hubbard model with on-site and nearest-neighbor boson-boson repulsions on
($d > 1$)-dimensional hypercubic lattices. Analytical expressions for the
ground-state phase boundaries between the incompressible (Mott or
charge-density-wave insulators) and the compressible (superfluid or supersolid)
phases are derived up to third order in the hopping $t$. We also briefly
discuss possible implications of our results in the context of ultracold
dipolar Bose gases with dipole-dipole interactions loaded into optical
lattices.
