We study the electronic states of core multi-shell semiconductor nanowires,
including the effect of strong magnetic fields. We show that the multi-shell
overgrowth of a free-standing nanowire, together with the prismatic symmetry of
the substrate, may induce quantum confinement of carriers in a set of quasi-1D
quantum channels corresponding to the nanowire edges. Localization and
inter-channel tunnel coupling are controlled by the curvature at the edges and
the diameter of the underlying nanowire. We also show that a magnetic field may
induce either Aharonov-Bohm oscillations of the energy levels in the axial
configuration, or a dimensional transition of the quantum states from quasi-1D
to Landau levels for fields normal to the axis. Explicit predictions are given
for nanostructures based on GaAs, InAs, and InGaN with different symmetries.
