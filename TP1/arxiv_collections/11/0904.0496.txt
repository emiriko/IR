We investigate the dependence of spin squeezing on the polar angle of the
initial coherent spin state $|\theta_0, \phi_0>$ in a generalized one-axis
twisting model, where the detuning $\delta$ is taken into account. We show
explicitly that regardless of $\delta$ and $\phi_0$, previous results of the
ideal one-axis twisting is recovered as long as $\theta_0=\pi/2$. For a small
departure of $\theta_0$ from $\pi/2$, however, the achievable variance
$(V_{-})_{\min}\sim N^{2/3}$, larger than the ideal case $N^{1/3}$. We also
find that the maximal-squeezing time $t_{\min}$ scales as $N^{-5/6}$. Analytic
expressions of $(V_{-})_{\min}$ and $t_{\min}$ are presented, which agree with
numerical simulations.
