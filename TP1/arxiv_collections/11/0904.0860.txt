In work the opportunity of construction fractal estimation of low-frequency
component microaccelerations with the help of the valid part to
Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function at identically zero phase is statistically
proved. The proof will be carried out with the help of correlation factor and
nonparametric rang criterion Cox - Stuart.
