In the previous work we introduced a new static cylindrically symmetric
vacuum solutions in Weyl coordinates in the context of the metric f(R) theories
of gravity\cite{1}. Now we obtain a 2-parameter family of exact solutions which
contains cosmological constant and a new parameter as $\beta$. This solution
corresponds to a constant Ricci scalar. We proved that in $f(R)$ gravity, the
constant curvature solution in cylindrically symmetric cases is only one member
of the most generalized Tian family in GR. We show that our constant curvature
exact solution is applicable to the exterior of a string. Sensibility of
stability under initial conditions is discussed.
