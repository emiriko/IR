The investigation of the electroweak symmetry breaking is one of the primary
tasks of the experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The potential
of the ATLAS experiment for the discovery of the Higgs boson(s) in Standard
Model and Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is presented, with emphasis on
studies which have been completed recently.
