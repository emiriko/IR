We have identified radio and/or mid-infrared counterparts to 198 out of 350
sources detected at >=5 sigma over ~ 9 square degrees centered on the Chandra
Deep Field South (CDFS) by the Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter
Telescope (BLAST) at 250, 350 and 500 um. We have matched 114 of these
counterparts to optical sources with previously derived photometric redshifts
and fitted SEDs to the BLAST fluxes and fluxes at 70 and 160 um acquired with
the Spitzer Space Telescope. In this way, we have constrained dust
temperatures, total far-infrared/sub-millimeter luminosities and star formation
rates for each source. Our findings show that on average, the BLAST sources lie
at significantly lower redshifts and have significantly lower rest-frame dust
temperatures compared to submm sources detected in surveys conducted at 850 um.
We demonstrate that an apparent increase in dust temperature with redshift in
our sample arises as a result of selection effects. Finally, we provide the
full multi-wavelength catalog of >= 5 sigma BLAST sources contained within the
complete ~ 9 square degree survey area.
