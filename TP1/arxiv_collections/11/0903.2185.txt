A finite array of $N$ globally coupled Stratonovich models exhibits a
continuous nonequilibrium phase transition. In the limit of strong coupling
there is a clear separation of time scales of center of mass and relative
coordinates. The latter relax very fast to zero and the array behaves as a
single entity described by the center of mass coordinate. We compute
analytically the stationary probability and the moments of the center of mass
coordinate. The scaling behaviour of the moments near the critical value of the
control parameter $a_c(N)$ is determined. We identify a crossover from linear
to square root scaling with increasing distance from $a_c$. The crossover point
approaches $a_c$ in the limit $N \to \infty$ which reproduces previous results
for infinite arrays. The results are obtained in both the Fokker-Planck and the
Langevin approach and are corroborated by numerical simulations. For a general
class of models we show that the transition manifold in the parameter space
depends on $N$ and is determined by the scaling behaviour near a fixed point of
the stochastic flow.
