Low-energy experiments involving kaon, B-meson, D-meson, and hyperon
flavor-changing neutral transitions have confirmed the loop-induced
flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) picture of the standard model (SM). The
continuing study of these processes is essential to further refine this picture
and ultimately understand the flavor dynamics. In this paper we consider
deviations from the SM in the charm sector and their effect on FCNC processes.
Specifically, we parameterize new physics in terms of left- and right-handed
anomalous couplings of the W boson to the charm quark. We present a
comprehensive study of existing constraints and point out those measurements
that are most sensitive to new physics of this type.
