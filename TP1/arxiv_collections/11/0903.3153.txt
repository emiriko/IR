The creation of single collective excitations in atomic ensembles via
spontaneous Raman emission plays a key role in several quantum communication
protocols, starting with the seminal DLCZ protocol [L.-M.Duan, M.D. Lukin, J.I.
Cirac, and P. Zoller, Nature {\bf 414}, 413 (2001).] This process is usually
analyzed theoretically under the assumptions that the write laser pulse
inducing the Raman transition is far off-resonance, and that the atomic
ensemble is only homogeneously broadened. Here we study the impact of
near-resonance excitation for inhomogeneously broadened ensembles on the
collective character of the created atomic excitation. Our results are
particularly relevant for experiments with hot atomic gases and for potential
future solid-state implementations.
