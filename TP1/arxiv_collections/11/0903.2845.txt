We present a new method for detecting the missing baryons by generating a
template for the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. The template is computed
from the product of a reconstructed velocity field with a galaxy field; we find
that the combination of a galaxy redshift survey such as SDSS and a CMB survey
such as ACT and PLANCK can detect the kSZ, and thus the ionized gas, at
significant signal-to-noise. Unlike other techniques that look for hot gas or
metals, this approach directly detects the electrons in the IGM through their
signature on the CMB. The estimated signal-to-noise for detecting the
galaxy-momentum kSZ cross-correlation is 4, 9, and 12 for ACT (with survey area
of 2000 $\mathrm{deg}^2$) with SDSS-DR4, SDSS3 and ADEPT respectively. The
estimated signal-to-noise for PLANCK with SDSS-DR4, SDSS3 and ADEPT is 11, 23,
and 32.
  Our method provides a new mean for determining properties of the ionized gas
in the Universe. We provide galaxy momentum templates constructed from Sloan
Digital Sky Survey online at our website at
http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~shirley/SZ/SZ.html. The predicted correlation
coefficients are provided along with the momentum maps. One can download the
momentum templates and cross-correlate directly with CMB maps from ACT and
PLANCK to detect the missing baryons.
