Deciding whether the union of two convex polyhedra is itself a convex
polyhedron is a basic problem in polyhedral computations; having important
applications in the field of constrained control and in the synthesis,
analysis, verification and optimization of hardware and software systems. In
such application fields though, general convex polyhedra are just one among
many, so-called, numerical abstractions, which range from restricted families
of (not necessarily closed) convex polyhedra to non-convex geometrical objects.
We thus tackle the problem from an abstract point of view: for a wide range of
numerical abstractions that can be modeled as bounded join-semilattices --that
is, partial orders where any finite set of elements has a least upper bound--,
we show necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence between the
lattice-theoretic join and the set-theoretic union. For the case of closed
convex polyhedra --which, as far as we know, is the only one already studied in
the literature-- we improve upon the state-of-the-art by providing a new
algorithm with a better worst-case complexity. The results and algorithms
presented for the other numerical abstractions are new to this paper. All the
algorithms have been implemented, experimentally validated, and made available
in the Parma Polyhedra Library.
