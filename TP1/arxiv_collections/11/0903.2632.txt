We investigate the phenomenology of the Nearly Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (nMSSM) in the deflected anomaly mediation scenario. We also
include the Fayet-Iliopoulos D-term of the standard model gauge group. In the
nMSSM, the mu term is replaced by the vacuum expectation value of the gauge
singlet; therefore, there is no difficulty in generating the B-term of the SUSY
breaking scale. Although the messenger sector is introduced, direct couplings
between nMSSM fields and messenger sector fields are forbidden by the discrete
symmetry. Therefore, the phenomenology at the weak scale does not depend on the
detail of the messenger sector. We show that there are regions of parameter
space in which electroweak symmetry breaking occurs successfully and the
lightest Higgs is heavier than the LEP bound. We show that the gluino is light
in this scenario. The lightest neutralino, which is mainly composed of a
singlino, is a candidate for dark matter. The relic density explains the
observed abundance of dark matter. The dark matter-nucleon scattering cross
section satisfies the current limit from CDMS and XENON10 with a small value
for the strange quark content of a nucleon.
