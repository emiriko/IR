The Bohmian interpretation of quantum mechanics adds particle trajectories to
the wave function and ensures that the probability distribution of the particle
positions agrees with quantum mechanics at any time. This is not sufficient to
avoid contradictions with quantum mechanics. There are correlations between
particle positions at different times which cannot be reproduced with real
particle trajectories. A simple rearrangement of an experimental test of the
Bell-CHSH inequality demonstrates this.
