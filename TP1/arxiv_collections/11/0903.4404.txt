Recently J.C. Rohde constructed families of Calabi-Yau threefolds
parametrised by Shimura varieties. The points corresponding to threefolds with
CM are dense in the Shimura variety and, moreover, the families do not have
boundary points with maximal unipotent monodromy. Both aspects are of interest
for Mirror Symmetry. In this paper we discuss one of Rohde's examples in detail
and we explicitly give the Picard-Fuchs equation for this one dimensional
family.
