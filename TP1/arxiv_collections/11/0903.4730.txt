We consider the Erdos-Renyi random graph G(n,p) inside the critical window,
that is when p=1/n+ lambda*n^{-4/3}, for some fixed lambda in R. Then, as a
metric space with the graph distance rescaled by n^{-1/3}, the sequence of
connected components G(n,p) converges towards a sequence of continuous compact
metric spaces. The result relies on a bijection between graphs and certain
marked random walks, and the theory of continuum random trees. Our result gives
access to the answers to a great many questions about distances in critical
random graphs. In particular, we deduce that the diameter of G(n,p) rescaled by
n^{-1/3} converges in distribution to an absolutely continuous random variable
with finite mean.
