We present a new K-selected, optical-to-near-infrared photometric catalog of
the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS), making it publicly available to
the astronomical community. The dataset is founded on publicly available
imaging, supplemented by original zJK imaging data obtained as part of the
MUltiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile (MUSYC). The final photometric catalog
consists of photometry derived from nine band U-K imaging covering the full
0.5x0.5 sq. deg. of the ECDFS, plus H band data for approximately 80% of the
field. The 5sigma flux limit for point-sources is K = 22.0 (AB). This is also
the nominal completeness and reliability limit of the catalog: the empirical
completeness for 21.75 < K < 22.00 is 85+%. We have verified the quality of the
catalog through both internal consistency checks, and comparisons to other
existing and publicly available catalogs. As well as the photometric catalog,
we also present catalogs of photometric redshifts and restframe photometry
derived from the ten band photometry. We have collected robust spectroscopic
redshift determinations from published sources for 1966 galaxies in the
catalog. Based on these sources, we have achieved a (1sigma) photometric
redshift accuracy of Dz/(1+z) = 0.036, with an outlier fraction of 7.8%. Most
of these outliers are X-ray sources. Finally, we describe and release a utility
for interpolating restframe photometry from observed SEDs, dubbed InterRest.
Particularly in concert with the wealth of already publicly available data in
the ECDFS, this new MUSYC catalog provides an excellent resource for studying
the changing properties of the massive galaxy population at z < 2. (Abridged)
