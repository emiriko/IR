In this paper it is shown that Smith (2008) used inappropriate and
inconsistent formulations in averaging various quantities over the entire
surface of the Earth considered as a sphere. Using two instances of averaging
procedures as customarily applied in studies on turbulence, it is shown that
Smith's formulations are highly awkward. Furthermore, Smith's discussion of the
infrared absorption in the atmosphere is scrutinized and evaluated. It is shown
that his attempt to refute the criticism of Gerlich and Tscheuschner (2007,
2009) on the so-called greenhouse effect is rather fruitless.
