We have summarized here the astronomical knowledge of the ancient Hindu
astronomers. This knowledge was accumulated from before 1500 B.C. up to around
1200 A.D. In Section \ref{equiv} we have correlated terms used by the Hindu
astronomers and their equivalents in modern astronomy. In Section \ref{coord}
we have defined the different astronomical coordinate systems and their
transformation relations. In Sections \ref{seasons} and \ref{cycles} we have
collected the main features of solar and lunar motions in terms of modern
astronomical terminology. In Section \ref{stars} we have given the names of the
stars mentioned by the Hindu astronomers and their modern names with the
present astronomical coordinates. In Section \ref{hist} we have given a short
survey of Indian history with emphasis to Hindu astronomy. In Sections
\ref{vedas} and \ref{sid} we have given short descriptions of the main sources
of Hindu astronomy. In Section \ref{astron} the important features of Hindu
astronomy have been described. All through the article we have tried to present
the content in tabular forms for ready and unambiguous perception.
