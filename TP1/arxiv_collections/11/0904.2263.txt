Nanoscale lithography on SrRuO3 (SRO) thin film surfaces has been performed
by scanning tunneling microscopy under ambient conditions. The depth of etched
lines increases with increasing bias voltage but it does not change
significantly by increasing the tunneling current. The dependence of line width
on bias voltage from experimental data is in agreement with theoretical
calculation based on field-induced evaporation. Moreover, a three-square
nanostructure was successfully created, showing the capability of fabricating
nanodevices in SRO thin films.
