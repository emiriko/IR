LOFAR, the "low-frequency array", will be one of the first in a new
generation of radio telescopes and Square Kilometer Array (SKA) pathfinders
that are highly flexible in capability because they are largely software
driven. LOFAR will not only open up a mostly unexplored spectral window, the
lowest frequency radio light observable from the Earth's surface, but it will
also be an unprecented tool with which to monitor the transient radio sky over
a large field of view and down to timescales of milliseconds or less. Here we
discuss LOFAR's current and upcoming capabilities for observing fast transients
and pulsars, and briefly present recent commissioning observations of known
pulsars.
