The high kinetic energy outflowing in the jets of microquasars is delivered
to the surrounding interstellar medium. This energy input can cause the
formation of bow shocks and cocoons that may be detectable from radio to
gamma-ray energies. Evidences or hints of emission from jet/medium interactions
have been reported for some sources, but little has been done regarding the
theoretical modeling of the resulting non-thermal emission. We have developed
an analytical model based on those successfully applied to extragalactic
sources or the interaction of AGN jets with their surroundings. Focusing on the
adiabatic phase of the growing structures, we give estimations of the expected
luminosities through synchrotron, relativistic Bremsstrahlung and inverse
Compton processes. We conclude that the interaction structures may be
detectable at radio wavelengths, while extreme values for the jet kinetic
power, the source age and the medium density are required to make the emission
at high and very high energies detectable.
