We summarize basic theoretical ideas which let to the observation of the
short-range correlations (SRC) in nuclei using hard probes and outline
directions for probing quark-gluon structure of SRCs. Implications of the
observations of color transparency for processes involving pions are reviewed.
Open questions and directions for further studies of color transparency
phenomena using hadronic projectiles are presented using as an example the
PANDA detector at FAIR.
