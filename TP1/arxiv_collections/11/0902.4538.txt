In this paper, we study the diffusive shock acceleration of cosmic-ray
protons and nuclei, taking into account all the relevant interaction processes
with photon backgrounds. We investigate how the competition between protons and
nuclei is modified by the acceleration parameters such as the acceleration
rate, its rigidity dependence, the photon density and the confinement
capability of the sources. We find that in the case of interaction-limited
acceleration processes protons are likely to be accelerated to higher energies
than nuclei, whereas for confinement-limited acceleration nuclei are
accelerated to higher energies than protons. Finally, we discuss our results in
the context of possible astrophysical accelerators, and in the light of recent
cosmic-ray data.
