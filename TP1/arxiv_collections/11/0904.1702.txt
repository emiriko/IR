We implement the already existing macro,$ALICE_ROOT/STEER /CheckESD.C that is
ran after reconstruction to compute the physics efficiency, as a task that will
run on proof framework like CAF. The task was implemented in a C++ class called
AliAnalysisTaskCheckESD and it inherits from AliAnalysisTaskSE base class. The
function of AliAnalysisTaskCheckESD is to compute the ratio of the number of
reconstructed particles to the number of particle generated by the Monte Carlo
generator.The class AliAnalysisTaskCheckESD was successfully implemented. It
was used during the production for first physics and permitted to discover
several problems (missing track in the MUON arm reconstruction, low efficiency
in the PHOS detector etc.). The code is committed to the SVN repository and
will become standard tool for quality assurance.
