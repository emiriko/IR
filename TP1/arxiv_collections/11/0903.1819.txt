Helical multishell gold nanowire is studied theoretically for the formation
mechanism of helical domain boundary. Nanowires with the wire length of more
than 10 nm are relaxed by quantum mechanical molecular dynamics simulation with
tight-binding form Hamiltonian. In results, non-helical nanowires are
transformed into helical ones with the formation of atom pair defects at domain
boundary, where the defective atom pair is moved from an inner shell. Analysis
of local electronic structure shows a competitive feature of the energy gain of
reconstruction on wire surface and the energy loss of the defect formation. A
simple energy scaling theory gives a general discussion of domain boundary
formation.
