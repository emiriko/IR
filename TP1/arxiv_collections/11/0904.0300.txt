Semantic web services (SWS) are self-contained, self-describing, semantically
marked-up software resources that can be published, discovered, composed and
executed across the Web in a semi-automatic way. They are a key component of
the future Semantic Web, in which networked computer programs become providers
and users of information at the same time. This work focuses on developing a
full-life-cycle software toolset for creating and maintaining Semantic Web
Services (SWSs) based on the Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO) framework. A
main part of WSMO-based SWS is service capability - a declarative description
of Web service functionality. A formal syntax and semantics for such a
description is provided by Web Service Modeling Language (WSML), which is based
on different logical formalisms, namely, Description Logics, First-Order Logic
and Logic Programming. A WSML description of a Web service capability is
represented as a set of complex logical expressions (axioms). We develop a
specialized user-friendly tool for constructing and editing WSMO-based SWS
capabilities. Since the users of this tool are not specialists in first-order
logic, a graphical way for constricting and editing axioms is proposed. The
designed process for constructing logical expressions is ontology-driven, which
abstracts away as much as possible from any concrete syntax of logical
language. We propose several mechanisms to guarantees the semantic consistency
of the produced logical expressions. The tool is implemented in Java using
Eclipse for IDE and GEF (Graphical Editing Framework) for visualization.
