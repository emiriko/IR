We report on potential for measurement of W and Z boson production
accompanied by jets. Of particular interest are jet multiplicity and $P_{\rm
T}$ distributions. The 10 to 100 $pb^{-1}$ datasets expected in the startup
year of operation of LHC are likely to already provide information beyond the
reach of the Tevatron collider both in jet multiplicity and $P_{\rm T}$ range.
We are especially interested in understanding the ratios of W+jets to Z+jets
distributions by comparing them to next-to-leading order Monte Carlo
generators, as these processes present a formidable background for searches of
new physics phenomena.
