We study the inclusive decays of Ds+ mesons, using data collected near the
Ds*+ Ds- peak production energy E_cm=4170 MeV by the CLEO-c detector. We report
the inclusive yields of Ds+ decays to K^+ X, K^- X, KS0 X, pi^+ X, pi^- X, pi^0
X, eta X, eta' X, phi X, omega X and f0(980) X, and also decays into pairs of
kaons, Ds+ -> KK-bar X. Using these measurements, we obtain an overview of Ds+
decays.
