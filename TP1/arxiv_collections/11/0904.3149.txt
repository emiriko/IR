We describe the effects of geometric torsion on the coherent motion of
electrons along a thin twisted quantum ring. The geometric torsion inherent in
the quantum ring triggers a quantum phase shift in the electrons' eigenstates,
thereby resulting in a torsion-induced persistent current that flows along the
twisted quantum ring. The physical conditions required for detecting the
current flow are discussed.
