The properties of bulk nanostructured materials are often controlled by
atomic scale features like segregation along defects or composition gradients.
Here we discuss about the complimentary use of TEM and APT to obtain a full
description of nanostructures. The advantages and limitations of both
techniques are highlighted on the basis of experimental data collected in
severely deformed steels with a special emphasis on carbon spatial
distribution.
