We report on the magnetic and structural properties of Ar and Mn implanted
InAs epitaxial films grown on GaAs (100) by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) and
the effect of Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA) for 30 seconds at 750C. Channeling
Particle Induced X- ray Emission (PIXE) experiments reveal that after Mn
implantation almost all Mn atoms are subsbtitutional in the In-site of the InAs
lattice, like in a diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS). All of these samples
show diamagnetic behavior. But, after RTA treatment the Mn-InAs films exhibit
room-temperature magnetism. According to PIXE measurements the Mn atoms are no
longer substitutional. When the same set of experiments were performed with As
as implantation ion all of the layers present diamagnetism without exception.
This indicates that the appearance of room-temperature ferromagnetic-like
behavior in the Mn-InAs-RTA layer is not related to lattice disorder produce
during implantation, but to a Mn reaction produced after a short thermal
treatment. X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) and Rutherford Back Scattering
(RBS) measurements evidence the segregation of an oxygen deficient-MnO2 phase
(nominally MnO1.94) in the Mn-InAs-RTA epitaxial layers which might be on the
origin of room temperature ferromagnetic-like response observed.
