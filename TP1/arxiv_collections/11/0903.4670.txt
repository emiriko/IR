We review some recent results on how PT-symmetry, that is a simultaneous
time-reversal and parity transformation, can be used to construct new
integrable models. Some complex valued multi-particle systems, such as
deformations of the Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models, are shown to arise
naturally from real valued field equations of non-linear integrable systems.
Deformations of complex non-linear integrable field equations, some of them
even allowing for compacton solutions, are also investigated. The integrabilty
of various systems is established by means of the Painleve test
