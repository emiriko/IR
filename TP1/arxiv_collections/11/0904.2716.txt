By focusing on what can be observed by running traceroute-like measurements
at a high frequency from a single monitor to a fixed destination set, we show
that the observed view of the topology is constantly evolving at a pace much
higher than expected. Repeated measurements discover new IP addresses at a
constant rate, for long period of times (up to several months). In order to
provide explanations, we study this phenomenon both at the IP, and at the
Autonomous System levels. We show that this renewal of IP addresses is
partially caused by a BGP routing dynamics, altering paths between existing
ASes. Furthermore, we conjecture that an intra AS routing dynamics is another
cause of this phenomenon.
