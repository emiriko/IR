The Borrmann effect, which is related to the microscopic distribution of the
electromagnetic field inside the primitive cell, is studied in photonic and
magnetophotonic crystals. This effect, well-known in x-ray spectroscopy, is
responsible for the enhancement or suppression of various linear and nonlinear
optical effects when the incidence angle and/or the frequency change. It is
shown that by design of the primitive cell this effect can be suppressed and
even inverted.
