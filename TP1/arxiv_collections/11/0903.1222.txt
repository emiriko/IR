Some of us have recently reported in Science 321 232 (2008) vibrational
cooling of translationally cold Cs_2 molecules into the lowest vibrational
level v=0 of the singlet X 1Sigma_g ground electronic state. Starting from a
sample of cold molecules produced in a collection of vibrational levels of the
ground state, our method was based on repeated optical pumping by laser light
with a spectrum broad enough to excite all populated vibrational levels but
frequency-limited in such a way to eliminate transitions from v=0 level, in
which molecules accumulate. In this paper this method is generalized to
accumulate molecules into an arbitrary selected "target" vibrational level. It
is implemented by using ultrashort pulse shaping techniques based on Liquid
Crystal spatial light modulator. In particular a large fraction of the
initially present molecule is transferred into a selected vibrational level
such as v=1, 2 and 7. Limitations of the method as well as the possible
extension to rotational cooling are also discussed.
