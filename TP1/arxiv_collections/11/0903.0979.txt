Young Massive Clusters (YMCs) represent ideal testbeds in which to study
massive stellar evolution as they contain large, coeval, chemically
homogeneous, samples of massive stars. By studying YMCs with a range of ages
(and hence turn-off masses), we can investigate the post main-sequence
evolution of massive stars as a function of initial mass. Recent discoveries of
YMCs over a range of ages within our own Galaxy - where we can successfully
resolve individual stars - offers the unprecedented opportunity to test our
ideas of massive stellar evolution. Here, I review some of the recent works in
this field, and describe how we can use YMCs to investigate several topics,
including (a) the evolutionary state of H-rich Wolf-Rayet stars; (b) the
influence of binarity on stellar evolution in dense clusters; and (c) Red
Supergiants and the post-supernova remnants they leave behind.
