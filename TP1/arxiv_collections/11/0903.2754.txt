In the classical flare picture, hard X-ray emission from the chromosphere is
succeeded by soft-X-ray emission from hot plasma in the flare loop, the soft
X-ray emission being a direct consequence of the impact of the non-thermal
particle beam. However, observations of events exist in which a pronounced
increase in soft X-ray emission is observed minutes before the onset of the
hard X-ray emission. Such pre-flare emission clearly contradicts the classical
flare picture. For the first time, the pre-flare phase of such solar flares is
studied in detail. We want to explain the time evolution of the observed
emission by means of alternative energy transport mechanisms such as heat
conduction. RHESSI events displaying pronounced pre-flare emission were
analyzed in imaging and spectroscopy. The pre-flare phase is characterized by
purely thermal emission from a coronal source with increasing emission measure
and density. After this earliest phase, a small non-thermal tail to higher
energies appears in the spectra, becoming more and more pronounced. However,
images still only display one X-ray source, implying that this non-thermal
emission is coronal. The increase of emission measure and density indicates
that material is added to the coronal region. The most plausible origin is
evaporated material from the chromosphere. Energy provided by a heat flux is
capable of driving chromospheric evaporation.
