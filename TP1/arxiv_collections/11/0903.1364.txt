New high-quality CCD photometric light curves for the W UMa-type systems V410
Aur, CK Boo, FP Boo, V921 Her, ET Leo, XZ Leo, V839 Oph, V2357 Oph, AQ Psc and
VY Sex are presented. The new multicolor light curves, combined with the
spectroscopic data recently obtained at David Dunlap Observatory, are analyzed
with the Wilson-Devinney code to yield the physical parameters (masses, radii
and luminosities) of the components. Our models for all ten systems resulted in
a contact configuration. Four binaries (V921 Her, XZ Leo, V2357 Oph and VY Sex)
have low, while two (V410 Aur and CK Boo) have high fill-out factors. FP Boo,
ET Leo, V839 Oph and AQ Psc have medium values of the fill-out factor. Three of
the systems (FP Boo, V921 Her and XZ Leo) have very bright primaries as a
result of their high temperatures and large radii.
