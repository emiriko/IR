We present a dynamical mean field theory study of the valence transition
($f^{14} \to f^{13}$) in elemental, metallic Yb under pressure. Our
calculations reproduce the observed valence transition as reflected in the
volume dependence of the $4f$ occupation. The transition is accelerated by
heating, and suggests quasiparticle or Kondo-like structure in the spectra of
the trivalent end state, consistent with the early lanthanides. Results for the
local charge fluctuations and susceptibility, however, show novel signatures
uniquely associated with the valence transition itself, indicating that Yb is a
fluctuating valence material in contrast to the intermediate valence behavior
seen in the early trivalent lanthanides Ce, Pr, and Nd.
