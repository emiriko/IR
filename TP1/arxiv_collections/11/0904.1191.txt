We consider graph states of arbitrary number of particles undergoing generic
decoherence. We present methods to obtain lower and upper bounds for the
system's entanglement in terms of that of considerably smaller subsystems. For
an important class of noisy channels, namely the Pauli maps, these bounds
coincide and thus provide the exact analytical expression for the entanglement
evolution. All the results apply also to (mixed) graph-diagonal states, and
hold true for any convex entanglement monotone. Since any state can be locally
depolarized to some graph-diagonal state, our method provides a lower bound for
the entanglement decay of any arbitrary state. Finally, this formalism also
allows for the direct identification of the robustness under size scaling of
graph states in the presence of decoherence, merely by inspection of their
connectivities.
