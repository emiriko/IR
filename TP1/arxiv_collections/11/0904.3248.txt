We predict the biasing and clustering properties of galaxy clusters that are
expected to be observed in the catalogues produced by two forthcoming X-ray and
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect surveys. We study a set of flat cosmological models
where the primordial density probability distribution shows deviations from
Gaussianity in agreement with current observational bounds form the background
radiation. We consider both local and equilateral shapes for the primordial
bispectrum in non-Gaussian models. The two catalogues investigated are those
produced by the \emph{e}ROSITA wide survey and from a survey based on South
Pole Telescope observations. It turns out that both the bias and observed power
spectrum of galaxy clusters are severely affected in non-Gaussian models with
local shape of the primordial bispectrum, especially at large scales. On the
other hand, models with equilateral shape of the primordial bispectrum show
only a mild effect at all scales, that is difficult to be detected with
clustering observations. Between the two catalogues, the one performing better
is the \emph{e}ROSITA one, since it contains only the largest masses, that are
more sensitive to primordial non-Gaussianity.
