The basic problem in the cooperation theory is to justify the cooperation.
Here we propose a new approach, where players are driven by their altruism to
cooperate or not. The probability of cooperation depends also on the
co-player's reputation. We find that players with positive altruism cooperate
and met cooperation. In this approach, payoffs are not relevant. The mechanism
is most efficient in the fully connected network.
