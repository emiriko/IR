For a finite dimensional discrete bipartite system, we find the relation
between local projections performed by Alice, and Bob post-selected state
dependence on the global state submatrices. With this result the joint state
reconstruction problem for a bipartite system can be solved with strict local
projections and one-way classical communication. The generalization to
multipartite systems is straightforward.
