Recent work in gravitational lensing and catastrophe theory has shown that
the sum of the signed magnifications of images near folds, cusps and also
higher catastrophes is zero. Here, it is discussed how Lefschetz fixed point
theory can be used to interpret this result geometrically. It is shown for the
generic case as well as for elliptic and hyperbolic umbilics in gravitational
lensing.
