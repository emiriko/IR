A novel self-consistent implementation of Hedin's GW perturbation theory is
introduced. This finite-temperature method uses Hartree-Fock wave functions to
represent Green's function. GW equations are solved with full potential linear
augmented plane wave (FLAPW) method at each iteration of a self-consistent
cycle. With our approach we are able to calculate total energy as a function of
the lattice parameter. Ground state properties calculated for Na, Al, and Si
compare well with experimental data.
