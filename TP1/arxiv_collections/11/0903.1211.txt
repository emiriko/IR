This work aims to provide a first insight into the mass-metallicity (MZ)
relation of star-forming galaxies at redshift z~1.4. To reach this goal, we
present a first set of nine VVDS galaxies observed with the NIR integral-field
spectrograph SINFONI on the VLT. Oxygen abundances are derived from empirical
indicators based on the ratio between strong nebular emission-lines (Halpha,
[NII]6584 and [SII]6717,6731). Stellar masses are deduced from SED fitting with
Charlot & Bruzual (2007) population synthesis models, and star formation rates
are derived from [OII]3727 and Halpha emission-line luminosities. We find a
typical shift of 0.2-0.4 dex towards lower metallicities for the z~1.4
galaxies, compared to the MZ-relation in the local universe as derived from
SDSS data. However, this small sample of eight galaxies does not show any clear
correlation between stellar mass and metallicity, unlike other larger samples
at different redshift (z~0, z~0.7, and z~2). Indeed, our galaxies lie just
under the relation at z~2 and show a small trend for more massive galaxies to
be more metallic (~0.1 logarithmic slope). There are two possible explanations
to account for these observations. First, the most massive galaxies present
higher specific star formation rates when compared to the global VVDS sample
which could explain the particularly low metallicity of these galaxies as
already shown in the SDSS sample. Second, inflow of metal-poor gas due to tidal
interactions could also explain the low metallicity of these galaxies as two of
these three galaxies show clear signatures of merging in their velocity fields.
Finally, we find that the metallicity of 4 galaxies is lower by ~0.2 to 0.4 dex
if we take into account the N/O abundance ratio in their metallicity estimate.
