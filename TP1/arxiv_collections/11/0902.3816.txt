Lie derivatives of various geometrical and physical quantities define
symmetries and conformal symmetries in general relativity. Thus we obtain
motions, collineations, conformal motions and conformal collineations. These
symmetries are used not only to find new solutions of Einstein's field
equations but to classify the spaces also. Different classification schemes are
presented here. Relationships between these symmetries are discussed and
illustrating examples are presented.
