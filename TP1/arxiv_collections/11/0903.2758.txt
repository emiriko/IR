Recent muon and neutron experiments on the new FeAs-based superconductors
revealed phase diagrams characterized by first-order evolution from
antiferromagnetic to superconducting states, and an inelastic magnetic
resonance mode whose energy scales as $\sim 4 k_{B}T_{c}$. These features
exhibit striking commonalities with cuprate, backyball, organic, and
heavy-fermion superconductors as well as superfluid $^{4}$He.
