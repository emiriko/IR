The consistent description of the nuclear response at low and high momentum
transfer requires a unified dynamical model, suitable to account for both
short- and long-range correlation effects. We report the results of a study of
the charged current weak response of symmetric nuclear matter, carried out
using an effective interaction obtained from a realistic model of the
nucleon-nucleon force within the formalism of correlated basis functions. Our
approach allows for a clear identification of the kinematical regions in which
different interaction effects dominate.
