The strange metal phase of optimally and overdoped cuprates exhibits a number
of anomalous transport properties: unsaturating linear T resistivity, distinct
relaxation times for Hall angle and resistivity, temperature dependent
anisotropic relaxation times, and a characteristic crossover from supposed
Fermi Liquid to linear T behavior. All receive natural explanations and
quantitative fits in terms of the Hidden Fermi Liquid theory.
