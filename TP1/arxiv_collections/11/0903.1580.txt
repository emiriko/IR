I propose a sharp form of Thorne's hoop conjecture which relates Birkhoff's
invariant $\beta$ for an outermost apparent horizon to its $ADM$ mass, $ \beta
\le 4 \pi M_{ADM}$. I prove the conjecture in the case of collapsing null
shells and provide further evidence from exact rotating black hole solutions.
Since $\beta$ is bounded below by the length $l$ of the shortest non-trivial
geodesic lying in the apparent horizon, the conjecture implies $l \le 4 \pi
M_{ADM}$. The Penrose conjecture, $\sqrt{\pi A} \le 4 \pi M_{ADM}$, and Pu's
theorem imply this latter consequence for horizons admitting an antipodal
isometry. Quite generally, Penrose's inequality and Berger's isembolic
inequality, $\sqrt{\pi A} \ge {2\over\sqrt\pi} i$, where $i$ is the injectivity
radius, imply $ 4c \le 2 i \le 4 \pi M_{ADM}$, where $c$ is the convexity
radius.
