We consider a scenario where our universe is taken as a three-dimensional
domain wall embedded in a five-dimensional Minkowski space-time, as originally
proposed by Brito and collaborators [1]. We explore the existence of a richer
class of soliton solutions and their consequences for the acceleration of the
universe driven by collisions of bulk particle excitations with the walls. In
particular it is shown that some of these solutions should play a fundamental
role throughout the expansion process.
