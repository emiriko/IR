We consider effect of stochastic sources upon self-organization process being
initiated with creation of the limit cycle. General expressions obtained are
applied to the stochastic Lorenz system to show that departure from equilibrium
steady state can destroy the limit cycle at certain relation between
characteristic scales of temporal variation of principle variables. Noise
induced resonance related to the limit cycle is found to appear if the fastest
variations displays a principle variable, which is coupled with two different
degrees of freedom or more.
