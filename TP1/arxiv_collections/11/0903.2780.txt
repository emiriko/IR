Certain alternative properties of physical systems are describable by
supports of arguments of response functions (e.g. light cone, borders of media)
and expressed by projectors; corresponding equations of restraints lead to
dispersion relations, theorems of counting, etc. As supports are measurable,
their absolutely strict borders contradict the spirit of quantum theory and
their quantum evolution leading to appearance of subtractions or certain needed
flattening would be considered. Flattening of projectors introduce transitive
zones that can be examined as a specification of adiabatic hypothesis or the
Bogoliubov regulatory function in QED. For demonstration of their possibilities
the phenomena of refraction and reflection of electromagnetic wave are
considered; they show, in particular, the inevitable appearing of double
electromagnetic layers on all surfaces that formerly were repeatedly
postulated, etc. Quantum dynamics of projectors proves the neediness of
subtractions that usually are artificially adding and express transient
singularities and zones in squeezed forms.
