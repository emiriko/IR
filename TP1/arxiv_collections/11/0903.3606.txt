We investigate linear and nonlinear transport across single-walled carbon
nanotube quantum dots weakly coupled to spin-polarized leads. We consider tubes
of finite length and small diameter, where not only forward scattering
contributions of the Coulomb potential, but also short-ranged processes play an
important role. In particular, they induce exchange effects leading for
electron fillings 4n+2 either to a non-degenerate groundstate of spin S=0 or to
a triplet groundstate. In the linear regime we present analytical results for
the conductance - for both the S=0 and the triplet groundstate - and
demonstrate that an external magnetic field is crucial to reveal the spin
nature of the groundstates. In the nonlinear regime we show stability diagrams
that clearly distinguish between the different groundstates. We observe a
negative differential conductance (NDC) effect in the S=0 groundstate for
antiparallel lead magnetization. In presence of an external magnetic field spin
blockade effects can be detected, again leading to NDC effects for both
groundstates.
