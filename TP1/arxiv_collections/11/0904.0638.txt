New broadband UBVRI photoelectric observations on the Johnson-Kron-Cousins
photometric system have been made of 202 stars around the sky, and centered at
the celestial equator. These stars constitute both an update of and additions
to a previously published list of equatorial photometric standard stars. The
list is capable of providing, for both celestial hemispheres, an internally
consistent homogeneous broadband standard photometric system around the sky.
When these new measurements are included with those previously published by
Landolt (1992), the entire list of standard stars in this paper encompasses the
magnitude range 8.90 < V < 16.30, and the color index range -0.35 < (B - V) <
+2.30.
