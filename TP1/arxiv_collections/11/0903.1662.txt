We argue that by inducing superconductivity in graphene via the proximity
effect, it is possible to observes the "quantum valley Hall effect". In the
presence of magnetic field, supercurrent causes "valley pseudospin" to
accumulate at the edges of the superconducting strip. This, and the structure
of the superconducting vortex core, provide possibilities to experimentally
observe aspects of the "deconfined quantum criticality".
