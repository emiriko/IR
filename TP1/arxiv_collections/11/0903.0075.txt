NASA's first two deep space missions, Pioneers 10 and 11, have been
travelling through the outer solar system for three decades. A slight deviation
from their calculated trajectories presents an as yet unsolved scientific
mystery. The use of recently recovered Doppler and telemetry data may help us
develop a better understanding of this anomaly, and decide whether or not it is
due to a force of on-board origin.
