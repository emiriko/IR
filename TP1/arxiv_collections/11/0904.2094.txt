In this paper, we study almost sure central limit theorems for multiple
stochastic integrals and provide a criterion based on the kernel of these
multiple integrals. We apply our result to normalized partial sums of Hermite
polynomials of increments of fractional Brownian motion. We obtain almost sure
central limit theorems for these normalized sums when they converge in law to a
normal distribution.
