We investigate the dynamics of inertia-gravity wave modes in 3D rotating
stratified fluids. We start by deriving a reduced PDE, the GGG model,
consisting of only wave-mode interactions. In principle, comparing this model
to the full rotating Boussinesq system allows us to gauge the importance of
wave-vortical-wave vs. wave-wave-wave interactions in determining the transfer
and distribution of wave-mode energy. As in many atmosphere-ocean phenomena we
work in a skewed aspect ratio domain (H/L) with Fr = Ro < 1 such that Bu = 1.
Our focus is on the equilibration of wave-mode energy and its spectral scaling
under the influence of random large-scale forcing. As anticipated, when forcing
is applied to all modes, with Fr=Ro ~ 0.05 and H/L=1/5, the wave-mode energy
equilibrates and its spectrum scales as a power-law. For the same parameters,
when forcing is restricted to only wave modes, the energy fails to equilibrate
in both the full system as well as the GGG subsystem at resolutions we can
achieve. This cleary demonstrates the importance of the vortical mode in
determining the wave-mode energy distribution. Proceeding to the second set of
simulations, i.e. for the larger Fr=Ro ~ 0.1 in a less skewed aspect ratio
domain with H/L=1/3, we observe that the energy of the GGG subsystem
equilibrates. Further, the full system with forcing restricted to wave modes
also equilbrates and both yield identical energy spectra. Thus it is clear that
the wave-wave-wave interactions play a role in the overall dynamics at moderate
Ro, Fr and aspect ratios. Apart from theoretical concerns, these results
highlight the difficulty in properly resolving wave-mode interactions when
simulating realistic geophysical phenomena.
