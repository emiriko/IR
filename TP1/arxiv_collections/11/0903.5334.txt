Two new forms of strongly coupled plasmas will be discussed. They have become
possible to create and observe in the laboratory only recently and exhibit a
wealth of intriguing complex behavior which can be studied, in many cases for
the first time, experimentally. Plasmas, gases of charged particles, are
universal in the sense that certain properties of complex behavior do only
depend on ratios of characteristic parameters of the plasma, not on the
parameters themselves. Therefore, it is of fundamental and far reaching
consequence, to be able to create and observe a strongly coupled plasma since
its behavior is paradigmatic for an entire class of plasmas.
