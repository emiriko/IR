In the present work we demonstrate that in addition to the well-known
colossal-dielectric-constant material CaCu3Ti4O12 also various members of the
series Ln2/3Cu3Ti4O12 with Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er and
Tm, exhibit giant values of the dielectric constant. Just as CaCu3Ti4O12, all
these materials show a Maxwell-Wagner type relaxation process. For the best
material, Pr2/3Cu3Ti4O12, we provide a detailed investigation of its dielectric
properties in a broad frequency range up to 1 GHz. Polarization at internal
barriers, most likely grain boundaries, seems to be the reason for the observed
very high values of the dielectric constant. Taking into account the present
results and those reported in literature
