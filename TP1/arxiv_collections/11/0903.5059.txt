We consider several hints for new physics involving CP-asymmetries in
B-decays and interpret them in terms of generic contributions to effective
Wilson coefficients. The effects we focus on are: the differences in the fitted
value of sin(2 beta) versus the ones directly measured via the time dependent
CP asymmetries in B -> J/psi K or via B -> (phi,eta') K; the difference between
the direct CP asymmetries in B- -> K- pi0 and B0 -> K- pi+ and the ~2.2 sigma
indications for the CP-asymmetry in Bs -> J/psi phi. To alleviate concerns
regarding the disagreement between inclusive and exclusive Vub, we show that
our results hold even without the inclusion of Vub in the analysis. We find
that no matter what kind of new physics (NP) is invoked to explain these
effects, its effective scale is bounded from above from a few hundred GeV to a
few TeV depending on specific assumptions regarding the type of new physics.
The only exception to this is when the NP contribution is assumed to reside
entirely in LR operators in K mixing, then the scale of NP can be as high as
around 24 TeV; however, this case cannot account for CP asymmetry in Bs ->
J/psi phi or a difference in sin(2 beta) from penguin modes compared to that
from J/psi K or for that matter the large difference seen between direct CP
asymmetries in K- pi+ and in K- pi0.
