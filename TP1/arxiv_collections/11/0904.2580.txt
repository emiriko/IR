Elastic and inelastic neutron scattering studies reveal details of the
antiferromagnetic tansition and intriguing spin-dynamics in the
magneto-electric effect single crystal LiMnPO$_4$. The elastic scattering
studies confirm the system is antiferromagnetic (AFM) below $T_N$=33.75 K with
local magnetic moments (Mn$^{2+}$; $S = 5/2$) that are aligned along the
crystallographic a-axis. The spin-wave dispersion curves propagating along the
three principal axes, determined by inelastic scattering, are adequately
modeled in the linear spin-wave framework assuming a spin-Hamiltonian that is
parameterized by inter- and in-plane nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor
interactions, and by easy-plane anisotropy. The temperature dependence of the
spin dynamics makes this an excellent model many-body spin system to address
the question of the relationship between spin-wave excitations and the order
parameter.
