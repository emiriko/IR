The estimation of cosmological parameters from precision observables is an
important industry with crucial ramifications for particle physics. This
article discusses the statistical methods presently used in cosmological data
analysis, highlighting the main assumptions and uncertainties. The topics
covered are parameter estimation, model selection, multi-model inference, and
experimental design, all primarily from a Bayesian perspective.
