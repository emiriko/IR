A completely analytical theory of chirped-pulse oscillators is presented. The
theory is based on an approximate integration of the generalized nonlinear
complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. The obtained parametric space of a
chirped-pulse oscillator allows easy tracing the characteristics of both
solid-state and fiber oscillators operating in the positive dispersion regime.
