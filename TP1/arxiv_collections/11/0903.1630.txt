We study the quantum phase diagram of the Heisenberg planar antiferromagnet
with a subset of four-spin ring exchange interactions, using the recently
proposed heirarchical mean-field approach. By identifying relevant degrees of
freedom, we are able to use a single variational anzatz to map the entire phase
diagram of the model and uncover the nature of its various phases. It is shown
that there exists a transition between a N\'eel state and a quantum
paramagnetic phase, characterized by broken translational invariance. The
non-magnetic phase preserves the lattice rotational symmetry, and has a
correlated plaquette nature. Our results also suggest that this phase
transition can be properly described within the Landau paradigm.
