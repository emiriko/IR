We study the "lepton-specific" two Higgs doublet model, in which one doublet
Phi_l gives mass to charged leptons and the other Phi_q gives mass to both up-
and down-type quarks. We examine the existing experimental constraints on the
charged Higgs boson mass and the parameter tan(beta) \equiv
<Phi_q^0>/<Phi_l^0>. The most stringent constraints come from LEP-II direct
searches and lepton flavour universality in tau decays. The former yields M_H+
\geq 92.0 GeV; the latter yields two allowed regions, 0.61 tan(beta) GeV \leq
M_H+ \leq 0.73 tan(beta) GeV or M_H+ \geq 1.4 tan(beta) GeV, and excludes
parameter regions beyond the LEP-II bound for tan(beta) \gtrsim 65. We present
the charged Higgs decay branching fractions and discuss prospects for charged
Higgs discovery at the LHC in this model.
