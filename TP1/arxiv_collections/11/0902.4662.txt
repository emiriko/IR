We investigate the recently proposed Kerr/CFT correspondence in the context
of rotating spacetimes with a NUT twist. The Kerr/CFT correspondence states
that the near-horizon states of an extremal four (or higher) dimensional black
hole could be identified with a certain chiral conformal field theory. The
corresponding Virasoro algebra is generated with a class of diffeomorphism
which preserves an appropriate boundary condition on the near-horizon geometry.
We try to understand the analog of singularities in the context of dual chiral
CFT. Explicitly, we use Kerr/CFT correspondence to show that if we initially do
not remove the singularities from the spacetimes, in the dual chiral CFT we can
detect the presence of singularities in the bulk of spacetime.
