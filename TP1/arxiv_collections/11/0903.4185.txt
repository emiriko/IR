We build a holographic description of non-relativistic system for
superconductivity in strongly interacting condensed matter via gauge/gravity
duality. We focus on the phase transition and give an example to show that a
simple gravitational theory can provide a non-relativistic holographical dual
description of a superconductor. There is also a critical temperature like the
relativistic case, below which a charged condensation field appears by a second
order phase transition and the (DC) conductivity becomes infinite. We also
calculated the frequency dependent conductivity.
