Periodic changes in a stellar magnetic field can be explained in two ways:
the oblique rotator model or the solar cycle model. Although many papers favor
the oblique rotator model, there has not been enough evidence to rule out the
solar cycle model definitively. This paper presents five new observations
(together with a old one) that can be carried out to distinguish magnetic field
rotation and magnetic field reversal.
