We present an experiment where we tune the decoherence in a quantum
interferometer using one of the simplest object available in the physic of
quantum conductors : an ohmic contact. For that purpose, we designed an
electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer which has one of its two arms connected
to an ohmic contact through a quantum point contact. At low temperature, we
observe quantum interference patterns with a visibility up to 57%. Increasing
the connection between one arm of the interferometer to the floating ohmic
contact, the voltage probe, reduces quantum interferences as it probes the
electron trajectory. This unique experimental realization of a voltage probe
works as a trivial which-path detector whose efficiency can be simply tuned by
a gate voltage.
