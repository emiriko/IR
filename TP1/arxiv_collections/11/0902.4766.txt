Suppression of rectification at metal--Mott-insulator interfaces, which is
previously shown by numerical solutions to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation and experiments on real devices, is reinvestigated theoretically by
nonequilibrium Green's functions. The one-dimensional Hubbard model is used for
a Mott insulator. The effects of attached metallic electrodes are incorporated
into the self-energy. A scalar potential originating from work-function
differences and satisfying the Poisson equation is added to the model. For the
electron density, we decompose it into three parts. One is obtained by
integrating the local density of states over energy to the midpoint of the
electrodes' chemical potentials. The others, obtained by integrating lesser
Green's functions, are due to the couplings with the electrodes and correspond
to an inflow and an outflow of electrons. In Mott insulators, incoming
electrons and holes are extended over the whole system, avoiding further
accumulation of charge relative to the case without bias. This induces
collective charge transport and results in the suppression of rectification.
