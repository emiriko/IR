It is shown that the Bohm equations for the phase $S$ and squared modulus
$\rho$ of the quantum mechanical wave function can be derived from the
classical ensemble equations admiting an aditional momentum $p_s$ of the form
proportional to the osmotic velocity in the Nelson stochastic mechanics and
using the variational principle with appropriate change of variables. The
possibility to treat grad$S$ and $p_s$ as two parts of the momentum of quantum
ensemble particles is considered from the view point of uncertainty relations
of Robertson - Schroedinger type on the examples of the stochastic image of
quantum mechanical canonical coherent and squeezed states.
