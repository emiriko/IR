Using standard statistical method, we discover the existence of correlations
among Hawking radiations (of tunneled particles) from a black hole. The
information carried by such correlations is quantified by mutual information
between sequential emissions. Through a careful counting of the entropy taken
out by the emitted particles, we show that the black hole radiation as
tunneling is an entropy conservation process. While information is leaked out
through the radiation, the total entropy is conserved. Thus, we conclude the
black hole evaporation process is unitary.
