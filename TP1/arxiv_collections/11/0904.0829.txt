We study the ultraviolet complete non-relativistic theory recently proposed
by Horava. After introducing a Lifshitz scalar for a general background, we
analyze the cosmology of the model in Lorentzian and Euclidean signature.
Vacuum solutions are found and it is argued the existence of non-singular
bouncing profiles. We find a general qualitative agreement with both the
picture of Causal Dynamical Triangulations and Quantum Einstein Gravity.
However, inflation driven by a Lifshitz scalar field on a classical background
might not produce a scale-invariant spectrum when the principle of detailed
balance is assumed.
