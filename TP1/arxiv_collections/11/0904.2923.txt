We examine the modal, spectral, and polarization entanglement properties of
photon pairs generated in a nonlinear, periodically poled, two-mode waveguide
(1-D planar or 2-D circular) via nondegenerate spontaneous parametric
down-conversion. Any of the possible degrees of freedom -- mode number,
frequency, or polarization -- can be used to distinguish the down-converted
photons while the others serve as attributes of entanglement. Distinguishing
the down-converted photons based on their mode numbers enables us to
efficiently generate spectral or polarization entanglement that is either
narrowband or broadband. On the other hand, when the generated photons are
distinguished by their frequencies in a Type-0 process, modal entanglement
turns out to be an efficient alternative to polarization entanglement.
Moreover, modal entanglement in Type-II down-conversion may be used to generate
a doubly entangled state in frequency and polarization.
