A family of wave solutions to the full Einstein equations in AdS_5 geometry
is derived. These background solutions give by duality the response of N=4 SYM
at strong coupling to an arbitrary distribution of fast moving external sources
for the energy-momentum tensor operator. We discuss the similarities of these
solutions with the Color Glass Condensate effective theory for QCD at high
energy.
