The multiscale variance stabilization Transform (MSVST) has recently been
proposed for Poisson data denoising. This procedure, which is nonparametric, is
based on thresholding wavelet coefficients. We present in this paper an
extension of the MSVST to 3D data (in fact 2D-1D data) when the third dimension
is not a spatial dimension, but the wavelength, the energy, or the time. We
show that the MSVST can be used for detecting and characterizing astrophysical
sources of high-energy gamma rays, using realistic simulated observations with
the Large Area Telescope (LAT). The LAT was launched in June 2008 on the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope mission. The MSVST algorithm is very fast relative to
traditional likelihood model fitting, and permits efficient detection across
the time dimension and immediate estimation of spectral properties.
Astrophysical sources of gamma rays, especially active galaxies, are typically
quite variable, and our current work may lead to a reliable method to quickly
characterize the flaring properties of newly-detected sources.
