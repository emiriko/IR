Workshop RPSCINT'2008 was organized in Kyiv (Ukraine) on 9th and 10th
September 2008. The idea was to bring together physicists, chemists, crystal
scintillator experts and manufacturers to discuss the requirements of low-count
rate experiments, in particular the required radiopurity and scintillation
properties; selection and screening of input materials; purification of
materials; raw compound preparation; crystal growing, annealing and handling;
test of crystals; search for and development of new scintillating materials.
Some contributions to the RPSCINT 2008 workshop are presented in these
proceedings.
