We demonstrate the Au-assisted growth of semiconductor nanowires on different
engineered substrates. Two relevant cases are investigated: GaAs/AlGaAs
heterostructures capped by a $50 {\rm nm}$-thick InAs layer grown by molecular
beam epitaxy and a $2 {\rm \mu m}$-thick InAs buffer layer on Si(111) obtained
by vapor phase epitaxy. Morphological and structural properties of substrates
and nanowires are analyzed by atomic force and transmission electron
microscopy. Our results indicate a promising direction for the integration of
III-V nanostructures on Si-based electronics as well as for the development of
novel micromechanical structures.
