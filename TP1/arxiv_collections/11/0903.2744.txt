We propose three criteria for the generation of random digital strings from
quantum beam splitters: (i) three or more mutually exclusive outcomes
corresponding to the invocation of three- and higher dimensional Hilbert
spaces; (ii) the mandatory use of pure states in conjugated bases for
preparation and detection; and (iii) the use of entangled singlet (unique)
states for elimination of bias.
