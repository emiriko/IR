Characterized by zigzag and armchair boundaries, the narrow ribbons display
the very different characteristics in Hall conductivities. It is shown that the
multi-band-crossings occur in the energy spectrum for armchair ribbons, and the
number of them depends on the width of ribbons. Theoretically, it is predicated
that the conductivities exhibit drastic sign reversals for narrow ribbons as
the Fermi energy sweep over the band-crossings. A new classification of
armchair ribbons is suggested based on the emergence of a flat band in the
energy spectrum only for odd armchair ribbons. The evolution of jumped Hall
conductivities to step-like plateaus and the restore of density of states at
the van Hove singularity in the limitation to graphene sheet have been
analyzed.
