We present the first galaxy evolution results from the Local Cluster
Substructure Survey (LoCuSS), a multi-wavelength survey of 100 X-ray selected
galaxy clusters at 0.15<z<0.30. LoCuSS combines far-UV through far-IR
observations of cluster galaxies with gravitational lensing analysis and X-ray
data to investigate the interplay between the hierarchical assembly of clusters
and the evolution of cluster galaxies. Here we present new panoramic
Spitzer/MIPS 24micron observations of the merging cluster Abell 1758 at z=0.279
spanning 6.5x6.5Mpc and reaching a 90% completeness limit of 400uJy. We
estimate a global cluster SFR of 910\pm320 M_sun/yr within 3 Mpc of the cluster
centre, originating from 42 galaxies with L_IR > 5x10^10 L_sun. The obscured
activity in A1758 is therefore comparable with that in Cl 0024+1654, the most
active cluster previously studied at 24um. The obscured galaxies faithfully
trace the cluster potential as revealed by the weak-lensing mass map of the
cluster, including numerous mass peaks at R~2-3Mpc that are likely associated
with infalling galaxy groups and filamentary structures. However the core
(R<500kpc) of A1758N is 2x more active in the IR than that of A1758S, likely
reflecting differences in the recent dynamical history of the two clusters. The
24micron results from A1758 therefore suggest that dust-obscured cluster
galaxies are common in merging clusters and suggests that obscured activity in
clusters is triggered by both the details of cluster-cluster mergers and
processes that operate at larger radii including those within in-falling
groups. Our ongoing far-UV through far-IR observations of a large sample of
clusters should allow us to disentangle the different physical processes
responsible for triggering obscured star formation in clusters.
