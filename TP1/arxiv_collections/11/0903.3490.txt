Transverse parton momentum dependent distribution functions (TMDs) of the
nucleon are studied in a covariant model, which describes the intrinsic motion
of partons in terms of a covariant momentum distribution. The consistency of
the approach is demonstrated, and model relations among TMDs are studied. As a
byproduct it is shown how the approach allows to formulate the non-relativistic
limit.
