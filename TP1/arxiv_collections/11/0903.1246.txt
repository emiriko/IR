It was found that the vector meson pair from the pseudoscalar decays can form
an entangled state. In this work we give out detailed explanations on the
polarization correlation of the two entangled vector mesons. It is demonstrated
that an experimental test of the Clauser-Horne inequality can be carried out
through measuring the azimuthal distribution of four pseudoscalars in the
cascade decay $\eta_c \to VV \to (PP)(PP)$, and the measurement of this process
is feasible with the current running experiments in tau-charm factory.
Moreover, a brief discussion on the polarization correlation of the two vector
mesons from $B \to VV$ decays is also presented.
