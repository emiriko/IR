We review the theory of hadronic atoms in QCD+QED. The non-relativistic
effective Lagrangian approach, used to describe this type of bound states, is
illustrated with the case of pi+pi- atoms. In addition, we discuss the
evaluation of isospin-breaking corrections to hadronic atom observables by
invoking chiral perturbation theory.
