Following a suggestion by Smit, the CP odd terms of the effective action of
the Standard Model, obtained by integration of quarks and leptons, are computed
to sixth order within a strict covariant derivative expansion approach. No
other approximations are made. The final result so derived includes all
Standard Model gauge fields and Higgs. Remarkably, at the order considered in
this work, all parity violating contributions turn out to be zero. Non
vanishing CP violating terms are obtained in the C-odd P-even sector. These are
several orders of magnitude larger than perturbative estimates. Various
unexpected regularities in the final result are noted.
