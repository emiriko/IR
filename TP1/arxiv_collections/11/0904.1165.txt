We study the fluxes of anti-deuterons that could be produced by annihilations
in the galactic halo of Dark Matter particles with multi-TeV mass and a large
annihilation cross section, as indicated by the recent PAMELA results. The
model of Minimal Dark Matter (MDM) is an example in this category. We find that
the fluxes are well within the reach of planned experiments for DM candidates
that annihilate mainly into quark pairs, and also extend into the multi-GeV
range above the background. They are instead suppressed and concentrated at too
large energies to emerge above the background if the main annihilation channel
is into gauge bosons (such as in particular W+W- in the MDM case).
