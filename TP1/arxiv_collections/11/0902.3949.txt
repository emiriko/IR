It is shown that entanglement, which is a quantum correlation property of at
least two subsystems, is imprinted in the mode structure of a single photon.
The photon, which is emitted by two coupled cavities, carries the information
on the concurrence of the two intracavity fields. This can be useful for
recording the entanglement dynamics of two cavity fields and for entanglement
transfer.
