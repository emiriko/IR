We use techniques of tube-log Riemann surfaces due to R.Perez-Marco to
construct a hedgehog containing smooth $C^{\infty}$ combs. The hedgehog is a
common hedgehog for a family of commuting non-linearisable holomorphic maps
with a common indifferent fixed point. The comb is made up of smooth curves,
and is transversally bi-H\"older regular.
