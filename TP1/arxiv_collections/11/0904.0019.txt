Many combinatorial optimization problems entail a number of hierarchically
dependent optimization problems. An often used solution is to associate a
suitably large cost with each individual optimization problem, such that the
solution of the resulting aggregated optimization problem solves the original
set of hierarchically dependent optimization problems. This paper starts by
studying the package upgradeability problem in software distributions.
Straightforward solutions based on Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) and
pseudo-Boolean (PB) optimization are shown to be ineffective, and unlikely to
scale for large problem instances. Afterwards, the package upgradeability
problem is related to multilevel optimization. The paper then develops new
algorithms for Boolean Multilevel Optimization (BMO) and highlights a large
number of potential applications. The experimental results indicate that the
proposed algorithms for BMO allow solving optimization problems that existing
MaxSAT and PB solvers would otherwise be unable to solve.
