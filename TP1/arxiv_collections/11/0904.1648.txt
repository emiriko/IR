In the framework of Generalised Parton Distributions, we study the
helicity-dependent and independent cross sections measured in Hall A and the
beam spin asymmetries measured in Hall B at Jefferson Laboratory. We perform a
global fit of these data and fits on each kinematical bin. We extract the real
and imaginary parts of the Compton Form Factor $\mathcal{H}$ under the main
hypothesis of dominance of the Generalised Parton Distribution $H$ and twist 2
accuracy. We discuss our results and compare to previous extractions as well as
to the VGG model. We pay extra attention to the estimation of errors on the
extraction of $\mathcal{H}$.
