The occurrence of single- or multisite localized vibrational modes, also
called Discrete Breathers (DBs), in 2D hexagonal dusty plasma (DP) lattices is
investigated. The system is described by a Klein-Gordon hexagonal lattice
characterized by a negative coupling parameter $\e$ in account of its inverse
dispersive behavior. A theoretical analysis is performed in order to establish
the possibility of existence of single- as well as three-site DBs in such
systems. The study is complemented by a numerical investigation based on
experimentally provided potential forms. This investigation shows that a DP
lattice can support single site DBs while three-site in phase breathers could
exist if specific conditions, about the inter-grain interaction strength, would
hold. On the other hand, out of phase and vortex three site breathers cannot be
supported since they are highly unstable.
