We present the complete classification of smooth toric Fano threefolds, known
to the algebraic geometry literature, and perform some preliminary analyses in
the context of brane-tilings and Chern-Simons theory on M2-branes probing
Calabi-Yau fourfold singularities. We emphasise that these 18 spaces should be
as intensely studied as their well-known counter-parts: the del Pezzo surfaces.
