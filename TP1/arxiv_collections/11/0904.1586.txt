Charged and neutral, pion and kaon electric polarizabilities are extracted
from lattice QCD using an ensemble of anisotropic gauge configurations with
dynamical clover fermions. We utilize classical background fields to access the
polarizabilities from two-point correlation functions. Uniform background
fields are achieved by quantizing the electric field strength with the proper
treatment of boundary flux. These external fields, however, are implemented
only in the valence quark sector. A novel method to extract charge particle
polarizabilities is successfully demonstrated for the first time.
