In close binary systems, rotation and tidal forces of the component stars
deform each other and destroy their spherical symmetry. We present new models
for low-mass, pre-main sequence stars that include the combined distortion
effects of tidal and rotational forces on the equilibrium configuration of
stars. We investigate the effects of interaction between tides and rotation on
the stellar structure and evolution. The Kippenhahn & Thomas (1970)
approximation, along with the Clairaut-Legendre expansion for the gravitational
potential of a self-gravitating body, is used to take the distortion effects
into account. We obtained values of internal structure constants for low-mass,
pre-main sequence stars from stellar evolutionary models that consider the
combined effects of rotation and tidal forces due to a companion star. We also
derived a new expression for the rotational inertia of a tidally and
rotationally distorted star. Our distorted models were successfully used to
analyze the eclipsing binary system EK Cep, reproducing the stellar radii,
effective temperature ratio, lithium depletion, rotational velocities, and the
apsidal motion rate in the age interval of 15.5-16.7 Myr. In the low-mass
range, the assumption that harmonics greater than j=2 can be neglected seems
not to be fully justified, although it is widely used when analyzing the
apsidal motion of binary systems. The non-standard evolutionary tracks are
cooler than the standard ones, mainly for low-mass stars. Distorted models
predict more mass-concentrated stars at the zero-age main-sequence than
standard models.
