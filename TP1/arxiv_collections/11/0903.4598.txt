We investigate diffractive events in hadron-hadron collisions, in which two
jets are produced and separated by a large rapidity gap. In perturbative QCD,
the hard color-singlet object exchanged in the t-channel, and responsible for
the rapidity gap, is the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) Pomeron. We
perform a phenomenological study including the corrections due to
next-to-leading logarithms (NLL). Using a renormalisation-group improved NLL
kernel, we show that the BFKL predictions are in good agreement with the
Tevatron data, and present predictions which could be tested at the LHC.
