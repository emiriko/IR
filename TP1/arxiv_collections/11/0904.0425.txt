Recently, we introduced several dispersive representations for the vector
$K\pi$ form factor and fitted them to the Belle spectrum of $\tau \to K \pi
\nu_\tau$. Here, we briefly present the model and discuss the results for the
slope and curvature of $F_+(s)$ arising from the best fit. Furthermore, we
compare the pole position of the charged $K^*(892)$ computed from our model
with other results in the literature. Finally, we discuss the prospects of a
simultaneous fit to $\tau \to K \pi \nu_\tau$ and $K_{e3}$ spectra.
