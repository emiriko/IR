Working with epitaxial films of Fe, we succeeded in independent control of
different scattering processes in the anomalous Hall effect. The result
appropriately accounted for the role of phonons, thereby clearly exposing the
fundamental flaws of the standard plot of the anomalous Hall resistivity versus
longitudinal resistivity. A new scaling has been thus established that allows
an unambiguous identification of the intrinsic Berry curvature mechanism as
well as the extrinsic skew scattering and side-jump mechanisms of the anomalous
Hall effect.
