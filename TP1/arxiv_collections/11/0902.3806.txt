Spin splitting of the energy spectrum of single-layer graphene on Au/Ni(111)
substrate has been recently reported. I show that eigenstates of spin-orbit
coupled graphene are polarized in-plane and perpendicular to electron momentum
$\bf k$; the magnitude of spin polarization $\bf S$ vanishes when $k \to 0$. In
a perpendicular magnetic field $\bf B$, $\bf S$ is parallel to $\bf B$, and two
zero modes emerge in the Landau level spectrum. Singular $\bf B$-dependence of
their magnetization suggests existence of a novel magnetic instability. They
also manifest themselves in a new unconventional quantum Hall effect.
