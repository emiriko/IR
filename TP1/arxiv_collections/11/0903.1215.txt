Cross sections for the ^{3}He(e,e'pn)p reaction were measured for the first
time at energy transfers of 220 and 270 MeV for several momentum transfers
ranging from 300 to 450 MeV/c. Cross sections are presented as a function of
the momentum of the recoil proton and the momentum transfer. Continuum Faddeev
calculations using the Argonne V18 and Bonn-B nucleon-nucleon potentials
overestimate the measured cross sections by a factor 5 at low recoil proton
momentum with the discrepancy becoming much smaller at higher recoil momentum.
