The light Higgs mass in the MSSM is highly constrained and is predicted to be
close to M_Z which causes a tension between the LEP II Higgs mass bound 114 GeV
and the natural electroweak symmetry breaking in the MSSM. The usual way to
increase the light CP even Higgs mass was to increase the quartic coupling of
the up type Higgs. We point out that the light Higgs mass can be increased by
reducing the off-diagonal term in the mass matrix when tan beta is moderate,
which is about 5 to 10. As a result no mixing and/or a Higgs mixing angle of
the opposite sign arises and the branching ratio of Higgs decay is drastically
changed. This is possible in scalar sequestering scenario in which mu parameter
can be large independently of the electroweak symmetry breaking. We also
discuss the same effect in the BMSSM.
