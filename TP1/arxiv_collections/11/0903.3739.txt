We study the dynamical magnetization process in the ordered ground-state
phase of the transverse Ising model under sweeps of magnetic field with
constant velocities. In the case of very slow sweeps and for small systems
studied previously (Phys. Rev. B 56, 11761 (1997)), non-adiabatic transitions
at avoided level-crossing points give the dominant contribution to the shape of
magnetization process. In contrast, in the ordered phase of this model and for
fast sweeps, we find significant, size-independent jumps in the magnetization
process. We study this phenomenon in analogy to the spinodal decomposition in
classical ordered state and investigate its properties and its dependence on
the system parameters. An attempt to understand the magnetization dynamics
under field sweep in terms of the energy-level structure is made. We discuss a
microscopic mechanism of magnetization dynamics from a viewpoint of local
cluster flips and show that this provides a picture that explains the size
independence. The magnetization dynamics in the fast-sweep regime is studied by
perturbation theory and we introduce a perturbation scheme based on interacting
Landau-Zener type processes to describe the local cluster flip dynamics.
