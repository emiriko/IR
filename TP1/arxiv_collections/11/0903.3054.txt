We show that in weakly disordered Luttinger liquids close to a commensurate
filling the ratio of thermal conductivity kappa and electrical conductivity
sigma can deviate strongly from the Wiedemann Franz (WF) law valid for Fermi
liquids scattering from impurities. In the regime where the Umklapp scattering
rate Gamma_U is much larger than the impurity scattering rate Gamma_imp, the
Lorenz number L = (kappa/sigma T) rapidly changes from very large values, L ~
(Gamma_U/Gamma_imp) >> 1 at the commensurate point to very small values, L ~
(Gamma_imp/Gamma_U) << 1 for a slightly doped system. This surprising behavior
is a consequence of approximate symmetries existing even in the presence of
strong Umklapp scattering.
