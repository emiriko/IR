Mass segregation is observed in many star clusters, including several that
are less than a few Myr old. Timescale arguments are frequently used to argue
that these clusters must be displaying primordial segregation, because they are
too young to be dynamically relaxed. Looking at this argument from the other
side, the youth of these clusters and the limited time available to mix
spatially distinct populations of stars can provide constraints on the amount
of initial segregation that is consistent with current observations. We present
n-body experiments testing this idea, and discuss the implications of our
results for theories of star formation. For system ages less than a few
crossing times, we show that star formation scenarios predicting general
primordial mass segregation are inconsistent with observed segregation levels.
