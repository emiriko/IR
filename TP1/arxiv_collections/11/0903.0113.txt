In this talk we discuss intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) by their
amplilification of distant sources; MACHO searches have studied event times $2
h \lesssim t_0 \lesssim 2 y$ corresponding masses in the range $10^{-6}
M_{\odot} \lesssim M \lesssim 100 M_{\odot}$. We suggest that larger masses up
to $10^6 M_{\odot}$ are also of considerable interest by arguments about the
entropy of the universe. One percent by mass of dark energy can provide
ninety-nine percent of total entropy.
