The dense molecular cloud cores that form stars, like other self-gravitating
objects, undergo bulk oscillations. Just at the point of gravitational
instability, their fundamental oscillation mode has zero frequency. We study,
using perturbation theory, the evolution of a spherical cloud that possesses
such a frozen mode. We find that the cloud undergoes a prolonged epoch of
subsonic, accelerating contraction. This slow contraction occurs whether the
cloud is initially inflated or compressed by the oscillation. The subsonic
motion described here could underlie the spectral infall signature observed in
many starless dense cores.
