Significant advances in the discovery and characterization of the planetary
systems of nearby stars can be accomplished with a moderate aperture high
performance coronagraphic space mission that could be started in the next
decade. Its observations would make significant progress in studying
terrestrial planets in their habitable zones to giant planets and circumstellar
debris disks, also informing the design of a more capable future mission. It is
quite exciting that such fundamental exoplanet science can be done with
relatively modest capabilities.
