If a real value invariant of compact combinatorial manifolds (with or without
boundary) depends only on the number of simplices in each dimension on the
manifold, then the invariant is completely determined by Euler characteristics
of the manifold and its boundary. So essentially, Euler characteristic is the
unique invariant of this type.
