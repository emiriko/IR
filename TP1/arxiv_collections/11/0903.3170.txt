We extend our previous description of the superscaling phenomenon in
inclusive electron scattering within the Coherent Density Fluctuation Model
(CDFM). This model is a natural extension to finite nuclei of the Relativistic
Fermi Gas Model (RFG) within which the scaling variable $\psi^{\prime}$ was
introduced. In this work we propose a new modified CDFM approach to calculate
the total, longitudinal and transverse scaling functions built up from the
hadronic tensor and the longitudinal and transverse response functions in the
RFG. We test the superscaling behavior of the new CDFM scaling functions by
calculating the cross sections of electron scattering (in QE- and
$\Delta$-region for nuclei with $12\leq A\leq208$ at different energies and
angles) and comparing to available experimental data. The new modified CDFM
approach is extended to calculate charge-changing neutrino and antineutrino
scattering on $^{12}$C at 1 GeV incident energy.
