In this note we shall study the Witten multiple zeta function associated to
the Lie algebra so(5) defined by Matsumoto. Our main result shows that its
special values at nonnegative integers are always expressible by alternating
Euler sums. More precisely, every such special value of weight w>2 is a finite
rational linear combination of alternating Euler sums of weight w and depth at
most two, except when the only nonzero argument is one of the two last
variables in which case $\zeta(w-1)$ is needed.
