Using a static massive spherically symmetric scalar field coupled to gravity
in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) background, first we consider some
asymptotic solutions near horizon and their local equations of state(E.O.S) on
them. We show that near cosmological and event horizons our scalar field
behaves as a dust. At the next step near two pure de-Sitter or Schwarzschild
horizons we obtain a coupling dependent pressure to energy density ratio. In
the case of a minimally couplling this ratio is -1 which springs to the mind
thermodynamical behavior of dark energy. If having a negative pressure behavior
near these horizons we concluded that the coupling constant must be $\xi<{1/4}$
>. Therefore we derive a new constraint on the value of our coupling $\xi$ .
These two different behaviors of unique matter in the distinct regions of
spacetime at present era can be interpreted as a phase transition from dark
matter to dark energy in the cosmic scales and construct a unified scenario.
