This work describes the statistics for the occupation numbers of quantum
levels in a large isolated quantum system, where all possible superpositions of
eigenstates are allowed, provided all these superpositions have the same fixed
energy. Such a condition is not equivalent to the conventional micro-canonical
condition, because the latter limits the participating eigenstates to a very
narrow energy window. The statistics is obtained analytically for both the
entire system and its small subsystem. In a significant departure from the
Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, the average occupation numbers of quantum states
exhibit in the present case weak algebraic dependence on energy. In the
macroscopic limit, this dependence is routinely accompanied by the condensation
into the lowest energy quantum state. This work contains initial numerical
tests of the above statistics for finite systems, and also reports the
following numerical finding: When the basis states of large but finite random
matrix Hamiltonians are expanded in terms of eigenstates, the participation of
eigenstates in such an expansion obeys the newly obtained statistics. The above
statistics might be observable in small quantum systems, but for the
macroscopic systems, it rather reenforces doubts about self-sufficiency of
non-relativistic quantum mechanics for justifying the Boltzmann-Gibbs
equilibrium.
