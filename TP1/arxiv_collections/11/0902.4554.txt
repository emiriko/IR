Tidal friction is thought to be important in determining the long-term
spin-orbit evolution of short-period extrasolar planetary systems. Using a
simple model of the orbit-averaged effects of tidal friction Eggleton, Kiseleva
& Hut (1998), we analyse the effects of the inclusion of stellar magnetic
braking on the evolution of such systems. A phase-plane analysis of a
simplified system of equations, including only the stellar tide together with a
model of the braking torque proposed by Verbunt & Zwaan (1981), is presented.
The inclusion of stellar magnetic braking is found to be extremely important in
determining the secular evolution of such systems, and its neglect results in a
very different orbital history. We then show the results of numerical
integrations of the full tidal evolution equations, using the misaligned spin
and orbit of the XO-3 system as an example, to study the accuracy of simple
timescale estimates of tidal evolution. We find that it is essential to
consider coupled evolution of the orbit and the stellar spin in order to model
the behaviour accurately. In addition, we find that for typical Hot Jupiters
the stellar spin-orbit alignment timescale is of the same order as the inspiral
time, which tells us that if a planet is observed to be aligned, then it
probably formed coplanar. This reinforces the importance of Rossiter-McLaughlin
effect observations in determining the degree of spin-orbit alignment in
transiting systems.
