This year's SCES has proved exciting in the array of unconventional phenomena
discovered both in novel systems, and by the renewed investigation of age-old
systems, arguably in the vicinity of QCPs. From heavy fermion systems, to
cuprate superconductors, and in a new twist iron pnictide superconductors -
some questions remain: just how similar or different are correlated phenomena
in these systems? Further, how ubiquitous are ultra-strongly correlated effects
such as the fractional quantum Hall effect (QHE), and can cold atom systems
mimic such correlated phases? We shall discuss some of these issues here.
