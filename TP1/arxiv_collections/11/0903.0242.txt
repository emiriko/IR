Motivated by the recent PAMELA and ATIC results, we calculate the electron
and positron fluxes from the decay of lightest-superparticle (LSP) dark matter.
We assume that the LSP is the dominant component of dark matter, and consider
the case that the R-parity is very weakly violated so that the lifetime of the
LSP becomes of the order of 10^26 sec. We will see that, with such a choice of
the lifetime, the cosmic-ray electron and positron from the decay can be the
source of the anomalous electron and positron fluxes observed by PAMELA and
ATIC. We consider the possibilities that the LSP is the gravitino, the lightest
neutralino, and scalar neutrino, and discuss how the resultant fluxes depend on
the dark-matter model. We also discuss the fluxes of gamma-ray and anti-proton,
and show that those fluxes can be consistent with the observed value in the
parameter region where the PAMELA and ATIC anomalies are explained.
