We present the first experimental study of a new type of power recycling
microwave interferometer designed for low noise measurements. This system
enhances sensitivity to phase fluctuations in a Device Under Test, independent
of input power levels. The single sideband thermal white phase noise floor of
the system has been lowered by 8 dB (reaching -185 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset
frequency) at relatively low power levels (13 dBm).
