Reconstructing a finite set of curves from an unordered set of sample points
is a well studied topic. There has been less effort that considers how much
better the reconstruction can be if tangential information is given as well. We
show that if curves are separated from each other by a distance D, then the
sampling rate need only be O(sqrt(D)) for error-free reconstruction. For the
case of point data alone, O(D) sampling is required.
