The spectral emission of neutrinos from a plasma in nuclear statistical
equilibrium (NSE) is investigated. Particular attention is paid to the possible
emission of high energy (>10 MeV) neutrinos or antineutrinos. A newly developed
numerical approach for describing the abundances of nuclei in NSE is presented.
Neutrino emission spectra, resulting from general Fuller, Fowler, Newman (FFN)
conditions, are analyzed. Regions of T-rho-Ye space favoring detectability are
selected. The importance of critical Y_e values with zero net rate of
neutronization (Ye dot) is discussed. Results are provided for the processing
of matter under conditions typical for thermonuclear and core-collapse
supernovae, pre-supernova stars, and neutron star mergers.
