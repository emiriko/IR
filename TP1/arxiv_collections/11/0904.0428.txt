In this paper we prove some existence and regularity results concerning
parabolic equations dtu = F(D u, D2 u) + f(x,u) with some boundary conditions,
on Omega times ]0,T[, where Omega is some bounded domain which possesses the
cone property and $F$ is singular or degenerate, with some uniform ellipticity
conditions.
