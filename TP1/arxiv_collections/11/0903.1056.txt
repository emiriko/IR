An implementation of a quantum computer based on space states in double
quantum dots is discussed. There is no charge transfer in qubits during
calculation, therefore, uncontrollable entan-glement between them due to
long-range Coulomb interaction is suppressed. Other plausible sources of
decoherence caused by interaction with phonons and gates could be substantially
suppressed in the structure too. We also demonstrate how all necessary quantum
logic operations, initialization, writing, and read-out could be carried out in
the computer.
