Based on density functional calculations, we propose a possible orbital
ordering in MnV2O4 which consists of orbital chains running along
crystallographic a and b directions with orbitals rotated alternatively by
about 45 degrees within each chain. We show that the consideration of
correlation effects as implemented in the local spin density approximation
(LSDA)+U approach is crucial for a correct description of the space group
symmetry. This implies that the correlation-driven orbital ordering has a
strong influence on the structural transitions in this system. Inclusion of
spin-orbit effects does not seem to influence the orbital ordering pattern. We
further find that the proposed orbital arrangement favours a noncollinear
magnetic ordering of V spins, as observed experimentally. Exchange couplings
among V spins are also calculated and discussed.
