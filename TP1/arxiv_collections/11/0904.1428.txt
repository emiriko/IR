We obtain the affine Euler-Poincar\'e equations by standard Lagrangian
reduction and deduce the associated Clebsch-constrained variational principle.
These results are illustrated in deriving the equations of motion for continuum
spin systems and Kirchhoff's rod, where they provide a unified geometric
interpretation.
