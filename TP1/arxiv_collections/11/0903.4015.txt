We analyze recent measurements [R. Blinc, V. V. Laguta, B. Zalar, M. Itoh and
H. Krakauer, J. Phys. : Cond. Mat., v.20, 085204 (2008)] of the electric field
gradient on the oxygen site in the perovskites SrTiO3 and BaTiO3, which
revealed, in agreement with calculations, a large difference in the EFG for
these two compounds. In order to analyze the origin of this difference, we have
performed density functional electronic structure calculations within the
local-orbital scheme FPLO. Our analysis yields the counter-intuitive behavior
that the EFG increases upon lattice expansion. Applying the standard model for
perovskites, the effective two-level p-d Hamiltonian, can not explain the
observed behavior. In order to describe the EFG dependence correctly, a model
beyond this usually sufficient p-d Hamiltonian is needed. We demonstrate that
the counter-intuitive increase of the EFG upon lattice expansion can be
explained by a s-p-d model, containing the contribution of the oxygen 2s states
to the crystal field on the Ti site. The proposed model extension is of general
relevance for all related transition metal oxides with similar crystal
structure.
