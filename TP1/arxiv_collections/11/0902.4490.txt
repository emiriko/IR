We discuss the implications of assuming a four-zero Yukawa texture for the
properties of the charged Higgs boson within the context of the general 2-Higgs
Doublet Model of Type III. We begin by presenting a detailed analysis of the
charged Higgs boson couplings with heavy quarks and the resulting pattern for
its decays. The production of charged Higgs bosons is also sensitive to the
modifications of its couplings, so that we also evaluate the resulting effects
on the top decay $t \to b H^{+}$ as well as on `direct' $c\bar{b}\to H^++c. c.$
and `indirect' $q\bar q,gg\to \bar t b H^++c. c.$ production. Significant scope
exists at the Large Hadron Collider for several $H^\pm$ production and decay
channels combined to enable one to distinguish between such a model and
alternative 2-Higgs doublet scenarios.
