We derive an explicit analytic estimate for the entanglement of a large class
of bipartite quantum states which extends into bound entanglement regions. This
is done by using an efficiently computable concurrence lower bound, which is
further employed to numerically construct a volume of $3 \times 3$ bound
entangled states.
