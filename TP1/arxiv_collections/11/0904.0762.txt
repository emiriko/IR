The first 42 elements of the Allen Telescope Array (ATA-42) are beginning to
deliver data at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory in Northern California.
Scientists and engineers are actively exploiting all of the flexibility
designed into this innovative instrument for simultaneously conducting surveys
of the astrophysical sky and conducting searches for distant technological
civilizations. This paper summarizes the design elements of the ATA, the cost
savings made possible by the use of COTS components, and the cost/performance
trades that eventually enabled this first snapshot radio camera. The
fundamental scientific program of this new telescope is varied and exciting;
some of the first astronomical results will be discussed.
