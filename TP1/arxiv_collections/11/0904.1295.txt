Let f be a transcendental entire function for which the set of critical and
asymptotic values is bounded. The Denjoy-Carleman-Ahlfors theorem implies that
if the set of all z for which |f(z)|>R has N components for some R>0, then the
order of f is at least N/2. More precisely, we have log log M(r,f) > (N/2) log
r - O(1), where M(r,f) denotes the maximum modulus of f. We show that if f does
not grow much faster than this, then the escaping set and the Julia set of f
have positive Lebesgue measure. However, as soon as the order of f exceeds N/2,
this need not be true. The proof requires a sharpened form of an estimate of
Tsuji related to the Denjoy-Carleman-Ahlfors theorem.
