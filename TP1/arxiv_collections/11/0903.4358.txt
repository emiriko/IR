Sum of powers 1^p+...+n^p, with n and p being natural numbers and n>=1, can
be expressed as a polynomial function of n of degree p+1. Such representations
are often called Faulhaber formulae. A simple recursive algorithm for computing
coefficients of Faulhaber formulae is presented. The correctness of the
algorithm is proved by giving a recurrence relation on Faulhaber formulae.
