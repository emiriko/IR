Consideration was given to a model of social dynamics controlled by
successive collective decisions based on the threshold majority procedures. The
current system state is characterized by the vector of participants' capitals
(utilities). At each step, the voters can either retain their status quo or
accept the proposal which is a vector of the algebraic increments in the
capitals of the participants. In this version of the model, the vector is
generated stochastically. Comparative utility of two social attitudes--egoism
and collectivism--was analyzed. It was established that, except for some
special cases, the collectivists have advantages, which makes realizable the
following scenario: on the conditions of protecting the corporate interests, a
group is created which is joined then by the egoists attracted by its
achievements. At that, group egoism approaches altruism. Additionally, one of
the considered variants of collectivism handicaps manipulation of voting by the
organizers.
