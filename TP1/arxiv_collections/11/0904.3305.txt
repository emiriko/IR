We demonstrate the large deviation property for the mild solutions of
stochastic evolution equations with monotone nonlinearity and multiplica- tive
noise. This is achieved using the recently developed weak convergence method,
in studying the large deviation principle. An It^o-type inequality is a main
tool in the proofs. We also give two examples to illustrate the applications of
the theorems.
