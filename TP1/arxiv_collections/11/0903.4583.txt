An RD-space $\mathcal X$ is a space of homogeneous type in the sense of
Coifman and Weiss with the additional property that a reverse doubling property
holds in $\mathcal X$. In this paper, the authors first give several equivalent
characterizations of RD-spaces and show that the definitions of spaces of test
functions on $\mathcal X$ are independent of the choice of the regularity
$\epsilon\in (0,1)$; as a result of this, the Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces
on $\mathcal X$ are also independent of the choice of the underlying
distribution space. Then the authors characterize the norms of inhomogeneous
Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces by the norms of homogeneous Besov and
Triebel-Lizorkin spaces together with the norm of local Hardy spaces in the
sense of Goldberg. Also, the authors obtain the sharp locally integrability of
elements in Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces.
