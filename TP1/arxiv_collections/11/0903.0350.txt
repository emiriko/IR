The elliptic flow (v2) pattern in terms of hadron mass and transverse
momentum pT is qualitatively described for pT < 2 GeV/c by ideal hydrodynamics
in Au + Au collisions at RHIC. In addition, for pT = 2 - 6 GeV/c the measured
v2 follow a universal scaling by the number of quarks explained by quark
coalescence/recombination models. These observations suggest that a partonic
collectivity develops in the matter in early stage of heavy ion collisions.
Centrality as well as system size and energy dependence of the v2 is important
to shed light on the underlying collision dynamics in heavy ion collisions. We
present the measurements of centrality dependence of v2 at sqrt{sNN} = 200 and
62.4 GeV in Au + Au and Cu + Cu collisions for K0S, phi, Lambda, Xi and Omega
at STAR experiment. We focus on the recent Cu + Cu results and discuss the
centrality dependence of v2 as well as the number of quark scaling as a
function of transverse kinetic energy at different system size and energies. We
also discuss the eccentricity scaled v2 for identified hadrons and implications
that ideal hydrodynamical limit has not been reached at RHIC.
