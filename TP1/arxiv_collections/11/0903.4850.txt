In our preceding paper, we have proposed an algorithm for obtaining
finite-norm solutions of higher-order linear ordinary differential equations of
the Fuchsian type [\sum_m p_m (x) (d/dx)^m] f(x) = 0 (where p_m is a polynomial
with rational-number-valued coefficients), by using only the four arithmetical
operations on integers, and we proved its validity. For any nonnegative integer
k, it is guaranteed mathematically that this method can produce all the
solutions satisfying \int |f(x)|^2 (x^2+1)^k dx < \infty, under some
conditions. We materialize this algorithm in practical procedures. An
interger-type quasi-orthogonalization used there can suppress the explosion of
calculations. Moreover, we give an upper limit of the errors. We also give some
results of numerical experiments and compare them with the corresponding exact
analytical solutions, which show that the proposed algorithm is successful in
yielding solutions with high accuracy (using only arithmetical operations on
integers).
