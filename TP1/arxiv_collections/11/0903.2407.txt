The axial coupling and the magnetic moment of D*-meson or, more specifically,
the couplings g(D*Dpi) and g(D*Dgamma), encode the non-perturbative QCD effects
describing the decays D*-->Dpi and D*-->Dgamma. We compute these quantities by
means of lattice QCD with Nf=2 dynamical quarks, by employing the Wilson
("clover") action. On our finer lattice (a=0.065 fm) we obtain: g(D*Dpi)=20 +/-
2, and g(D0*D0gamma)=[2.0 +/- 0.6]/GeV. This is the first determination of
g(D0*D0gamma) on the lattice. We also provide a short phenomenological
discussion and the comparison of our result with experiment and with the
results quoted in the literature.
