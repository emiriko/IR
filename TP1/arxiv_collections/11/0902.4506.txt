We present a method of concatenated quantum error correction in which
improved classical processing is used with existing quantum codes and
fault-tolerant circuits to more reliably correct errors. Rather than correcting
each level of a concatenated code independently, our method uses information
about the likelihood of errors having occurred at lower levels to maximize the
probability of correctly interpreting error syndromes. Results of simulations
of our method applied to the [[4,1,2]] subsystem code indicate that it can
correct a number of discrete errors up to half of the distance of the
concatenated code, which is optimal.
