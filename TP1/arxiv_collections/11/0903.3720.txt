The left-right twin $Higgs$ ($LRTH$) model is a concrete realization of the
twin $Higgs$ mechanism, which predicts the existence of the top partner $T$. In
this paper, we consider production of $T$ associated with the top quark $t$ at
the high energy linear $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider ($ILC$) and the $LHC$ experiments,
and its single production in future linac-ring type $ep$ collider experiment.
To compare our results with those of the littlest $Higgs$ model with
$T$-parity, we also estimate production of the $T$-even top partner $T_{+}$ via
the corresponding processes in these high energy collider experiments. A simply
phenomenological analysis is also given.
