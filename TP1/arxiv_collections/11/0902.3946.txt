This work proposes a method for the two-dimensional simulation of Brownian
particles in a fluid with restrictions. The method is based on simple numerical
rules between two matrices. One of the matrix represent the identification of
all particles over which are adapted statistics rules for particles movement,
the results are mapped over other matrix which represent the particles
positions. The rules for the movement are established by a statistic mechanism
allowing assign random or non-random movement direction. The same probably of
movement for each direction for each time step is assumed, in order to be
agreed with the physics conditions of Brownian movement in a two dimensional
network. The root mean square displacement of all particles was calculated in a
large number of simulations, together with the translational velocity of
particles in order to compare with theoretical values of diffusion coefficient
and the validation of model. Also, the time duration for some simulations vs.
the number of particles and concentration was calculated.
