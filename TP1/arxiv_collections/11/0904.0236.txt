For the first time, we calculate the heating rate, attractive conservative
and tangential dissipative fluctuation electromagnetic forces felt by a thick
plate moving parallel to a closely spaced another plate in rest using the
retarded nonrelativistic approximation of fluctuation electrodynamics. We argue
that recently developed relativistic out of equilibrium theory of fluctuation
electromagnetic interactions (Volokitin et. al., Phys.Rev. B78, 155437 (2008))
has serious drawbacks.
