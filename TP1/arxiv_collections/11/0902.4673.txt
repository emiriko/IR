The equation describing the capacitance of capacitors is determined. It is
shown that by optimizing the material of the conducting electrodes, the
capacitance of capacitors reaching the quantum regime can be substantially
enhanced or reduced. Dielectric capacitors with negative total capacitances are
suggested and their properties analyzed. Resulting perspectives to enhance the
performance of electronic devices are discussed.
