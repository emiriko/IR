We review the subject of perfect state transfer; how one designs the (fixed)
interactions of a chain of spins so that a quantum state, initially inserted on
one end of the chain, is perfectly transferred to the opposite end in a fixed
time. The perfect state transfer systems are then used as a constructive tool
to design Hamiltonian implementations of other primitive protocols such as
entanglement generation and signal amplification in measurements, before
showing that, in fact, universal quantum computation can be implemented in this
way.
