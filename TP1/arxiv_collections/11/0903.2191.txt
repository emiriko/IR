We study numerically how the energy spreads over a finite disordered
nonlinear one-dimensional lattice, where all linear modes are exponentially
localized by disorder. We establish emergence of dynamical thermalization,
characterized as an ergodic chaotic dynamical state with a Gibbs distribution
over the modes. Our results show that the fraction of thermalizing modes is
finite and grows with the nonlinearity strength.
