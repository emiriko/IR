Ce 3d-4f resonant angle-resolved photoemission measurements on
CeCoGe$_{1.2}$Si$_{0.8}$ and CeCoSi$_{2}$ have been performed to understand the
Fermi surface topology as a function of hybridization strength between Ce 4$f$-
and conduction electrons in heavy-fermion systems. We directly observe that the
hole-like Ce 4$f$-Fermi surfaces of CeCoSi$_{2}$ is smaller than that of
CeCoGe$_{1.2}$Si$_{0.8}$, indicating the evolution of the Ce 4$f$-Fermi surface
with the increase of the hybridization strength. In comparision with LDA
calculation, the Fermi surface variation cannot be understood even though the
overall electronic structure are roughly explained, indicating the importance
of strong correlation effects. We also discuss the relation between the Ce
4$f$-Fermi surface variation and the Kondo peaks.
