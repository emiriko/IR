We demonstrate the conditional reversal of a weak (partial-collapse) quantum
measurement on a photonic qubit. The weak quantum measurement causes a
nonunitary transformation of a qubit which is subsequently reversed to the
original state after a successful reversing operation. Both the weak
measurement and the reversal operation are implemented linear optically. The
state recovery fidelity, determined by quantum process tomography, is shown to
be over 94% for partial-collapse strength up to 0.9. We also experimentally
study information gain due to the weak measurement and discuss the role of the
reversing operation as an information erasure.
