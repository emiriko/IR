Modern theoretical models strongly suggest that new phenomena await discovery
above the energy scale of the Standard Model (SM) of particle interactions. In
this paper we argue that correct description of particle physics in the TeV
energy scale needs to account for degrees of freedom obeying the conformal (or
scale) invariance. In this respect, the existing of Georgi's unparticles is
strongly argued. We present the gauge model of scalar unparticles. The ground
state of scalar unparticles in the continuum is restricted by the vacuum
expectation value of the SM Higgs boson and the scale dimension $d$. In the
framework of Abelian gauge field theories we develop a model in
four-dimensional space-time in which the scalar unHiggs is a dipole field. The
quantization is performed within the canonical formalism. Based on general
principles of quantum field theory the new features of unHiggs propagators are
carried out for the first time.
