Two-dimensional numerical simulations of the effect of background turbulence
on 2D resistive magnetic reconnection are presented. For sufficiently small
values of the resistivity ($\eta$) and moderate values of the turbulent power
($\epsilon$), the reconnection rate is found to have a much weaker dependence
on $\eta$ than the Sweet-Parker scaling of $\eta^{1/2}$ and is even consistent
with an $\eta-$independent value. For a given value of $\eta$, the dependence
of the reconnection rate on the turbulent power exhibits a critical threshold
in $\epsilon$ above which the reconnection rate is significantly enhanced.
