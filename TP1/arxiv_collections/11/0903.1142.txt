A solid-state analogue of Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage can be
implemented in a triple well solid-state system to coherently transport an
electron across the wells with exponentially suppressed occupation in the
central well at any point of time. Termed coherent tunneling adiabatic passage
(CTAP), this method provides a robust way to transfer quantum information
encoded in the electronic spin across a chain of quantum dots or donors. Using
large scale atomistic tight-binding simulations involving over 3.5 million
atoms, we verify the existence of a CTAP pathway in a realistic solid-state
system: gated triple donors in silicon. Realistic gate profiles from commercial
tools were combined with tight-binding methods to simulate gate control of the
donor to donor tunnel barriers in the presence of cross-talk. As CTAP is an
adiabatic protocol, it can be analyzed by solving the time independent problem
at various stages of the pulse - justifying the use of time-independent
tight-binding methods to this problem. Our results show that a three donor CTAP
transfer, with inter-donor spacing of 15 nm can occur on timescales greater
than 23 ps, well within experimentally accessible regimes. The method not only
provides a tool to guide future CTAP experiments, but also illuminates the
possibility of system engineering to enhance control and transfer times.
