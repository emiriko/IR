Understanding the ability to measure and discriminate particle events at the
lowest possible energy is an essential requirement in developing new
experiments to search for weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark
matter. In this paper we detail an assessment of the potential sensitivity
below 10 keV in the 1 m^3 DRIFT-II directionally sensitive, low pressure,
negative ion time projection chamber (NITPC), based on event-by-event track
reconstruction and calorimetry in the multiwire proportional chamber (MWPC)
readout. By application of a digital smoothing polynomial it is shown that the
detector is sensitive to sulfur and carbon recoils down to 2.9 and 1.9 keV
respectively, and 1.2 keV for electron induced events. The energy sensitivity
is demonstrated through the 5.9 keV gamma spectrum of 55Fe, where the energy
resolution is sufficient to identify the escape peak. The effect a lower energy
sensitivity on the WIMP exclusion limit is demonstrated. In addition to recoil
direction reconstruction for WIMP searches this sensitivity suggests new
prospects for applications also in KK axion searches.
