In this letter we study the observed distributions of rotational velocity in
a sample of more than 16,000 nearby F and G dwarf stars, magnitude complete and
presenting high precision $Vsin i$ measurements. We show that the velocity
distributions cannot be fitted by a maxwellian. On the other hand, an analysis
based on both Tsallis and Kaniadakis power-law statistics is by far the most
appropriate statistics and give a very good fit. It is also shown that single
and binary stars have similar rotational distributions. This is the first time,
to our knowledge, that these two new statistics are tested for the rotation of
such a large sample of stars, pointing solidly to a solution of the puzzling
problem on the function governing the distribution of stellar rotational
velocity
