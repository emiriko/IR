Strong magnetic fields modify particle motion in the curved space-time of
spinning black holes and change the stability conditions of circular orbits. We
study conditions for magnetocentrifugal jet launching from accretion disks
around black holes, whereby large scale black hole lines anchored in the disk
may fling tenuous coronal gas outward. For a Schwarzschild black hole,
magnetocentrifugal launching requires that the poloidal component of magnetic
fields makes an angle less than $60^\circ$ to the outward direction at the disk
surface, similar to the Newtonian case. For prograde rotating disks around Kerr
black holes, this angle increases and becomes $90^\circ$ for footpoints
anchored to the disk near the horizon of a critically spinning $a=M$ black
hole. Thus, a disk around a critically spinning black hole may centrifugally
launch a jet even along the rotation axis.
