Crisis response is a critical area of research, with encouraging progress in
the past view yeas. The aim of the research is to contribute to building future
crisis environment where software agents, robots, responders, crisis managers,
and crisis organizations interact to provide advice, protection and aid. This
paper discusses the crisis response domain requirements, and provides analysis
of five crisis response systems namely: DrillSim [2], DEFACTO [15], ALADDIN
[1], RoboCup Rescue [18], and FireGrid [3]. Analysis of systems includes
systems architecture and methodology. In addition, we identified features and
limitations of systems based on crisis response domain requirements.
