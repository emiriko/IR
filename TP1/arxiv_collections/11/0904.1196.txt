Heterogeneous photocatalysis is an interesting alternative for the
purification, decontamination and smell abatment of air. In the present work,
the photocatalytic oxidation of 2-butanone (MEK : methyl ethyle ketone) is
investigated, this low molecular mass product being the source of serious smell
pollution. The influence of light and of the pollutant concentration were
investigated in an annular photoreactor. As most VOC's, the degradation rate of
MEK follows a Langmuir-Hinshelwood type law. Intermediate products were
analysed by GC-MD ; acetaldehyde is the dominant byproduct of the
photocatalytic oxidation.
