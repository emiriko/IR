Electrodynamics of rotating systems is expected to exhibit novel nonlocal
features that come about when acceleration-induced nonlocality is introduced
into the special relativity theory in conformity with the Bohr-Rosenfeld
principle. The implications of nonlocality for the amplitude and frequency of
electromagnetic radiation received by uniformly rotating observers are
investigated.
