Some recent experimental studies show the invisibility of antiferromagnetic
transition in the cases of manganites when their particle size is reduced to
nanometer scale. In complete contrast to these cases, we have observed the
signature of antiferromagnetic transition in the magnetocaloric properties of
nanocrystalline La$_{0.125}$Ca$_{0.875}$MnO$_{3}$ of average particle size 70
and 60 nm similar to its polycrystalline bulk form. The system exhibit inverse
magnetocaloric effect in its polycrystalline and nanocrystalline form. An extra
ferromagnetic phase is stabilized at low temperature for the sample with
particle size $\sim 60$ nm.
