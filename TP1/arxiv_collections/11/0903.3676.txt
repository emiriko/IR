A new Combinatorial Ricci curvature and Laplacian operators for grayscale
images are introduced and tested on 2D synthetic, natural and medical images.
Analogue formulae for voxels are also obtained. These notions are based upon
more general concepts developed by R. Forman. Further applications, in
particular a fitting Ricci flow, are discussed.
