Temperature dependence of thermoelectric power S(T) of three differently
processed Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (Bi2212) samples, viz. as-processed melt quenched
(Bi2212-MQ), 6000C N2-annealed (Bi2212-N2) and 6000C O2-annealed (Bi2212-O2) is
reported here. All the samples possess single-phase character and their
superconducting transition temperatures (TcR=0) are 85 K, 90 K and 72 K
respectively for Bi2212-MQ, Bi2212-N2 and Bi2212-O2. While Bi2212-MQ and
Bi2212-N2 samples are in near optimum doping regime, Bi2212-O2 is an over-doped
sample. TcS=0 values obtained through S(T) data are also in line with those
deduced from the temperature dependence of resistance and DC magnetization.
Interestingly, S(T) behaviour of the optimally-doped Bi2212-MQ and Bi2212-N2
samples is seen to be positive in whole temperature range, it is found negative
for the over-doped Bi2212-O2 sample above TcS=0. These results have been seen
in the light of the recent band structure calculations and the ensuing split
Fermi surface as determined by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy
(ARPES).
