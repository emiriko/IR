The interaction between the bacterial S-protein SbpA on different types of
lipid membranes has been studied using atomic force microscopy, transmission
electron microscopy, and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation. On one
hand, It has been found that the bacterial forms two dimensional nanocrystals
on zwitterionic DOPC bilayers and negatively charged DMPG vesicles adsorbed on
mica, on zwitterionic DPPC and charged DPPC/DMPG (1:1) monolayers adsorbed on
carbon grids. On the other hand, SbpA protein adsorption took place on
zwitterionic DOPC bilayers and DOPC/DOPS (4:1) bilayers, previously adsorbed on
silicon supports. SbpA adsorption also took place on DPPC/DOPS (1:1) monolayers
adsorbed on carbon grids. Finally, neither SbpA adsorption, nor
recrystallization was observed on zwitterionic DMPC vesicles (previously
adsorbed on polyelectrolyte multilayers), and on DPPC vesicles supported on
silicon.
