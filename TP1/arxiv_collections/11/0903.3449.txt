The cosmic no hair conjecture is tested for a large class of inhomogeneous
cosmologies with a positive cosmological constant. Firstly, we derive a new
class of exact inhomogeneous cosmological solutions whose matter content of the
models is formed by a mixture of two interacting simple fluids plus a
cosmological Lambda-term. These models generalize the de Sitter spacetime and
the inhomogeneous two-fluid Szekeres-type cosmologies derived by Lima and
Tiomno. Finally, we show that the late time behaviour of our solutions is in
agreement with the "cosmic no hair theorem" of Hawking and Moss.
