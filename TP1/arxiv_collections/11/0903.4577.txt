Inspired by a paper of R. W. Rosenthal, we investigate generalized
Nash-equilibria of integer programming games. We show that generalized
Nash-equilibria always exist and are related to an optimal solution of a
so-called N-fold integer program. This link allows us to establish some
polynomial time complexity results about solving this optimization problem and
its inverse counter-part.
