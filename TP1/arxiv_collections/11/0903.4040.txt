We study N=1 global and local supersymmetric theories with a continuous
global U(1)_R symmetry. We discuss conditions for supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking
and vacuum structures of R-symmetric SUSY models. Especially we find the
conditions for R-symmetry breaking and runway vacua in global supersymmetric
theories. We introduce explicit R-symmetry breaking terms into such models in
global and local supersymmetric theories. We classify explicit R-symmetry
breaking terms by the structure of newly appeared SUSY stationary points as a
consequence of the R-breaking effect. Based on the generic argument, we propose
the scenario that conformal dynamics causes approximate R-symmetry and
metastable SUSY breaking vacua at a low energy scale. Furthermore, we find that
conformal dynamics also leads approximate R-symmetry in softly SUSY breaking
theories, even in more complicated models such as the duality cascade. We
investigate the RG flow of SUSY breaking terms as well as supersymmetric
couplings in the duality cascade of softly broken supersymmetric theories. We
also show the possibility that cascading would be terminated by the gauge
symmetry breaking, which is induced by the so-called B-term. Finally, we find
some models to arrive at standard-model-like models and to cause gauge symmetry
breaking corresponding to electro-weak symmetry breaking.
