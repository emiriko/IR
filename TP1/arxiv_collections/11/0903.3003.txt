The paper examines the geometrical properties of a six-dimensional
Kaluza-Klein type model. They may have an impact on the model of the structure
of a neutron and its excited states in the realm of one particle physics. The
statistical reason for the six-dimensionality and the stability of the solution
is given. The derivation of the weak limit approximation of the general wave
mechanical (quantum mechanical) approach, defined in the context of losing its
self-consistency (here gravitational), is presented. The non self-consistent
case for the Klein-Gordon equation is defined. The derivation of the energy of
states and the analysis of the spin origin of the analyzed fields configuration
is presented as the manifestation of both the geometry of the internal
two-dimensional space and kinematics of fields inside it. The problem of the
departure from the (gravitational) self-consistent calculations of the metric
tensor and of other fields of the configuration is discussed. The
implementation of the model for the description of a neutron and its excited
states, including their spins and energies, is given. The informational reason
for the existence of the internal extra space dimensions is proposed.
