Hydrodynamical simulations of jets interacting with clouds moving in the
ambient medium of the host galaxy are presented. Clouds with sizes of the order
of the jet diameter and smaller, crossing the path of the jet with different
speeds are considered. In the case of slow moving clouds the jet is stopped
over the brief period of time taken by the cloud to cross the jet. The jet
maintains its general morphology in the case of fast moving clouds. Erosion of
the clouds leads to redistribution of cloud material to large distances. Such
interaction may explain the large outflow velocities observed from pc to kpc
scales in the compact radio sources.
