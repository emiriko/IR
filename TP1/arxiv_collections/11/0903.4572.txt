The inclusive light hadronic decays of 1D_2 heavy quarkonia are studied
within the framework of NRQCD at the leading order in $v$ and up to the order
of $\alpha_s^3$. With one-loop QCD corrections, the infrared divergences and
Coulomb singularities in the decay amplitudes are proved to be absorbed by the
renormalization of the matrix elements of corresponding NRQCD operators, and
the infrared finite short-distance coefficients are obtained through the
matching calculations. By taking the factorization scale to be 2m_Q, the light
hadronic decay widths are estimated to be about 274, 4.7, and 8.8 KeV for the
$\eta_{c2}, \eta_{b2}$, and $\eta_{b2}'$ respectively. Based on the above
estimates, and using the E1 transition width and dipion transition width for
the $\eta_{c2}$ estimated elsewhere, we get the total width of $\eta_{c2}$ to
be about 660-810 KeV, and the branching ratio of the E1 transition
$\eta_{c2}\to\gamma h_c$ to be about (44-54)%, which will be useful in
searching for this missing charmonium state through, e.g., the process
$\eta_{c2}\to\gamma h_c$ followed by $h_c\to\gamma\eta_c$.
