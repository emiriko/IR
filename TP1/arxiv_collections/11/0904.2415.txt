We study soliton dynamics in a system of two linearly coupled discrete
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, which describe the dynamics of a
two-component Bose gas, coupled by an electromagnetic field, and confined in a
strong optical lattice. When the nonlinear coupling strengths are equal, we use
a unitary transformation to remove the linear coupling terms, and show that the
existing soliton solutions oscillate from one species to the other. When the
nonlinear coupling strengths are different, the soliton dynamics is numerically
investigated and the findings are compared to the results of an effective
two-mode model. The case of two linearly coupled Ablowitz-Ladik equations is
also investigated.
