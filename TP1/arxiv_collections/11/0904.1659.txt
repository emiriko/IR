We prove the global existence and uniqueness of the classical (weak) solution
for the 2D or 3D compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a density-dependent
viscosity coefficient ($\lambda=\lambda(\rho)$). Initial data and solutions are
only small in the energy-norm. We also give a description of the large time
behavior of the solution. Then, we study the propagation of singularities in
solutions. We obtain that if there is a vacuum domain at initially, then the
vacuum domain will exists for all time, and vanishes as time goes to infinity.
