We study the elusive transition from exponential to post-exponential
(algebraic) decay of the probability density of a quantum particle emitted by
an exponentially decaying source, in one dimension. The main finding is that
the probability density at the transition time, and thus its observability,
increases with the distance of the detector from the source, up to a critical
distance beyond which exponential decay is no longer observed. Solvable models
provide explicit expressions for the dependence of the transition on resonance
and observational parameters, facilitating the choice of optimal conditions.
