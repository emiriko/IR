We compute the complete set of Feynman Rules producing the Rational Terms of
kind R_2 needed to perform any QCD 1-loop calculation. We also explicitly check
that in order to account for the entire R_2 contribution, even in case of
processes with more than four external legs, only up to four-point vertices are
needed. Our results are expressed both in the 't Hooft Veltman regularization
scheme and in the Four Dimensional Helicity scheme, using explicit color
configurations as well as the color connection language.
