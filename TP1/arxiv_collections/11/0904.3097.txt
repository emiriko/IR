We study the groundstates of cold atomic gases on rotating optical lattices,
as described by the Bose-Hubbard model in a uniform effective magnetic field.
Mapping the bosons to composite fermions leads to the prediction of quantum
Hall fluids that have no counterpart in the continuum. We construct trial
wavefunctions for these phases, and perform numerical tests of the predictions
of the composite fermion model. Our results establish the existence of strongly
correlated phases beyond those in the continuum limit, and provide evidence for
a wider scope of the composite fermion approach beyond its application to the
lowest Landau-level.
