These notes are loosely based on lectures given at the CERN Winter School on
Supergravity, Strings and Gauge theories, February 2009 and at the IPM String
School in Tehran, April 2009. I have focused on a few concrete topics and also
on addressing questions that have arisen repeatedly. Background condensed
matter physics material is included as motivation and easy reference for the
high energy physics community. The discussion of holographic techniques
progresses from equilibrium, to transport and to superconductivity.
