We compare two combinatorial definitions of parabolic sets of roots. We show
that these definitions are equivalent for simple finite dimensional Lie
algebras, affine Lie algebras, and toroidal Lie algebras. In contrast, these
definitions are not always equivalent for simple finite dimensional Lie
superalgebras.
