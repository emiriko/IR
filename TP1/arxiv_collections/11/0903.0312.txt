The dynamics of two groups of molecular motors pulling in opposite directions
on a rigid filament is studied theoretically. To this end we first consider the
behavior of one set of motors pulling in a single direction against an external
force using a new mean-field approach. Based on these results we analyze a
similar setup with two sets of motors pulling in opposite directions in a
tug-of-war in the presence of an external force. In both cases we find that the
interplay of fluid friction and protein friction leads to a complex phase
diagram where the force-velocity relations can exhibit regions of bistability
and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Finally, motivated by recent work, we turn
to the case of motility assay experiments where motors bound to a surface push
on a bundle of filaments. We find that, depending on the absence or the
presence of a bistability in the force-velocity curve at zero force, the bundle
exhibits anomalous or biased diffusion on long-time and large-length scales.
