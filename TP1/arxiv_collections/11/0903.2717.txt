We report experimental results on unidirectional traffic-like collective
movement of ants on trails. Our work is primarily motivated by fundamental
questions on the collective spatio-temporal organization in systems of
interacting motile constituents driven far from equilibrium. Making use of the
analogies with vehicular traffic, we analyze our experimental data for the
spatio-temporal organisation of the ants on the trail. From this analysis, we
extract the flow-density relation as well as the distributions of velocities of
the ants and distance-headways. Some of our observations are consistent with
our earlier models of ant-traffic, which are appropriate extensions of the
asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP). In sharp contrast to highway
traffic and most other transport processes, the average velocity of the ants is
almost independent of their density on the trail. Consequently, no jammed phase
is observed.
