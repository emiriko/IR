Spin-exchange relaxation free alkali-metal magnetometers typically operate in
the regime of high optical density, presenting challenges for simple and
efficient optical pumping and detection. We describe a high-sensitivity Rb
magnetometer using a single elliptically-polarized off-resonant laser beam.
Circular component of the light creates relatively uniform spin polarization
while the linear component is used to measure optical rotation generated by the
atoms. Modulation of the atomic spin direction with an oscillating magnetic
field shifts the detected signal to high frequencies. Using a fiber-coupled DFB
laser we achieve magnetic field sensitivity of 7 fT/$\sqrt{% \mathrm{Hz}}$ with
a miniature $5\times5\times5$ mm Rb vapor cell.
