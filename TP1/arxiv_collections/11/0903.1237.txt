The magnetization of heavy holes in III-V semiconductor quantum wells with
Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in an external perpendicular magnetic field is
theoretically studied. We concentrate on the effects on the magnetization
induced by the system boundary, the Rashba SOC and the temperature. It is found
that the sawtooth-like de Haas--van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations of the
magnetization will change dramatically in the presence of such three factors.
Especially, the effects of the edge states and Rashba SOC on the magnetization
are more evident when the magnetic field is more small. The oscillation center
will shift when the boundary effect is considered and the Rashba SOC will bring
beating patterns to the dHvA oscillations. These effects on the dHvA
oscillations are preferred to be observed at low temperature. With increasing
the temperature, the dHvA oscillations turn to be blurred and eventually
disappear.
