Any moduli space of representations of a quiver (possibly with oriented
cycles) has an embedding as a dense open subvariety into a moduli space of
representations of a bipartite quiver having the same type of singularities. A
connected quiver is Dynkin or extended Dynkin if and only if all moduli spaces
of its representations are smooth.
