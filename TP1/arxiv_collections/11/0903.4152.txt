We apply population synthesis techniques to calculate the present day
population of post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs) for a range of theoretical
models describing the common envelope (CE) phase. Adopting the canonical energy
budget approach we consider models where the ejection efficiency,
$\alpha_{\rmn{CE}}$ is either a constant, or a function of the secondary mass.
We obtain the envelope binding energy from detailed stellar models of the
progenitor primary, with and without the thermal and ionization energy, but we
also test a commonly used analytical scaling. We also employ the alternative
angular momentum budget approach, known as the $\gamma$-algorithm. We find that
a constant, global value of $\alpha_{\rmn{CE}} \ga 0.1$ can adequately account
for the observed population of PCEBs with late spectral-type secondaries.
However, this prescription fails to reproduce IK Pegasi, which has a secondary
with spectral type A8. We can account for IK Pegasi if we include thermal and
ionization energy of the giant's envelope, or if we use the $\gamma$-algorithm.
However, the $\gamma$-algorithm predicts local space densities that are 1 to 2
orders of magnitude greater than estimates from observations. In contrast, the
canonical energy budget prescription with an initial mass ratio distribution
that favours unequal initial mass ratios gives a local space density which is
in good agreement with observations, and best reproduces the observed
distribution of PCEBs. Finally, all models fail to reproduce the sharp decline
for orbital periods, $P_{\rmn{orb}} \ga 1$ d in the orbital period distribution
of observed PCEBs, even if we take into account selection effects against
systems with long orbital periods and early spectral-type secondaries.
