The exclusive photoproduction reaction gamma p --> Upsilon p has been studied
with the ZEUS experiment in ep collisions at HERA using an integrated
luminosity of 468 pb^{-1}. The measurement covers the kinematic range 60<W<220
GeV and Q^2<1 GeV^2, where W is the photon-proton centre-of-mass energy and Q^2
is the photon virtuality. These results, which represent the analysis of the
full ZEUS data sample for this channel, are compared to predictions based on
perturbative QCD.
