The electrical conductivity of disordered insulator-conductor composites have
been studied for more than thirty years. In spite of this some properties of dc
bulk conductivity of composites still remain incompletely understood. We
present a brief review of the most significant theories that have been proposed
to study the critical insulator-conductor transition comparing their
predictions with many experimental results.
