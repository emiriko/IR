The origin and evolution of the magnetic helicity in the solar corona are not
well understood. For instance, the magnetic helicity of an active region is
often about $10^{42}$ Mx$^2$ ($10^{26}$ Wb$^{2}$), but the observed processes
whereby it is thought to be injected into the corona do not yet provide an
accurate estimate of the resulting magnetic helicity budget or time evolution.
The variation in magnetic helicity is important for understanding the physics
of flares, coronal mass ejections, and their associated magnetic clouds. To
shed light on this topic, we investigate here the changes in magnetic helicity
due to electric currents in the corona for a single twisted flux tube that may
model characteristic coronal structures such as active region filaments,
sigmoids, or coronal loops. For a bipolar photospheric magnetic field and
several distributions of current, we extrapolated the coronal field as a
nonlinear force-free field. We then computed the relative magnetic helicity, as
well as the self and mutual helicities. Starting from a magnetic configuration
with a moderate amount of current, the amount of magnetic helicity can increase
by 2 orders of magnitude when the maximum current strength is increased by a
factor of 2. The high sensitivity of magnetic helicity to the current density
can partially explain discrepancies between measured values on the photosphere,
in the corona, and in magnetic clouds. Our conclusion is that the magnetic
helicity strongly depends on both the strength of the current density and also
on its distribution. Only improved measurements of current density at the
photospheric level will advance our knowledge of the magnetic helicity content
in the solar atmosphere.
