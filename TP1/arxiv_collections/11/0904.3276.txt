It has been suggested recently to study the dynamics of a gravitating gluon
condensate q in the context of a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
universe. The expansion of the Universe (or, more generally, the presence of a
nonvanishing Ricci curvature scalar R) perturbs the gluon condensate and may
induce a nonanalytic term \tilde{h}(R,q) in the effective gravitational action.
The aim of this article is to explore the cosmological implications of a
particular nonanalytic term \tilde{h} \propto \eta |R|^{1/2} |q|^{3/4}. With a
quadratic approximation of the gravitating gluon-condensate vacuum energy
density \rho_{V}(q) near the equilibrium value q_{0} and a small coupling
constant \eta of the modified-gravity term \tilde{h}, an "accelerating
universe" is obtained which resembles the present Universe, both qualitatively
and quantitatively. The unknown component X of this model universe (here,
primarily due to modified-gravity effects) has an effective equation-of-state
parameter \bar{w}_{X} which is found to evolve toward the value -1 from above.
