We outline scientific objectives for monitoring X-ray sources and transients
with wide-angle, coded mask cameras. It is now possible to instantaneously view
half of the sky over long time intervals, gaining access to events of
extraordinary interest. Solid state detectors can raise the quality of data
products for bright sources to levels associated with pointed instruments.
There are diverse ways to advance high energy astrophysics and quantitative
applications for general relativity.
