We demonstrate that the anisotropy R of the paramagnetic spin fluctuations
grows toward Tc at 75As sites in the optimally electron-doped superconductor
Ba[(Fe0.92Co0.08)2]2As2, with stronger spin fluctuations along the c-axis. Our
finding is in remarkable contrast with the case of high T$_c$ cuprates, where R
is independent of temperature above Tc.
