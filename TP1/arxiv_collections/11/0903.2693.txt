The DNA cryptography is a new and very promising direction in cryptography
research. DNA can be used in cryptography for storing and transmitting the
information, as well as for computation. Although in its primitive stage, DNA
cryptography is shown to be very effective. Currently, several DNA computing
algorithms are proposed for quite some cryptography, cryptanalysis and
steganography problems, and they are very powerful in these areas. However, the
use of the DNA as a means of cryptography has high tech lab requirements and
computational limitations, as well as the labor intensive extrapolation means
so far. These make the efficient use of DNA cryptography difficult in the
security world now. Therefore, more theoretical analysis should be performed
before its real applications.
  In this project, We do not intended to utilize real DNA to perform the
cryptography process; rather, We will introduce a new cryptography method based
on central dogma of molecular biology. Since this method simulates some
critical processes in central dogma, it is a pseudo DNA cryptography method.
The theoretical analysis and experiments show this method to be efficient in
computation, storage and transmission; and it is very powerful against certain
attacks. Thus, this method can be of many uses in cryptography, such as an
enhancement insecurity and speed to the other cryptography methods. There are
also extensions and variations to this method, which have enhanced security,
effectiveness and applicability.
