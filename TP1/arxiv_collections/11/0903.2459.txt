We study transport of local magnetization in a Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain at
zero temperature. The system is initially prepared in a highly excited pure
state far from equilibrium and its evolution is analyzed via exact
diagonalization. Integrable and non-integrable regimes are obtained by
adjusting the parameters of the Hamiltonian, which allows for the comparison of
transport behaviors in both limits. In the presence of nearest neighbor
interactions only, the transport behavior in the integrable clean system
contrasts with the chaotic chain with on-site defects, oscillations in the
first suggesting ballistic transport and a fast decay in the latter indicating
diffusive transport. The results for a non-integrable system with frustration
are less conclusive, similarities with the integrable chain being verified. We
also show how methods of quantum control may be applied to chaotic systems to
induce a desired transport behavior, such as that of an integrable system.
