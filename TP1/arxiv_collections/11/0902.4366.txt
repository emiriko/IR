Let $n$ be a positive integer and $\alpha_n$ be the arithmetic function which
assigns the multiplicative order of $a^n$ modulo $n$ to every integer $a$
coprime to $n$ and vanishes elsewhere. Similarly, let $\beta_n$ assign the
projective multiplicative order of $a^n$ modulo $n$ to every integer $a$
coprime to $n$ and vanishes elsewhere. In this paper, we present a study of
these two arithmetic functions. In particular, we prove that for positive
integers $n_1$ and $n_2$ with the same square-free part, there exists an exact
relationship between the functions $\alpha_{n_1}$ and $\alpha_{n_2}$ and
between the functions $\beta_{n_1}$ and $\beta_{n_2}$. This allows us to reduce
the determination of $\alpha_n$ and $\beta_n$ to the case where $n$ is
square-free. These arithmetic functions recently appeared in the context of an
old problem of Molluzzo, and more precisely in the study of which arithmetic
progressions yield a balanced Steinhaus triangle in $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$
for $n$ odd.
