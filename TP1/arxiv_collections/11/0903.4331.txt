Various methods to control the influence of a covariate on a response
variable are compared. In particular, ANOVA with or without homogeneity of
variances (HOV) of errors and Kruskal-Wallis (K-W) tests on covariate-adjusted
residuals and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) are compared. Covariate-adjusted
residuals are obtained from the overall regression line fit to the entire data
set ignoring the treatment levels. It is demonstrated that the methods on
covariate-adjusted residuals are only appropriate when the regression lines are
parallel and means are equal for treatment factors. Empirical size and power
performance of the methods are compared by extensive Monte Carlo simulations.
We manipulated the conditions such as assumptions of normality and HOV, sample
size, and clustering of the covariates. Guidelines on which method to use for
various cases are also provided.
