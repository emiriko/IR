The analysis of shape transitions in Nd isotopes, based on the framework of
relativistic energy density functionals and restricted to axially symmetric
shapes in Ref. \cite{PRL99}, is extended to the region $Z = 60$, 62, 64 with $N
\approx 90$, and includes both $\beta$ and $\gamma$ deformations. Collective
excitation spectra and transition probabilities are calculated starting from a
five-dimensional Hamiltonian for quadrupole vibrational and rotational degrees
of freedom, with parameters determined by constrained self-consistent
relativistic mean-field calculations for triaxial shapes. The results reproduce
available data, and show that there is an abrupt change of structure at N=90
that can be approximately characterized by the X(5) analytic solution at the
critical point of the first-order quantum phase transition between spherical
and axially deformed shapes.
