The dynamics of sheared inelastic-hard-sphere systems are studied using
non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and direct simulation Monte
Carlo. In the molecular dynamics simulations Lees-Edwards boundary conditions
are used to impose the shear. The dimensions of the simulation box are chosen
to ensure that the systems are homogeneous and that the shear is applied
uniformly. Various system properties are monitored, including the one-particle
velocity distribution, granular temperature, stress tensor, collision rates,
and time between collisions. The one-particle velocity distribution is found to
agree reasonably well with an anisotropic Gaussian distribution, with only a
slight overpopulation of the high velocity tails. The velocity distribution is
strongly anisotropic, especially at lower densities and lower values of the
coefficient of restitution, with the largest variance in the direction of
shear. The density dependence of the compressibility factor of the sheared
inelastic hard sphere system is quite similar to that of elastic hard sphere
fluids. As the systems become more inelastic, the glancing collisions begin to
dominate more direct, head-on collisions. Examination of the distribution of
the time between collisions indicates that the collisions experienced by the
particles are strongly correlated in the highly inelastic systems. A comparison
of the simulation data is made with DSMC simulation of the Enskog equation.
Results of the kinetic model of Montanero et al. {[}Montanero et al., J. Fluid
Mech. 389, 391 (1999){]} based on the Enskog equation are also included. In
general, good agreement is found for high density, weakly inelastic systems.
