We report on the fabrication and electrical characterization of few-layer
graphene (FLG) devices coated with a ferroelectric polymer layer of
poly(vinylidene fluoride/trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF/TrFE)]. Highly stable and
reliable resistance changes were observed under floating conditions, which were
dependent on the back gate voltage applied beforehand. Nonvolatile memory
functionality in the hybrid FLG-P(VDF/TrFE) devices is attributed to a remanent
electric field induced by the ferroelectric polarization of the P(VDF/TrFE)
layer.
