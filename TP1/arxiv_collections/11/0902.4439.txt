Using a new ansatz for solving the Einstein equations with a scalar field
with the sign of the kinetic term inverted, I find a series of formulae to
derive axial symmetric stationary exact solutions of the Phantom scalar field
in general relativity. We focus on the solutions which represent wormholes. The
procedure presented in this work allows to derive new exact solutions up to
very simple integrations. Among other results, I find exact rotating solutions
containing magnetic monopoles, dipoles, etc., coupled to Phantom scalar and to
gravitational multipole fields.
