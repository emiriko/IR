Data on stopping in intermediate-energy central heavy-ion collisions are
analyzed following transport theory based on the Boltzmann equation. In
consequence, values of nuclear shear viscosity are inferred. The inferred
values are significantly larger than obtained for free nucleon dispersion
relations and free nucleon-nucleon cross sections.
