There exist some boundary-driven open systems with diffusive dynamics whose
particle current fluctuations exhibit universal features that belong to the
Edwards-Wilkinson universality class. We achieve this result by establishing a
mapping, for the system's fluctuations, to an equivalent open --yet
equilibrium-- diffusive system. We discuss the possibility of observing dynamic
phase transitions using the particle current as a control parameter.
