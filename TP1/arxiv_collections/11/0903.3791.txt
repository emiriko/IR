A basic problem of quantum communication is to generate entangled states
between distant sites. Using entanglement swapping, we are able to generate an
entangled state of the desired distance from connecting many short distance
entangled states. We investigate the entanglement swapping of the Valence-Bond
Solid state with un-identical local filtering operations. It is found that not
only a long distance entangled state can be generated from the VBS state, but
also there is a trade-off between the probability and the degree of the
entanglement in the resultant state. The results are also generalized to higher
dimensional cases.
