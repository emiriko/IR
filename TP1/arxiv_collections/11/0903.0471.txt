We study the CardPath constraint. This ensures a given constraint holds a
number of times down a sequence of variables. We show that SLIDE, a special
case of CardPath where the slid constraint must hold always, can be used to
encode a wide range of sliding sequence constraints including CardPath itself.
We consider how to propagate SLIDE and provide a complete propagator for
CardPath. Since propagation is NP-hard in general, we identify special cases
where propagation takes polynomial time. Our experiments demonstrate that using
SLIDE to encode global constraints can be as efficient and effective as
specialised propagators.
