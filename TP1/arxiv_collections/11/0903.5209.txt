In recent years light-front quantisation has been extended to allow for a
consistent treatment of systems at finite temperature and density. This is in
particular interesting for an investigation of the processes in nuclear matter
under extreme condition as occurring, e.g., during a heavy ion collision.
Utilising a Dyson expansion to the N-point Green functions at finite
temperature and density we focus on the occurrence of pionic and scalar diquark
dynamics in quark matter and compute the masses and the Mott dissociation using
a separable t-matrix approach. For the scalar quark-quark correlation we
determine the critical temperature of colour superconductivity using the
Thouless criterion. On the same footing the properties of the nucleon in a
medium of quark matter are computed within a Faddeev approach. Critical lines
for nucleon breakup are given. Presently, we use a light-front
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model that allows us to compare these results of this novel
approach to the more traditional instant form approach, where applicable.
