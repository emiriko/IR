We show that the statistics of the charge transfer of non-interacting
fermions through a two-lead contact is generalized binomial, at any temperature
and for any form of the scattering matrix: an arbitrary charge-transfer process
can be decomposed into independent single-particle events. This result
generalizes previous studies of adiabatic pumping at zero temperature and of
transport induced by bias voltage.
