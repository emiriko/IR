We study the single transverse spin asymmetry for the inclusive pion
production in the nucleon-nucleon collision, p^\uparrow p\to\pi X, based on the
twist-3 mechanism in the collinear factorization. We derive the
soft-fermion-pole (SFP) contribution to the twist-3 single-spin-dependent cross
section associated with the twist-3 quark-gluon correlation functions in the
polarized nucleon. We find that the SFP can give rise to a large effect to the
asymmetry A_N owing to the large partonic hard cross sections with the large
color factor, if the SFP function has a similar magnitude as the
soft-gluon-pole (SGP) function, in spite of the absence of the "derivative
term" for the SFP function unlike for the SGP function.
