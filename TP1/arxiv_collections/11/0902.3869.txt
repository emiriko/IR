The induced Compton scattering of radio emission off the particles of the
ultrarelativistic electron-positron plasma in the open field line tube of a
pulsar is considered. We examine the scattering of a bright narrow radio beam
into the background over a wide solid angle and specifically study the
scattering in the transverse regime, which holds in a moderately strong
magnetic field. Making use of the angular distribution of the scattered
intensity and taking into account the effect of rotational aberration in the
scattering region, we simulate the profiles of the backscattered components as
applied to the Crab pulsar. It is suggested that the interpulse (IP), the
high-frequency interpulse (IP') and the pair of the so-called high-frequency
components (HFC1 and HFC2) result from the backward scattering of the main
pulse (MP), precursor (PR) and the low-frequency component (LFC), respectively.
The components of the high-frequency profiles, the IP' and HFCs, are
interpreted for the first time. The HFC1 and HFC2 are argued to be a single
component split by the rotational aberration close to the light cylinder. It is
demonstrated that the observed spectral and polarization properties of the
profile components of the Crab pulsar as well as the giant pulse phenomenon
outside of the MP can be explained in terms of our model.
