We investigated the classical Shastry-Sutherland lattice under an external
magnetic field in order to understand the recently discovered magnetization
plateaux in the rare-earth tetraborides compounds RB$_4$. A detailed study of
the role of thermal fluctuations was carried out by mean of classical spin
waves theory and Monte-Carlo simulations. Magnetization quasi-plateaux were
observed at 1/3 of the saturation magnetization at non zero temperature. We
showed that the existence of these quasi-plateaux is due to an entropic
selection of a particular collinear state. We also obtained a phase diagram
that shows the domains of existence of different spin configurations in the
magnetic field versus temperature plane.
