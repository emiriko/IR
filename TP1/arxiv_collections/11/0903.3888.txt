We have studied the structural and superconducting properties of tetragonal
FeSe under pressures up to 26GPa using synchrotron radiation and diamond anvil
cells. The bulk modulus of the tetragonal phase is 28.5(3)GPa, much smaller
than the rest of Fe based superconductors. At 12GPa we observe a phase
transition from the tetragonal to an orthorhombic symmetry. The high pressure
orthorhombic phase has a higher Tc reaching 34K at 22GPa.
