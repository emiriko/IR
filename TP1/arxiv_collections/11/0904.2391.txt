By analyzing vortex lattices, re-entrant Cooper pairing and
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states in a single theoretical
framework we explore how vortices and spin textures join to protect
superconductivity against large magnetic fields. We use a rapidly rotating
ultra-cold gas of fermionic atoms near unitarity as a model system amenable to
experimental exploration, and discover a hierarchy of spin-polarized and FFLO
phases in which a metal or a band-insulator of unpaired particles coexists with
a spatially modulated superfluid hosting a vortex lattice. Quantum fluctuations
can transform these phases into strongly correlated "vortex liquid" metals and
insulators respectively. We argue that vortex lattices significantly enhance
the stability of FFLO states and discuss prospects for observing these states
in cold atom experiments.
