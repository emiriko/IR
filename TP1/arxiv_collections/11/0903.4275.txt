We show that a laser beam which propagates through an optical medium with
Kerr (focusing) and higher order (defocusing) nonlinearities displays pressure
and surface-tension properties yielding capillarity and dripping effects
totally analogous to usual liquid droplets. The system is reinterpreted in
terms of a thermodynamic grand potential, allowing for the computation of the
pressure and surface tension beyond the usual hydrodynamical approach based on
Madelung transformation and the analogy with the Euler equation. We then show
both analytically and numerically that the stationary soliton states of such a
light system satisfy the Young-Laplace equation, and that the dynamical
evolution through a capillary is described by the same law that governs the
growth of droplets in an ordinary liquid system.
