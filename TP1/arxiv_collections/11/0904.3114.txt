In this paper we explore the behavior of the quasi-particle interference
pattern (QPI) of scanning tunneling microscopy as a function of temperature,
$T$. After insuring a minimal consistency with photoemission, we find that the
QPI pattern is profoundly sensitive to quasi-particle coherence and that it
manifests two energy gap scales. The nearly dispersionless QPI pattern above
$T_c$ is consistent with data on moderately underdoped cuprates. To illustrate
the important two energy scale physics we present predictions of the
QPI--inferred energy gaps as a function of $T$ for future experiments on
moderately underdoped cuprates.
