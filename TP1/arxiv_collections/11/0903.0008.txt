The existence of a neutron scattering resonance at a wavevector q* implies a
sign change of the gap between two Fermi surface regions separated by
wavevector q* . For the Fe pnictides, a resonance has been observed for a
wavevector q* which connects a hole Fermi surface around the $\Gamma$ point
with an electron Fermi surface around the X or Y points of the 1 Fe/unit cell
Brillouin zone. Here we study the neutron scattering resonance for a five
orbital model within an RPA-BCS approximation. Our results show that both
sign-switched and extended s-wave gaps are consistent with the present data for
q* near ($\pi$, 0) and that scattering at other momentum transfers can be
useful in distinguishing between gap structures.
