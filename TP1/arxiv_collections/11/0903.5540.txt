We use the QCD sum rules to evaluate the mass of a possible scalar mesonic
state that couples to a molecular $D_{s}^{*}\bar{D}_s^{*}$ current. We find a
mass $m_{D_s^*D_s^*}=(4.14\pm 0.09)$ GeV, which is in a excellent agreement
with the recently observed Y(4140) charmonium state. We consider the
contributions of condensates up to dimension eight, we work at leading order in
$\alpha_s$ and we keep terms which are linear in the strange quark mass $m_s$.
We also consider a molecular $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$ current and we obtain
$m_{D^*{D}^*}=(4.13\pm 0.10)$, around 200 MeV above the mass of the Y(3930)
charmonium state. We conclude that it is possible to describe the Y(4140)
structure as a $D_s^*\bar{D}_s^*$ molecular state.
