A Monte Carlo simulation is performed in a cubic lattice of interacting
identical Stoner-Woldfarth nanoparticles. The model system is a
randomly-anisotropic Heisenberg spin system with a small anisotropy-to-exchange
ratio D/J = 3.5. The dc susceptibility, chi(dc)(T), shows a Curie-Weiss-like
transition at a temperature T-C/J approximate to 1.5, followed by a
low-temperature glassy behavior manifested by cusps in both the
zero-field-cooled and the field-cooled curves. The ac susceptibility, chi(ac)
(T, omega), at various frequencies, w, shows that with decreasing temperature,
a non-Arrhenius dispersive peak occurs at T-b(omega), succeeded by another
dispersionless peak at T-g/J approximate to 1.20 in the in-phase part, chi'(T,
omega), of chi (T, omega) while the out-of-phase part, chi '' (T, omega), shows
only one peak. A dynamic scaling analysis shows that the system exhibits a
critical slowing-down at T-g with a quite small exponent zv approximate to
1.65. However, no universal collapse is seen for the fully-scaled data of chi
'' (T, omega). These observed behaviors are interpreted under the droplet-like
hypothesis that the formation and development of exchange-induced correlated
clusters drive ensembles of nanoparticles undergoing a transition from a
paramagnetic order to a short-range order (SRO) at T-C, followed by a
transition at T-g to the magnetic state in which a magnetic glassy order and a
magnetic quasi-long-range order (QLRO) coexist. In addition, our simulation
shows that the onset of the latter transition, which is peculiarly manifested
by the dispersionless peak, occurs only for those ensembles possessing the
anisotropy strength in the region 1.0 <= D/J <= 5.0.....
