We incorporate the color-screening effect due to light quark pair creation
into the heavy quark-antiquark potential, and investigate the effects of
screened potential on the spectrum of higher charmonium. We calculate the
masses, electromagnetic decays, and E1 transitions of charmonium states in the
screened potential model, and propose possible assignments for the newly
discovered charmonium or charmonium-like $"X,Y,Z"$ states. We find the masses
of higher charmonia with screened potential are considerably lower than those
with unscreened potential. The $\chi_{c2}(2P)$ mass agrees well with that of
the Z(3930), and the mass of $\psi(4415)$ is compatible with $\psi(5S)$ rather
than $\psi(4S)$. In particular, the discovered four $Y$ states in the ISR
process, i.e., $Y(4008), Y(4260), Y(4320/4360), Y(4660)$ may be assigned as the
$\psi(3S), \psi(4S), \psi(3D), \psi(6S)$ states respectively. The X(3940) and
X(4160) found in the double charmonium production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation may
be assigned as the $\eta_c(3S)$ and $\chi_{c0}(3P)$ states. Based on the
calculated E1 transition widths for $\chi_{c1}(2P)\to \gamma J/\psi$ and
$\chi_{c1}(2P)\to \gamma \psi(2S)$ and other results, we argue that the X(3872)
may be a $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ dominated charmonium state with some admixture of the
$D^0\bar{D}^{*0}$ component. Possible problems encountered in these assignments
and comparisons with other interpretations for these $X,Y,Z$ states are
discussed in detail. We emphasize that more theoretical and experimental
investigations are urgently needed to clarify these assignments and other
interpretations.
