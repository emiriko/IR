We discuss a simple derivation of the real-time AdS/CFT prescription as an
analytic continuation of the corresponding problem in Euclidean signature. We
then extend the formalism to spinor operators and apply it to the examples of
real-time fermionic correlators in CFTs dual to pure AdS and the BTZ black
hole.
