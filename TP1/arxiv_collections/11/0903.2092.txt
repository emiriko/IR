We study topological strings on local toric del Pezzo surfaces by a method
called remodeling the B-model which was recently proposed by Bouchard, Klemm,
Marino and Pasquetti. For a large class of local toric del Pezzo surfaces we
prove a functional formula of the Bergman kernel which is the basic constituent
of the topological string amplitudes by the topological recursion relation of
Eynard and Orantin. Because this formula is written as a functional of the
period, we can obtain the topological string amplitudes at any point of the
moduli space by a simple change of variables of the Picard-Fuchs equations for
the period. By this formula and mirror symmetry we compute the A-model
amplitudes on K_{F_2}, and predict the open orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants
of C^3/Z_4.
