Biological systems possess negative entropy. In them, one form of order
produces another, more organized form of order. We propose a formal scheme to
calculate robustness of an entire biological system by quantifying the negative
entropy present in it. Our Methodology is based upon a computational
implementation of two-person non-cooperative finite zero-sum game between
positive (physico-chemical) and negative (biological) entropy, present in the
system(TCA cycle, for this work). Biochemical analogue of Nash equilibrium,
proposed here, could measure the robustness in TCA cycle in exact numeric
terms, whereas the mixed strategy game between these entropies could quantitate
the progression of stages of biological adaptation. Synchronization profile
amongst macromolecular concentrations (even under environmental perturbations)
is found to account for negative entropy and biological robustness. Emergence
of synchronization profile was investigated with dynamically varying metabolite
concentrations. Obtained results were verified with that from the deterministic
simulation methods. Categorical plans to apply this algorithm in Cancer studies
and anti-viral therapies are proposed alongside. From theoretical perspective,
this work proposes a general, rigorous and alternative view of immunology.
