We develop a theory of the effective disorder temperature in glass-forming
materials driven away from thermodynamic equilibrium by external forces. Our
basic premise is that the slow configurational degrees of freedom of such
materials are weakly coupled to the fast kinetic/vibrational degrees of
freedom, and therefore that these two subsystems can be described by different
temperatures during deformation. We use results from the preceding paper on the
nonequilibrium thermodynamics of systems with internal degrees of freedom to
derive an equation of motion for the effective temperature and to learn how
this temperature couples to the dynamics of the system as a whole.
