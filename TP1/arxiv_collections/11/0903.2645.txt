We present a new method for generating a regular train of ultrashort optical
pulses in a prepared two-level medium. The train develops from incident
monochromatic probe radiation travelling in a medium of atoms, which are in a
quantum mechanical superposition of dressed internal states. In the frame of
used linear theory for the probe radiation, the energy of individual pulses is
an exponentially growing function of atom density and of interaction cross
section. Pulse repetition rate is determined by the generalized Rabi frequency
and can be around 1 THz and greater. We also show that the terms, extra to the
dipole approximation, endow the gas by a new property: non-saturating
dependence of refractive index on the dressing monochromatic field intensity.
Contribution of these nonsaturating terms can be compatible with the main
dipole approximation in the wavelength region of about ten micrometers (the
range of CO_2 laser) or larger.
