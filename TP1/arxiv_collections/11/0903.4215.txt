Multipotent stem or progenitor cells undergo a sequential series of binary
fate decisions, which ultimately generate the diversity of differentiated
cells. Efforts to understand cell fate control have focused on simple gene
regulatory circuits that predict the presence of multiple stable states,
bifurcations and switch-like transitions. However, existing gene network models
do not explain more complex properties of cell fate dynamics such as the
hierarchical branching of developmental paths. Here, we construct a generic
minimal model of the genetic regulatory network controlling cell fate
determination, which exhibits five elementary characteristics of cell
differentiation: stability, directionality, branching, exclusivity, and
promiscuous expression. We argue that a modular architecture comprising
repeated network elements reproduces these features of differentiation by
sequentially repressing selected modules and hence restricting the dynamics to
lower dimensional subspaces of the high-dimensional state space. We implement
our model both with ordinary differential equations (ODEs), to explore the role
of bifurcations in producing the one-way character of differentiation, and with
stochastic differential equations (SDEs), to demonstrate the effect of noise on
the system. We further argue that binary cell fate decisions are prevalent in
cell differentiation due to general features of the underlying dynamical
system. This minimal model makes testable predictions about the structural
basis for directional, discrete and diversifying cell phenotype development and
thus can guide the evaluation of real gene regulatory networks that govern
differentiation.
