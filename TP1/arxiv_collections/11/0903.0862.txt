We report the detection of luminous CO(3-2) line emission in the halo of the
z=2.6 radio galaxy (HzRG) TXS0828+193, which has no detected counterpart at
optical to mid-infrared wavelengths implying a stellar mass < few x10^9 M_sun
and relatively low star-formation rates. With the IRAM PdBI we find two CO
emission line components at the same position at ~80 kpc distance from the HzRG
along the axis of the radio jet, with different blueshifts of few 100 km s^-1
relative to the HzRG and a total luminosity of ~2x10^10 K km s^-1 pc^2 detected
at 8 sigma significance. HzRGs have significant galaxy overdensities and
extended halos of metal-enriched gas often with embedded clouds or filaments of
denser material, and likely trace very massive dark-matter halos. The CO
emission may be associated with a gas-rich, low-mass satellite galaxy with
little on-going star formation, in contrast to all previous CO detections of
galaxies at similar redshifts. Alternatively, the CO may be related to a gas
cloud or filament and perhaps jet-induced gas cooling in the outer halo,
somewhat in analogy with extended CO emission found in low-redshift galaxy
clusters.
