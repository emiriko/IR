Dressed states of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates of spin-1 atoms coupling
with optical cavity modes with far off resonance frequency are investigated.
The exact solution of time evolution of population of spin component is
derived, and the numerical result shows that the evolution is different from
spin mixing without the coupling. Due to the coupling with the atoms, the
photon state also evolute to different optical cavity modes.
