In the $J/\psi$ radiative decay channels $J/\psi\to \gamma V\bar{V}$, the
result of partial wave analysis indicates that the $V\bar{V}$ systems are
predominately pseudoscalar component, and most of these channels have
relatively large branching ratios at an order of $10^{-3}$. Meanwhile, vector
mesons, such as $\rho$, $\omega$ and $K^*$, have strong couplings with nucleons
and/or hyperons. This suggests a dynamical mechanism describing the $\eta
p\bar{p}$ form factors for higher $\eta$ mesons, such as $\eta(1405/1475)$ and
$\eta(1760)$. It is thus natural to expect that rescatterings of these vector
meson pairs into $p\bar{p}$ of $0^-$ partial wave could be an important source
contributing to $J/\psi\to\gamma p\bar{p}$ of which the branching ratio is at
the order of $10^{-4}$. Our calculation justifies this point. In particular, we
find that interferences between different rescattering amplitudes can produce a
significant threshold enhancement in the invariant mass spectrum of $p\bar{p}$.
Without introducing dramatic ingredients, our model provides a natural
explanation for the peculiar threshold enhancement observed by BES-II in
$J/\psi\to \gamma p\bar{p}$. Additional experimental constraints on the
$V\bar{V}\to p\bar{p}$ transitions are examined. This mechanism in $J/\psi\to
\omega p\bar{p}$ is also discussed.
