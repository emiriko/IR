We consider pairs of commuting isometries that are annihilated by a
polynomial. We show that the polynomial must be inner toral, which is a
geometric condition on its zero set. We show that cyclic pairs of commuting
isometries are nearly unitarily equivalent if they are annihilated by the same
minimal polynomial.
