Disorder effects strongly influence the transport properties of graphene
based nanodevices even to the point of Anderson localization. Focusing on the
local density of states and its distribution function, we analyze the
localization properties of actual size graphene nanoribbons. In particular we
determine the time evolution and localization length of the single particle
wave function in dependence on the ribbon extension and edge geometry, as well
as on the disorder type and strength.
