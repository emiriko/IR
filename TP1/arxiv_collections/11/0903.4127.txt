We construct a theory of distributions in the setting of analysis on
post-critically finite self-similar fractals, and on fractafolds and products
based on such fractals. The results include basic properties of test functions
and distributions, a structure theorem showing that distributions are
locally-finite sums of powers of the Laplacian applied to continuous functions,
and an analysis of the distributions with point support. Possible future
applications to the study of hypoelliptic partial differential operators are
suggested.
