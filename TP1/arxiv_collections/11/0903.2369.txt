Measurements of basal plane longitudinal rho_b(B) and Hall rho_H(B)
resistivities were performed on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)
samples in pulsed magnetic field up to B = 50 T applied perpendicular to
graphene planes, and temperatures 1.5 K < T < 4.2 K. At B > 30 T and for all
studied samples, we observed a sign change in rho_H(B) from electron- to
hole-like. For our best quality sample, the measurements revealed the
enhancement in rho_b(B) for B > 34 T (T = 1.8 K), presumably associated with
the field-driven charge density wave or Wigner crystallization transition.
Besides, well defined plateaus in rho_H(B) were detected in the ultra-quantum
limit revealing the signatures of fractional quantum Hall effect in graphite.
