Three existing interpretations of quantum mechanics, given by Heisenberg,
Bohm and Madelung, are examined to describe dissipative quantum systems as
well. It is found that the Madelung quantum hydrodynamics is the only correct
approach. A new stochastic reinterpretation of the quantum mechanics is
proposed, which represents the microscopic face of the Madelung hydrodynamics.
The main idea is that the vacuum fluctuates permanently, which explains the
probabilistic character of the quantum mechanics. Thus, it is an objective
theory independent of the human beings and their measurements. The effect of
the thermal fluctuations in the surrounding is also accounted for via a
heuristic Langevin equation with two random forces. Some statistical
characteristics of these quantum and thermal noises are determined by
reproducing known results for the system phase-space dynamics.
