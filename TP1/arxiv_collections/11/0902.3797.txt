We demonstrate theoretically that the abstraction reaction $A+B_2 \to AB+B$
can be driven coherently and efficiently with quantum-degenerate bosonic or
fermionic matter waves. We show that the initial stages of the reaction are
dominated by quantum fluctuations, resulting in the appearance of macroscopic
non-classical correlations in the final atomic and molecular fields. The
dynamics associated with the creation of bosonic and of fermionic dimer-atom
pairs are also compared. This study opens up a promising new regime of quantum
degenerate matter-wave chemistry.
