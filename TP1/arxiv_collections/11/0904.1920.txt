Motion planning is a fundamental problem of robotics with applications in
many areas of computer science and beyond. Its restriction to graphs has been
investigated in the literature for it allows to concentrate on the
combinatorial problem abstracting from geometric considerations. In this paper,
we consider motion planning over directed graphs, which are of interest for
asymmetric communication networks. Directed graphs generalize undirected
graphs, while introducing a new source of complexity to the motion planning
problem: moves are not reversible. We first consider the class of acyclic
directed graphs and show that the feasibility can be solved in time linear in
the product of the number of vertices and the number of arcs. We then turn to
strongly connected directed graphs. We first prove a structural theorem for
decomposing strongly connected directed graphs into strongly biconnected
components.Based on the structural decomposition, we give an algorithm for the
feasibility of motion planning on strongly connected directed graphs, and show
that it can also be decided in time linear in the product of the number of
vertices and the number of arcs.
