A general nonequilibrium thermodynamic theory is developed for time-dependent
Langevin dynamics, starting from the common definition of nonequilibrium Gibbs
entropy. It is shown that the notations appearing in the First and the Second
Law of thermodynamics could be consistently applied to transient nonequilibrium
processes. We find out a general equality representing the energy balance
relation for the system, and further an explicit mathematical interpretation
for the extended form of the Second Law is proposed, which only comes into
existence in the time-dependent case. More applications to several classic
thermodynamic processes are finally included.
