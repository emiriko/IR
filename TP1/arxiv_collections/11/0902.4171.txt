We consider a possible mechanism of thermalization of nucleons in
relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Our model belongs, to a certain degree, to
the transport ones; we investigate the evolution of the system created in
nucleus-nucleus collision, but we parametrize this development by the number of
collisions of every particle during evolution rather than by the time variable.
We based on the assumption that the nucleon momentum transfer after several
nucleon-nucleon (-hadron) elastic and inelastic collisions becomes a random
quantity driven by a proper distribution. This randomization results in a
smearing of the nucleon momenta about their initial values and, as a
consequence, in their partial isotropization and thermalization. The trial
evaluation is made in the framework of a toy model. We show that the proposed
scheme can be used for extraction of the physical information from experimental
data on nucleon rapidity distribution.
