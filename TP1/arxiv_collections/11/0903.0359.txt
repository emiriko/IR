We determine the electromagnetic properties of decuplet resonances using
chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order. Utilizing a partially
quenched charge matrix, we isolate and remove the quark disconnected
contractions. This allows us to compare the physical meson loop contributions
to the connected contributions, of which the latter are currently calculated
using lattice QCD. Finally we determine linear combinations of decuplet
resonance and hyperon electromagnetic properties that are exactly independent
of disconnected contractions in the isospin limit.
