We study the interior electrovacuum region of axisymmetric and stationary
black holes with surrounding matter and find that there exists always a regular
inner Cauchy horizon inside the black hole, provided the angular momentum $J$
and charge $Q$ of the black hole do not vanish simultaneously. In particular,
we derive an explicit relation for the metric on the Cauchy horizon in terms of
that on the event horizon. Moreover, our analysis reveals the remarkable
universal relation $(8\pi J)^2+(4\pi Q^2)^2=A^+ A^-$, where $A^+$ and $A^-$
denote the areas of event and Cauchy horizon respectively.
