The quantum system of particles in a double well potential is a widely
studied and extremely useful example for understanding quantum mechanics. This
simple system has recently been used in theoretical proposals and related
experiments as a way to make quantum logic gates for ultra-cold atoms confined
in optical lattices (periodic potentials arising from the interaction of atoms
with standing waves of laser light). Such quantum gates are the fundamental
building blocks for quantum information processing; in this context the regular
array of cold atoms in the optical lattice serves as the quantum register. The
purpose of this paper is to explain how this current research can be understood
in terms of well-known principles for systems of identical particles, and hence
furnish an up-to-date example for the teaching of quantum mechanics.
