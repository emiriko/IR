We discuss the phenomenology of the most general effective Lagrangian, up to
operators of dimension 5, build with standard model fields and interactions
including right-handed neutrinos. In particular we find there is a dimension 5
electroweak moment operator of right-handed neutrinos, not discussed previously
in the literature, which could have interesting phenomenological consequences.
