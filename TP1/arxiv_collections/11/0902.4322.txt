We measured the polarization memory of excitonic and biexcitonic optical
transitions from single quantum dots at either positive, negative or neutral
charge states. Positive, negative and no circular or linear polarization memory
was observed for various spectral lines, under the same quasi-resonant
excitation below the wetting layer band-gap. We developed a model which
explains both qualitatively and quantitatively the experimentally measured
polarization spectrum for all these optical transitions. We consider quite
generally the loss of spin orientation of the photogenerated electron-hole pair
during their relaxation towards the many-carrier ground states. Our analysis
unambiguously demonstrates that while electrons maintain their initial spin
polarization to a large degree, holes completely dephase.
