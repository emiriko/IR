In this paper we construct the action of Ding-Iohara and shuffle algebras in
the sum of localized equivariant K-groups of Hilbert schemes of points on C^2.
We show that commutative elements K_i of shuffle algebra act through vertex
operators over positive part {h_i}_{i>0} of the Heisenberg algebra in these
K-groups. Hence we get the action of Heisenberg algebra itself. Finally, we
normalize the basis of the structure sheaves of fixed points in such a way that
it corresponds to the basis of Macdonald polynomials in the Fock space
k[h_1,h_2,...].
