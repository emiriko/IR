On the basis of self-consistent Born approximation, we solve the
Bethe-Salpeter matrix equations for Cooperon propagator of the Dirac fermions
in graphene under the charged impurity scatterings and a weak external magnetic
field. In the absence of the magnetic field, the quantum interference effect in
the electric conductivity from the contribution of Cooperon propagator will be
studied and possible weak localization in the system is discussed in terms of
the sample length and temperature. The magnetoconductivity stemming from the
quantum interference effect is calculated, and the obtained results are in good
agreement with experimental measurements.
