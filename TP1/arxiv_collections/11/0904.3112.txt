The $\mu\nu$SSM provides a solution to the $\mu$ problem of the MSSM and
explains the origin of neutrino masses by simply using right-handed neutrino
superfields. We have completed the analysis of the vacua in this model,
studying the possibility of spontaneous CP violation through complex Higgs and
sneutrino vacuum expectation values. As a consequence of this process, a
complex MNS matrix can be present. Besides, we have discussed the neutrino
physics and the associated electroweak seesaw mechanism in the $\mu\nu$SSM,
including also phases. Current data on neutrino masses and mixing angles can
easily be reproduced.
