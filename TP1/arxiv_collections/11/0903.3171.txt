The three loop anomalous dimension for the gauge invariant, renormalizable,
non-local mass operator for a gluon is computed in the MSbar scheme. In
addition the anomalous dimensions of the associated localizing ghost fields are
also deduced at the same order and it is shown that the three loop QCD
beta-function correctly emerges from the gluon localizing ghost vertex
renormalization.
