Quantum chromodynamics predicts that the interaction between its fundamental
constituents, quarks and gluons, can lead to different states of strongly
interacting matter, dependent on its temperature and baryon density. We first
survey the possible states of matter in QCD and discuss the transition from a
color-confining hadronic phase to a plasma of deconfined colored quarks and
gluons. Next, we summarize the results from non-perturbative studies of QCD at
finite temperature and baryon density, and address the origin of deconfinement
in the different regimes. Finally, we consider possible probes to test the
basic features of bulk matter in QCD.
