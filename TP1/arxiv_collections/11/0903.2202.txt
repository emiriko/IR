Some recent approaches for scalable offline partial evaluation of logic
programs include a size-change analysis for ensuring both so called local and
global termination. In this work|inspired by experimental evaluation|we
introduce several improvements that may increase the accuracy of the analysis
and, thus, the quality of the associated specialized programs. We aim to
achieve this while maintaining the same complexity and scalability of the
recent works.
