We study the manifestations of universal four-body physics in ultracold
dimer-dimer collisions.
  We show that resonant features associated with three-body Efimov physics and
dimer-dimer scattering lengths are universally related. The emergence of
universal four-boson states allows for the tunability of the dimer-dimer
interaction, thus enabling the future study of ultracold molecular gases with
both attractive and repulsive interactions. Moreover, our study of the
interconversion between dimers and Efimov trimers shows that $B_{2}+B_{2}\to
B_{3}+B$ rearrangement reactions can provide an efficient trimer formation
mechanism. Our analysis of the temperature dependence of this reaction provides
an interpretation of the available experimental data and sheds light on the
possible experimental realization of rearrangement processes in ultracold
gases.
