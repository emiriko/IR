One of the objectives of theories describing quantum dynamical geometry is to
compute expectation values of geometrical observables. The results of such
computations can be affected by whether or not matter is taken into account. It
is thus important to understand to what extent and to what effect matter can
affect dynamical geometries. Using a simple model, it is shown that matter can
effectively mold a geometry into an isotropic configuration. Implications for
"atomistic" models of quantum geometry are briefly discussed.
