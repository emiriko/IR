Differential cross sections for the reaction $\gamma p \to n \pi^+$ have been
measured with the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) and a tagged
photon beam with energies from 0.725 to 2.875 GeV. Where available, the results
obtained here compare well with previously published results for the reaction.
Agreement with the SAID and MAID analyses is found below 1 GeV. The present set
of cross sections has been incorporated into the SAID database, and exploratory
fits have been made up to 2.7 GeV. Resonance couplings have been extracted and
compared to previous determinations. With the addition of these cross sections
to the world data set, significant changes have occurred in the high-energy
behavior of the SAID cross-section predictions and amplitudes.
