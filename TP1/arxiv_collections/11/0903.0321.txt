We study narrow ballistic Josephson weak links in a InAs quantum wells
contacted by Nb electrodes and find a dramatic magnetic-field suppression of
the Andreev reflection amplitude, which occurs even for in-plane field
orientation with essentially no magnetic flux through the junction. Our
observations demonstrate the presence of a Doppler shift in the energy of the
Andreev levels, which results from diamagnetic screening currents in the hybrid
Nb/InAs-banks. The data for conductance, excess and critical currents can be
consistently explained in terms of the sample geometry and the McMillan energy,
characterizing the transparency of the Nb/InAs-interface.
