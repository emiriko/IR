We present the orbital solutions for four OB spectroscopic binaries, MT145,
GSC 03161-00815, 2MASS J20294666+4105083, and Schulte 73, and the partial
orbital solution to the B spectroscopic binary, MT372, as part of an ongoing
study to determine the distribution of orbital parameters for massive binaries
in the Cygnus OB2 Association. MT145 is a new, single-lined, moderately
eccentric (e=0.291+/-0.009) spectroscopic binary with period of 25.140+/-0.008
days. GSC 03161-00815 is a slightly eccentric (e=0.10+/-0.01), eclipsing,
interacting and double-lined spectroscopic binary with a period of
4.674+/-0.004 days. 2MASS J20294666+4105083 is a moderately eccentric
(e=0.273+/-0.002) double-lined spectroscopic binary with a period of
2.884+/-0.001 days. Schulte 73 is a slightly eccentric (e=0.169+/-0.009),
double-lined spectroscopic binary with a period of 17.28+/-0.03 days and the
first "twin" in our survey with a mass ratio of q=0.99+/-0.02. MT372 is a
single-lined, eclipsing system with a period of 2.228 days and low eccentricity
(e~0). Of the now 18 known OB binaries in Cyg OB2, 14 have periods and mass
ratios. Emerging evidence also shows that the distribution of log(P) is flat
and consistent with Oepik's Law.
