This is a brief review on the scenario of baryogenesis through leptogenesis.
Leptogenesis is an appealing scenario that may relate the observed baryon
asymmetry in the Universe to the low-energy neutrino data. In this review talk,
particular emphasis is put on recent developments on the field, such as the
flavourdynamics of leptogenesis and resonant leptogenesis near the electroweak
phase transition. It is illustrated how these recent developments enable the
modelling of phenomenologically predictive scenarios that can directly be
tested at the LHC and indirectly in low-energy experiments of lepton-number and
lepton-flavour violation.
