New critical surfaces have been analytically found for a 3D vectorial model
of bistable pumping system of an optical-wavelength acoustic laser (phaser).
The Lyapunov instability is possible for this pumping system at the upper
branch for a high quality factor Qc of a pump resonator: Qc/Qm >> 1, where Qm
is the magnetic quality factor. This instability is of great interest for
interpretaion of some experimental data on the optical-wavelength ruby phaser
(see our previous papers arXiv:cond-mat/0303188, arXiv:cond-mat/0402640,
arXiv:0704.0123, arXiv:0901.0449).
