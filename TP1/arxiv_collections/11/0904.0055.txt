By changing from a resonant multimode paradigm to a free mass paradigm for
transducers in resonant mass gravitational wave detection, an array of six
spheres can achieve a sensitivity response curve competitive with
interferometers, being as sensitive as GEO600 and TAMA300 in the 3 to 6 kHz
band and more sensitive than LIGO for 50 percent of the 6 to 10 kHz band. We
study how to assemble a klystron resonant cavity that has a 1 nm gap by
understanding the stability of the forces applied at it (Casimir force, elastic
force, weight). This approach has additional benefits. First, due to the
relatively inexpensive nature of this technology (around US$ 1 million), it is
accessible to a broader part of the world scientific community. Additionally,
spherical resonant mass detectors have the ability to discern both the
direction and polarization resolutions.
