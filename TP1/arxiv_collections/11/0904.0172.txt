The Loschmidt echo (LE) (or fidelity) quantifies the sensitivity of the time
evolution of a quantum system with respect to a perturbation of the
Hamiltonian. In a typical chaotic system the LE has been previously argued to
exhibit a long-time saturation at a value inversely proportional to the
effective size of the Hilbert space of the system. However, until now no
quantitative results have been known and, in particular, no explicit expression
for the proportionality constant has been proposed. In this paper we perform a
quantitative analysis of the phenomenon of the LE saturation and provide the
analytical expression for its long-time saturation value for a semiclassical
particle in a two-dimensional chaotic billiard. We further perform extensive
(fully quantum mechanical) numerical calculations of the LE saturation value
and find the numerical results to support the semiclassical theory.
