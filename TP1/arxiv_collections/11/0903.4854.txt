Context: New observational means such as the space missions CoRoT and Kepler
and ground-based networks are and will be collecting stellar pulsation data
with unprecedented accuracy. A significant fraction of the stars in which
pulsations are observed are rotating rapidly.
  Aims: Our aim is to characterise pulsation modes in rapidly rotating stellar
models so as to be able to interpret asteroseismic data from such stars.
  Methods: The pulsation code developed in Ligni\`eres et al. (2006) and Reese
et al. (2006) is applied to stellar models based on the self-consistent field
(SCF) method (Jackson et al. 2004, 2005, MacGregor et al. 2007).
  Results: Pulsation modes in SCF models follow a similar behaviour to those in
uniformly rotating polytropic models, provided that the rotation profile is not
too differential. Pulsation modes fall into different categories, the three
main ones being island, chaotic, and whispering gallery modes, which are
rotating counterparts to modes with low, medium, and high l-|m| values,
respectively. The frequencies of the island modes follow an asymptotic pattern
quite similar to what was found for polytropic models. Extending this
asymptotic formula to higher azimuthal orders reveals more subtle behaviour as
a function of m and provides a first estimate of the average advection of
pulsation modes by rotation. Further calculations based on a variational
principle confirm this estimate and provide rotation kernels that could be used
in inversion methods. When the rotation profile becomes highly differential, it
becomes more and more difficult to find island and whispering gallery modes at
low azimuthal orders. At high azimuthal orders, whispering gallery modes, and
in some cases island modes, reappear.
