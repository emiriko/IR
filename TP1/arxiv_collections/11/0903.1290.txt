We present electronic transport measurements in individual
Au-catalyst/Ge-nanowire interfaces demonstrating the presence of a Schottky
barrier. Surprisingly, the small-bias conductance density increases with
decreasing diameter. Theoretical calculations suggest that this effect arises
because electron-hole recombination in the depletion region is the dominant
charge transport mechanism, with a diameter dependence of both the depletion
width and the electron-hole recombination time. The recombination time is
dominated by surface contributions and depends linearly on the nanowire
diameter.
