We report synthesis, structural details and transport measurements on
Sr4V2O6Fe2As2. Namely the stoichiometric amounts of V2O5 + SrO2 + Sr + 2FeAs
are weighed mixed, ground thoroughly and palletized in rectangular form in a
glove box in high purity Ar atmosphere. The pellet is further sealed in an
evacuated (10-5 Torr) quartz tube and put for heat treatments at 750 and 1150
0C in a single step for 12 and 36 hours respectively. Finally the quartz
ampoule is allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. The as synthesized
sample is black in color. The compound crystallized in P4/nmm space group with
lattice parameters a = b = 3.925A and c = 15.870A. Also seen are some small
impurity lines. The compound did not exhibit superconductivity but instead a
spin density wave (SDW) like metallic step at around 175 K is seen in R(T)
measurements
