The Bianchi IX cosmological model (through Bianchi I and II) is analyzed in
the framework of a generalized uncertainty principle. In particular, the
anisotropies of the Universe are described by a deformed Heisenberg algebra.
Three main results are in order. (i) The Universe can not isotropize because of
the deformed Kasner dynamics. (ii) The triangular allowed domain is
asymptotically stationary with respect to the particle (Universe) and its
bounces against the walls are not interrupted by the deformed effects. (iii) No
reflection law can be in obtained since the Bianchi II model is no longer
analytically integrable.
