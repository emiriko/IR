Consider a class of relativistic rotators described by position and a single
null direction. Such a rotator is called fundamental if both its Casimir
invariants are intrinsic dimensional parameters independent of arbitrary
constants of motion. As shown by Staruszkiewicz, only one rotator with this
property exists (its partner with similar property can be excluded on physical
grounds).
  We obtain a general solution to equations of free motion of the fundamental
relativistic rotator in a covariant manner. Surprisingly, this motion is not
entirely determined by initial conditions but depends on one arbitrary function
of time, which specifies rotation of the null direction in the centre of
momentum frame. This arbitrariness is in manifest contradiction with classical
determinism. In this sense the isolated fundamental relativistic rotator is
pathological as a dynamical system. To understand why this is so, we study the
necessary condition for the uniqueness of the related Cauchy problem. It turns
out that the fundamental relativistic rotator (together with its partner) can
be uniquely characterized by violating this condition in the considered class
of rotators.
