We consider current precision electroweak data, Z' searches and dark matter
constraints and analyse their implications for an extension of the SM that
includes an extra U(1)' massive gauge boson and a particular hidden sector
("hidden valley") with a confining (QCD-like) gauge group. The constraints on
the Z' with arbitrary Z-Z' kinetic mixing coming from direct searches and
precision tests of the Standard Model are analysed and shown to lead to a lower
limit of 800 GeV on its mass. Renormalisable interactions involving the Z'
probe the physics of the hidden valley sector which contains a pseudoscalar
dark matter candidate. We find that dark matter constraints place an upper
bound on the mass of the Z' of O(10) TeV. A TeV mass scale is needed for the
hidden valley states, and the Sommerfeld factor for p-wave dark matter
annihilation is found significantly to suppress the allowed parameter space of
the model.
