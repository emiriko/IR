In software development process we come across various modules. Which raise
the idea of priority of the different modules of a software so that important
modules are tested on preference. This approach is desirable because it is not
possible to test each module regressively due to time and cost constraints.
This paper discuss on some parameters, required to prioritize several modules
of a software and provides measure of optimal time and cost for testing based
on non homogeneous Poisson process.
