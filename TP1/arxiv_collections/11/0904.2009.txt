The Pauli exclusion principle can be stated as inequality
$<\psi|\rho|\psi>\le 1$ for the electron density matrix $\rho$. Nowadays it is
replaced by skew symmetry of the multi-electron wave function. The replacement
leads to numerous additional constraints on $\rho$, which are discussed in this
letter together with their physical implications, in particular for spin
magnetic moment of a multi-electron system.
