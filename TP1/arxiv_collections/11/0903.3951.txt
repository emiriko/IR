Aims: We measure the clustering properties for a large samples of u- (z~3),
g- (z~4), and r- (z~5) dropouts from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy
Survey (CFHTLS) Deep fields.
  Methods: Photometric redshift distributions along with simulations allow us
to de-project the angular correlation measurements and estimate physical
quantities such as the correlation length, halo mass, galaxy bias, and halo
occupation as a function of UV luminosity.
  Results: For the first time we detect a significant one-halo term in the
correlation function at z~5. The comoving correlation lengths and halo masses
of LBGs are found to decrease with decreasing rest-frame UV-luminosity. No
significant redshift evolution is found in either quantity. The typical halo
mass hosting an LBG is M>~10^{12}h^{-1}M_\odot and the halos are typically
occupied by less than one galaxy. Clustering segregation with UV luminosity is
clearly observed in the dropout samples, however redshift evolution cannot
clearly be disentangled from systematic uncertainties introduced by the
redshift distributions. We study a range of possible redshift distributions to
illustrate the effect of this choice. Spectroscopy of representative subsamples
is required to make high-accuracy absolute measurements of high-z halo masses.
