Several overlay-based live multimedia streaming platforms have been proposed
in the recent peer-to-peer streaming literature. In most of the cases, the
overlay neighbors are chosen randomly for robustness of the overlay. However,
this causes nodes that are distant in terms of proximity in the underlying
physical network to become neighbors, and thus data travels unnecessary
distances before reaching the destination. For efficiency of bulk data
transmission like multimedia streaming, the overlay neighborhood should
resemble the proximity in the underlying network. In this paper, we exploit the
proximity and redundancy properties of a recently proposed clique-based
clustered overlay network, named eQuus, to build efficient as well as robust
overlays for multimedia stream dissemination. To combine the efficiency of
content pushing over tree structured overlays and the robustness of data-driven
mesh overlays, higher capacity stable nodes are organized in tree structure to
carry the long haul traffic and less stable nodes with intermittent presence
are organized in localized meshes. The overlay construction and fault-recovery
procedures are explained in details. Simulation study demonstrates the good
locality properties of the platform. The outage time and control overhead
induced by the failure recovery mechanism are minimal as demonstrated by the
analysis.
