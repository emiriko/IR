We study structures of general relativistic compact stars with exotic matter.
Our study is based on axisymetric and stationary formalism including purely
toroidal magnetic field. We also study the finite size effects of quark-hadron
mixed phase on structures of magnetars. For hybrid stars, we find a
characteristic distribution of magnetic field, which has a discontinuity
originated in the quark-hadron mixed phase. These distributions of magnetic
field will change astrophysical phenomena, such as cooling processes.
