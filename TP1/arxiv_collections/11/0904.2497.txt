We consider spherically symmetric static solutions of the Einstein equations
with a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda,$ which are regular at the
centre, and we investigate the influence of $\Lambda$ on the bound of M/R,
where M is the ADM mass and R is the area radius of the boundary of the static
object. We find that for any solution which satisfies the energy condition
$p+2p_{\perp}\leq\rho,$ where $p\geq 0$ and $p_{\perp}$ are the radial and
tangential pressures respectively, and $\rho\geq 0$ is the energy density, and
for which $0\leq \Lambda R^2\leq 1,$ the inequality
  \frac{M}{R}\leq\frac29-\frac{\Lambda R^2}{3}+\frac29 \sqrt{1+3\Lambda R^2},
holds. If $\Lambda=0$ it is known that infinitely thin shell solutions uniquely
saturate the inequality, i.e. the inequality is sharp in that case. The
situation is quite different if $\Lambda>0.$ Indeed, we show that infinitely
thin shell solutions do not generally saturate the inequality except in the two
degenerate situations $\Lambda R^2=0$ and $\Lambda R^2=1$. In the latter
situation there is also a constant density solution, where the exterior
spacetime is the Nariai solution, which saturates the inequality, hence, the
saturating solution is non-unique. In this case the cosmological horizon and
the black hole horizon coincide. This is analogous to the charged situation
where there is numerical evidence that uniqueness of the saturating solution is
lost when the inner and outer horizons of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solution
coincide.
