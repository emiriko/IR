We present ISAAC spectroscopy and ISAAC, UKIDSS and Spitzer Space Telescope
broad-band photometry of SDSS J1228+1040 -- a white dwarf for which evidence of
a gaseous metal-rich circumstellar disk has previously been found from optical
emission lines. The data show a clear excess in the near- and mid-infrared,
providing compelling evidence for the presence of dust in addition to the
previously identified gaseous debris disk around the star. The infrared excess
can be modelled in terms of an optically thick but geometrically thin disk. We
find that the inner disk temperatures must be relatively high (~1700 K) in
order to fit the SED in the near-infrared. These data provide the first
evidence for the co-existence of both gas and dust in a disk around a white
dwarf, and show that their presence is possible even around moderately hot
(~22,000 K) stars.
