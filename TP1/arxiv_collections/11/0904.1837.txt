We present the first Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) observations of the
[O IV] 25.89 $\mu$m emission line detected from the ultraluminous X-ray source
(ULX) in Holmberg II. This line is a well established signature of high
ionization, usually associated with AGN. Its detection suggests that the ULX
has a strong impact on the surrounding gas. A Spitzer high resolution spectral
map shows that the [O IV] is coincident with the X-ray position of the ULX. The
ratios of the [O IV] to lower ionization lines are similar to those observed in
AGN, suggesting that a strong UV and X-ray source is responsible for the
photoionization. The best XMM-Newton data is used to model the X-ray band which
is then extrapolated into the UV. We perform infrared and ultraviolet
photometry, and use previously published optical and radio data to construct
the full SED for the ULX and its companion. The preferred model to describe the
SED includes an accretion disk which dominates the soft X-rays but contributes
little at UV and optical wavelengths. The optical counterpart is consistent
with a B supergiant as previously suggested in other studies. The bolometric
luminosity of the ULX suggests the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole
with mass $>$85 M$_\odot$ for sub-Eddington accretion or, alternatively, a
stellar-mass black hole that is accreting at super-Eddington rates. In a
follow-up second paper we perform detailed photoionization modeling of the
infrared lines in order to constrain the bolometric luminosity of the ULX.
