The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on--board the Fermi Gamma ray Space Telescope
began its on--orbit operations on June 23, 2008. Calibrations, defined in a
generic sense, correspond to synchronization of trigger signals, optimization
of delays for latching data, determination of detector thresholds, gains and
responses, evaluation of the perimeter of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA),
measurements of live time, of absolute time, and internal and spacecraft
boresight alignments. Here we describe on orbit calibration results obtained
using known astrophysical sources, galactic cosmic rays, and charge injection
into the front-end electronics of each detector. Instrument response functions
will be described in a separate publication. This paper demonstrates the
stability of calibrations and describes minor changes observed since launch.
These results have been used to calibrate the LAT datasets to be publicly
released in August 2009.
