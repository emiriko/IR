In this work we present a close correlation between third Kepler law and
Titius-Bode empirical rule. Concretely, we demonstrate that third Kepler law,
or, corresponding equilibrium condition between centrifugal and Newtonian
gravitational force, implies that planet orbital momentum becomes effectively a
function of the planet distance as unique variable and vice versa. Then,
approximation of the planet distance by its first order Taylor expansion over
planet orbital momentum holds an exponential form corresponding to Titius-Bode
rule. In this way it is not necessary postulate exponential form of the planet
distance (as it has been done by Scardigli) but only discrete values of its
argument. Physically, it simply means that, in the linear approximation,
"quantized" planets orbital momentums do a geometrical progression.
