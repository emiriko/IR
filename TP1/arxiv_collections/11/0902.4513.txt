Supernovae red shifts are fitted in a simple 5D model: the galaxies are
assumed to be enclosed in a giant S^3-spherical shell which expands (ultra)
relativistically in a (1+4)D Minkowski space. This model, as compared with the
kinematical (1+3)D model of Prof Farley, goes in line with the Copernican
principle: any galaxy observes the same isotropic distribution of distant
supernovae, as well as the same Hubble plot of distance modulus \mu vs red
shift z. A good fit is obtained (no free parameters); it coincides with
Farley's fit at low z, while shows some more luminosity at high z, leading to
1% decrease in the true distance modulus (and 50% increase in luminosity) at
z\sim 2.
  The model proposed can be also interpreted as a FLRW-like model with the
scale factor a(t)=t/t_0; this could not be a solution of general relativity (5D
GR is also unsuitable--it has no longitudinal polarization). However, there
still exists the other theory (with D=5 and no singularities in solutions), the
other game in the town, which seems to be able to do the job.
