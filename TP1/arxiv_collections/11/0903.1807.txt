The first part reviews the working mechanisms, capabilities and performance
of axion helioscopes, including the achieved results so far. The 2nd part is
observationally driven. New simulation results obtained with the Geant4 code
reconstruct spectral shape of solar X-ray spectra, and their isotropic emission
and lateral size. The derived rst mass of the axion(-like) particles is ~10meV.
The axion interaction with magnetic field gradient is a generic theoretical
suggestion that could reconcile present limits with relevant solar X-ray
activity. A short outlook of the experimentally expanding solar axion field is
given.
