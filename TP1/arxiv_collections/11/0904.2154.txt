We study the stability of $D \geq 7$ asymptotically flat black holes rotating
in a single two-plane against tensor-type gravitational perturbations. The
extensive search of quasinormal modes for these black holes did not indicate
any presence of growing modes, implying the stability of simply rotating
Myers-Perry black holes against tensor-type perturbations.
