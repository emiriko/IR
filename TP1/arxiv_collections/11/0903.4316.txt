Elementary gas-phase reactions of the bimolecular type A + B -> Products are
characterized by the second order kinetic law -d[A]/dt=k[A][B], where [A] and
[B] are the concentrations of A and B species, t is time and k is the rate
constant, usually estimated by means of Eyring equation. Here, we show that its
standard derivation, as such, is not consistent with the second order law. This
contradiction is however removed by introducing a correlation between what we
call "potentially reactive pairs". A new derivation of Eyring equation is
finally proposed on the basis of the previous findings.
