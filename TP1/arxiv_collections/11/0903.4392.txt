Several high-throughput distributed data-processing applications require
multi-hop processing of streams of data. These applications include continual
processing on data streams originating from a network of sensors, composing a
multimedia stream through embedding several component streams originating from
different locations, etc. These data-flow computing applications require
multiple processing nodes interconnected according to the data-flow topology of
the application, for on-stream processing of the data. Since the applications
usually sustain for a long period, it is important to optimally map the
component computations and communications on the nodes and links in the
network, fulfilling the capacity constraints and optimizing some quality metric
such as end-to-end latency. The mapping problem is unfortunately NP-complete
and heuristics have been previously proposed to compute the approximate
solution in a centralized way. However, because of the dynamicity of the
network, it is practically impossible to aggregate the correct state of the
whole network in a single node. In this paper, we present a distributed
algorithm for optimal mapping of the components of the data flow applications.
We propose several heuristics to minimize the message complexity of the
algorithm while maintaining the quality of the solution.
