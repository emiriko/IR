The paper is devoted to the range description of the Radon type transform
that averages a function over all spheres centered on a given sphere. Such
transforms arise naturally in thermoacoustic tomography, a novel method of
medical imaging. Range descriptions have recently been obtained for such
transforms, and consisted of smoothness and support conditions, moment
conditions, and some additional orthogonality conditions of spectral nature. It
has been noticed that in odd dimensions, surprisingly, the moment conditions
are superfluous and can be eliminated. It is shown in this text that in fact
the same happens in any dimension.
