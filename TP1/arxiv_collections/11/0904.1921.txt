Angular momentum transport within young massive protoplanetary discs may be
dominated by self-gravity at radii where the disk is too weakly ionized to
allow the development of the magneto-rotational instability. We use
time-dependent one-dimensional disc models, based on a local cooling time
calculation of the efficiency of transport, to study the radial structure and
stability (against fragmentation) of protoplanetary discs in which self-gravity
is the sole transport mechanism. We find that self-gravitating discs rapidly
attain a quasi-steady state in which the surface density in the inner disc is
high and the strength of turbulence very low (alpha ~ 10^{-3} or less inside 5
au). Temperatures high enough to form crystalline silicates may extend out to
several au at early times within these discs. None of our discs spontaneously
develop regions that would be unambiguously unstable to fragmentation into
substellar objects, though the outer regions (beyond 20 au) of the most massive
discs are close enough to the threshold that fragmentation cannot be ruled out.
We discuss how the mass accretion rates through such discs may vary with disc
mass and with mass of the central star, and note that a determination of the
\dot{M}-M_* relation for very young systems may allow a test of the model.
