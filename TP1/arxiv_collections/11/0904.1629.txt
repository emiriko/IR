Household robots need to communicate with human beings in a friendly fashion.
To achieve better understanding of displayed information, an importance and a
certainty of the information should be communicated together with the main
information. The proposed intent expression system aims to convey this
additional information using an eye robot. The eye motions are represented as
states in a pleasure-arousal space model. Change of the model state is
calculated by fuzzy inference according to the importance and certainty of the
displayed information. This change influences the arousal-sleep coordinate in
the space which corresponds to activeness in communication. The eye robot
provides a basic interface for the mascot robot system which is an easy to
understand information terminal for home environments in a humatronics society.
