We study the finite size scaling behaviour of the specific heat of thin films
in the neighbourhood of the lambda-transition. To this end we have simulated
the improved two-component phi^4 model on the simple cubic lattice. We employ
free boundary conditions in the short direction to mimic the vanishing order
parameter at the boundaries of a 4He film. Most of our simulations are
performed for the thicknesses L_0=8,16 and 32 of the film. It turns out that
one has to take into account corrections proportional 1/L_0 to obtain a good
collapse of the finite size scaling functions obtained from different L_0. Our
results are compared with those obtained from experiments on thin films of 4He
near the lambda-transition, from field theory and from previous Monte Carlo
simulations.
