We demonstrate theoretically the noise-stimulated enhancement of quantum
coherence in a superconducting flux qubit. First, an external classical noise
can increase the off-diagonal components of the qubit density matrix. Second,
in the presence of noise, the Rabi oscillations survive for times significantly
longer than the Rabi decay time in a noiseless system. These Rabi oscillations
appear as a modulation of the forced response of the qubit to the ac driving
field. These effects can be considered as a manifestation of quantum stochastic
resonance and are relevant to experimental techniques, such as Rabi
spectroscopy.
