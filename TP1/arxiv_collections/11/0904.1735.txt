Since the announcement of the proton spin crisis by the European Muon
Collaboration there has been considerable progress in unravelling the
distribution of spin and orbital angular momentum within the proton. We review
the current status of the problem, showing that not only have strong upper
limits have been placed on the amount of polarized glue in the proton but that
the experimental determination of the spin content has become much more
precise. It is now clear that the origin of the discrepancy between experiment
and the naive expectation of the fraction of spin carried by the quarks and
anti-quarks in the proton lies in the non-perturbative structure of the proton.
We explain how the features expected in a modern, relativistic and chirally
symmetric description of nucleon structure naturally explain the current data.
The consequences of this explanation for the presence of orbital angular
momentum on quarks and gluons is reviewed and comparison made with recent
results from lattice QCD and experimental data.
