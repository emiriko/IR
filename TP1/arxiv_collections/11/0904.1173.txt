Examination of the electrical resistivities of iron pnictides shows that they
can be accounted by conduction by polarons. Their activation energies show a
linear behaviour with the critical temperatures of the spin density waves
(SDW), T*, as both vary with pressure. The slope matches the ratio SDW gap to
T*, while the intercept can be related to the transition temperature of the
lattice distortion, T0. An adapted Landau free energy predicts the observed
order of the transitions, according to which is higher, T* or T0. Simple
arguments favour combined Jahn-Teller antiferromagnetic bipolarons.
