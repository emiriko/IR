A secluded U(1) gauge field, kinetically mixed with Standard Model
hypercharge, provides a `portal' mediating interactions with a hidden sector at
the renormalizable level, as recently exploited in the context of WIMP dark
matter. The secluded U(1) symmetry-breaking scale may naturally be suppressed
relative to the weak scale, and so this sector is efficiently probed by medium
energy electron-positron colliders. We study the collider signatures of the
minimal secluded U(1) model, focusing on the reach of B-factory experiments
such as BaBar and BELLE. In particular, we show that Higgs-strahlung in the
secluded sector can lead to multi-lepton signatures which probe the natural
range for the kinetic mixing angle of 10^(-2)-10^(-3) over a large portion of
the kinematically accessible parameter space.
