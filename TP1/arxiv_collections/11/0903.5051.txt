We consider critical dense polymers ${\cal L}(1,2)$. We obtain for this model
the eigenvalues of the local integrals of motion of the underlying Conformal
Field Theory by means of Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz. We give a detailed
description of the relation between this model and Symplectic Fermions
including the indecomposable structure of the transfer matrix. Integrals of
motion are defined directly on the lattice in terms of the Temperley Lieb
Algebra and their eigenvalues are obtained and expressed as an infinite sum of
the eigenvalues of the continuum integrals of motion. An elegant decomposition
of the transfer matrix in terms of a finite number of lattice integrals of
motion is obtained thus providing a reason for their introduction.
