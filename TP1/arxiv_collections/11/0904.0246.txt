To optimise the design of the light readout in the ArDM 1-ton liquid argon
dark matter detector, a range of reflector and WLS coating combinations were
investigated in several small setups, where argon scintillation light was
generated by radioactive sources in gas at normal temperature and pressure and
shifted into the blue region by tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB). Various
thicknesses of TPB were deposited by spraying and vacuum evaporation onto
specular 3M{\small\texttrademark}-foil and diffuse
Tetratex{\small\textregistered} (TTX) substrates. Light yields of each
reflector and TPB coating combination were compared. Reflection coefficients of
TPB coated reflectors were independently measured using a spectroradiometer in
a wavelength range between 200 and 650 nm. WLS coating on the PMT window was
also studied. These measurements were used to define the parameters of the
light reflectors of the ArDM experiment. Fifteen large $120\times 25$ cm$^2$
TTX sheets were coated and assembled in the detector. Measurements in argon gas
are reported providing good evidence of fulfilling the light collection
requirements of the experiment.
