It is well established numerically that spectral statistics of
pseudo-integrable models differs considerably from the reference statistics of
integrable and chaotic systems. In [PRL,93 (2004) 254102] statistical
properties of a certain quantized pseudo-integrable map had been calculated
analytically but only for a special sequence of matrix dimensions. The purpose
of this paper is to obtain the spectral statistics of the same quantum map for
all matrix dimensions.
