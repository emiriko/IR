Quantum detection processes in QFT must play a key role in the description of
quantum field correlations, such as the appearance of entanglement, and of
causal effects. We consider the detection in the case of a simple QFT model
with a suitable interaction to exact treatment, consisting of a quantum scalar
field coupled linearly to a classical scalar source. We then evaluate the
response function to the field quanta of two-level point-like quantum model
detectors, and analyze the effects of the approximation adopted in standard
detection theory. We show that the use of the RWA, that characterizes the
Glauber detection model, leads in the detector response to non-local terms
corresponding to an instantaneously spreading of source effects over the whole
space. Other detector models, obtained with non-standard or the no-application
of RWA, give instead local responses to field quanta, apart from source
independent vacuum contribution linked to preexisting correlations of
zero-point field.
