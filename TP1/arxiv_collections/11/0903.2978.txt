The scattering of an electromagnetic plane wave by a spherical particle was
solved analytically by Gustav Mie in 1908. The Mie solution is expressed as a
series with very many terms thus obscuring the physical interpretations of the
results. The purpose of the paper is to try to illustrate this phenomenon
within the Ramsauer framework used in atomic and nuclear physics. We show that
although the approximations are numerous, the Ramsauer analytical formulae
describe fairly well the differential and the total cross sections. This allows
us to propose an explanation for the origin of the different structures in the
total cross section.
