Recently many important biopolymers have been found to possess intrinsic
curvature. Tubulin protofilaments in animal cells, FtsZ filaments in bacteria
and double stranded DNA are examples. We examine how intrinsic curvature
influence the conformational statistics of such polymers. We give exact results
for the tangent-tangent spatial correlation function C(r) = t(s).t(s + r), both
in two and three dimensions. Contrary to expectation, C(r) does not show any
oscillatory behavior, rather decays exponentially and the effective persistence
length has strong length dependence for short polymers. We also compute the
distribution function P(R) of the end to end distance R and show how curved
chains can be distinguihed from WLC using loop formation probability.
