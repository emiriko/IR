We report measurements of the Fermi surface (FS) of the ternary phosphide
SrFe$_2$P$_2$ using the de Haas-van Alphen effect. The calculated FS of this
compound is very similar to SrFe$_2$As$_2$, the parent compound of the high
temperature superconductors. Our data show that the Fermi surface is composed
of two electron and two hole sheets in agreement with bandstructure
calculations. Several of the sheets show strong c-axis warping emphasizing the
importance of three-dimensionality in the non-magnetic state of the ternary
pnictides. We find that the electron and hole pockets have a different
topology, implying that this material does not satisfy a nesting condition.
