We use the self-consistent mean-field theory to discuss the ground state and
decay properties of $\Lambda$ hypernuclei. We first discuss the deformation of
$\Lambda$ hypernuclei using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) approach. We show
that, although most of hypernuclei have a similar deformation parameter to the
core nucleus, the shape of $^{28}$Si is drastically altered, from oblately
deformed to spherical, if a $\Lambda$ particle is added to this nucleus. We
then discuss the pionic weak decay of neutron-rich $\Lambda$ hypernuclei using
the Skyrme Hartree-Fock + BCS method. We show that, for a given isotope chain,
the decay rate increases as a function of mass number, due to the strong
neutron-proton interaction.
