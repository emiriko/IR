We utilize classical molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the
intrinsic loss mechanisms of monolayer graphene nanoresonators undergoing
flexural oscillations. We find that spurious edge modes of vibration, which
arise not due to externally applied stresses but intrinsically due to the
different vibrational properties of edge atoms, are the dominant intrinsic loss
mechanism that reduces the Q-factors. We additionally find that while hydrogen
passivation of the free edges is ineffective in reducing the spurious edge
modes, fixing the free edges is critical to removing the spurious edge-induced
vibrational states. Our atomistic simulations also show that the Q-factor
degrades inversely proportional to temperature; furthermore, we also
demonstrate that the intrinsic losses can be reduced significantly across a
range of operating temperatures through the application of tensile mechanical
strain.
