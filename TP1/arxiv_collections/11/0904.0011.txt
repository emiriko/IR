We establish unique continuation for various discrete nonlinear wave
equations. For example, we show that if two solutions of the Toda lattice
coincide for one lattice point in some arbitrarily small time interval, then
they coincide everywhere. Moreover, we establish analogous results for the
Toda, Kac-van Moerbeke, and Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchies. Although all these
equations are integrable, the proof does not use integrability and can be
adapted to other equations as well.
