Recently, motivated by the study of vectorized stream cipher systems, the
joint linear complexity and joint minimal polynomial of multisequences have
been investigated. Let S be a linear recurring sequence over finite field
F_{q^m} with minimal polynomial h(x) over F_{q^m}. Since F_{q^m} and F_{q}^m
are isomorphic vector spaces over the finite field F_q, S is identified with an
m-fold multisequence S^{(m)} over the finite field F_q. The joint minimal
polynomial and joint linear complexity of the m-fold multisequence S^{(m)} are
the minimal polynomial and linear complexity over F_q of S respectively. In
this paper, we study the minimal polynomial and linear complexity over F_q of a
linear recurring sequence S over F_{q^m} with minimal polynomial h(x) over
F_{q^m}. If the canonical factorization of h(x) in F_{q^m}[x] is known, we
determine the minimal polynomial and linear complexity over F_q of the linear
recurring sequence S over F_{q^m}.
