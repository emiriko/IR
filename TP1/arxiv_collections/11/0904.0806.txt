We prove several global existence theorems for spacetimes with toroidal or
hyperbolic symmetry with respect to a geometrically defined time. More
specifically, we prove that generically, the maximal Cauchy development of
$T^2$-symmetric initial data with positive cosmological constant $\Lambda >0$,
in the vacuum or with Vlasov matter, may be covered by a global areal foliation
with the area of the symmetry orbits tending to zero in the contracting
direction. We then prove the same result for surface symmetric spacetimes in
the hyperbolic case with Vlasov matter and $\Lambda \ge 0$. In all cases, there
is no restriction on the size of initial data.
