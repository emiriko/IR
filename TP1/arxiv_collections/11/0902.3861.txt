Formal methods provide remarkable tools allowing for high levels of
confidence in the correctness of developments. Their use is therefore
encouraged, when not required, for the development of systems in which safety
or security is mandatory. But effectively specifying a secure system or
deriving a secure implementation can be tricky. We propose a review of some
classical `gotchas' and other possible sources of concerns with the objective
to improve the confidence in formal developments, or at least to better assess
the actual confidence level.
