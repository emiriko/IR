We study axion cosmology in a 5D Universe, in the case of flat and warped
extra dimension. The comparison between theoretical predictions and
observations constrains the 5D axion decay constant and the 5D Planck mass,
which has to be taken into account in building 5D axion models. The framework
developed in this paper can be readily applied to other bulk fields in brane
universes.
