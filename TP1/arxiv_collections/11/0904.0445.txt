We study the few-electron eigenspectrum of a nanotube quantum dot with
spin-orbit coupling. The two-electron phase diagram as a function of the length
of the dot and the applied parallel magnetic field shows clear signatures of
both spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interaction. Below a certain
critical length, ground state transitions are correctly predicted by a
single-particle picture and are mainly independent of the length of the dot
despite the presence of strong correlations. However, for longer quantum dots
the critical magnetic field strongly decreases with increasing length, which is
a pure interaction effect. In fact, the new ground state is spin- and
valley-polarized, which implies a strong occupation of higher longitudinal
modes.
