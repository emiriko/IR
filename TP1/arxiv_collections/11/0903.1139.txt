Constraint propagation is one of the techniques central to the success of
constraint programming. To reduce search, fast algorithms associated with each
constraint prune the domains of variables. With global (or non-binary)
constraints, the cost of such propagation may be much greater than the
quadratic cost for binary constraints. We therefore study the computational
complexity of reasoning with global constraints. We first characterise a number
of important questions related to constraint propagation. We show that such
questions are intractable in general, and identify dependencies between the
tractability and intractability of the different questions. We then demonstrate
how the tools of computational complexity can be used in the design and
analysis of specific global constraints. In particular, we illustrate how
computational complexity can be used to determine when a lesser level of local
consistency should be enforced, when constraints can be safely generalized,
when decomposing constraints will reduce the amount of pruning, and when
combining constraints is tractable.
