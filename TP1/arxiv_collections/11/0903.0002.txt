Determining the magnetic field of solar spicules is vital for developing
adequate models of these plasma jets, which are thought to play a key role in
the thermal, dynamic, and magnetic structure of the chromosphere. Here we
report on magnetic spicule properties in a very quiet region of the off-limb
solar atmosphere, as inferred from new spectropolarimetric observations in the
HeI 10830 A triplet. We have used a novel inversion code for Stokes profiles
caused by the joint action of atomic level polarization and the Hanle and
Zeeman effects (HAZEL) to interpret the observations. Magnetic fields as strong
as 40G were unambiguously detected in a very localized area of the slit, which
may represent a possible lower value of the field strength of organized network
spicules.
