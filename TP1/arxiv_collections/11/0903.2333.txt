A monatomic simple liquid in two dimensions, where atoms interact
isotropically through the Lennard-Jones-Gauss potential [M. Engel and H.-R.
Trebin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 225505 (2007)], is vitrified by the use of a rapid
cooling technique in a molecular dynamics simulation. Transformation to a
crystalline state is investigated at various temperatures and the
time-temperature-transformation (TTT) curve is determined. It is found that the
transformation time to a crystalline state is the shortest at a temerature 14%
below the melting temperature Tm and that at temperatures below Tv = 0.6 Tm the
transformation time is much longer than the available CPU time. This indicates
that a long-lived glassy state is realized for T < Tv.
