In an earlier paper, we proved that, under certain hypotheses, the moduli
space of an asymptotically cylindrical special Lagrangian submanifold with
fixed boundary of an asymptotically cylindrical Calabi-Yau 3-fold is a smooth
manifold. Here we prove the analogous result for an asymptotically cylindrical
special Lagrangian submanifold with moving boundary.
