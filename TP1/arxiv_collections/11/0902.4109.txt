We study the process $p\bar{p} \to \Lambda_c \bar{\Lambda}_c$ within the
generalized parton picture. Our starting point is the double handbag diagram
which factorizes into soft generalized parton distributions and a hard
subprocess amplitude for $u \bar{u} \to c \bar{c}$. Our cross-section
predictions may become interesting in view of forthcoming experiments at FAIR
in Darmstadt.
