We derive the Mode Coupling Theory (MCT) of the glass transition as a Landau
theory, formulated as an expansion of the exact dynamical equations in the
difference between the correlation function and its plateau value. This sheds
light on the universality of MCT predictions. While our expansion generates
higher order non-local corrections that modify the standard MCT equations, we
find that the square root singularity of the order parameter, the scaling
function in the \beta regime and the functional relation between the exponents
defining the \alpha and \beta timescales are universal and left intact by these
corrections.
