We study a percolation problem based on critical loop configurations of the
O($n$) loop model on the honeycomb lattice. We define dual clusters as groups
of sites on the dual triangular lattice that are not separated by a loop, and
investigate the the bond-percolation properties of these dual clusters. The
universal properties at the percolation threshold are argued to match those of
Kasteleyn-Fortuin random clusters in the critical Potts model. This relation is
checked numerically by means of cluster simulations of several O($n$) models in
the range $1\leq n \leq 2$. The simulation results include the percolation
threshold for several values of $n$, as well as the universal exponents
associated with bond dilution and the size distribution of the diluted clusters
at the percolation threshold. Our numerical results for the exponents are in
agreement with existing Coulomb gas results for the random-cluster model, which
confirms the relation between both models. We discuss the renormalization flow
of the bond-dilution parameter $p$ as a function of $n$, and provide an
expression that accurately describes a line of unstable fixed points as a
function of $n$, corresponding with the percolation threshold. Furthermore, the
renormalization scenario indicates the existence, in $p$ versus $n$ diagram,
another line of fixed points at $p=1$, which is stable with respect to $p$.
