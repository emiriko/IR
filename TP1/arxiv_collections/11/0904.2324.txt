We report a numerical analysis of the Anderson transition in a
quantum-chaotic system, the quasiperiodic kicked rotor with three
incommensurate frequencies. It is shown that this dynamical system exhibits the
same critical phenomena as the truly random 3D-Anderson model. By taking proper
account of systematic corrections to one-parameter scaling, the universality of
the critical exponent is demonstrated. Our result $\nu = 1.59 \pm 0.01$ is in
perfect agreement with the value found for the Anderson model.
