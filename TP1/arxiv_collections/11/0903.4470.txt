We study the effect that FCNC interactions of the top quark will have on the
branching ratio of charged decays of the top quark. We have performed an
integrated analysis using Tevatron and B-factories data and with just the
further assumption that the CKM matrix is unitary we can obtain very
restrictive bounds on the strong and electroweak FCNC branching ratios Br(t ->
q X) < 4.0 10^{-4}, where X is any vector boson and a sum in q = u,c is
implied.
