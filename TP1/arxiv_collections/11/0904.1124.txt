Using the irreducible tensor-operator technique, we establish the relation
between different forms of spin tomograms. Quantizer and dequantizer operators
are presented in simple explicit forms and are specified for the low-spin
states. The kernel of the star-product is evaluated for qubits and qutrits and
its connection with a generic formula is found.
