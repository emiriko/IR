We describe analytically and numerically the process of population transfer
by stimulated Raman adiabatic passage through a bright state when the pulses
propagate in a medium. Limitations of the adiabaticity are analyzed and
interpreted in terms of reshaping of the pulses. We find parameters for the
pulses for which the population transfer is nearly complete over long
distances.
