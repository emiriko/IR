We present here the results of our research for B-type pulsators in low
metallicity environments, searching for short-term periodic variability in a
large sample of B and Be stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MC), for which the
fundamental astrophysical parameters were accurately determined. A significant
number of beta Cephei and SPB-like pulsators at low-metallicity have been
detected, conflicting with the current theoretical models of pulsation. In
addition, we have placed these pulsating stars in the HR diagram mapping the
observational instability regions for the MC metallicities. The large sample of
B and Be stars analysed allows 5Aus to make a reliable statistics of the
pulsating B-type stars in the MC. Finally, we have made a comparison between
pulsational theory and observations in low metallicity environments.
