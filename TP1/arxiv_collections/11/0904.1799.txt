Basing on the density functional theory of fermion condensation, we analyze
the non-Fermi liquid behavior of strongly correlated Fermi-systems such as
heavy-fermion metals. When deriving equations for the effective mass of
quasiparticles, we consider solids with a lattice and homogeneous systems. We
show that the low-temperature thermodynamic and transport properties are formed
by quasiparticles, while the dependence of the effective mass on temperature,
number density, magnetic fields, etc gives rise to the non-Fermi liquid
behavior. Our theoretical study of the heat capacity, magnetization, energy
scales, the longitudinal magnetoresistance and magnetic entropy are in good
agreement with the remarkable recent facts collected on the heavy-fermion metal
YbRh2Si2.
