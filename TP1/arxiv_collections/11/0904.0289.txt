Using method of quantum trajectories we study the behavior of two identical
or different superconducting qubits coupled to a quantum dissipative driven
resonator. Above a critical coupling strength the qubit rotations become
synchronized with the driving field phase and their evolution becomes entangled
even if two qubits may significantly differ from one another. Such entangled
qubits can radiate entangled photons that opens new opportunities for entangled
wireless communication in a microwave range.
