We describe SPICE: Simulation Package for Including Flavor in Collider
Events. SPICE takes as input two ingredients: a standard flavor-conserving
supersymmetric spectrum and a set of flavor-violating slepton mass parameters,
both of which are specified at some high "mediation" scale. SPICE then combines
these two ingredients to form a flavor-violating model, determines the
resulting low-energy spectrum and branching ratios, and outputs HERWIG and SUSY
LesHouches files, which may be used to generate collider events. The
flavor-conserving model may be any of the standard supersymmetric models,
including minimal supergravity, minimal gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking,
and anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking supplemented by a universal scalar
mass. The flavor-violating contributions may be specified in a number of ways,
from specifying charges of fields under horizontal symmetries to completely
specifying all flavor-violating parameters. SPICE is fully documented and
publicly available, and is intended to be a user-friendly aid in the study of
flavor at the Large Hadron Collider and other future colliders.
