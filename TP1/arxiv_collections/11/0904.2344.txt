The quasiparticle dynamics of electrons in a magnetically ordered state is
investigated by high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission of Ni(110) at 10
K. The self-energy is extracted for high binding energies reaching up to 500
meV, using a Gutzwiller calculation as a reference frame for correlated
quasiparticles. Significant deviations exist in the 300 meV range, as
identified on magnetic bulk bands for the first time. The discrepancy is
strikingly well described by a self-energy model assuming interactions with
spin excitations. Implications relating to different electron-electron
correlation regimes are discussed.
