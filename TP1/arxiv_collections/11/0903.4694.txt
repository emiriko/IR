The collective behavior in a variant of Schelling's segregation model is
characterized with methods borrowed from statistical physics, in a context
where their relevance was not conspicuous. A measure of segregation based on
cluster geometry is defined and several quantities analogous to those used to
describe physical lattice models at equilibrium are introduced. This physical
approach allows to distinguish quantitatively several regimes and to
characterize the transitions between them, leading to the building of a phase
diagram. Some of the transitions evoke empirical sudden ethnic turnovers. We
also establish links with 'spin-1' models in physics. Our approach provides
generic tools to analyze the dynamics of other socio-economic systems.
