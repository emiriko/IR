We present a non-neutral stochastic model for the dynamics taking place in a
meta-community ecosystems in presence of migration. The model provides a
framework for describing the emergence of multiple ecological scenarios and
behaves in two extreme limits either as the unified neutral theory of
biodiversity or as the Bak-Sneppen model. Interestingly, the model shows a
condensation phase transition where one species becomes the dominant one, the
diversity in the ecosystems is strongly reduced and the ecosystem is
non-stationary. This phase transition extend the principle of competitive
exclusion to open ecosystems and might be relevant for the study of the impact
of invasive species in native ecologies.
