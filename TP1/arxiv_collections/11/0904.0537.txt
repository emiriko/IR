Joel Scherk (1946--1980) was an important early contributor to the
development of string theory. Together with various collaborators, he made
numerous profound and influential contributions to the subject throughout the
decade of the 1970s. On the occasion of a conference at the Ecole Normale
Superieure in 2000 that was dedicated to the memory of Joel Scherk I gave a
talk entitled "Reminiscences of Collaborations with Joel Scherk". The present
article, an expanded version of that one, also discusses work in which I was
not involved.
