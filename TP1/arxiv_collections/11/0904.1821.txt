We present the results of X-ray spectral analysis of the superbubble around
the OB association LH9 in the H II complex N11 in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
Using observations from Suzaku, we have modeled the X-ray emission over the
energy range 0.2-7.5 keV. We constrained the thermal spectrum below 2 keV using
a thermal plasma model found in a previous XMM-Newton study of the N11 region.
We find that the hard X-ray emission (> 2 keV) requires a nonthermal power-law
component. The photon index of this component was found to be $\Gamma=1.72\pm
0.15$. We performed an energy budget analysis for N11 using the known stellar
content of LH9. We found that the observed thermal and kinetic energy in the
superbubble is only half of the expected mechanical energy injected by stars.
