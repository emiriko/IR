We examine the propagation of collisionless particles emitted from a
spherical shell to infinity. The number distribution at infinity, calculated as
a function of the polar angle, exhibits a small deviation from uniformity. The
number of particles moving from the polar region toward the equatorial plane is
slightly larger than that of particles in the opposite direction, for an
emission radius $ > 4.5M$ in extreme Kerr space-time. This means that the black
hole spin exerts an anti-collimation effect on the particles stream propagating
along the rotation axis. We also confirm this property in the weak field limit.
The quadrupole moment of the central object produces a force toward the
equatorial plane. For a smaller emission radius $r<4.5M$, the absorption of
particles into the black hole, the non-uniformity and/or the anisotropy of the
emission distribution become much more important.
