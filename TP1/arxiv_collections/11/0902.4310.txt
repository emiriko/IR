In the bulk state, the Ising FCC antiferromagnet is fully frustrated and is
known to have a very strong first-order transition. In this paper, we study the
nature of this phase transition in the case of a thin film, as a function of
the film thickness. Using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, we show that the
transition remains first order down to a thickness of four FCC cells. It
becomes clearly second order at a thickness of two FCC cells, i.e. four atomic
layers. It is also interesting to note that the presence of the surface reduces
the ground state (GS) degeneracy found in the bulk. For the two-cell thickness,
the surface magnetization is larger than the interior one. It undergoes a
second-order phase transition at a temperature $T_C$ while interior spins
become disordered at a lower temperature $T_D$. This loss of order is
characterized by a peak of the interior spins susceptibility and a peak of the
specific heat which do not depend on the lattice size suggesting that either it
is not a real transition or it is a Kosterlitz-Thouless nature. The surface
transition, on the other hand, is shown to be of second order with critical
exponents deviated from those of pure 2D Ising universality class. We also show
results obtained from the Green's function method. Discussion is given.
