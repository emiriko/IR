There has been much interest in developing methods for transferring quantum
information. We discuss a way to transfer quantum information between two
trapped ions through a wire. The motion of a trapped ion induces oscillating
charges in the trap electrodes. By sending this current to the electrodes of a
nearby second trap, the motions of ions in the two traps are coupled. We
investigate the electrostatics of a set-up where two separately trapped ions
are coupled through an electrically floating wire. We also discuss experimental
issues, including possible sources of decoherence.
