We explore electron transport in a thin cylinder, attached to two
semi-infinite one-dimensional metallic electrodes, in the presence of both
longitudinal and transverse magnetic fluxes. A simple tight-binding model is
used to describe the system, where all the calculations are performed in the
Green's function formalism. Quite surprisingly it is observed that, typical
current amplitude oscillates as a function of the transverse magnetic flux,
associated with conductance-energy characteristics, showing $N\phi_0$
flux-quantum periodicity, where $N$ and $\phi_0$ $(=ch/e)$ correspond to the
system size and elementary flux-quantum respectively. The analysis might be
helpful in fabricating mesoscopic switching devices, where a particular
response can be delayed by tuning the system size $N$.
