The degree of intermittency of the magnetic field of a large-scale dynamo is
considered. Based on simulations it is argued that there is a tendency for the
field to become more diffuse and non-intermittent as the dynamo saturates. The
simulations are idealized in that the turbulence is strongly helical and shear
is strong, so the tendency for the field to become more diffuse is somewhat
exaggerated. Earlier results concerning the effects of magnetic buoyancy are
discussed. It is emphasized that the resulting magnetic buoyancy is weak
compared with the stronger effects of simultaneous downward pumping. These
findings are used to support the notion that the solar dynamo might operate in
a distributed fashion where the near-surface shear layer could play an
important role.
