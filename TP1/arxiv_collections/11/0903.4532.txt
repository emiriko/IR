Within the MSSM and SM frameworks, we analyze the 1loop electroweak (EW)
predictions for the helicity amplitudes describing the 17 processes $gg\to
HH'$, and the 9 processes $gg\to VH$; where $H,H'$ denote Higgs or Goldstone
bosons, while $V= Z, ~W^\pm$. Concentrating on MSSM, we then investigate how
the asymptotic helicity conservation (HCns) property of SUSY, affects the
amplitudes at the LHC energy range; and what is the corresponding situation in
SM, where no HCns theorem exists. HCns is subsequently used to construct many
relations among the cross sections of the above MSSM processes, depending only
on the angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$. These relations should be asymptotically
exact, but with mass-depending deviations appearing, as the energy decreases
towards the LHC range. Provided the SUSY scale is not too high, they may remain
roughly correct, even at the LHC energy range.
