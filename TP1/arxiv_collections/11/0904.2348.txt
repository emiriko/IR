The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, successfully launched on June 11th,
2008, is the next generation satellite experiment for high-energy gamma-ray
astronomy. The main instrument, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), with a
wide field of view (> 2 sr), a large effective area (> 8000 cm2 at 1 GeV),
sub-arcminute source localization, a large energy range (20 MeV - 300 GeV) and
a good energy resolution (close to 8% at 1 GeV), has excellent potential to
either discover or to constrain a Dark Matter signal. The Fermi LAT team
pursues complementary searches for signatures of particle Dark Matter in
different search regions such as the galactic center, galactic satellites and
subhalos, the milky way halo, extragalactic regions as well as the search for
spectral lines. In these proceedings we examine the potential of the LAT to
detect gamma-rays coming from Weakly Interacting Massive Particle annihilations
in these regions with special focus on the galactic center region.
