We document Fortran MPI checkerboard code for Markov Chain Monte Carlo
simulations of pure SU(3) lattice gauge theory with the Wilson action on a
D-dimensional double-layered torus. This includes the usual torus with periodic
boundary conditions as an optional case. We use Cabibbo-Marinari heatbath
checkerboard updating. Parallelization on sublattices is implemented in all D
directions and can be restricted to less than D directions. The parallelization
techniques of this paper can be used for any model with interactions of link
variables defined on plaquettes.
