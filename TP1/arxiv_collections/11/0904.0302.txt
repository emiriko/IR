Intense experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated that the
anisotropic triangular lattice as realized in the kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2X family of
organic charge transfer (CT) salts yields a complex phase diagram with
magnetic, superconducting, Mott insulating and even spin liquid phases. With
extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations we refresh the link
between manybody theory and experiment by determining hopping parameters of the
underlying Hubbard model. This leads us to revise the widely used semiempirical
parameters in the direction of less frustrated, more anisotropic triangular
lattices. The implications of these results on the systems' description are
discussed.
