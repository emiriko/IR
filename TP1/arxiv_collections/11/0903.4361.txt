The R&D Collaboration SiLC (Silicon tracking for Linear Colliders) is based
on generic R&D aiming to develop the next generation of large Silicon tracking
systems for the Linear collider experiments; it serves all three ILC detector
concepts. There is a strong involvement in ILD, a natural collaboration with
SiD and recent 4th concept interest to use Silicon tracking technology as well.
Here is a very brief summary of the latest results on sensors, Front End
Electronics, Mechanics and Integration issues, test bench and test beam results
and where to go from there.
