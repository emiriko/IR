In this letter we discuss the Higgs mechanism in the linear and static
translational gauge theory of dislocations. We investigate the role of the
Nambu-Goldstone field and the Proca field in the dislocation gauge theory. In
addition, we give the constitutive relations for (homogeneous) anisotropic,
hemitropic and isotropic materials and also stress function tensors for the
gauge theory of dislocations.
