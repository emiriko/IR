We study the billiard map corresponding to a periodic Lorentz gas in
2-dimensions in the presence of small holes in the table. We allow holes in the
form of open sets away from the scatterers as well as segments on the
boundaries of the scatterers. For a large class of smooth initial
distributions, we establish the existence of a common escape rate and
normalized limiting distribution. This limiting distribution is conditionally
invariant and is the natural analogue of the SRB measure of a closed system.
Finally, we prove that as the size of the hole tends to zero, the limiting
distribution converges to the smooth invariant measure of the billiard map.
