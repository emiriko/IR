Sound generation and -interaction is highly complex, nonlinear and
self-organized. Already 150 years ago Lord Rayleigh raised the following
problem: Two nearby organ pipes of different fundamental frequencies sound
together almost inaudibly with identical pitch. This effect is now understood
qualitatively by modern synchronization theory (M. Abel et al., J. Acoust. Soc.
Am., 119(4), 2006). For a detailed, quantitative investigation, we substituted
one pipe by an electric speaker. We observe that even minute driving signals
force the pipe to synchronization, thus yielding three decades of
synchronization -- the largest range ever measured to our knowledge.
Furthermore, a mutual silencing of the pipe is found, which can be explained by
self-organized oscillations, of use for novel methods of noise abatement.
Finally, we develop a specific nonlinear reconstruction method which yields a
perfect quantitative match of experiment and theory.
