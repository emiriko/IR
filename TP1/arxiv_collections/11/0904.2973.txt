Results of a two-particle correlation analysis of high-$p_t$ charged
particles in Pb-Au collisions at 158$A$ GeV/$c$ are presented. The data have
been recorded by the CERES experiment at the CERN-SPS. The correlations are
studied as function of transverse momentum, particle charge and collision
centrality. We observe a jet-like structure in the vicinity of a high-$p_t$
trigger particle and a broad back-to-back distribution. The yields of
associated particles per trigger show a strong dependence on the
trigger/associate charge combination. A comparison to PYTHIA confirms the
jet-like pattern at the near-side but suggests a strong modification at the
away-side, implying significant energy transfer of the hard-scattered parton to
the medium.
