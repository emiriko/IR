A general nonlinear logistic equation has been proposed to model long-time
saturation in industrial growth. An integral solution of this equation has been
derived for any arbitrary degree of nonlinearity. A time scale for the onset of
nonlinear saturation in industrial growth can be estimated from an
equipartition condition between nonlinearity and purely exponential growth.
Precise predictions can be made about the limiting values of the annual revenue
and the human resource content that an industrial organisation may attain.
These variables have also been modelled to set up an autonomous first-order
dynamical system, whose equilibrium condition forms a stable node (an attractor
state) in a related phase portrait. The theoretical model has received close
support from all relevant data pertaining to the well-known global company,
IBM.
