In a very interesting recent Letter\cite{berg}, the authors suggested that a
novel form of superconducting state is realized in La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ with
$x$ close to 1/8. This suggestion was based on experiments\cite{li} on this
compound which found predominantly two-dimensional (2D) characters of the
superconducting state, with extremely weak interplane coupling. Later this
specific form of superconducting state was termed striped
superconductors\cite{berg08}. The purpose of this note is to point out that the
suggested form\cite{berg} of the superconducting order parameter can be
detected directly using magnetic field modulated Josephson effect.
