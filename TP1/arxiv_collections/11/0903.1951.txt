In this paper, we prove maximal inequalities and study the functional central
limit theorem for the partial sums of linear processes generated by dependent
innovations. Due to the general weights, these processes can exhibit long-range
dependence and the limiting distribution is a fractional Brownian motion. The
proofs are based on new approximations by a linear process with martingale
difference innovations. The results are then applied to study an estimator of
the isotonic regression when the error process is a (possibly long-range
dependent) time series.
