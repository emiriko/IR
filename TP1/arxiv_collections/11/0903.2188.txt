Fuzzy reasoning is a very productive research field that during the last
years has provided a number of theoretical approaches and practical
implementation prototypes. Nevertheless, the classical implementations, like
Fril, are not adapted to the latest formal approaches, like multi-adjoint logic
semantics. Some promising implementations, like Fuzzy Prolog, are so general
that the regular user/programmer does not feel comfortable because either
representation of fuzzy concepts is complex or the results difficult to
interpret. In this paper we present a modern framework, Rfuzzy, that is
modelling multi-adjoint logic. It provides some extensions as default values
(to represent missing information, even partial default values) and typed
variables. Rfuzzy represents the truth value of predicates through facts, rules
and functions. Rfuzzy answers queries with direct results (instead of
constraints) and it is easy to use for any person that wants to represent a
problem using fuzzy reasoning in a simple way (by using the classical
representation with real numbers).
