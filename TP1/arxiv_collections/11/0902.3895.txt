The measurement of the quasi-free production of the eta prime meson has been
carried out at the COSY-11 detection setup using a proton beam and a deuteron
cluster target. The energy dependence of the cross section is extracted using a
fixed proton beam momentum of p_beam=3.35 GeV/c and exploiting the Fermi
momenta of nucleons inside deuterons. The data cover a range of centre-of-mass
excess energies from 0 to 24 MeV. Due to the low statistics at the present
stage only upper limits for the cross sections could be extracted. In this
article we focus on the functioning and efficiency determination of the neutron
detector.
