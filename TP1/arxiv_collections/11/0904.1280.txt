While Special and General Relativity are well known by a very large number of
people, Einstein's religious convinctions are almost ignored. The paper focuses
on what was his view about immortality. Einstein believed in Spinoza's view of
God and in cosmic religion. Since the Special Relativity implies a kind of
superdeterminism with the future completely determined,that can be taken as
ontological proof for the non-Existence of an hypothetical God. Because of that
K.Popper in a private conversation with him said: "You are Parmenides".
Einstein's Pantheism was in contrast with the non-Euclidean universe of Special
Relativity. In conclusion the interest in our times of his Weltanschaung will
be taken in consideration.
