We propose Range and Roots which are two common patterns useful for
specifying a wide range of counting and occurrence constraints. We design
specialised propagation algorithms for these two patterns. Counting and
occurrence constraints specified using these patterns thus directly inherit a
propagation algorithm. To illustrate the capabilities of the Range and Roots
constraints, we specify a number of global constraints taken from the
literature. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that propagating counting and
occurrence constraints using these two patterns leads to a small loss in
performance when compared to specialised global constraints and is competitive
with alternative decompositions using elementary constraints.
