In this paper we present a mathematical analysis for a steady-state laminar
boundary layer flow, governed by the Ostwald-de Wael power-law model of an
incompressible non- Newtonian fluid past a semi-infinite power-law stretched
flat plate with uniform free stream velocity. A generalization of the usual
Blasius similarity transformation is used to find similarity solutions [1].
Under appropriate assumptions, partial differential equations are transformed
into an autonomous third-order nonlinear degenerate ordinary differential
equation with boundary conditions. Using a shooting method, we establish the
existence of an infinite number of global unbounded solutions. The asymptotic
behavior is also discussed. Some properties of those solutions depend on the
viscosity power-law index.
