General features of generation of the cosmological charge asymmetry in CPT
non-invariant world are discussed. If the effects of CPT violation manifest
themselves only in mass differences of particles and antiparticles, the baryon
asymmetry of the universe hardly can be explained solely by breaking of CPT
invariance. However, CPT non-invariant theories may lead to a new effect of
distorting the usual equilibrium distributions. If this takes place, CPT
violation may explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe.
