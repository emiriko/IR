We search for spherically symmetric, stationary solutions with a string gas
shell as a source. The requirement of a uniform newtonian potential, or
constancy of the 00 component of the metric, implies the existence of a "dual"
radiation, which we argue can be interpreted as representing the virtual
quantum fluctuations that stabilize the shell. A string hedgehog can be
introduced also into the solution. For zero or small hedgehog strength the
string gas shell is of a regular nature, while the dual radiation is of a
spacelike nature. For higher hedgehog strengths however the radiation
"materializes" and becomes timelike while the string gas shell becomes space
like. The significance of these solutions for the quantum theory is discussed.
