We propose a method to probe dispersive atom-surface interactions by
measuring via two-photon Bragg spectroscopy the dynamic structure factor of a
Bose-Einstein condensate above corrugated surfaces. This method takes advantage
of the condensate coherence to reveal the spatial Fourier components of the
lateral Casimir-Polder interaction energy.
