An analytical solution of fluctuating-charge models using Gaussian
elimination allows us to isolate the contribution of charge conservation
effects in determining the charge distribution. We use this analytical solution
to calculate dipole moments and polarizabilities and show that charge
conservation plays a critical role in maintaining the correct translational
properties of the electrostatic properties predicted by these models.
