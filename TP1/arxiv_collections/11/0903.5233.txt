We demonstrate the collapse and revival features of the entanglement dynamics
of different polarization-entangled photon states in a non-Markovian
environment. Using an all-optical experimental setup, we show that entanglement
can be revived even after it suffers from sudden death. A maximally revived
state is shown to violate a Bell's inequality with 4.1 standard deviations
which verifies its quantum nature. The revival phenomenon observed in this
experiment provides an intriguing perspective on entanglement dynamics.
