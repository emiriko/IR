Murota et al. have recently developed a theory of discrete convex analysis
which concerns M-convex functions on jump systems. We introduce here a family
of M-concave functions arising naturally from polynomials (over a field of
generalized Puiseux series) with prescribed non-vanishing properties. This
family contains several of the most studied M-concave functions in the
literature. In the language of tropical geometry we study the tropicalization
of the space of polynomials with the half-plane property, and show that it is
strictly contained in the space of M-concave functions. We also provide a short
proof of Speyer's hive theorem which he used to give a new proof of Horn's
conjecture on eigenvalues of sums of Hermitian matrices.
