Using time-dependent density functional theory, applied to valence electrons,
coupled non-adiabatically to molecular dynamics of the ions, we study the
induced dynamics of ethylene subjected to the laser field. We demonstrate the
reliable quality of such an approach in comparison to the experimental data on
atomic and molecular properties. The impact of ionic motion on the ionization
is discussed showing the importance of dealing with electronic and ionic
degrees of freedom simultaneously. We explore the various excitation scenarios
of ethylene as a function of the laser parameters. We find that the Coulomb
fragmentation depends sensitively on the laser frequency. The high laser
intensity can cause brute-force Coulomb explosion and the laser pulse length
actually has influence on the excitation dynamics of ethylene.
