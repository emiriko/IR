Laser excitation of nanometer-sized atomic and molecular clusters offers
various opportunities to explore and control ultrafast many-particle dynamics.
Whereas weak laser fields allow the analysis of photoionization, excited-state
relaxation, and structural modifications on these finite quantum systems,
large-amplitude collective electron motion and Coulomb explosion can be induced
with intense laser pulses. This review provides an overview of key phenomena
arising from laser-cluster interactions with focus on nonlinear optical
excitations and discusses the underlying processes according to the current
understanding. A brief general survey covers basic cluster properties and
excitation mechanisms relevant for laser-driven cluster dynamics. Then, after
an excursion in theoretical and experimental methods, results for single- and
multiphoton excitations are reviewed with emphasis on signatures from time- and
angular resolved photoemission. A key issue of this review is the broad
spectrum of phenomena arising from clusters exposed to strong fields, where the
interaction with the laser pulse creates short-lived and dense nanoplasmas. The
implications for technical developments include the controlled generation of
ion, electron, and radiation pulses, as will be addressed along with
corresponding examples. Finally, future prospects of laser-cluster research as
well as experimental and theoretical challenges are discussed.
