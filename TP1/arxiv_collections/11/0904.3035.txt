We introduce a powerful connection between Ehrhart theory and additive number
theory, and use it to produce infinitely many new classes of inequalities
between the coefficients of the $h^*$-polynomial of a lattice polytope. This
greatly improves upon the three known classes of inequalities, which were
proved using techniques from commutative algebra and combinatorics. As an
application, we deduce all possible `balanced' inequalities between the
coefficients of the $h^*$-polynomial of a lattice polytope containing an
interior lattice point, in dimension at most 6.
