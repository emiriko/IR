We study the dynamical stability of an additional, potentially habitable
planet in the HD 47186 planetary system. Two planets are currently known in
this system: a "hot Neptune" with a period of 4.08 days and a Saturn-mass
planet with a period of 3.7 years. Here we consider the possibility that one or
more undetected planets exist between the two known planets and possibly within
the habitable zone in this system. Given the relatively low masses of the known
planets, additional planets could have masses $\lsim 10 \mearth$, and hence be
terrestrial-like and further improving potential habitability. We perform
$N$-body simulations to identify the stable zone between planets $b$ and $c$
and find that much of the inner habitable zone can harbor a $10 \mearth$
planet. With the current radial-velocity threshold of $\sim 1$ m/s, an
additional planet should be detectable if it lies at the inner edge of the
habitable zone at 0.8 AU. We also show that the stable zone could contain two
additional planets of $10 \mearth$ each if their eccentricities are lower than
$\sim 0.3$.
