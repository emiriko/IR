We show that by using an original method, bulk graphite can be bonded onto
borosilicate glass or potentially any insulating substrate with ionic
conductivity and then cleaved off to leave single or few layer graphene on the
substrate, identified optically and with Raman spectroscopy. This simple,
inexpensive and fast method leads to the preparation of large area graphene and
single or few-layer films of layered materials in general. We have prepared mm
size few-layer graphene samples and also measured I-V characteristics in a FET.
This opens up perspectives both for fundamental research as well as for
applications.
