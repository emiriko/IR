For a vector bundle E on a model of a smooth projective curve over a p-adic
number field a p-adic representation of the geometric fundamental group of X
has been defined in work with Annette Werner if the reduction of E is strongly
semistable of degree zero. In the present note we calculate the reduction of
this representation using the theory of Nori's fundamental group scheme.
