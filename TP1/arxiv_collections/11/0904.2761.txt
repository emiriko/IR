We extend Zeilberger's approach to special function identities to cases that
are not holonomic. The method of creative telescoping is thus applied to
definite sums or integrals involving Stirling or Bernoulli numbers, incomplete
Gamma function or polylogarithms, which are not covered by the holonomic
framework. The basic idea is to take into account the dimension of appropriate
ideals in Ore algebras. This unifies several earlier extensions and provides
algorithms for summation and integration in classes that had not been
accessible to computer algebra before.
