The exact range of the joined values of several R\'{e}nyi entropies is
determined. The method is based on topology with special emphasis on the
orientation of the objects studied. Like in the case when only two orders of
R\'{e}nyi entropies are studied one can parametrize upper and lower bounds but
an explicit formula for a tight upper or lower bound cannot be given.
