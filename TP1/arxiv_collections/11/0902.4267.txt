We present results from a numerical study of N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory using domain wall fermions. In this particular lattice formulation of
the theory, supersymmetry is expected to emerge accidentally in the continuum
and chiral limits without any fine-tuning of operators. Dynamical simulations
were performed for the gauge group SU(2) on 8^3x8 and 16^3x32 lattice
space-time volumes and at three different values of the coupling: beta = 2.3,
2.353 and 2.4. Results from this study include measurements of the static
potential, residual mass, and a chirally extrapolated value for the gluino
condensate at beta=2.3. In addition to these, we study the low lying
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the five dimensional Hermitian domain-wall
fermion Dirac operator and present evidence that, for the choice of parameters
under investigation, features of the spectrum appear qualitatively consistent
with strong coupling and the presence of a large residual mass. From the five
dimensional eigenvalues we explore the possibility of using the Banks-Casher
relation to determine an independent value for the gluino condensate in the
chiral limit.
