We introduce an algebra of instruction sequences by presenting a semigroup C
in which programs can be represented without directional bias: in terms of the
next instruction to be executed, C has both forward and backward instructions
and a C-expression can be interpreted starting from any instruction. We provide
equations for thread extraction, i.e., C's program semantics. Then we consider
thread extraction compatible (anti-)homomorphisms and (anti-)automorphisms.
Finally we discuss some expressiveness results.
