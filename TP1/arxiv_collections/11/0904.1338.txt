We present a general solution of third order Lovelock gravity in the presence
of a specific type II perfect fluid. This solution for linear equation of
state, $p=w(\rho-4B)$ contains all the known solutions of third order Lovelock
gravity in the literature and some new static and radiating solutions for
different values of $w$ and $B$. Specially, we consider the properties of
static and radiating solutions for $w=0$ and $w=(n-2)^{-1}$ with B=0 and
$B\neq0$. These solutions are asymptotically flat for B=0, while they are
asymptotically (anti)-de Sitter for $B\neq0$. The new static solutions for
these choices of $B$ and $w$ present black holes with one or two horizons,
extreme black holes or naked singularities provided the parameters of the
solutions are chosen suitable. The static solution with $w=0$ and vanishing
geometrical mass ($m=0$) may present a black hole with two inner and outer
horizons. This is a peculiar feature of the third order Lovelock gravity, which
does not occur in lower order Lovelock gravity. We also, investigate the
properties of radiating solutions for these values of $B$ and $w$, and compare
the singularity strengths of them with the known radiating solutions of third
order Lovelock gravity.
