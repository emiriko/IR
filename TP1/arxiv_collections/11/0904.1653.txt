The present paper provides a multi-period contagion model in the credit risk
field. Our model is an extension of Davis and Lo's infectious default model. We
consider an economy of n firms which may default directly or may be infected by
other defaulting firms (a domino effect being also possible). The spontaneous
default without external influence and the infections are described by not
necessarily independent Bernoulli-type random variables. Moreover, several
contaminations could be required to infect another firm. In this paper we
compute the probability distribution function of the total number of defaults
in a dependency context. We also give a simple recursive algorithm to compute
this distribution in an exchangeability context. Numerical applications
illustrate the impact of exchangeability among direct defaults and among
contaminations, on different indicators calculated from the law of the total
number of defaults. We then examine the calibration of the model on iTraxx data
before and during the crisis. The dynamic feature together with the contagion
effect seem to have a significant impact on the model performance, especially
during the recent distressed period.
