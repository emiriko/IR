We demonstrate a hybrid analog+digital electronic lock to stabilize a
dynamically tunable rf offset between two lasers. Our method features an 80 MHz
capture range, +/- 7 GHz tuning range, frequency agility of 1 MHz/microsecond,
and low (<30 ppm) drift in the absolute optical frequency difference after
~1000 s. With this scheme, multiple slave lasers can easily be referenced to
one stable master laser, while each remains rapidly and accurately tunable over
the wide frequency ranges encountered in typical laser cooling and trapping
experiments.
