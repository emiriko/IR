The current INFRAWEBS European research project aims at developing ICT
framework enabling software and service providers to generate and establish
open and extensible development platforms for Web Service applications. One of
the concrete project objectives is developing a full-life-cycle software
toolset for creating and maintaining Semantic Web Services (SWSs) supporting
specific applications based on Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO) framework.
According to WSMO, functional and behavioural descriptions of a SWS may be
represented by means of complex logical expressions (axioms). The paper
describes a specialized user-friendly tool for constructing and editing such
axioms - INFRAWEBS Axiom Editor. After discussing the main design principles of
the Editor, its functional architecture is briefly presented. The tool is
implemented in Eclipse Graphical Environment Framework and Eclipse Rich Client
Platform.
