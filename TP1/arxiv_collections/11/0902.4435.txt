We compute three particle correlations in the Glasma flux tube model of high
energy heavy ion collisions. We obtain a simple geometrical picture of these
correlations; when convoluted with final state radial flow, it results in
distinct predictions for the near side three particle correlation in central
heavy ion collisions.
