In order to accommodate increasingly tighter observational constraints on
dark matter, several models have been proposed recently in which dark matter
particles are charged under some hidden gauge group. Hidden gauge charges are
invisible for the standard model particles, hence such scenarios are very
difficult to constrain directly. However black holes are sensitive to all gauge
charges, whether they belong to the standard model or not. Here, we examine the
constraints on the possible values of the dark matter particle mass and hidden
gauge charge from the evolution of primordial black holes. We find that the
existence of the primordial black holes with reasonable mass is incompatible
with dark matter particles whose charge to mass ratio is of the order of one.
For dark matter particles whose charge to mass ratio is much less than one, we
are able to exclude only heavy dark matter in the mass range of 10^(11) GeV -
10^(16) GeV. Finally, for dark matter particles whose charge to mass ratio is
much greater than one, there are no useful limits coming from primordial black
holes.
