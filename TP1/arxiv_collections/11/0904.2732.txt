A technique based on using optical fiber taper waveguides for probing single
emitters embedded in thin dielectric membranes is assessed through numerical
simulations. For an appropriate membrane geometry, photoluminescence collection
efficiencies in excess of 10 % are predicted, exceeding the efficiency of
standard free-space collection by an order of magnitude. Our results indicate
that these fiber taper waveguides offer excellent prospects for performing
efficient spectroscopy of single emitters embedded in thin films, such as a
single self-assembled quantum dot in a semiconductor membrane.
