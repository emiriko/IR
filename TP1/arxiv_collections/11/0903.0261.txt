A system of functional equations relating the Euler characteristics of moduli
spaces of stable representations of quivers and the Euler characteristics of
(Hilbert scheme-type) framed versions of quiver moduli is derived. This is
applied to wall-crossing formulas for the Donaldson-Thomas type invariants of
M. Kontsevich and Y. Soibelman, in particular confirming their integrality.
