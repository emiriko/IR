We propose a scheme for building a heralded two-qutrit entangled state from
polarized photons. An optical circuit is presented to build the maximally
entangled two-qutrit state from two heralded Bell pairs and ideal threshold
detectors. Several schemes are discussed for constructing the two Bell pairs.
We also show how one can produce an unbalanced two-qutrit state that could be
of general purpose use in some protocols. In terms of applications of the
maximally entangled qutrit state, we mainly focus on how to use the state to
demonstrate a violation of the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu inequality
under the restriction of measurements which can be performed using linear
optical elements and photon counting. Other possible applications of the state,
such as for higher dimensional quantum cryptography, teleportation, and
generation of heralded two-qudit states are also briefly discussed.
