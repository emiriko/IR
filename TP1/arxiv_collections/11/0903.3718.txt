Recently achieved high intensities of short laser pulses open new prospects
in their application to hole boring in inhomogeneous overdense plasmas and for
ignition in precompressed DT fusion targets. A simple analytical model and
numerical simulations demonstrate that pulses with intensities exceeding 1022
W/cm2 may penetrate deeply into the plasma as a result of efficient
ponderomotive acceleration of ions in the forward direction. The penetration
depth as big as hundreds of microns depends on the laser fluence, which has to
exceed a few tens of GJ/cm2. The fast ions, accelerated at the bottom of the
channel with an efficiency of more than 20%, show a high directionality and may
heat the precompressed target core to fusion conditions.
