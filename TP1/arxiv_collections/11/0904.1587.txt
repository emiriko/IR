Biochemical processes typically involve huge numbers of individual reversible
steps, each with its own dynamical rate constants. For example, kinetic
proofreading processes rely upon numerous sequential reactions in order to
guarantee the precise construction of specific macromolecules. In this work, we
study the transient properties of such systems and fully characterize their
first passage (completion) time distributions. In particular, we provide
explicit expressions for the mean and the variance of the completion time for a
kinetic proofreading process and computational analyses for more complicated
biochemical systems. We find that, for a wide range of parameters, as the
system size grows, the completion time behavior simplifies: it becomes either
deterministic or exponentially distributed, with a very narrow transition
between the two regimes. In both regimes, the dynamical complexity of the full
system is trivial compared to its apparent structural complexity. Similar
simplicity is likely to arise in the dynamics of many complex multi-step
biochemical processes. In particular, these findings suggest not only that one
may not be able to understand individual elementary reactions from macroscopic
observations, but also that such understanding may be unnecessary.
