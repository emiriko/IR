We report the observation of all-optically tunable Raman fluorescence from a
single quantum dot. The Raman photons are produced in an optically-driven
Lambda-system defined by subjecting the single electron charged quantum dot to
a magnetic field in Voigt geometry. Detuning the driving laser from resonance,
we tune the frequency of the Raman photons by about 2.5 GHz. The number of
scattered photons and the linewdith of the Raman photons are investigated as a
function of detuning. The study presented here could form the basis of a new
technique for investigating spin-bath interactions in the solid state.
