The manipulation of geometrically constrained magnetic domain walls (DWs) in
nanoscale magnetic strips has attracted much interest recently, with proposals
for prospective memory and logic devices. Here we propose to use the high
controllability of the motion of geometrically constrained DWs for the
manipulation of individual nanoparticles on a chip with an active control of
position at the nanometer scale. The proposed method exploits the fact that
magnetic nanoparticles in solution can be captured by a DW, whose position can
be manipulated with nanometric accuracy in a specifically designed magnetic
nanowire structure. We show that the high control over DW nucleation,
displacement, and annihilation processes in such structures can be used to
capture, transport and release magnetic nanoparticles. As magnetic particles
with functionalized surfaces are commonly used as molecule carriers or labels,
the accurate control over the handling of the single magnetic nanoparticle is
crucial for several applications including single molecule manipulation,
separation, cells manipulation and biomagnetic sensing.
