We report on the experimental observation of a novel type of polarization
locked vector soliton in a passively mode-locked fiber laser. The vector
soliton is characterized by that not only the two orthogonally polarized
soliton components are phase locked, but also one of the components has a
double-humped intensity profile. Multiple such phase-locked high order vector
solitons with identical soliton parameters and harmonic mode-locking of the
vector solitons were also obtained in the laser. Numerical simulations
confirmed the existence of stable high-order vector solitons in fiber lasers.
