Superconductors exhibit unconventional electronic and magnetic properties if
the Cooper pair wave function breaks additional symmetries of the normal phase.
Rotational symmetries in spin- and orbital spaces, as well as discrete
symmetries such as space and time inversion, may be spontaneously broken. When
this occurs in conjunction with broken global U(1) gauge symmetry, new physical
phenomena are exhibited below the superconducting transition that are
characteristic of the broken symmetries of the pair condensate. This is
particularly true of vortices and related defects. Superconductors with a
multi-component order parameter exhibit a variety of different vortex
structures and closely related defects that are not possible in condensates
belonging to a one-dimensional representation. In this article we discuss the
structure of vortices in Fermionic superfluids and superconductors which break
chiral symmetry, i.e. combined broken time-inversion and 2D parity. In
particular, we consider the structure of vortices and defects that might be
realized in thin films of 3He-A and the layered superconductor Sr2RuO4, and
identify some of the characteristic signatures of broken chiral symmetry that
should be revealed by these defects.
