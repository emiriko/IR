We formulate the theory of the two-stream instability (e-cloud instability)
with electrons trapped in quadrupole magnets. We show that a linear instability
theory can be sensibly formulated and analyzed. The growth rates are
considerably smaller than the linear growth rates for the two-stream
instability in drift spaces and are close to those actually observed.
