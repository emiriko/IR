The CeTIn5 superconductors (T=Co, Rh, or Ir) have generated great interest
due to their relatively Tc's, NFL behavior, and their proximity to AF order and
quantum critical points. In contrast to small changes with the T-species,
electron doping in CeT(In{1-x}Mx)5 with M=Sn and hole doping with Cd or Hg have
a dramatic effect on the electronic properties at very low concentrations. The
present work reports EXAFS measurements that address the substituent atom
distribution as a function of T, M, and x, near the superconducting phase.
Together with previous measurements for M=Sn, the proportion of the M atom
residing on the In(1) site, f{In(1)}, increases in the order M=Cd, Sn, and Hg,
ranging from about 40% to 70%, showing a strong preference for these
substituents to occupy the In(1) site (random=20%). In addition, f{In(1)}
ranges from 70% to 100% for M=Hg in the order T=Co, Rh, and Ir. These fractions
track the changes in the atomic radii of the various species, and help explain
the sharp dependence of Tc on substituting into the In site. However, it is
difficult to reconcile the small concentrations of M with the dramatic changes
in the ground state in the hole-doped materials with only an impurity
scattering model. These results therefore indicate that while such
substitutions have interesting local atomic structures with important
electronic and magnetic consequences, other local changes in the electronic and
magnetic structure are equally important in determining the bulk properties of
these materials.
