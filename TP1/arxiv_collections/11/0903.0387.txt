We have constructed an analytical model of AGN feedback and studied its
implications for elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters. The results show that
momentum injection above a critical value will eject material from low mass
elliptical galaxies, and leads to an X-ray luminosity, $L_{\rm X}$, that is
$\propto$ $\sigma^{8-10}$, depending on the AGN fuelling mechanism, where
$\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion of the hot gas. This result agrees well
with both observations and semi-analytic models. In more massive ellipticals
and clusters, AGN outflows quickly become buoyancy-dominated. This necessarily
means that heating by a central cluster AGN redistributes the intracluster
medium (ICM) such that the mass of hot gas, within the cooling radius, should
be $ \propto L_{\rm X}(<r_{\rm cool})/[g(r_{\rm cool})\sigma]$, where $g(r_{\rm
cool})$ is the gravitational acceleration at the cooling radius. This
prediction is confirmed using observations of seven clusters. The same
mechanism also defines a critical ICM cooling time of $\sim 0.5$ Gyr, which is
in reasonable agreement with recent observations showing that star formation
and AGN activity are triggered below a universal cooling time threshold.
