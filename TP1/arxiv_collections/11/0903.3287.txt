We present a simple framework to compute hyperbolic Voronoi diagrams of
finite point sets as affine diagrams. We prove that bisectors in Klein's
non-conformal disk model are hyperplanes that can be interpreted as power
bisectors of Euclidean balls. Therefore our method simply consists in computing
an equivalent clipped power diagram followed by a mapping transformation
depending on the selected representation of the hyperbolic space (e.g.,
Poincar\'e conformal disk or upper-plane representations). We discuss on
extensions of this approach to weighted and $k$-order diagrams, and describe
their dual triangulations. Finally, we consider two useful primitives on the
hyperbolic Voronoi diagrams for designing tailored user interfaces of an image
catalog browsing application in the hyperbolic disk: (1) finding nearest
neighbors, and (2) computing smallest enclosing balls.
