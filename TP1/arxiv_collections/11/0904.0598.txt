We discuss three practical methods for performing Eulerian rotations of
Slater determinants in a three-dimensional Cartesian geometry. In addition to
the straightforward application of the active form of the quantum mechanical
rotation operator, we introduce two methods using a passive position-space
rotation followed by an active spin-space rotation, one after variation and the
other before variation. These methods can be used to initialize reactions
involving deformed nuclei where a particular alignment of the deformed nuclei
with respect to the collision axis is desired. We show that doing the rotation
before the variation is the most efficient way of generating such initial
states.
