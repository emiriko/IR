We study B_s --> mu+ mu- in the context of the R-parity violating minimal
supergravity in the high tan beta regime. We find that the lowest value of the
branching ratio can go well below the present LHCb sensitivity and hence B_s
--> mu+ mu- can even be invisible to the LHC. We also find that the present
upper bound on Br(B_s --> mu+ mu-) puts strong constraint on the minimal
supergravity parameter space. The constraints become more severe if the upper
bound is close to its standard model prediction.
