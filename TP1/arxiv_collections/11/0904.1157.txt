An efficient conditioning technique, the so-called Brownian Bridge
simulation, has previously been applied to eliminate pricing bias that arises
in applications of the standard discrete-time Monte Carlo method to evaluate
options written on the continuous-time extrema of an underlying asset. It is
based on the simple and easy to implement analytic formulas for the
distribution of one-dimensional Brownian Bridge extremes. This paper extends
the technique to the valuation of multi-asset options with knock-out barriers
imposed for all or some of the underlying assets. We derive formula for the
unbiased option price estimator based on the joint distribution of the
multi-dimensional Brownian Bridge dependent extrema. As analytic formulas are
not available for the joint distribution in general, we develop upper and lower
biased option price estimators based on the distribution of independent extrema
and the Fr\'echet lower and upper bounds for the unknown distribution. All
estimators are simple and easy to implement. They can always be used to bind
the true value by a confidence interval. Numerical tests indicate that our
biased estimators converge rapidly to the true option value as the number of
time steps for the asset path simulation increases in comparison to the
estimator based on the standard discrete-time method. The convergence rate
depends on the correlation and barrier structures of the underlying assets.
