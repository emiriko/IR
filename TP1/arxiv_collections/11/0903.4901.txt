Results of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements at Fe
L-edges and electronic structure calculations of LiFeAs and NaFeAs are
presented. Both experiment and theory show that in the vicinity of the Fermi
energy, the density of states is dominated by contributions from Fe 3d-states.
The comparison of Fe L2,3 non-resonant and resonant (excited at L2-threshold)
X-ray emission spectra with spectra of LaOFeAs and CaFe2As2 show a great
similarity in energy and I(L2)/I(L3) intensity ratio. The I(L2)/I(L3) intensity
ratio of all FeAs-based superconductors is found to be more similar to metallic
Fe than to correlated FeO. Basing on these measurements we conclude that
iron-based superconductors are weakly or moderately correlated systems.
