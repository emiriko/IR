We study a further refinement of the standard refined enumeration of
alternating sign matrices (ASMs) according to their first two rows instead of
just the first row, and more general "d-refined" enumerations of ASMs according
to the first d rows. For the doubly-refined case of d=2, we derive a system of
linear equations satisfied by the doubly-refined enumeration numbers A_{n,i,j}
that enumerate such matrices. We give a conjectural explicit formula for
A_{n,i,j} and formulate several other conjectures about the sufficiency of the
linear equations to determine the A_{n,i,j}'s and about an extension of the
linear equations to the general d-refined enumerations.
