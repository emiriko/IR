A new method is proposed for the problem of solving chi-square minimization
with a positive solution. This method is embodied in an evolution of the
popular NNLS algorithm. Its efficiency with respect to residue minimization is
illustrated by the improvement it permits on the location of gamma-interactions
inside an AGATA HPGe detector.
