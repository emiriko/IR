The Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model with relativistic
mean fields is used to simulate $\bar p$-nucleus collisions. Antiproton
absorption cross sections and momentum distributions of annihilation products
are calculated by varying the $\bar p$ coupling strength to the mean meson
fields. Parameters of the antiproton-nucleus optical potential are extracted
from the comparison of the model calculations with experimental data.
