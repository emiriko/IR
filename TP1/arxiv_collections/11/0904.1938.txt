Magnetic fields are present in a wide variety of stars throughout the HR
diagram and play a role at basically all evolutionary stages, from
very-low-mass dwarfs to very massive stars, and from young star-forming
molecular clouds and protostellar accretion discs to evolved giants/supergiants
and magnetic white dwarfs/neutron stars. These fields range from a few microG
(e.g., in molecular clouds) to TeraG and more (e.g., in magnetic neutron
stars); in non-degenerate stars in particular, they feature large-scale
topologies varying from simple nearly-axisymmetric dipoles to complex
non-axsymmetric structures, and from mainly poloidal to mainly toroidal
topology. After recalling the main techniques of detecting and modelling
stellar magnetic fields, we review the existing properties of magnetic fields
reported in cool, hot and young non-degenerate stars and protostars, and
discuss our understanding of the origin of these fields and their impact on the
birth and life of stars.
