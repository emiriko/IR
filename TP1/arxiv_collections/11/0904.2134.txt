Confining a laser field between two high reflectivity mirrors of a
high-finesse cavity can increase the probability of a given cavity photon to be
scattered by an atom traversing the confined photon mode. This enhanced
coupling between light and atoms is successfully employed in cavity quantum
electrodynamics experiments and led to a very prolific research in quantum
optics. The idea of extending such experiments to sub-wavelength sized
nanomechanical systems has been recently proposed in the context of optical
cavity cooling. Here we present an experiment involving a single nanorod
consisting of about 10^9 atoms precisely positioned to plunge into the confined
mode of a miniature high finesse Fabry-Perot cavity. We show that the optical
transmission of the cavity is affected not only by the static position of the
nanorod but also by its vibrational fluctuation. While an imprint of the
vibration dynamics is directly detected in the optical transmission,
back-action of the light field is also anticipated to quench the nanorod
Brownian motion. This experiment shows the first step towards optical cavity
controlled dynamics of mechanical nanostructures and opens up new perspectives
for sensing and manipulation of optomechanical nanosystems.
