We show that bipartite entanglement distribution (or entanglement of
assistance) in multipartite quantum systems is by nature polygamous. We first
provide an analytic upper bound for the concurrence of assistance in bipartite
quantum systems, and derive a polygamy inequality of multipartite entanglement
in arbitrary dimensional quantum systems.
