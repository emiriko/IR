We study generic aspects of bubble dynamics in DNA under time dependent
perturbations, for example temperature change, by mapping the associated
Fokker-Planck equation to a quantum time-dependent Schroedinger equation with
imaginary time. In the static case we show that the eigenequation is exactly
the same as that of the $\beta$-deformed nuclear liquid drop model, without the
issue of non-integer angular momentum. A universal breathing dynamics is
demonstrated by using an approximate method in quantum mechanics. The
calculated bubble autocorrelation function qualitatively agrees with
experimental data. Under time dependent modulations, utilizing the adiabatic
approximation, bubble properties reveal memory effects.
