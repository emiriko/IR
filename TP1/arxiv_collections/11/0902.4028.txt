Effects of strong longitudinal color electric fields (SCF) on the open charm
production in nucleus-nucleus (A + A) collisions at 200A GeV are investigated
within the framework of the HIJING-BBbar v2.0 model. A three fold increase of
the effective string tension due to in medium effects in A + A collisions,
results in a sizeable (60-70 percents) enhancement of the total charm
production cross sections. The nuclear modification factors show a suppression
at moderate transverse momentum consistent with RHIC data. At Large Hadron
Collider energies the model predicts an increase of total charm production
cross sections by approximately an order of magnitude.
