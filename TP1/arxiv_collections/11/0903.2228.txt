A computational study of the epitaxial Co2MnSi(001)/MgO(001) interface
relevant to tunneling magnetoresistive (TMR) devices is presented. Employing ab
initio atomistic thermodynamics, we show that the Co- or MnSi-planes of
bulk-terminated Co2MnSi form stable interfaces, while pure Si or pure Mn
termination requires non-equilibrium conditions. Except for the pure Mn
interface, the half-metallic property of bulk Co2MnSi is disrupted by interface
bands. Even so, at homogeneous Mn or Co interfaces these bands contribute
little to the minority-spin conductance through an MgO barrier, and hence such
terminations could perform strongly in TMR devices.
