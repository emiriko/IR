A summary of mid-infrared continuum luminosities arising from dust is given
for very luminous galaxies, Lir > 10^12 solar luminosities, with 0.005 < z <
3.2 containing active galactic nuclei (AGN), including 115 obscured AGN and 60
unobscured (type 1) AGN. All sources have been observed with the Spitzer
Infrared Spectrograph. Obscured AGN are defined as having optical depth > 0.7
in the 9.7 um silicate absorption feature and unobscured AGN show silicate in
emission. Luminosity vLv(8 um) is found to scale as (1+z)^2.6 to z = 2.8, and
luminosities vLv(8 um) are approximately 3 times greater for the most luminous
unobscured AGN. Total infrared luminosities for the most luminous obscured AGN,
Lir(AGN_obscured) in solar luminosities, scale as log Lir(AGN_obscured) =
12.3+-0.25 + 2.6(+-0.3)log(1+z), and for the most luminous unobscured AGN,
scale as log Lir(AGN1) = 12.6+-0.15 + 2.6(+-0.3)log(1+z), indicating that the
most luminous AGN are about 10 times more luminous than the most luminous
starbursts. Results are consistent with obscured and unobscured AGN having the
same total luminosities with differences arising only from orientation, such
that the obscured AGN are observed through very dusty clouds which extinct
about 50% of the intrinsic luminosity at 8 um. Both obscured and unobscured AGN
should be detected to z ~ 6 by Spitzer surveys with fv(24 um) > 0.3 mJy, even
without luminosity evolution for z > 2.5. By contrast, the most luminous
starbursts cannot be detected for z > 3, even if luminosity evolution continues
beyond z = 2.5.
