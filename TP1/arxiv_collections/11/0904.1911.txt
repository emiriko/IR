Fourier transform is applied to annular beams of simplified flat two-level
geometry: bright outer ring with a darker core. The pattern of focal beam
profile (i.e. far field) is calculated and characterized with respect of its
intensity structure. Specific behavior is observed for extreme annularity
values.
