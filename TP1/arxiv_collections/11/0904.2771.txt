This is a collection of lecture notes from three lectures given by Alexei
Kitaev at the 2008 Les Houches summer school "Exact methods in low-dimensional
physics and quantum computing." They provide a pedagogical introduction to
topological phenomena in 1-D superconductors and in the 2-D topological phases
of the toric code and honeycomb model.
