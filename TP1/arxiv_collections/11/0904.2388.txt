In this Letter, we report the discovery of a new bright radio transient in
M82. Using the Very Large Array, we observed the nuclear region of M82 at
several epochs at 22 GHz and detected a new bright radio source in this
galaxy's central region. We find a flux density for this flaring source that is
~300 times larger than upper limits determined in previous observations. The
flare must have started between 2007 October 29 and 2008 March 24. Over the
last year, the flux density of this new source has decreased from ~100 mJy to
~11 mJy. The lightcurve (based on only three data points) can be fitted better
with an exponential decay than with a power law. Based on the current data we
cannot identify the nature of this transient source. However, a new radio
supernova seems to be the most natural explanation. With it's flux density of
more than 100 mJy, it is at least 1.5 times brighter than SN1993J in M81 at the
peak of its lightcurve at 22 GHz.
