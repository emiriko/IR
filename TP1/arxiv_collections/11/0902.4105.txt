We present infrared photometry of the episodic dust-making Wolf-Rayet system
WR19 (LS3), tracking its fading from a third observed dust-formation episode in
2007 and strengthening the view that these episodes are periodic (P =
10.1+/-0.1 y). Radial velocities of the O9 component observed between 2001 and
2008 show RV variations consistent with WC19 being a spectroscopic binary of
high eccentricity (e=0.8), having periastron passage in 2007.14, shortly before
the phase of dust formation. In this respect, WR19 resembles the archetypical
episodic dust-making colliding-wind binary system WR140.
