In the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy the globular clusters are distributed
widely, without any significant central concentration. Oh et al. pointed out
that such a distribution is paradoxical: dynamical friction effects estimated
using single-component King models would have forced the globular clusters to
spiral down to the center of the galaxy well within a Hubble time. This paper
is devoted to a discussion of this paradox. We describe a model in which the
stars of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy are embedded in a cloud of dark matter,
and each of these components is specified by its own phase space distribution
function. This model allows us to fit self-consistently the observed luminosity
profile and the spatial variation of the velocity dispersion of the stars. This
fitting yields two basic parameters, related to the central density and
velocity dispersion, that characterize the phase space distribution of dark
matter. The dynamical friction effects calculated on the basis of this
self-consistent model are small enough that the observed spatial distribution
of the globular clusters poses no difficulty, and the apparent paradox is
resolved. Thus we have at hand a model for Fornax that reproduces the main
observed features of this dwarf spheroidal galaxy.
