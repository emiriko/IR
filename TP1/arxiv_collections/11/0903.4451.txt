Solar-axion interaction rates in NaI, CsI and Xe scintillators via the
axio-electric effect were calculated. A table is presented with photoelectric
and axioelectric cross sections, solar-axion fluxes, and the interaction rates
from 2.0 to 10.0 keV. The results imply that annual-modulation data of large
NaI and CsI arrays, and large Xe scintillation chambers, might be made
sensitive enough to probe coupling to photons at levels required to explain
axion-photon oscillation phenomena proposed to explain the survival of
high-energy photons traveling cosmological distances. The DAMAA/LIBRA data are
used to demonstrate the power of the model-independent annual modulation due to
the seasonal variation in the earth sun distance.
