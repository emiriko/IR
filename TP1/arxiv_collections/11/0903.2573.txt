The cross section for inclusive charm production by a low-energy antiproton
beam is calculated using the parton model and next-to-leading order
perturbative QCD. For an antiproton beam with a momentum of 15 GeV, the charm
cross section at next-to-leading order in the QCD coupling constant changes by
more than an order of magnitude as the charm quark mass is varied from 1.3 to
1.7 GeV. The variations can be reduced by demanding that the same value of the
charm quark mass give the measured charm cross sections for fixed-target
experiments with a proton beam. The resulting estimate for the charm cross
section from a low-energy antiproton beam is large enough to allow the study of
charm meson mixing.
