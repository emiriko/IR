We have derived new abundances of the rare-earth elements Pr, Dy, Tm, Yb, and
Lu for the solar photosphere and for five very metal-poor, neutron-capture
r-process-rich giant stars. The photospheric values for all five elements are
in good agreement with meteoritic abundances. For the low metallicity sample,
these abundances have been combined with new Ce abundances from a companion
paper, and reconsideration of a few other elements in individual stars, to
produce internally-consistent Ba, rare-earth, and Hf (56<= Z <= 72) element
distributions. These have been used in a critical comparison between stellar
and solar r-process abundance mixes.
