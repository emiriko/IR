We consider pairs of a non-empty compact connected and locally connected
Hausdorff space and a real-valued continuous function. Our aim is to measure
the difference between this kind of the pairs. In this notes we introduce new
pseudodistances between pairs associated with reparametrization invariant
seminorms. We finish with an example where the use of this lower bound is
illustrated.
