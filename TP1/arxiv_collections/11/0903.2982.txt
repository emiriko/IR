The multiferroicity in a triangular spin lattice with proper-screw-spin chain
order was explored by performing density functional calculations for AgCrO2 and
analyzing the symmetry of the magnetic structure of the triangular spin
lattice. Strong geometric spin frustration exists within and between CrO2
layers, and the ferroelectric polarization originates from the spiral-spin
chain structures propagating across the proper-screw-spin chains. The
triangular spin lattice can have ferroelectric polarization parallel to its
mirror plane due to hidden symmetry.
