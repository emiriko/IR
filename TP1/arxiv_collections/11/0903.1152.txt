To model combinatorial decision problems involving uncertainty and
probability, we introduce stochastic constraint programming. Stochastic
constraint programs contain both decision variables (which we can set) and
stochastic variables (which follow a probability distribution). They combine
together the best features of traditional constraint satisfaction, stochastic
integer programming, and stochastic satisfiability. We give a semantics for
stochastic constraint programs, and propose a number of complete algorithms and
approximation procedures. Finally, we discuss a number of extensions of
stochastic constraint programming to relax various assumptions like the
independence between stochastic variables, and compare with other approaches
for decision making under uncertainty.
