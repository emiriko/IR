We show that the conventional threshold resummation calculation cannot
describe well the low energy Drell-Yan (DY) data without including the
non-perturbative correction terms which are deduced from analyzing the
asymptotic behavior of the resummation formalism. It is demonstrated that the
non-perturbative correction is generally small for the large invariant mass DY
pairs produced at the Tevatron and the LHC.
