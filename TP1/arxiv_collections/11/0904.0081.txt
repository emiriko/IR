The norm game (NG) introduced by Robert Axelrod is a convenient frame to
disccuss the time evolution of the level of preserving norms in social systems.
Recently NG was formulated in terms of a social contagion on a model social
network with two stable states: defectors or punishers. Here we calculate the
critical line between these states on the plane of parameters, which measure
the severities of punishing and of being punished. We show also that the
position of this line is more susceptible to the amount of agents who always
punish and never defect, than to those who always defect and never punish. The
process is discussed in the context of the statistical data on crimes in some
European countries close to Wroc{\l}aw - the place of this Conference - around
1990.
