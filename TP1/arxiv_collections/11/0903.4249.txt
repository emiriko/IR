We use the Mellin-Barnes representation in order to improve the theoretical
estimate of mass corrections to the width of light pseudoscalar meson decays
into a lepton pair, $P\to l^{+}l^{-}$ . The full resummation of the terms
$(M^{2}/\Lambda^{2}) ^{n},$ $(m^{2}/M^{2}) ^{n}$and $(m^{2}/\Lambda^{2}) ^{n}$
to the decay amplitude is performed, where $m$ is the lepton mass, $M$ is the
meson mass and $\Lambda\approx m_{\rho}$ is the characteristic scale of the
$P\to \gamma^{\ast}\gamma^{\ast}$ form factor. The total effect of mass
corrections is quite important for $\eta(\eta^{\prime})$ decays. We also
comment on the estimation of the hadronic light-by-light scattering
contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment in the chiral perturbation
theory.
