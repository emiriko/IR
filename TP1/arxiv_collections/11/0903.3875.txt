A generic unital positive operator-valued measure (POVM), which transforms a
given stationary pure state to an arbitrary statistical state with perfect
decoherence, is presented. This allows one to operationally realize
thermalization as a special case. The loss of information due to randomness
generated by the operation is discussed by evaluating the entropy.
Thermalization of the bipartite spin-1/2 system is discussed as an illustrative
example.
