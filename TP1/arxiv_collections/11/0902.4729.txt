This paper examines the properties of the homentropic Euler equations when
the characteristics of the equations have been spatially averaged. The new
equations are referred to as the characteristically averaged homentropic Euler
(CAHE) equations. An existence and uniqueness proof for the modified equations
is given. The speed of shocks for the CAHE equations are determined. The
Riemann problem is examined and a general form of the solutions is presented.
Finally, numerically simulations on the homentropic Euler and CAHE equations
are conducted and the behaviors of the two sets of equations are compared.
