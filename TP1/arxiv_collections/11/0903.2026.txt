The Ninja data analysis challenge allowed the study of the sensitivity of
data analysis pipelines to binary black hole numerical relativity waveforms in
simulated Gaussian noise at the design level of the LIGO observatory and the
VIRGO observatory. We analyzed NINJA data with a pipeline based on the Hilbert
Huang Transform, utilizing a detection stage and a characterization stage:
detection is performed by triggering on excess instantaneous power,
characterization is performed by displaying the kernel density enhanced (KD)
time-frequency trace of the signal. Using the simulated data based on the two
LIGO detectors, we were able to detect 77 signals out of 126 above SNR 5 in
coincidence, with 43 missed events characterized by signal to noise ratio SNR
less than 10. Characterization of the detected signals revealed the merger part
of the waveform in high time and frequency resolution, free from time-frequency
uncertainty. We estimated the timelag of the signals between the detectors
based on the optimal overlap of the individual KD time-frequency maps, yielding
estimates accurate within a fraction of a millisecond for half of the events. A
coherent addition of the data sets according to the estimated timelag
eventually was used in a characterization of the event.
