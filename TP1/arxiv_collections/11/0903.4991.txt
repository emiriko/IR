Some preliminary thoughts on how to design and develop the DAQ architecture
for the Silicon tracking system at the future Linear electron positron
collider, are briefly presented here. The proposed structure includes three DAQ
levels. The first level is based on a high level processing mix-mode ASIC
sitting on the detector. The second level still on the detector is a DSP like
interface that will send the processed data to the general DAQ system. Several
novel technological aspects are part of this development. The role of the
ongoing test beam activities with detector prototypes as training camp is
emphasized.
