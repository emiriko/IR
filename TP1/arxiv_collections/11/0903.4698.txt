We have carried out a survey of long 50ks XMM-Newton observations of a sample
of bright, variable AGN. We found a distinctive energy dependence of the
variability in RXJ0136.9-3510 where the fractional variability increases from
0.3 to 2 keV, and then remains constant. This is in sharp contrast to other AGN
where the X-ray variability is either flat or falling with energy, sometimes
with a peak at $\sim$~2 keV superimposed on the overall trend. Intriguingly
these unusual characteristics of the variability are shared by one other AGN,
namely RE J1034+396, which is so far unique showing a significant X-ray QPO. In
addition the broad band spectrum of RXJ0136.9-3510 is also remarkably similar
to that of RE J1034+396, being dominated by a huge soft excess in the EUV-soft
X-ray bandpass. The bolometric luminosity of RX J0136.9-3510 gives an Eddington
ratio of about 2.7 for a black hole mass (from the H beta line width) of $7.9
\times 10^{7}M_{\sun}$. This mass is about a factor of 50 higher than that of
RE J1034+396, making any QPO undetectable in this length of observation.
Nonetheless, its X-ray spectral and variability similarities suggest that RE
J1034+396 is simply the closest representative of a new class of AGN spectra,
representing the most extreme mass accretion rates.
