We present a theoretical study of the slow and fast light propagation in
semiconductor optical amplifiers based on coherent population oscillations. By
modulating the injection current to force the population oscillations we can
modify the delay or advancement of light signals. Specifically, it is shown
that the relative phase of the optical signal to the bias current modulations
can be used as a knob for changing light propagation from delay to advancement.
In addition, we analyze the effect of the modulation current for slow light in
vertical cavity surface emission lasers (VCSELs) by taking into account the
cavity effects. It is shown that the change of the depth of the modulation
allows to tune the structural resonance, which in turn produces an enhancement
of the delay.
