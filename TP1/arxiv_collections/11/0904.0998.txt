The luminosity-redshift relation of cosmological standard candles provides
information about the relative energy composition of our Universe. In
particular, the observation of type Ia supernovae up to redshift of z~2
indicate a universe which is dominated today by dark matter and dark energy.
The propagation distance of light from these sources is of the order of the
Hubble radius and serves as a very sensitive probe of feeble inelastic photon
interactions with background matter, radiation or magnetic fields. In this
paper we discuss the limits on mini-charged particle models arising from a
dimming effect in supernova surveys. We briefly speculate about a strong
dimming effect as an alternative to dark energy.
