We present the design and the prototype of the Small Synoptic Second Solar
Spectrum Telescope (S5T), which can autonomously measure scattering
polarization signals on a daily basis with large sensitivity and accuracy. Its
data will be used to investigate the nature of weak, turbulent magnetic fields
through the Hanle effect in many lines. Also the relation between those fields
and the global solar dynamo can be revealed by spanning the observations over a
significant fraction of a solar cycle. The compact instrument concept is
enabled by a radial polarization converter that allows for ``one-shot''
polarimetry over the entire limb of the Sun. A polarimetric sensitivity of
~10^-5 is achieved by minimizing the instrumental polarization and by FLC
modulation in combination with a fast line-scan camera in the fiber-fed
spectrograph. The first prototype results successfully show the feasibility of
the concept.
