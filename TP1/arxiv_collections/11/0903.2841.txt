We address a long-standing problem in colloid and nanoparticle science:
particle shape selection in solution synthesis. Our main finding is that a
proper balance of two processes, preferential attachment of transported
monomers at the protruding features of the growing cluster and monomer
rearrangement at the cluster surface, can yield a well-defined particle shape
for a large interval of times, and persisting for sizes much larger than the
original seed.
