In this talk we discuss black hole solutions in six-dimensional gravity with
a Gauss- Bonnet term in the bulk and an induced gravity term on a thin 3-brane
of codimension-2. It is shown that these black holes can be localized on the
3-brane, and they can further be extended into the bulk by a warp function.
These solutions have regular horizons and no other curvature singularities
appear apart from the string-like ones. The projection of the Gauss-Bonnet term
on the brane imposes a constraint relation which requires the presence of
matter in the extra dimensions, in order to sustain our solutions.
