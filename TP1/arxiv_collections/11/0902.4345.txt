The paper reports a theoretical study of scattering of electrons by edges in
graphene and its effect on Raman scattering. First, effective models are
discussed for translationally invariant and rough edges. Second, they are used
in a calculation of the edge-activated Raman D peak intensity and its
dependence on the polarization of the incident/scattered light, as well as on
the position of the excitation spot. Manifestations of the quasiclassical
character of electron motion in Raman scattering are discussed.
