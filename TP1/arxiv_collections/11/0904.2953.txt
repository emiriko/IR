Making a decision in a changeable and dynamic environment is an arduous task
owing to the lack of information, their uncertainties and the unawareness of
planners about the future evolution of incidents. The use of a decision support
system is an efficient solution of this issue. Such a system can help emergency
planners and responders to detect possible emergencies, as well as to suggest
and evaluate possible courses of action to deal with the emergency. We are
interested in our work to the modeling of a monitoring preventive and emergency
management system, wherein we stress the generic aspect. In this paper we
propose an agent-based architecture of this system and we describe a first step
of our approach which is the modeling of information and their representation
using a multiagent system.
