This is the first of two papers describing the process of fitting
experimental data under interval uncertainty. Here I present the methodology,
designed from the very beginning as an interval-oriented tool, meant to replace
to the large extent the famous Least Squares (LSQ) and other slightly less
popular methods. Contrary to its classical counterparts, the presented method
does not require any poorly justified prior assumptions, like smallness of
experimental uncertainties or their normal (Gaussian) distribution. Using
interval approach, we are able to fit rigorously and reliably not only the
simple functional dependencies, with no extra effort when both variables are
uncertain, but also the cases when the constitutive equation exists in implicit
rather than explicit functional form. The magic word and a key to success of
interval approach appears the Hausdorff distance.
