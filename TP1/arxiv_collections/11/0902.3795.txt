Gluinos are produced pairwise at the LHC in quark-antiquark and gluon-gluon
collisions: $qqbar,gg \to \tilde{g} \tilde{g}$. While the individual
polarization of gluinos vanishes in the limit in which the small mass
difference between L and R squarks of the first two generations is neglected,
non-zero spin-spin correlations are predicted within gluino pairs. If the
squark/quark charges in Majorana gluino decays are tagged, the spin
correlations have an impact on the energy and angular distributions in
reconstructed final states. On the other hand, the gluino polarization in
single gluino production in the supersymmetric Compton process $g q \to
\tilde{g} \tilde{q}_{R,L}$ is predicted to be non-zero, and the polarization
affects the final-state distributions in super-Compton events.
