A model is proposed to study the possible pairing structures of N-boson
systems with nonzero spin. Analytical solutions have been obtained. The
emphasis is placed on the spin-structures of ground states with attractive or
repulsive pairing force, and with or without the action of a magnetic field. A
quantity (an analogue of the two-body density function) is defined to study the
spin-correlation between two bosons in N-body systems. The excitation of the
system has also been studied.
