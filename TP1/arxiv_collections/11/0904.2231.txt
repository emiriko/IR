We study quantum optical properties of the single-walled carbon nanotube
(SWCNT) by introducing the effective interaction between the quantized
electromagnetic field and the confined electrons in the SWCNT. Our purpose is
to explore the quantum natures of electron transport in the SWCNT by probing
its various quantum optical properties relevant to quantum coherence, such as
the interference of the scattered and emitted photons, and the bunching and
anti-bunching of photons which are characterized by the higher order coherence
functions. In the strong field limit, we study the interband Rabi oscillation
of electrons driven by a classical light. We also investigate the possible
lasing mechanism in superradiation of coherent electrons in a SWCNT driven by a
light pump or electron injection, which generate electron population inversion
in the higher energy-band of SWCNT.
