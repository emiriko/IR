We investigate whether the apparent discrepancy between proton electric form
factor from measurements using the Rosenbluth separation technique and
polarization transfer method is due to the standard approximations employed in
radiative correction procedures. Inaccuracies due to both the peaking
approximation and the soft-photon approximation have been removed in our
simulation approach. In contrast to results from (e,e'p) experiments, we find
them in this case to be too small to explain the discrepancy.
