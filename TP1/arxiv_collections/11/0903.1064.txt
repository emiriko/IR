For the first time, new important features of the fluctuation electromagnetic
interaction between a small conducting particle and a smooth surface of
polarizable medium (both dielectric and metallic) are worked out. The particle
is characterized by classical electric and magnetic polarizabilities. The
temperature dependence and retardation effects are explicitly taken into
account. The resulting interaction force between a metallic particle and the
surface of metal proves to be determined to great extent by magnetic coupling
and reveals specific dependences on distance, temperature, particle radius and
material properties of contacting materials. Numerical estimations are given in
the case of a Cu particle above a smooth Cu substrate at different particle
radius and temperature of the system.
