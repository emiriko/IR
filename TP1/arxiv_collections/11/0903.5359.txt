Arc-discharge with carbon electrodes containing Ni and Y2O3 in the presence
of Fe(CO)5 vapors have been investigated. It is found that unlike the cathode
deposit, the web deposited in the chamber contains mainly metallic
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as evidenced from Raman and optical
absorption spectroscopy. The percentage of metallic SWNTs increases with the
concentration of Fe(CO)5. Under optimal conditions, the web contains over 90%
of metallic SWNTs. This method enables the synthesis of nearly pure metallic
SWNTs on a large scale.
