We consider complex K3 surfaces with a non-symplectic group acting trivially
on the algebraic cycles. Vorontsov and Kondo classified those K3 surfaces with
transcendental lattice of minimal rank. The purpose of this note is to study
the Galois representations associated to these K3 surfaces. The rank of the
transcendental lattices is even and varies from 2 to 20, excluding 8 and 14. We
show that these K3 surfaces are dominated by Fermat surfaces, and hence they
are all of CM type. We will establish the modularity of the Galois
representations associated to them. Also we discuss mirror symmetry for these
K3 surfaces in the sense of Dolgachev, and show that a mirror K3 surface exists
with one exception.
