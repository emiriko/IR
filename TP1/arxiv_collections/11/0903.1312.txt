We demonstrate that for small values of momentum transfer, Q^2, the in-medium
change of the G_E/G_M form factor ratio for a bound neutron is dominated by the
change in the electric charge radius and predict in a model independent manner
that the in-medium ratio will increase relative to the free result. This effect
will act to increase the predicted cross-section for the neutron recoil
polarization transfer process 4He(e,e'n)3He. This is in contrast to medium
modification effects on the proton G_E/G_M from factor ratio, which act to
decrease the predicted cross-section for the 4He(e,e'p)3H reaction. Experiments
to measure the in-medium neutron form factors via neutron knockout reactions
are currently feasible in the range 0.1 < Q^2 < 1 GeV^2.
