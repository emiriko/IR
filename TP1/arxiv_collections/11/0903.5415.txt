A nonequilibrium distribution function of microscopic thermal current is
studied by a direct numerical simulation in a thermal conducting steady state
of particle systems. Two characteristic temperatures of the thermal current are
investigated on the basis of the distribution. It is confirmed that the
temperature depends on the current direction; Parallel temperature to the
heat-flux is higher than antiparallel one. The difference between the parallel
temperature and the antiparallel one is proportional to a macroscopic
temperature gradient.
