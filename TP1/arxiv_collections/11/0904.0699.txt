We report the observation of almost perfect light tunneling inhibition at the
edge and inside laser-written waveguide arrays due to band collapse. When the
refractive index of the guiding channels is harmonically modulated along the
propagation direction and out-of-phase in adjacent guides, light is trapped in
the excited waveguide over a long distance due to resonances. The phenomenon
can be used for tuning the localization threshold power.
