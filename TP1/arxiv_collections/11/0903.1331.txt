We present a Ginzburg-Landau theory of inhomogeneous polyelectrolytes with a
polar solvent. First, we take into account the molecular (solvation)
interaction among the ions, the charged monomers, the uncharged monomers, and
the solvent molecules, together with the electrostatic interaction with a
composition-dependent dielectric constant. Second, we treat the degree of
ionization as a fluctuating variable dependent on the local electric potential.
With these two ingredients included, our results are as follows. (i) We derive
a mass reaction law and a general expression for the surface tension. (ii) We
calculate the structure factor of the composition fluctuations as a function of
various parameters of the molecular interactions, which provides a general
criterion of the formation of mesophases. (iii) We numerically examine some
typical examples of interfaces and mesophase structures, which strongly depend
on the molecular interaction parameters.
