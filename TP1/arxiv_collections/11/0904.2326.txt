We report a numerical renormalization-group study of the thermoelectric
effect in the single-electron transistor (SET) and side-coupled geometries. As
expected, the computed thermal conductance and thermopower curves show
signatures of the Kondo effect and of Fano interference. The thermopower curves
are also affected by particle-hole asymmetry.
