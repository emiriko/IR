High data rate is required for multimedia communication. But the
communication at high data rate is always challenging. In this work we have
successfully performed data chatting, Voice chatting and high quality video
transmission between two distant units using MIMO adapter, Direct sequence
spread spectrum system and MATLAB/SIMULINK platform.
