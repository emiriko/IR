W Comae has significant variability in multi-wavelengthes, from the radio to
the gamma-ray bands. A bright outburst in the optical and X-ray bands was
observed in 1998, and most recently, a strong TeV flare was detected by VERITAS
in 2008. It is the first TeV intermediate-frequency-peaked BL Lacertae (IBL)
source. I find that both the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
quasi-simultaneously obtained during the TeV flare and during the optical/X-ray
outburst are well fit by using a single-zone synchrotron +
synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model. The satisfactory fitting requires a large
beaming factor, i.e., $\delta\sim 25$ and $\delta\sim 20$ for the TeV flare and
the optical/X-ray outburst, respectively, suggesting that both the
optical/X-ray outburst and the TeV flare are from a relativistic jet. The size
of the emission region of the TeV flare is three times larger than that of the
optical/X-ray outburst, and the strength of the magnetic field for the TeV
flare is $\sim 14$ times smaller than that of the X-ray/optical outburst,
likely indicating that the region of the TeV flare is more distant from the
core than that of the X-ray/optical outburst. The IC component of the TeV flare
peaks at around 1.3 GeV, but it is around 20 MeV for the X-ray/optical
outburst, lower than that for the TeV flare with 2 orders of magnitude. The
model predicts that the optical/X-ray outburst might be accompanied by a strong
MeV/GeV emission, but the TeV flare may be not associated with the
X-ray/optical outburst. The GeV emission is critical to characterize the SEDs
of the optical/X-ray outburst and the TeV flare. The predicted GeV flux is
above the sensitivity of \emph{Fermi}/LAT, and it could be verified with the
observations by \emph{Fermi}/LAT in near future.
