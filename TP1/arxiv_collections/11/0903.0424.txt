After several years of intensive technological development Virtual
Observatory resources have reached a level of maturity sufficient for their
routine scientific exploitation. The Virtual Observatory is starting to be used
by astronomers in a transparent way. In this article I will review several
research projects making use of the VO at different levels of importance. I
will present two projects going further than data mining: (1) studies of
environmental effects on galaxy evolution, where VO resources and services are
used in connection with dedicated observations using a large telescope and
numerical simulations, and (2) a study of optical and near-infrared colours of
nearby galaxies complemented by the spectroscopic data.
