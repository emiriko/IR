LS I +61 303 and LS 5039 are two of only a handful of known high mass X-ray
binaries (HMXBs) that exhibit very high energy emission in the MeV-TeV range,
and these "gamma-ray binaries" are of renewed interest due to the recent launch
of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Here we present new radial velocities
of both systems based on recent red and blue optical spectra. Both systems have
somewhat discrepant orbital solutions available in the literature, and our new
measurements result in improved orbital elements and resolve the disagreements.
The improved geometry of each orbit will aid in studies of the high energy
emission region near each source.
