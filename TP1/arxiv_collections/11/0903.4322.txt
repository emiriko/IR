The phi meson production on hyperons, pi Y --> phi Y and anti-kaons bar-K
N--> phi Y is argued to be a new efficient source of phi mesons in a
nucleus-nucleus collision. These reactions are not suppressed according to
Okubo-Zweig-Izuka rule in contrast to the processes with non-strange particles
in the entrance channels, pi B and BB with B=N,Delta. A rough estimate of the
cross sections within a simple hadronic model shows that the cross sections of
pi Y-->phi Y and bar-K N-->phi Y reactions can exceed that of the pi N--> phi N
reaction by factors 50 and 60, respectively. In the hadrochemical model for
nucleus-nucleus collisions at SIS and lower AGS energies we calculate the
evolution of strange particle populations and phi meson production rate due to
the new processes. It is found that the catalytic reactions can be operative if
the maximal temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions is larger than 130 MeV
and the collision time is larger than 10 fm. A possible influence of the
catalytic reactions on the centrality dependence of the phi yield at AGS
energies and the phi rapidity distributions at SPS energies is discussed.
