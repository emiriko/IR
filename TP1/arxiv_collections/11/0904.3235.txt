In this work we investigate an influence of decoherence effects on quantum
states generated as a result of the cross-Kerr nonlinear interaction between
two modes. For Markovian losses (both photon loss and dephasing), a region of
parameters when losses still do not lead to destruction of non-classicality is
identified. We emphasize the difference in impact of losses in the process of
state generation as opposed to those occurring in propagation channel. We show
moreover, that correlated losses in modern realizations of schemes of large
cross-Kerr nonlinearity might lead to enhancement of non-classicality.
