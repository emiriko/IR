In this paper, we perform statistical segmentation and clustering analysis of
the Dow Jones Industrial Average time series between January 1997 and August
2008. Modeling the index movements and log-index movements as stationary
Gaussian processes, we find a total of 116 and 119 statistically stationary
segments respectively. These can then be grouped into between five to seven
clusters, each representing a different macroeconomic phase. The macroeconomic
phases are distinguished primarily by their volatilities. We find the US
economy, as measured by the DJI, spends most of its time in a low-volatility
phase and a high-volatility phase. The former can be roughly associated with
economic expansion, while the latter contains the economic contraction phase in
the standard economic cycle. Both phases are interrupted by a
moderate-volatility market, but extremely-high-volatility market crashes are
found mostly within the high-volatility phase. From the temporal distribution
of various phases, we see a high-volatility phase from mid-1998 to mid-2003,
and another starting mid-2007 (the current global financial crisis).
Transitions from the low-volatility phase to the high-volatility phase are
preceded by a series of precursor shocks, whereas the transition from the
high-volatility phase to the low-volatility phase is preceded by a series of
inverted shocks. The time scale for both types of transitions is about a year.
We also identify the July 1997 Asian Financial Crisis to be the trigger for the
mid-1998 transition, and an unnamed May 2006 market event related to
corrections in the Chinese markets to be the trigger for the mid-2007
transition.
