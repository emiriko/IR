We perform a Dalitz plot analysis of the decay Ds to K+K-pi+ with the CLEO-c
data set of 586/pb of e+e- collisions accumulated at sqrt(s) = 4.17 GeV. This
corresponds to about 0.57 million D_s+D_s(*)- pairs from which we select 14400
candidates with a background of roughly 15%. In contrast to previous
measurements we find good agreement with our data only by including an
additional f_0(1370)pi+ contribution. We measure the magnitude, phase, and fit
fraction of K*(892) K+, phi(1020)pi+, K0*(1430)K+, f_0(980)pi+, f_0(1710)pi+,
and f_0(1370)pi+ contributions and limit the possible contributions of other KK
and Kpi resonances that could appear in this decay.
