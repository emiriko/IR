We present six Chandra X-ray spectra and light curves obtained for the nova
V1494 Aql (1999 #2) in outburst. The first three observations were taken with
ACIS-I on days 134, 187, and 248 after outburst. The count rates were 1.00,
0.69 and 0.53 cps, respectively. We found no significant periodicity in the
ACIS light curves. The X-ray spectra show continuum emission and lines
originating from N and O. We found acceptable spectral fits using isothermal
APEC models with significantly increased elemental abundances of O and N for
all observations. On day 248 after outburst a bright soft component appeared in
addition to the fading emission lines. The Chandra observations on days 300,
304, and 727 were carried out with the HRC/LETGS. The spectra consist of
continuum emission plus strong emission lines of O and N, implying a high
abundance of these elements. On day 300, a flare occurred and periodic
oscillations were detected in the light curves taken on days 300 and 304. This
flare must have originated deep in the outflowing material since it was
variable on short time scales. The spectra extracted immediately before and
after the flare are remarkably similar, implying that the flare was an
extremely isolated event. Our attempts to fit blackbody, Cloudy, or APEC models
to the LETG spectra failed, owing to the difficulty in disentangling continuum
and emission line components. The spectrum extracted during the flare shows a
significant increase in the strengths of many of the lines and the appearance
of several previously undetected lines. In addition, some of the lines seen
before and after the flare are not present during the flare. On day 727 only
the count rate from the zeroth order could be derived, and the source was too
faint for the extraction of a light curve or spectrum.
