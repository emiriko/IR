The paper presents combined spectroscopic and photometric orbital solutions
for ten close binary systems: CN And, V776 Cas, FU Dra, UV Lyn, BB Peg, V592
Per, OU Ser, EQ Tau, HN UMa and HT Vir. The photometric data consist of new
multicolor light curves, while the spectroscopy has been recently obtained
within the radial velocity program at the David Dunlap Observatory (DDO).
Absolute parameters of the components for these binary systems are derived. Our
results confirm that CN And is not a contact system. Its configuration is
semi-detached with the secondary component filling its Roche lobe. The
configuration of nine other systems is contact. Three systems (V776 Cas, V592
Per and OU Ser) have high (44-77%) and six (FU Dra, UV Lyn, BB Peg, EQ Tau, HN
UMa and HT Vir) low or intermediate (8-32%) fill-out factors. The absolute
physical parameters are derived.
