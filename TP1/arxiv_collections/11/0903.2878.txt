We present results from three Suzaku observations of the z=3.91
gravitationally lensed broad absorption line quasar APM 08279+5255. We detect
strong and broad absorption at rest-frame energies of <2 keV (low-energy) and
7-12 keV (high-energy). The detection of these features confirms the results of
previous long-exposure (80-90 ks) Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. The low
and high-energy absorption is detected in both the back-illuminated (BI) and
front-illuminated (FI) Suzaku XIS spectra (with an F-test significance of
>99%). We interpret the low-energy absorption as arising from a low-ionization
absorber with log NH~23 and the high-energy absorption as due to lines arising
from highly ionized (2.75 < log xi < 4.0; where xi is the ionization parameter)
iron in a near-relativistic outflowing wind. Assuming this interpretation we
find that the velocities in the outflow range between 0.1c and 0.6c. We
constrain the angle between the outflow direction of the X-ray absorber and our
line of sight to be <36 degrees. We also detect likely variability of the
absorption lines (at the >99.9% and >98% significance levels in the FI and BI
spectra, respectively) with a rest-frame time scale of ~1 month. Assuming that
the detected high-energy absorption features arise from Fe xxv, we estimate
that the fraction of the total bolometric energy injected over the quasar's
lifetime into the intergalactic medium in the form of kinetic energy to be
>10%.
