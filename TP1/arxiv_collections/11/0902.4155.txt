This is a continuation of our preceding paper devoted to signatures of
quantum chaos in the geometric collective model of atomic nuclei. We apply the
method by Peres to study ordered and disordered patterns in quantum spectra
drawn as lattices in the plane of energy vs. average of a chosen observable. A
good qualitative agreement with standard measures of chaos is manifested. The
method provides an efficient tool for studying structural changes of
eigenstates across quantum spectra of general systems.
