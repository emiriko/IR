Stuttering bisimulation is a well-known behavioral equivalence that preserves
CTL-X, namely CTL without the next-time operator X. Correspondingly, the
stuttering simulation preorder induces a coarser behavioral equivalence that
preserves the existential fragment ECTL-{X,G}, namely ECTL without the
next-time X and globally G operators. While stuttering bisimulation equivalence
can be computed by the well-known Groote and Vaandrager's [1990] algorithm, to
the best of our knowledge, no algorithm for computing the stuttering simulation
preorder and equivalence is available. This paper presents such an algorithm
for finite state systems.
