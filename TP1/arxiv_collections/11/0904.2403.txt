We show that colloidal molecular crystal states interacting with a periodic
substrate, such as an optical trap array, and a rotating external field can
undergo a rapid pattern switching in which the orientation of the crystal
changes. In some cases, a martensitic-like symmetry switching occurs. It is
also possible to create a polarized state where the colloids in each substrate
minima develop a director field which smoothly rotates with the external drive,
similar to liquid crystal behavior. These results open the possibility for
creating novel types of devices using photonic band gap materials, and should
be generalizable to a variety of other condensed matter systems with multiple
particle trapping.
