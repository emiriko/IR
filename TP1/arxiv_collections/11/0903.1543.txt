In this review we shall comment on a few recent findings which strengthen the
view that the black hole accretion has substantial amount of sub-Keplerian
component. The manifestation of this component is many fold. We discuss some of
them. A general outline of the complex structure that emerges from the
multitude of observations is presented. A detailed outline of what might be
going on in outburst sources is also discussed. The relationship amount the
spectral and timing properties can be best understood by this picture. We claim
that the sub-Keplerian advective disk paradigm is a complete package. Since
signatures of sub-Keplerian motion is already increasing in the literature, the
whole package must be correct.
