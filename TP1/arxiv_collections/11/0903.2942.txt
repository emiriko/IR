We analyse the formation of ultracold 7Li133Cs molecules in the rovibrational
ground state through photoassociation into the B1Pi state, which has recently
been reported [J. Deiglmayr et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 133004 (2008)].
Absolute rate constants for photoassociation at large detunings from the atomic
asymptote are determined and are found to be surprisingly large. The
photoassociation process is modeled using a full coupled-channel calculation
for the continuum state, taking all relevant hyperfine states into account. The
enhancement of the photoassociation rate is found to be caused by an `echo' of
the triplet component in the singlet component of the scattering wave function
at the inner turning point of the lowest triplet a3Sigma+ potential. This
perturbation can be ascribed to the existence of a broad Feshbach resonance at
low scattering energies. Our results elucidate the important role of couplings
in the scattering wave function for the formation of deeply bound ground state
molecules via photoassociation.
