Systems of N identical phase oscillators with global sinusoidal coupling are
known to display low-dimensional dynamics. Although this phenomenon was first
observed about 20 years ago, its underlying cause has remained a puzzle. Here
we expose the structure working behind the scenes of these systems, by proving
that the governing equations are generated by the action of the Mobius group, a
three-parameter subgroup of fractional linear transformations that map the unit
disc to itself. When there are no auxiliary state variables, the group action
partitions the N-dimensional state space into three-dimensional invariant
manifolds (the group orbits). The N-3 constants of motion associated with this
foliation are the N-3 functionally independent cross ratios of the oscillator
phases. No further reduction is possible, in general; numerical experiments on
models of Josephson junction arrays suggest that the invariant manifolds often
contain three-dimensional regions of neutrally stable chaos.
