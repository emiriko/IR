We study the tidal forcing, propagation and dissipation of linear inertial
waves in a rotating fluid body. The intentionally simplified model involves a
perfectly rigid core surrounded by a deep ocean consisting of a homogeneous
incompressible fluid. Centrifugal effects are neglected, but the Coriolis force
is considered in full, and dissipation occurs through viscous or frictional
forces. The dissipation rate exhibits a complicated dependence on the tidal
frequency and generally increases with the size of the core. In certain
intervals of frequency, efficient dissipation is found to occur even for very
small values of the coefficient of viscosity or friction. We discuss the
results with reference to wave attractors, critical latitudes and other
features of the propagation of inertial waves within the fluid, and comment on
their relevance for tidal dissipation in planets and stars.
