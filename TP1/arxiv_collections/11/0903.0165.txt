The flux of the diffuse gamma-ray background radiation (GBR) does not confirm
that the excess in the flux of cosmic ray electrons between 300-800 GeV, which
was measured locally with the ATIC instrument in balloon flights over
Antartica, is universal as expected from dark matter annihilation. Neither does
the increase with energy of the fraction of positrons in the cosmic ray flux of
electrons in the 10-100 GeV range that was measured by PAMELA imply a dark
matter origin: It is consistent with that expected from the sum of the two
major sources of Galactic cosmic rays, non relativistic spherical ejecta and
highly relativistic jets from supernova explosions.
