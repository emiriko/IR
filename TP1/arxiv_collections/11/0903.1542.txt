The trispectrum is at least as important as the bispectrum and its size can
be characterized by two parameters $\tau_{NL}$ and $g_{NL}$. In this short
paper, we focus on the Multi-brid inflation, in particular the two-brid
inflation model in arXiv.0805.0974, and find that $\tau_{NL}$ is always
positive and roughly equals to $({6\over 5}f_{NL})^2$ for the low scale
inflation, but $g_{NL}$ can be negative or positive and its order of magnitude
can be the same as that of $\tau_{NL}$ or even larger
