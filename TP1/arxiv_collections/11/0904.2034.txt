Photoproduction of $\Lambda$(1520) with liquid hydrogen and deuterium targets
was examined at photon energies below 2.4 GeV in the SPring-8 LEPS experiment.
For the first time, the differential cross sections were measured at low
energies and with a deuterium target. A large asymmetry of the production cross
sections from protons and neutrons was observed at backward K$^{+/0}$ angles.
This suggests the importance of the contact term, which coexists with t-channel
K exchange under gauge invariance. This interpretation was compatible with the
differential cross sections, decay asymmetry, and photon beam asymmetry
measured in the production from protons at forward K$^+$ angles.
