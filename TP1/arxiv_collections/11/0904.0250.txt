The [O IV] 25.89 micron line has been shown to be an accurate indicator of
active galactic nucleus (AGN) intrinsic luminosity in that it correlates well
with hard (10-200 keV) X-ray emission. We present measurements of [O IV] for 89
Seyfert galaxies from the unbiased Revised Shapley-Ames (RSA) sample. The [O
IV] luminosity distributions of obscured and unobscured Seyferts are
indistinguishable, indicating that their intrinsic AGN luminosities are quite
similar and that the RSA sample is well suited for tests of the unified model.
In addition, we analyze several commonly used proxies for AGN luminosity,
including [O III] 5007 A, 6 cm radio, and 2-10 keV X-ray emission. We find that
the radio luminosity distributions of obscured and unobscured AGNs show no
significant difference, indicating that radio luminosity is a useful isotropic
luminosity indicator. However, the observed [O III] and 2-10 keV luminosities
are systematically smaller for obscured Seyferts, indicating that they are not
emitted isotropically.
