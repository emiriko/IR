We report on the photodissociation dynamics study of n-butyl nitrite
(n-C_4H_9ONO) and isoamyl nitrite ((CH_3)_2C_3H_5ONO) by means of time-resolved
Fourier transform infrared (TR-FTIR) emission spectroscopy. The obtained
TR-FTIR emission spectra of the nascent NO fragments produced in the 355-nm
laser photolysis of the two alkyl nitrite species showed an almost identical
rotational temperature and vibrational distributions of NO. In addition, a
close resemblance between the two species was also found in the measured
temporal profiles of the IR emission of NO and the recorded UV absorption
spectra. The experimental results are consistent with our ab initio
calculations using the time-dependent density functional theory at the
B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level, which indicate that the substitution of one of the two
{gamma}-H atoms in n-C_4H_9ONO with a methyl group to form (CH_3)_2C_3H_5ONO
has only a minor effect on the photodissociation dynamics of the two molecules.
