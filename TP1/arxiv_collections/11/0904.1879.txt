We report on a multi-frequency, multi-epoch campaign of Very Long Baseline
Interferometry observations of the radio galaxy 1946+708 using the VLBA and a
Global VLBI array. From these high-resolution observations we deduce the
kinematic age of the radio source to be $\sim$4000 years, comparable with the
ages of other Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs). Ejections of pairs of jet
components appears to take place on time scales of 10 years and these
components in the jet travel outward at intrinsic velocities between 0.6 and
0.9 c. From the constraint that jet components cannot have intrinsic velocities
faster than light, we derive H_0 > 57 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 from the fastest pair of
components launched from the core. We provide strong evidence for the ejection
of a new pair of components in ~1997. From the trajectories of the jet
components we deduce that the jet is most likely to be helically confined,
rather than purely ballistic in nature.
