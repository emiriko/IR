In this paper we construct explicitly a square integrable residual
automorphic representation of the special orthogonal group $SO_{2n}$, through
Eisenstein series. We show that this representation comes from an elliptic
Arthur parameter $\psi$ and appears in the space
$L^2(SO_{2n}(\mathbb{Q})\backslash SO_{2n}(\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Q}}))$ with
multiplicity one. Next, we consider parameters whose Hecke matrices, at the
unramified places, have eigenvalues bigger (in absolute value), than those of
the parameter constructed before. The main result is, that these parameters
cannot be cuspidal. We establish bounds for the eigenvalues of Hecke operators,
as consequences of Arthur's conjectures for $SO_{2n}$. Next, we calculate the
character and the twisted characters for the representations that we
constructed. Finally, we find the composition of the global and local Arthur's
packets associated to our parameter $\psi$. All the results in this paper are
true if we replace $\mathbb{Q}$ by any number field $F$.
