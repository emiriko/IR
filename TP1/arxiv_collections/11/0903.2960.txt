Background: Hybridogenesis is a very interesting example of reproduction
which seems to integrate the sexual and clonal processes in one system. In a
case of frogs, described in the paper, two parental species - Rana lessonae and
Rana ridibunda can form fertile hybrid individuals - Rana esculenta. Hybrid
individuals eliminate one parental haplotype from their germ line cells before
meiosis (end before recombination) which implicates clonal reproduction of the
haplotype transferred to the gametes. All three "species" are called "complex
species". To study the evolution of genomes in the hybridogenetic fraction of
this complex species we have used the Monte Carlo based model rendering the age
structured populations. The model enables the analysis of distribution of
defective alleles in the individual genomes as well as in the genetic pool of
the whole populations.
  Results: We have shown that longer isolation of hybrids' populations leads to
the speciation through emerging the specific sets of complementing haplotypes
in their genetic pool. The fraction of defective alleles increases but the
defects are complemented in the heterozygous loci. Nevertheless, even small
supply of new hybrids generated by the two parental species or crossbreeding
between hybrids and one of the parental species prevents the speciation and
changes the strategy of the genome evolution from the complementing to the
purifying Darwinian selection.
