In this work, we study the electroweak sphalerons in a 5D background, where
the fifth dimension lies on an interval. We consider two specific cases: flat
space-time and the anti-de Sitter space-time compactified on S^{1}/Z_{2}. In
our work, we take the SU(2) gauge-Higgs model, where the gauge fields reside in
the 5D bulk; but the Higgs doublet is confined in one brane. We find that the
results in this model are close to those of the 4D Standard Model (SM). The
existence of the warp effect, as well as the heaviness of the gauge
Kaluza-Klein modes make the results extremely close to the SM ones.
