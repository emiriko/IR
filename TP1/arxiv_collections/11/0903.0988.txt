In arXiv:0806.0363 the worldvolume superalgebra of the $\mathcal{N}=8$
Bagger-Lambert theory was calculated. In this paper we derive the general form
for the worldvolume superalgebra of the $\mathcal{N}=6$ Bagger-Lambert theory.
For a particular choice of three-algebra we derive the superalgebra of the ABJM
theory. We interpret the associated central charges in terms of BPS brane
configurations. In particular we find the central charge corresponding to the
energy bound of the BPS fuzzy-funnel configuration of the ABJM theory. We also
derive general expressions for the BPS equations of the $\mathcal{N}=6$
Bagger-Lambert theory.
