Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out for a system of monomers on
square lattices that, by decreasing temperature or increasing density,
polymerize reversibly into chains with two allowed directions and, at the same
time, undergo a continuous isotropic-nematic (I-N) transition. The results show
that the self-assembly process affects the nature of the transition. Thus, the
determination of the critical exponents indicates that the universality class
of the I-N transition changes from two-dimensional Ising-type for monodisperse
rods without self-assembly to q=1 Potts-type for self-assembled rods.
