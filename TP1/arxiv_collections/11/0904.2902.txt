We analyze a coronal mass ejection (CME) which resulted from an intense flare
in active region AR486 on November 4, 2003. The CME propagation and speed are
studied with interplanetary scintillation images, near-Earth space mission
data, and Ulysses measurements. Together, these diverse diagnostics suggest
that the internal magnetic energy of the CME determines its interplanetary
consequences.
