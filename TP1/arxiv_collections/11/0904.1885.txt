We study a conservative 5-point cell-centered finite volume discretization of
the high-contrast diffusion equation. We aim to construct preconditioners that
are robust with respect to the magnitude of the coefficient contrast and the
mesh size simultaneously. For that, we prove and numerically demonstrate the
robustness of the preconditioner proposed by Aksoylu et al. (2008, Comput. Vis.
Sci. 11, pp. 319--331) by extending the devised singular perturbation analysis
from linear finite element discretization to the above discretization. The
singular perturbation analysis is more involved than that of finite element
because all the subblocks in the discretization matrix depend on the diffusion
coefficient. However, that dependence is eliminated asymptotically. This allows
the same preconditioner to be utilized due to similar limiting behaviours of
the submatrices; leading to a narrowing family of preconditioners that can be
used for different discretizations--a desirable preconditioner design goal. We
compare our numerical results to standard cell-centered multigrid and observe
that performance of our preconditioner is independent of the utilized
prolongation operators and smoothers.
  As a side result, we also prove that the solution over the highly-diffusive
island becomes constant asymptotically. Integration of this qualitative
understanding of the underlying PDE to our preconditioner is the main reason
behind its superior performance. Diagonal scaling is probably the most basic
preconditioner for high-contrast coefficients. Extending the matrix entry based
spectral analysis introduced by Graham and Hagger, we rigorously show that the
number of small eigenvalues of the diagonally scaled matrix depends on the
number of isolated islands comprising the highly-diffusive region.
