We discuss the tunneling spectroscopy at a surface in multi-band systems such
as Fe-based superconductors with the use of the quasiclassical approach. We
extend the single-band method by Matsumoto and Shiba [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 64,
1703 (1995)] into $n$-band systems ($n \geq 2$). We show that the appearance
condition of the zero-bias conductance peak does not depend on details of the
pair-potential anisotropy, but it depends on details of the normal state
properties in the case of fully-gapped superconductors. The surface density of
states in a two-band superconductor is presented as a simplest application. The
quasiclassical approach enables us to calculate readily the surface-angular
dependence of the tunneling spectroscopy.
