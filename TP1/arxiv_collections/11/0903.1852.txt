The excess of electrons/positrons observed by the Pamela and ATIC experiments
gives rise to a noticeable amount of synchrotron and Inverse Compton Scattering
(ICS) radiation when the e^+e^- interact with the Galactic Magnetic Field, and
the InterStellar Radiation Field (ISRF). In particular, the ICS signal produced
within the WIMP annihilation interpretation of the Pamela/ATIC excess shows
already some tension with the EGRET data. On the other hand, 1 yr of Fermi data
taking will be enough to rule out or confirm this scenario with a high
confidence level. The ICS radiation produces a peculiar and clean "ICS Haze"
feature, as well, which can be used to discriminate between the astrophysical
and Dark Matter scenarios. This ICS signature is very prominent even several
degrees away from the galactic center, and it is thus a very robust prediction
with respect to the choice of the DM profile and the uncertainties in the ISRF.
