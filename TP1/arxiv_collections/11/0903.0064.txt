A collaborative filtering system recommends to users products that similar
users like. Collaborative filtering systems influence purchase decisions, and
hence have become targets of manipulation by unscrupulous vendors. We provide
theoretical and empirical results demonstrating that while common nearest
neighbor algorithms, which are widely used in commercial systems, can be highly
susceptible to manipulation, two classes of collaborative filtering algorithms
which we refer to as linear and asymptotically linear are relatively robust.
These results provide guidance for the design of future collaborative filtering
systems.
