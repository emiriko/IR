The short-range and tensor components of the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction
induce a sizeable depletion of low momenta in the ground state of a nuclear
many-body system. The self-consistent Green's function method within the ladder
approximation provides an \textit{ab-initio} description of correlated nuclear
systems that accounts properly for these effects. The momentum distribution
predicted by this approach is analyzed in detail, with emphasis on the
depletion of the lowest momentum state. The temperature, density, and nucleon
asymmetry (isospin) dependence of the depletion of the Fermi sea is clarified.
A connection is established between the momentum distribution and the
time-ordered components of the self-energy, which allows for an improved
interpretation of the results. The dependence on the underlying nucleon-nucleon
interaction provides quantitative estimates of the importance of short-range
and tensor correlations in nuclear systems.
