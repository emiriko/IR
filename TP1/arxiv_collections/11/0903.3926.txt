Often user interfaces of theorem proving systems focus on assisting
particularly trained and skilled users, i.e., proof experts. As a result, the
systems are difficult to use for non-expert users. This paper describes a paper
and pencil HCI experiment, in which (non-expert) students were asked to make
suggestions for a GUI for an interactive system for mathematical proofs. They
had to explain the usage of the GUI by applying it to construct a proof sketch
for a given theorem. The evaluation of the experiment provides insights for the
interaction design for non-expert users and the needs and wants of this user
group.
