We report experimental implementation of various types of qubit channels
using an individual trapped ion. We analyzed experimental data and we performed
tomographic reconstruction of quantum channels based on these data.
Specifically, we studied phase damping channels, where the damping acts either
in the xy-plane of the Bloch sphere or in an arbitrary plane that includes the
origin of the Bloch sphere. We also experimentally realized and consequently
analyzed quantum channels that in addition to phase damping affect also a
polarization rotation. We used three reconstruction schemes for estimation of
quantum channels from experimental data: (1) a linear inverse method, (2) a
maximum likelihood estimation, and (3) a constrained maximum likelihood
estimation. We took into account realistic experimental conditions where
imperfect test-state preparations and biased measurements are incorporated into
the estimation schemes. As a result we found that imperfections present in the
process of preparation of test states and as well as in measurements of the
considered ion trap system do not limit the control of the implementation of
the desired channel. Even imperfect preparation of test state and subsequent
measurements still provide sufficient resources for the complete
quantum-channel tomography.
