How intracellular and extracellular signals are integrated by transcription
factors is essential for understanding complex cellular patterns at the
population level. In this Letter, by using a synthetic genetic oscillator
coupled to a quorum-sensing apparatus, we propose an experimentally feasible
cis-regulatory module (CRM) which performs four possible logic operations
(ANDN, ORN, NOR and NAND) of input signals. We show both numerically and
theoretically that these different CRMs drive fundamentally different dynamic
patterns, such as synchronization, clustering and splay state.
