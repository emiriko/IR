Let X be an irreducible symplectic manifold and Def(X) the Kuranishi space.
Assume that X admits a Lagrangian fibration. We prove that X can be deformed
preserving a Lagrangian fibration. More precisely, there exists a smooth
hypersurface H of Def(X) such that the restriction family over H admits a
family of Lagrangian fibrations over H.
