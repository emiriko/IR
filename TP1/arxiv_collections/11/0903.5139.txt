A movement is underway to test the uniqueness of Earth. Sponsored primarily
by NASA, it is enlisting talented researchers from many disciplines. It is
conceiving new telescopes to discover and characterize other worlds like Earth
around nearby stars and to obtain their spectra. The goal is to search for
signs of biological activity and perhaps find other cradles of life.
  Most effort thus far has focused on the optics to make such observations
feasible. Relatively little attention has been paid to science operations--the
link between instrument and science. Because of the special challenges
presented by extrasolar planets, science-operational issues may be limiting
factors for the "Are We Alone?" (AWA) movement. Science-operational metrics can
help compare the merits of direct and astrometric planet searches, and estimate
the concatenated completeness of searching followed by spectroscopy. This
completeness is the prime science metric of the AWA program. Therefore, the
goals of this white paper are to present representative calculations involving
science-operational metrics, and to promote a science-operational perspective.
We urge the Survey Committee to allow this perspective and such metrics to
inform its plan for the future of AWA.
