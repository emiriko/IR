We present new mass estimates of the galaxy cluster MS2137.3-2353, inferred
from X-ray and strong lensing analyses. This cluster exhibits an outstanding
strong lensing configuration and indicates a well-relaxed dynamical state,
being most suitable for a mass reconstruction which combines both techniques.
Despite this, several previous studies have claimed a significant discrepancy
between the X-ray and the strong lensing mass estimates. The primary aim of
this paper is to address and explain this mismatch. For this purpose, we have
analysed Chandra observations to recover the profiles of the intra-cluster
medium properties and, assuming a functional form for the matter density, the
total mass distribution. The notable strong-lensing features of MS2137.3 allow
us to reconstruct its projected mass in the central regions with good accuracy,
by taking advantage of the lensing inversion code Lenstool. We find a good
agreement between our X-ray and strong lensing mass estimates for MS2137,
leading to a mean, extrapolated value of M_200 ~ 4.4 +/- 0.3*10^14 M_sun, under
the assumption of the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile. However, the
strong lensing mass estimate is affected by the details of the BCG mass
modeling. In particular, we do not find evidence for a high concentration for
the NFW density profile, as reported in some earlier works.
