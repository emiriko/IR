We review the Rein--Sehgal model and criticize its use for low energy
neutrino induced coherent pion production. We have studied the validity of the
main approximations implicit in that model, trying to compare with physical
observables when that is possible and with microscopical calculations. Next, we
have tried to elaborate a new improved model by removing the more problematic
approximations, while keeping the model still reasonably simple. Last, we have
discussed the limitations intrinsic to any approach based on the partial
conservation of the axial current hypothesis. In particular, we have shown the
inability of such models to determine the angular distribution of the outgoing
pion with respect to the direction of the incoming neutrino, except for the
$q^2= 0$ kinematical point.
