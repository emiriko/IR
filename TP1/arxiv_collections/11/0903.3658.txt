Beamstrahlung will constitute an important source of background in a pixel
vertex detector at the future International Linear Collider. Electron and
positron tracks of this origin impact the pixel planes at angles generally
larger than those of secondary hadrons and the corresponding clusters are
elongated. We report studies of cluster characteristics using test beam
electron tracks incident at various angles at a Mimosa-5 pixel matrix.
