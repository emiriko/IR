At the Institute for Thermodynamics and Thermal Process Engineering (ITT)
about 100 molecular models for pure substances have been developed so far.
These models reproduce vapor pressure, saturated liquid density, and enthalpy
of vaporization with a technical accuracy of less than 5%, less than 1%, and
less than 5% deviation compared to experimental data, respectively.
  Simulation results are outlined for the pure substances ethylene oxide and
ammonia, demonstrating the outstanding predictive power of the applied methods.
Secondly, nucleation processes are discussed. Underlying effects on are studied
on the molecular level.
