Direct analytic continuation of the self energy is used to determine the
effect of antiferromagnetic ordering on the spectral function and optical
conductivity of a Mott insulator. Comparison of several methods shows that the
most robust estimation of the gap value is obtained by use of the real part of
the continued self energy in the quasiparticle equation within the single-site
dynamical mean field theory of the two dimensional square lattice Hubbard
model, where for U slightly greater than the Mott critical value,
antiferromagnetism increases the gap by about 80%.
