The asymmetric simple exclusion process with open boundaries, which is a very
simple model of out-of-equilibrium statistical physics, is known to be
integrable. In particular, its spectrum can be described in terms of Bethe
roots. The large deviation function of the current can be obtained as well by
diagonalizing a modified transition matrix, that is still integrable: the
spectrum of this new matrix can be also described in terms of Bethe roots for
special values of the parameters. However, due to the algebraic framework used
to write the Bethe equations in the previous works, the nature of the
excitations and the full structure of the eigenvectors were still unknown. This
paper explains why the eigenvectors of the modified transition matrix are
physically relevant, gives an explicit expression for the eigenvectors and
applies it to the study of atypical currents. It also shows how the coordinate
Bethe Ansatz developped for the excitations leads to a simple derivation of the
Bethe equations and of the validity conditions of this Ansatz. All the results
obtained by de Gier and Essler are recovered and the approach gives a physical
interpretation of the exceptional points The overlap of this approach with
other tools such as the matrix Ansatz is also discussed. The method that is
presented here may be not specific to the asymmetric exclusion process and may
be applied to other models with open boundaries to find similar exceptional
points.
