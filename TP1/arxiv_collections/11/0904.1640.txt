It is proposed that $T$ violation in physics, as well as the masses of
electron and $u, d$ quarks, arise from a pseudoscalar interaction with a new
spin 0 field $\tau(x)$, odd in $P$ and $T$, but even in $C$. This interaction
contains a factor $i\gamma_5$ in the quark and lepton Dirac algebra, so that
the full Hamiltonian is $P$, $T$ conserving; but by spontaneous symmetry
breaking, the new field $\tau(x)$ has a nonzero expectation value $<\tau>\neq
0$ that breaks $P$ and $T$ symmetry. Oscillations of $\tau(x)$ about its
expectation value produce a new particle, the "timeon". The mass of timeon is
expected to be high because of its flavor-changing properties.
  The main body of the paper is on the low energy phenomenology of the timeon
model. As we shall show, for the quark system the model gives a compact
3-dimensional geometric picture consisting of two elliptic plates and one
needle, which embodies the ten observables: six quark masses, three Eulerian
angles $\theta_{12}, \theta_{23}, \theta_{31}$ and the Jarlskog invariant of
the CKM matrix.
  For leptons, we assume that the neutrinos do not have a direct timeon
interaction; therefore, the lowest neutrino mass is zero. The timeon
interaction with charged leptons yields the observed nonzero electron mass,
analogous to the up and down quark masses. Furthermore, the timeon model for
leptons contains two fewer theoretical parameters than observables. Thus, there
are two testable relations between the three angles $\theta_{12}, \theta_{23},
\theta_{31}$ and the Jarlskog invariant of the neutrino mapping matrix.
