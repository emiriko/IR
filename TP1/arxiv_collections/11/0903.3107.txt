We discuss possible options for interpreting the newly observed state Y(4140)
by the CDF collaboration in $B^+\to J/\psi\phi K^+$ decay above the
$J/\psi\phi$ threshold, and argue that it is more likely to be a
$D_s^*$-$D_s^*$ molecular state or an exotic ($J^{PC}=1^{-+}$) hybrid
charmonium. We have discussed decay modes which would allow unambiguous
identification of the hybrid charmonium option.
