Gas bubble growth as a result of diffusion flux of dissolved gas molecules
from the surrounding supersaturated solution to the bubble surface is studied.
The condition of the flux steadiness is revealed. A limitation from below on
the bubble radius is considered. Its fulfillment guarantees the smallness of
fluctuation influence on bubble growth and irreversibility of this process.
Under the conditions of steadiness of diffusion flux three stages of bubble
growth are marked out. With account for Laplace forces in the bubble intervals
of bubble size change and time intervals of these stages are found. The trend
of the third stage towards the self-similar regime of the bubble growth, when
Laplace forces in the bubble are completely neglected, is described
analytically.
