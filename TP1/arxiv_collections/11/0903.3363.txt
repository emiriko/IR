We present a novel buckling instability relevant to membrane budding in
eukaryotic cells. In this mechanism, curved filaments bind to a lipid bilayer
without changing its intrinsic curvature. As more and more filaments adsorb,
newly added ones are more and more strained, which destabilizes the flat
membrane. We perform a linear stability analysis of filament-dressed membranes
and find that the buckling threshold is within reasonable in vivo parameter
values. We account for the formation of long tubes previously observed in cells
and in purified systems. We study strongly deformed dressed membranes and their
bifurcation diagram numerically. Our mechanism could be validated by a simple
experiment.
