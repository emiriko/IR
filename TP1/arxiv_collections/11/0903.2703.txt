An approximate homotopy symmetry method for nonlinear problems is proposed
and applied to the six-order boussinesq equation. We summarize the general
formulas for similarity reduction solutions and similarity reduction equations
of different orders, educing the related homotopy series solutions. The
convergence region of homotopy series solutions can be adjusted by the
auxiliary parameter. Series solutions and similarity reduction equations from
approximate symmetry method can be retrieved from approximate homotopy symmetry
method.
