In this paper, we directly derive generalized mirror transformation of
projective hypersurfaces up to degree 3 genus 0 Gromov-Witten invariants by
comparing Kontsevich localization formula with residue integral representation
of the virtual structure constants. We can easily generalize our method for
rational curves of arbitrary degree except for combinatorial complexities.
