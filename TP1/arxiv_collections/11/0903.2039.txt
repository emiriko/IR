Generating functions for plane overpartitions are obtained using various
methods such as nonintersecting paths, RSK type algorithms and symmetric
functions. We extend some of the generating functions to cylindric partitions.
Also, we show that plane overpartitions correspond to certain domino tilings
and we give some basic properties of this correspondence.
