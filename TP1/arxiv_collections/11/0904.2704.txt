We have developed a novel scanning probe-based methodology to study cell
biomechanics. The time dependence of the force exerted by the cell surface on a
scanning probe at constant local deformation has been used to extract local
relaxational responses. The generalized Maxwell viscoelastic model that
accounts for multi relaxations fully describes the mechanical behaviour of the
cell surface that exhibits a bimodal relaxation. Within the range of tested
forces (0.1-4 nN) a slow and a fast relaxation with characteristic times of 0.1
and 1s have been detected and assigned to rearrangements in the cell membrane
and cytoskeleton cortex, respectively. Relaxation time mapping allows to
simultaneously detect non-uniformities in membrane and cytoskeletal mechanical
behaviour and can be used as both identifying and diagnosing tools for cell
type and cell disease.
