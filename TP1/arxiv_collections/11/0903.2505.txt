The NASA/IPAC/NExScI Star and Exoplanet Database (NStED) is a general purpose
stellar archive which supports NASA planet-finding and planet-characterization
goals, stellar astrophysics, and the planning of NASA and other space missions.
There are two principal components of NStED: a database of 140,000 nearby stars
and exoplanet-hosting stars, and an archive dedicated to high precision
photometric surveys for transiting exoplanets (NStED-ETSS). We present
summaries of these components. The NStED stellar database currently serves
published parameters for 140,000 stars. These parameters include coordinates,
multiplicity, proper motion, parallax, spectral type, multiband photometry,
radial velocity, metallicity, chromospheric and coronal activity index,
rotation velocity/period, infrared excess. NStED-ETSS currently serves data
from the TrES survey of the Kepler field as well as dedicated photometric
surveys of four stellar clusters. NStED-ETSS aims to serve both the surveys and
the broader astronomical community by archiving these data and making them
available in a homogeneous format.
