Study and comparison of over 30 examples of electron doped BaFe2As2 for
transition metal (TM) = Co, Ni, Cu, and (Co/Cu mixtures) have lead to an
understanding that the suppression of the structural/antiferromagnetic phase
transition to low enough temperature in these compounds is a necessary
condition for superconductivity, but not a sufficient one. Whereas the
structural/antiferromagnetic transitions are suppressed by the number of TM
dopant ions (or changes in the c-axis) the superconducting dome exists over a
limited range of values of the number of electrons added by doping (or values
of the {a/c} ratio). By choosing which combination of dopants are used we can
change the relative positions of the upper phase lines and the superconducting
dome, even to the extreme limit of suppressing the upper structural and
magnetic phase transitions without the stabilization of low temperature
superconducting dome.
