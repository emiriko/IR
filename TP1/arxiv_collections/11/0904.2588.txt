The Hamiltonian Theory of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) regime provides a
simple and tractable approach to calculating gaps, polarizations, and many
other physical quantities. In this paper we include disorder in our treatment,
and show that a simple model with minimal assumptions produces results
consistent with a range of experiments. In particular, the interplay between
disorder and interactions can result in experimental signatures which mimic
those of spin textures.
