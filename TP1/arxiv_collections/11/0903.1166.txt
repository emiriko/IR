We discuss perspectives for new tests of general relativity which are based
on recent technological developments as well as new ideas. We focus our
attention on tests performed with atomic clocks and do not repeat arguments
present in the other contributions to the present volume. In particular, we
present the scientific motivations of the space projects ACES and SAGAS.
