Solar gravity (g) modes propagate within the radiative part of the solar
interior and are highly sensitive to the physical conditions of the solar core.
They would represent the best tool to infer the structure and dynamics of the
radiative interior, in particular the core, if they were properly detected and
characterized. Although individual rotational splittings for g modes have not
yet been calculated, we have to understand the effect of these modes, and also
low-degree high-frequency p modes, on the inversion of the solar rotation rate
between 0.1 and 0.2 Rs. In this work, we follow the methodology developed in
Mathur et al. (2008) and Garcia et al. (2008), adding g modes and low-degree
high-frequency p modes to artificial inversion data sets, in order to study how
they convey information on the solar core rotation.
