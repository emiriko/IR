Million degree plasmas are ubiquitous in the Universe, and examples include
the atmospheres of white dwarfs; accretion phenomena in young stars,
cataclysmic variables and active galactic nuclei; the coronae of stars; and the
interstellar medium of our own galaxy and of others. The bulk of radiation from
million degree plasmas is emitted at extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths,
which includes critical spectral features containing diagnostic information
often not available at other wavelengths. With underpinning by a mature
instrument technology, there is great opportunity here for exciting
discoveries.
