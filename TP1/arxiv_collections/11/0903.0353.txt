The task of managing general game playing in a multi-agent system is the
problem addressed in this paper. It is considered to be done by an agent. There
are many reasons for constructing such an agent, called general game management
agent. This agent manages strategic interactions between other agents -
players, natural or also artificial. The agent records the interaction for
further benchmarking and analysis. He can also be used for a kind of restricted
communications. His behavior is defined by a game description written in a
logic-based language. The language, we present for this application, is more
expressive than the language GDL, which is already used for such purposes. Our
language can represent imperfect information and time dependent elements of a
game. Time dependent elements like delays and timeouts are of crucial
importance for interactions between players with bounded processing power like
humans. We provide examples to show the feasibility of our approach. A way for
game theoretical solving of an interaction description in our language is
considered as future work.
