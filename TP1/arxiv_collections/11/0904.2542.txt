This is the second paper in a series of papers showing the results of
extrasolar planet population synthesis calculations. In the companion paper
(Paper I), we have presented in detail our methods. By applying an
observational detection bias for radial velocity surveys, we identify the
potentially detectable synthetic planets. The properties of these planets are
compared in quantitative statistical tests with the properties of a carefully
selected sub-population of actual exoplanets. We use a two dimensional
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the mass-distance distributions of synthetic
and observed planets, as well as 1D KS tests to compare the mass, the semimajor
axis and the [Fe/H] distributions. We find that some models can account to a
reasonable degree of significance for the observed properties. We concurrently
account for many other observed features, e.g. the "metallicity effect". This
gives us confidence that our model captures several essential features of giant
planet formation. Our simulations allow us also to extract the properties of
the underlying exoplanet population that are not yet detectable. For example,
we have derived the planetary initial mass function (PIMF) and have been led to
conclude that the planets detected so far represent only the tip of the
iceberg. The PIMF can also be used to predict how the detectable extrasolar
planet population will change as the precision of radial velocity surveys
improves to an extreme precision of 0.1 m/s.
