We consider two-component one-dimensional quantum gases with density
imbalance. While generically such fluids are two-component Luttinger liquids,
we show that if the ratio of the densities is a rational number, p/q, and mass
asymmetry between components is sufficiently strong, one of the two eigenmodes
acquires a gap. The gapped phase corresponds to (algebraic) ordering of
(p+q)-particle composites. In particular, for attractive mixtures, this implies
that the superconducting correlations are destroyed. We illustrate our
predictions by numerical simulations of the fermionic Hubbard model with
hopping asymmetry.
