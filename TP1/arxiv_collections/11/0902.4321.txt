We study the momentum dependence of the ghost propagator and of the space and
time components of the gluon propagator at equal time in pure SU(3) lattice
Coulomb gauge theory carrying out a joint analysis of data collected
independently at RCNP Osaka and Humboldt University Berlin. We focus on the
scaling behavior of these propagators at beta=5.8,...,6.2 and apply a matching
technique to relate the data for the different lattice cutoffs. Thereby,
lattice artifacts are found to be rather strong for both instantaneous gluon
propagators at large momentum. As a byproduct we obtain the respective lattice
scale dependences a(beta) for the transversal gluon and the ghost propagator
which indeed run faster with beta than two-loop running, but slightly slower
than what is known from the Necco-Sommer analysis of the heavy quark potential.
The abnormal a(beta) dependence as determined from the instantaneous time-time
gluon propagator, D_{44}, remains a problem, though. The role of residual
gauge-fixing influencing D_{44} is discussed.
