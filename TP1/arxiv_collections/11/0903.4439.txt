It is a consequence of QCD's spontaneously broken chiral symmetry that the
response of the neutron to long wavelength probes will be driven by excitation
of its pion cloud. In this article I discuss manifestations of this in
electromagnetic form factors and Compton scattering. Particular attention is
given to the interplay between this physics and shorter-distance components of
the neutron's electromagnetic structure.
