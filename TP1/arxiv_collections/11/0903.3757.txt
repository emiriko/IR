The magnetic Prandtl number Pr_M is the ratio of viscosity to resistivity. In
astrophysical disks the diffusion of angular momentum (viscosity) and magnetic
fields (resistivity) are controlled by turbulence. Phenomenological models of
the evolution of large scale poloidal magnetic fields in disks suggest that the
turbulent magnetic Prandtl number Pr_{M,T} controls the rate of escape of
vertical field from the disk; for Pr_{M,T} leq R/H vertical field diffuses
outward before it can be advected inward by accretion. Here we measure field
diffusion and angular momentum transport due to MHD turbulence in a shearing
box, and thus Pr_{M,T}, by studying the evolution of a sinusoidal perturbation
in the magnetic field that is injected into a turbulent background. We show
that the perturbation is always stable, decays approximately exponentially, has
decay rate proportional to k^2, and that the implied Pr_{M,T} ~ 1.
