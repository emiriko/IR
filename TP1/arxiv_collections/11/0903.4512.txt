We show that for every spherical category $\C$ with invertible dimension, the
Turaev-Viro TQFT admits a splitting into blocks which come from an HQFT, called
the Turaev-Viro HQFT. The Turaev-Viro HQFT has the classifying space $B\grad$
as target space, where $\grad$ is a group obtained from the category $\C$. This
construction gives a reformulation of the Turaev-Viro TQFT in terms of HQFT.
Furthermore the Turaev-Viro HQFT is an extension of the \emph{homotopical
Turaev-Viro invariant} which splits the Turaev-Viro invariant. An application
of this result is a description of the homological twisted version of the
Turaev-Viro invariant in terms of HQFT.
