The ground state Lamb shift of a semiconductor spherical Quantum Dot is
computed in the effective mass approximation. It appears to be significant
enough to be detectable for a wide range of small Quantum Dots synthesized in
semiconductors. A possible way to bserve it, via the Casimir effect, is
suggested.
