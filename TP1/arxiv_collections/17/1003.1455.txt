Poetry-writing in Sanskrit is riddled with problems for even those who know
the language well. This is so because the rules that govern Sanskrit prosody
are numerous and stringent. We propose a computational algorithm that converts
prose given as E-text into poetry in accordance with the metrical rules of
Sanskrit prosody, simultaneously taking care to ensure that sandhi or euphonic
conjunction, which is compulsory in verse, is handled. The algorithm is
considerably speeded up by a novel method of reducing the target search
database. The algorithm further gives suggestions to the poet in case what
he/she has given as the input prose is impossible to fit into any allowed
metrical format. There is also an interactive component of the algorithm by
which the algorithm interacts with the poet to resolve ambiguities. In
addition, this unique work, which provides a solution to a problem that has
never been addressed before, provides a simple yet effective speech recognition
interface that would help the visually impaired dictate words in E-text, which
is in turn versified by our Poetry Composer Engine.
