We demonstrate that a magneto-convection simulation incorporating essential
physical processes governing solar surface convection exhibits turbulent
small-scale dynamo action. By presenting a derivation of the energy balance
equation and transfer functions for compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), we
quantify the source of magnetic energy on a scale-by-scale basis. We rule out
the two alternative mechanisms for the generation of small-scale magnetic field
in the simulations: the tangling of magnetic field lines associated with the
turbulent cascade and Alfvenization of small-scale velocity fluctuations
("turbulent induction"). Instead, we find the dominant source of small-scale
magnetic energy is stretching by inertial-range fluid motions of small-scale
magnetic field lines against the magnetic tension force to produce (against
Ohmic dissipation) more small-scale magnetic field. The scales involved become
smaller with increasing Reynolds number, which identifies the dynamo as a
small-scale turbulent dynamo.
