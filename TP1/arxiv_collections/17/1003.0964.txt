It has been proposed that microwave cavities can be used in a photon
regeneration experiment to search for hidden sector photons. Using two isolated
cavities, the presence of hidden sector photons could be inferred from a 'light
shining through a wall' phenomenon. The sensitivity of the experiment has
strong a dependence on the geometric construction and electromagnetic mode
properties of the two cavities. In this paper we perform an in depth
investigation to determine the optimal setup for such an experiment. We also
describe the results of our first microwave cavity experiment to search for
hidden sector photons. The experiment consisted of two cylindrical copper
cavities stacked axially inside a single vacuum chamber. At a hidden sector
photon mass of 37.78 micro eV we place an upper limit on the kinetic mixing
parameter chi = 2.9 * 10^(-5). Whilst this result lies within already
established limits our experiment validates the microwave cavity `light shining
through a wall' concept. We also show that the experiment has great scope for
improvement, potentially able to reduce the current upper limit on the mixing
parameter chi by several orders of magnitude.
