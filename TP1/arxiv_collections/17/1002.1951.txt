The purpose of this Paper is to describe our research on different feature
extraction and matching techniques in designing a Content Based Image Retrieval
(CBIR) system. Due to the enormous increase in image database sizes, as well as
its vast deployment in various applications, the need for CBIR development
arose. Firstly, this paper outlines a description of the primitive feature
extraction techniques like, texture, colour, and shape. Once these features are
extracted and used as the basis for a similarity check between images, the
various matching techniques are discussed. Furthermore, the results of its
performance are illustrated by a detailed example.
