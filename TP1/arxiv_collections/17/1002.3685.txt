Cold fermionic atoms with three different hyperfine states with
  SU(3) symmetry confined in one-dimensional optical lattices show color-charge
separation, generalizing the conventional spin charge separation for
interacting SU(2) fermions in one dimension. Through time-dependent DMRG
simulations, we explore the features of this phenomenon for a generalized SU(3)
Hubbard Hamiltonian. In our numerical simulations of finite size systems, we
observe different velocities of the charge and color degrees of freedom when a
Gaussian wave packet or a charge (color) density response to a local
perturbation is evolved. The differences between attractive and repulsive
interactions are explored and we note that neither a small anisotropy of the
interaction, breaking the SU(3) symmetry, nor the filling impedes the basic
observation of these effects.
