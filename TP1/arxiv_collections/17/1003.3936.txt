Local magnetic measurements are used to quantitatively characterize
heterogeneity and flux line pinning in PrFeAsO_1-y and NdFeAs(O,F)
superconducting single crystals. In spite of spatial fluctuations of the
critical current density on the macroscopic scale, it is shown that the major
contribution comes from collective pinning of vortex lines by microscopic
defects by the mean-free path fluctuation mechanism. The defect density
extracted from experiment corresponds to the dopant atom density, which means
that dopant atoms play an important role both in vortex pinning and in
quasiparticle scattering. In the studied underdoped PrFeAsO_1-y and NdFeAs(O,F)
crystals, there is a background of strong pinning, which we attribute to
spatial variations of the dopant atom density on the scale of a few dozen to
one hundred nm. These variations do not go beyond 5% - we therefore do not find
any evidence for coexistence of the superconducting and the antiferromagnetic
phase. The critical current density in sub-T fields is characterized by the
presence of a peak effect, the location of which in the (B,T)-plane is
consistent with an order-disorder transition of the vortex lattice.
