Light scalar mesons abound in hadron processes, like the alligators in the
Florida Everglades. Moreover, scalars are intimately tied to the vacuum
structure of QCD. They are the product of many decays. Consequently, a rich
source of recent information about them has come from experiments producing
heavy flavour mesons. Indeed, scalars will continue to dominate many of the
processes to be studied at forthcoming facilities like BESIII in Beijing, FAIR
at GSI Darmstadt and the GlueX experiment at JLab, making an understanding (or
at least an excellent and theoretically consistent description) essential for
the physics missions of these facilities.
