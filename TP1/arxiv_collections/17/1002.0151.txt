An urban road network of Le Mans in France is analyzed. Some topological
properties of network are investigated, such as degree distribution, clustering
coefficient, diameter, and characteristic path length. These results suggest
that our network is a "small- world" network with short average shortest path
and large clustering coefficient. Furthermore, double power-law distribution is
found in degree distribution which is distinct from the single power-law and a
novel degree distribution function is also given. Some analysis on this
function extend the comprehension of the origination of the double power-law
distribution widely dispersed in nature.
