In quasicrystals, the phason degree of freedom and the inherent anharmonic
potentials lead to complex dynamics which cannot be described by the usual
phonon modes of motion. We have constructed simple one-dimensional model
systems, the dynamic Fibonacci chain (DFC) and approximants thereof. They allow
us to study the dynamics of periodic and quasiperiodic structures with
anharmonic double well interactions both by analytical calculations and by
molecular dynamics simulations. We found soliton modes like breathers and kink
solitons and we were able to obtain closed analytical solutions for special
cases, which are in good agreement with our simulations. Calculation of the
specific heat shows an increase above the Dulong-Petit value, which is due to
the anharmonicity of the potential and not caused by the phason degree of
freedom.
