We make a review on the recent progress in the operator algebraic approach to
(super)conformal field theory. We discuss representation theory, classification
results, full and boundary conformal field theories, relations to supervertex
operator algebras and Moonshine, connections to subfactor theory and
noncommutative geometry.
