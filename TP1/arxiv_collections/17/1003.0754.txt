The 3D network originated by the faces of irregular Poissonian Voronoi
Polyhedrons may represent the backbone on which the galaxies are originated. As
a consequence the spatial appearance of the catalogs of galaxies can be
reproduced. The selected catalogs to simulate are the 2dF Galaxy Redshift
Survey and the Third Reference Catalog of Bright Galaxies. In order to explain
the number of observed galaxies for a given flux/magnitude as a function of the
redshift, the photometric properties of the galaxies should be carefully
examined from both the astronomical and theoretical point of view. The
statistics of the Voronoi normalized volume is modeled by two distributions and
the Eridanus super-void is identified as the largest volume belonging to the
Voronoi Polyhedron. The behavior of the correlation function for galaxies is
simulated by adopting the framework of thick faces of Voronoi Polyhedrons on
short scales, while adopting standard arguments on large scales.
