The multiconfiguration methods are widely used by quantum physicists and
chemists for numerical approximation of the many electron Schr\"odinger
equation. Recently, first mathematically rigorous results were obtained on the
time-dependent models, e.g. short-in-time well-posedness in the Sobolev space
$H^2$ for bounded interactions (C. Lubichand O. Koch} with initial data in
$H^2$, in the energy space for Coulomb interactions with initial data in the
same space (Trabelsi, Bardos et al.}, as well as global well-posedness under a
sufficient condition on the energy of the initial data (Bardos et al.). The
present contribution extends the analysis by setting an $L^2$ theory for the
MCTDHF for general interactions including the Coulomb case. This kind of
results is also the theoretical foundation of ad-hoc methods used in numerical
calculation when modification ("regularization") of the density matrix destroys
the conservation of energy property, but keeps invariant the mass.
