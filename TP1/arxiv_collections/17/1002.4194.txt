We present the analysis of two long Gamma-Ray Bursts, GRB 090323 and GRB
090328, which triggered the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and generated
an Autonomous Repoint Request to the Fermi Large Area Telescope. The GBM light
curves show multi-peaked structures for both events. Here, we present
time-integrated and time-resolved burst spectra fitted with different models by
the GBM detectors.
