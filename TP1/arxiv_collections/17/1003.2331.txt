The electrical conductivity of PVC films prepared with a patented plasticizer
of type "A" was measured with high precision automated setup, based on standard
ring sell with a voltage range much less than breakdown voltage. Continual
voltage-current measurements permit to take into account Debay relaxation
process and clearly distinguish specific polymer film conductivity effects,
connected with continuous current-stabilization behavior and transitions
between two stable (long-living) states with several order magnitude different
conductivities. Spontaneous reversible and non-destructive transitions of
resistance levels was observed. For 30 mkm polymer films the values of sample
resistance was measured equal to: high- 106 Ohm and low -103 Ohm.
