In this paper we give a proof of the existence of an orthogonal geodesic
chord on a Riemannian manifold homeomorphic to a closed disk and with concave
boundary. This kind of study is motivated by the link of the multiplicity
problem with the famous Seifert conjecture (formulated in 1948) about multiple
brake orbits for a class of Hamiltonian systems at a fixed energy level.
