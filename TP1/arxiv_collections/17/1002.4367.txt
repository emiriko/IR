Motivated by Resonant X-ray scattering experiments in cuprate ladder
materials showing charge order modulation of period $\lambda=3$ and 5 at
specific hole densities, we investigate models involving the electronic t-J
ladders and bosonic chains coupled via screened Coulomb repulsion. Extensive
density matrix renormalization group calculations applied to the ladders/chains
supplemented by a self-consistent mean-field treatment of the
inter-ladder/chain coupling provide quantitative estimates of the charge order
for $\lambda=3,4$ and 5. As previously proposed, such patterns correspond to
the emergence of pair density waves which stem from the strong electronic
correlations. We comment on the existence of a $\lambda=4$ modulation not seen
so far in experiment.
