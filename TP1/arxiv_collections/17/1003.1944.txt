High precision measurements of induced and transferred recoil proton
polarization in d(polarized gamma, polarized p})n have been performed for
photon energies of 277--357 MeV and theta_cm = 20 degrees -- 120 degrees. The
measurements were motivated by a longstanding discrepancy between meson-baryon
model calculations and data at higher energies. At the low energies of this
experiment, theory continues to fail to reproduce the data, indicating that
either something is missing in the calculations and/or there is a problem with
the accuracy of the nucleon-nucleon potential being used.
