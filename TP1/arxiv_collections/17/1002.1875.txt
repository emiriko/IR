Context: According to theory, high-energy emission from the coronae of cool
stars can severely erode the atmospheres of orbiting planets. No observational
tests of the long term effects of erosion have yet been made. Aims: To analyze
the current distribution of planetary mass with X-ray irradiation of the
atmospheres in order to make an observational assessment of the effects of
erosion by coronal radiation. Methods: We study a large sample of
planet-hosting stars with XMM-Newton, Chandra and ROSAT; make a careful
identification of X-ray counterparts; and fit their spectra to make accurately
measurements of the stellar X-ray flux. Results: The distribution of the
planetary masses with X-ray flux suggests that erosion has taken place: most
surviving massive planets, (M_p sin i >1.5 M_J), have been exposed to lower
accumulated irradiation. Heavy erosion during the initial stages of stellar
evolution is followed by a phase of much weaker erosion. A line dividing these
two phases could be present, showing a strong dependence on planet mass.
Although a larger sample will be required to establish a well-defined erosion
line, the distribution found is very suggestive. Conclusions: The distribution
of planetary mass with X-ray flux is consistent with a scenario in which planet
atmospheres have suffered the effects of erosion by coronal X-ray and EUV
emission. The erosion line is an observational constraint to models of
atmospheric erosion.
