We investigate the horizontal distribution of zeros of the derivative of the
Riemann zeta function and compare this to the radial distribution of zeros of
the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of a random unitary matrix.
Both cases show a surprising bimodal distribution which has yet to be
explained. We show by example that the bimodality is a general phenomenon. For
the unitary matrix case we prove a conjecture of Mezzadri concerning the
leading order behavior, and we show that the same follows from the random
matrix conjectures for the zeros of the zeta function.
