Adsorption of gaseous species, and in particular of hydrogen atoms, on
graphene is an important process for the chemistry of this material. At the
equilibrium geometry, the H atom is covalently bonded to a carbon that puckers
out from the surface plane. Nevertheless the \emph{flat} graphene geometry
becomes important when considering the full sticking dynamics. Here we show how
GGA-DFT predicts a wrong spin state for this geometry, namely $S_z$=0 for a
single H atom on graphene. We show how this is caused by the self-interaction
error since the system shows fractional electron occupations in the two bands
closest to the Fermi energy. It is demonstrated how the use of hybrid
functionals or the GGA+$U$ method an be used to retrieve the correct spin
solution although the latter gives an incorrect potential energy curve.
