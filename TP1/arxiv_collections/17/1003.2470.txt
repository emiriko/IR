We introduce a notion of non-local almost minimal boundaries similar to that
introduced by Almgren in geometric measure theory. Extending methods developed
recently for non-local minimal surfaces we prove that flat non-local almost
minimal boundaries are smooth. This can be viewed as a non-local version of the
Almgren-De Giorgi-Tamanini regularity theory. The main result has several
applications, among these $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity for sets with prescribed
non-local mean curvature in $L^p$ and regularity of solutions to non-local
obstacle problems.
