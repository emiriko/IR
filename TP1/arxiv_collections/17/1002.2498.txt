In this paper we present a new proof of the homological stability of the
moduli space of closed surfaces in a simply connected background space $K$,
which we denote by $S_g (K)$. The homology stability of surfaces in $K$ with an
arbitrary number of boundary components, $S_{g,n} (K)$ was studied by the
authors in \cite{cohenmadsen}. The study there relied on stability results for
the homology of mapping class groups, $\Gamma_{g,n}$ with certain families of
twisted coefficients. It turns out that these mapping class groups only have
homological stability when $n$, the number of boundary components, is positive,
or in the closed case when the coefficient modules are trivial. Because of this
we present a new proof of the rational homological stability for $S_g(K)$, that
is homotopy theoretic in nature. We also take the opportunity to prove a new
stability theorem for closed surfaces in $K$ that have marked points.
