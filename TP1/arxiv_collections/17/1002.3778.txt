We give an explicitly gauge invariant canonical analysis of linearized
quadratic gravity theories in three dimensions for both flat and de-Sitter
backgrounds. In flat backgrounds, we also study the effects of gravitational
Chern-Simons term, and include the sources, compute the weak field limit as
well as scattering between spinning massive particles.
