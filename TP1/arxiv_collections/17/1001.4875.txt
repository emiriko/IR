We study entanglement degradation of two non-interacting qubits subject to
independent baths with broadband spectra typical of solid state nanodevices. We
obtain the analytic form of the concurrence in the presence of adiabatic noise
for classes of entangled initial states presently achievable in experiments. We
find that adiabatic (low frequency) noise affects entanglement reduction
analogously to pure dephasing noise. Due to quantum (high frequency) noise,
entanglement is totally lost in a state-dependent finite time. The possibility
to implement on-chip both local and entangling operations is briefly discussed.
