The results of muon-spin relaxation and heat capacity measurements on two
pyroxene compounds LiFeSi2O6 and NaFeSi2O6 demonstrate that despite their
underlying structural similarity the magnetic ordering is considerably
different. In LiFeSi2O6 a single muon precession frequency is observed below
TN, consistent with a single peak at TN in the heat capacity and a commensurate
magnetic structure. In applied magnetic fields the heat capacity peak splits in
two. In contrast, for natural NaFeSi2O6, where multiferroicity has been
observed in zero-magnetic-field, a rapid Gaussian depolarization is observed
showing that the magnetic structure is more complex. Synthetic NaFeSi2O6 shows
a single muon precession frequency but with a far larger damping rate than in
the lithium compound. Heat capacity measurements reproduce the phase diagrams
previously derived from other techniques and demonstrate that the magnetic
entropy is mostly associated with the build up of correlations in the
quasi-one-dimensional Fe3+ chains.
