A superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) system for
telecommunication wavelength using a GM cryocooler was developed and its
performance was verified. The cryocooler based SNSPD system can operate
continuously with a 100 V AC power supply without any cryogen. The packaged
SNSPD device was cooled to 2.96 K within a thermal fluctuation range of 10 mK.
An SNSPD with an area of 20 x 20 $\mu m^2$ showed good system detection
efficiency (DE) at 100 Hz dark count rate of 2.6% and 4.5% at wavelengths of
1550 and 1310 nm, respectively. An SNSPD with an area of 10 x 10 $\mu m^2$ and
kinetic inductance lower than that of the large area device showed good system
DE of 2.6% at a wavelength of 1550 nm. The SNSPD system could be operated for
over 10 h with constant system DE and dark count rate.
