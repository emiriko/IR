We find the nearest product states for arbitrary generalized W states of n
qubits, and show that the nearest product state is essentially unique if the W
state is highly entangled. It is specified by a unit vector in Euclidean
n-dimensional space. We use this duality between unit vectors and highly
entangled W states to find the geometric measure of entanglement of such
states.
