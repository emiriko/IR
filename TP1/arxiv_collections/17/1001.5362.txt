It is shown, that a free motion of microparticles (elementary particles) in
the gravitational field is multivariant (stochastic). This multivariance is
conditioned by multivariant physical space-time geometry. The physical geometry
is described completely by a world function. The Riemannian geometries form a
small part of possible physical geometries. The contemporary theory of
gravitation ignores existence of physical geometries. It supposes, that any
space-time geometry is a Riemannian geometry. It is a mistake. As a result the
contemporary theory of gravitation needs a revision. Besides, the Riemannian
geometry is inconsistent, and conclusions of the gravitational theory, based on
inconsistent geometry may be invalid. Free motion of macroparticles (planets),
consisting of many connected microparticles, is deterministic, because
connection of microparticles inside the macroparticle averages stochastic
motion of single macroparticles.
