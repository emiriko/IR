We scrutinize the effects of non-ideal data acquisition on the homodyne
tomograms of photon quantum states. The presence of a weight function,
schematizing the effects of the finite thickness of the probing beam or
equivalently noise, only affects the state reconstruction procedure by a
normalization constant. The results are extended to a discrete mesh and show
that quantum tomography is robust under incomplete and approximate knowledge of
tomograms.
