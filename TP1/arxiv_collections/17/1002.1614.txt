A new statistical model of charge transport in colloidal quantum dot arrays
is proposed. It takes into account Coulomb blockade forbidding multiple
occupancy of nanocrystals and influence of energetic disorder of interdot
space. The model explains power law current transients and the presence of
memory effect. The fractional differential analogue of the Ohm law is found
phenomenologically for nanocrystal arrays. The model combines ideas that were
considered as conflicting by other authors: the Scher-Montroll idea about power
law distribution of waiting times in localized states for disordered
semiconductors is applied with taking into account Coulomb blockade, Novikov's
condition about asymptotical power law distribution of time intervals between
successful current pulses in conduction channels is fulfilled, carrier
injection blocking predicted by Ginger and Greenham takes place.
