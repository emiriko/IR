We study the 2D Vector Meson model introduced by Thirring and Wess, that is
to say the Schwinger model with massive photon and massless fermion. We prove,
with a renormalization group approach, that the vector and axial Ward
identities are broken by the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly; and we rigorously
establish three widely believed consequences: a) the interacting meson-meson
correlation equals a free boson propagator, though the mass is additively
renormalized by the anomaly; b) the anomaly is quadratic in the charge, in
agreement with the Adler-Bardeen formula; c) the fermion-fermion correlation
has an anomalous long-distance decay.
