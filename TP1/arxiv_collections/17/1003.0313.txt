We show the existence of thermal rectification in the graded mass quantum
chain of harmonic oscillators with self-consistent reservoirs. Our analytical
study allows us to identify the ingredients leading to the effect. The presence
of rectification in this effective, simple model (representing graded mass
materials, systems that may be constructed in practice) indicates that
rectification in graded mass quantum systems may be an ubiquitous phenomenon.
Moreover, as the classical version of this model does not present
rectification, our results show that, here, rectification is a direct result of
the quantum statistics.
