We propose a new leptogenesis scenario in a gauged $B-L$ model with
supersymmetry at the TeV energy scale. Instead of relying on the very small
Yukawa couplings of the singlet neutrinos $N^c$ to generate the observed baryon
asymmetry of the Universe, which requires a very large resonance enhancement,
their $B-L$ gauge interactions are invoked. Successful leptogenesis is then
possible if a particular scalar bilinear $\tilde N^c \tilde N^c$ term is
disallowed.
