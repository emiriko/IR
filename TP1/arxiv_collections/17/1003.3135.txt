We present here the system size dependence of balance energy for semi-central
and peripheral collisions using quantum molecular dynamics model. For this
study, the reactions of $Ne^{20}+Ne^{20}$, $Ca^{40}+Ca^{40}$,
$Ni^{58}+Ni^{58}$, $Nb^{93}+Nb^{93}$, $Xe^{131}+Xe^{131}$ and
$Au^{197}+Au^{197}$ are simulated at different incident energies and impact
parameters. A hard equation of state along with nucleon-nucleon cross-sections
between 40 - 55 mb explains the data nicely. Interestingly, balance energy
follows a power law $\propto{A^{\tau}}$ for the mass dependence at all
colliding geometries. The power factor $\tau$ is close to -1/3 in central
collisions whereas it is -2/3 for peripheral collisions suggesting stronger
system size dependence at peripheral geometries. This also suggests that in the
absence of momentum dependent interactions, Coulomb's interaction plays an
exceedingly significant role. These results are further analyzed for nuclear
dynamics at the balance point.
