Aims: The detection of close and faint companions is an essential step in
many astrophysical fields, including the search for planetary companions. A new
method called "phase closure nulling" has been proposed for the detection of
such faint and close companions based on interferometric observations when the
system visibility amplitude is close to zero due to the large diameter of the
primary star. We aim at demonstrating this method by analyzing observations
obtained on the spectroscopic binary HD 59717. Methods: Using the AMBER/VLTI
instrument in the K-band with ~1500 spectral resolution, we record the
spectrally dispersed closures phases of the SB1 binary HD 59717 with a
three-baseline combination adequate for applying phase closure methods. After a
careful data reduction, we fit the primary diameter, the binary flux ratio, and
the separation using the phase closure data. Results: We detect the 5-mag
fainter companion of HD 59717 at a distance of 4 stellar radii from the
primary. We determine the diameter of the primary, infer the secondary's
spectral type and determine the masses and sizes of the stars in the binary
system. This is one of the highest contrasts detected by interferometry between
a companion and its parent star. Based on observations collected at the
European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile, within the commissioning
programme 60.A-9054(A).
