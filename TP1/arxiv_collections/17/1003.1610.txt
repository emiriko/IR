Every irreducible component of the variety of semi-simple n-dimensional
representations of the modular group has a Zariski dense subset contained in
the image of an etale map from a rational quotient variety of representations
of a fixed quiver Q. As an application we prove that there is a unique
component of 6-dimensional representations of the three string braid group B(3)
able to detect braid-reversion. Further, we give explicit rational
parametrizations of dense families of simple B(3)-representations in all
dimensions < 12.
