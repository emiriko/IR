We present an X-ray morphological and spectroscopic study of the pulsar
B2224+65 and its apparent jet-like X-ray features based on two epoch Chandra
observations. The main X-ray feature, which shows a large directional offset
from the ram-pressure confined pulsar wind nebula (Guitar Nebula), is broader
in apparent width and shows evidence for spectral hardening (at 95 percent
confidence) in the second epoch compared to the first. Furthermore, the sharp
leading edge of the feature is found to have a proper motion consistent with
that of the pulsar (~180 mas yr-1). The combined data set also provides
evidence for the presence of a counter feature, albeit substantially fainter
and shorter than the main one. Additional spectral trends along the major and
minor axes of the feature are only marginally detected in the two epoch data,
including softening counter to the direction of proper motion. Possible
explanations for the X-ray features include diffuse energetic particles being
confined by an organized ambient magnetic field as well as a simple ballistic
jet interpretation; however, the former may have difficulty in explaining
observed spectral trends between epochs and along the feature's major axis
whereas the latter may struggle to elucidate its linearity. Given the low
counting statistics available in the two epoch observations, it remains
difficult to determine a physical production scenario for these enigmatic X-ray
emitting features with any certainty.
