We have used time-resolved x-ray photoemission electron microscopy to
investigate the magnetization dynamics induced by nanosecond current pulses in
NiFe/Cu/Co nanostripes. A large tilt of the NiFe magnetization in the direction
transverse to the stripe is observed during the pulses. We show that this
effect cannot be quantitatively understood from the amplitude of the Oersted
field and the shape anisotropy. High frequency oscillations observed at the
onset of the pulses are attributed to precessional motion of the NiFe
magnetization about the effective field. We discuss the possible origins of the
large magnetization tilt and the potential implications of the static and
dynamic effects of the Oersted field on current-induced domain wall motion in
such stripes.
