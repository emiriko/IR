The exact solution for the energy spectrum of a one-dimensional Hamiltonian
with local two-site interactions and periodic boundary conditions is
determined. The two-site Hamiltonians commute with the symmetry algebra given
by the Drinfeld double D(D_3) of the dihedral group D_3. As such the model
describes local interactions between non-Abelian anyons, with fusion rules
given by the tensor product decompositions of the irreducible representations
of D(D_3). The Bethe ansatz equations which characterise the exact solution are
found through the use of functional relations satisfied by a set of mutually
commuting transfer matrices.
