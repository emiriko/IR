Electrical characterization of a nonthermal radio-frequency
atmospheric-pressure microplasma in a parallel plate configuration has shown
that reducing electrode gap into the submillimeter range increases current and
power density at a reduced voltage as compared to similar plasmas at larger
electrode gaps which have no gap dependence. Calculation of sheath thickness
and electric fields in the sheath and in the bulk demonstrate a dependence on
the electrode gap as it is reduced into the submillimeter regime, indicating a
distinct regime of operation.
