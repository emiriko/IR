We consider a class of map, recently derived in the context of cluster
mutation. In this paper we start with a brief review of the quiver context, but
then move onto a discussion of a related Poisson bracket, along with the
Poisson algebra of a special family of functions associated with these maps. A
bi-Hamiltonian structure is derived and used to construct a sequence of Poisson
commuting functions and hence show complete integrability. Canonical
coordinates are derived, with the map now being a canonical transformation with
a sequence of commuting invariant functions. Compatibility of a pair of these
functions gives rise to Liouville's equation and the map plays the role of a
B\"acklund transformation.
