The identity of dark matter is a question of central importance in both
astrophysics and particle physics. In the past, the leading particle candidates
were cold and collisionless, and typically predicted missing energy signals at
particle colliders. However, recent progress has greatly expanded the list of
well-motivated candidates and the possible signatures of dark matter. This
review begins with a brief summary of the standard model of particle physics
and its outstanding problems. We then discuss several dark matter candidates
motivated by these problems, including WIMPs, superWIMPs, light gravitinos,
hidden dark matter, sterile neutrinos, and axions. For each of these, we
critically examine the particle physics motivations and present their expected
production mechanisms, basic properties, and implications for direct and
indirect detection, particle colliders, and astrophysical observations.
Upcoming experiments will discover or exclude many of these candidates, and
progress may open up an era of unprecedented synergy between studies of the
largest and smallest observable length scales.
