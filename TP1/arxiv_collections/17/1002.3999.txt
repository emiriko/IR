MIMO (Multi Input Multi Output) wireless communication system is an
innovative solution to improve the bandwidth efficiency by exploiting
multipath-richness of the propagation environment. The degree of
multipath-richness of the channel will determine the capacity gain attainable
by MIMO deployment. Therefore, it is very important to have accurate knowledge
of the propagation environment/radio channel before MIMO implement. The radio
channel behavior can be estimated by channel measurement or channel sounding.
CDM (Code Division multiplexing) is one of the channel sounding techniques that
allow accurate measurement at the cost of hardware complexity. CDM based
channel sounder, requires code with excellent autocorrelation and
cross-correlation properties which generally difficult to achieve
simultaneously. Theoretical analysis and computer simulation result
demonstrated that, having excellent correlation propertied Loosely Synchronous
(LS) code sequence perform efficiently. Finally, the an efficient LS code
generator as a data source for transmitter implemented in Xilinx FPGA that can
be integrated into CDM based 2x2 MIMO complete channel sounder.
