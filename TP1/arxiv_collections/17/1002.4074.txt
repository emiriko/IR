We show that the vanishing of certain cohomology groups of polyhedral
complexes imply upper bounds on Ramsey numbers. Lovasz bounded the chromatic
numbers of graphs using Hom complexes. Babson and Kozlov proved Lovasz
conjecture and developed a Hom complex theory. We generalize the Hom complexes
to Ramsey complexes.
  The main theorem states that if certain cohomology groups of the Ramsey
complex Ram(dDelta_{p^k}, Sigma) are trivial, then the vertices of the
simplicial complex Sigma cannot be n-colored such that every color correspond
to a face of Sigma. In a corollary, we give an explicit description of the
Ramsey complexes used for upper bounds on Ramsey numbers.
