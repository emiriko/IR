An anhomomorphic logic $\ascript ^*$ is the set of all possible realities for
a quantum system. Our main goal is to find the "actual reality"
$\phi_a\in\ascript ^*$ for the system. Reality filters are employed to
eliminate unwanted potential realities until only $\phi_a$ remains. In this
paper, we consider three reality filters that are constructed by means of
quantum integrals. A quantum measure $\mu$ can generate or actualize a
$\phi\in\ascript ^*$ if $\mu (A)$ is a quantum integral with respect to $\phi$
for a density function $f$ over events $A$. In this sense, $\mu$ is an
"average" of the truth values of $\phi$ with weights given by $f$. We mainly
discuss relations between these filters and their existence and uniqueness
properties. For example, we show that a quadratic reality generated by a
quantum measure is unique. In this case we obtain the unique actual quadratic
reality.
