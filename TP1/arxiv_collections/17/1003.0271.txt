The non-relativistic approximation of the quark-meson-coupling model has been
discussed and compared with the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock model which includes spin
exchanges. Calculations show that the spin-exchange interaction has important
effect on the descriptions of finite nuclei and nuclear matter through the Fock
exchange. Also in the quark-meson-coupling model, it is the Fock exchange that
leads to a nonlinear density-dependent isovector channel and changes the
density-dependent behavior of the symmetry energy.
