We study the effect of thermal phase fluctuation on the electron spectral
function $A(k,\omega)$ in a d-wave superconductor with Monte Carlo simulation.
The phase degree of freedom is modeled by a XY-type model with build-in d-wave
character. We find a ridge-like structure emerges abruptly on the underlying
Fermi surface in $A(k,\omega=0)$ above the KT-transition temperature of the XY
model. Such a ridge-like structure, which shares the same characters with the
Fermi arc observed in the pseudogap phase of the underdoped cuprates, is found
to be caused by the vortex-like phase fluctuation of the XY model.
