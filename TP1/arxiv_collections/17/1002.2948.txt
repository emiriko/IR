Dome A, the highest plateau in Antarctica, is being developed as a site for
an astronomical observatory. The planned telescopes and instrumentation and the
unique site characteristics are conducive toward Type Ia supernova surveys for
cosmology. A self-contained search and survey over five years can yield a
spectro-photometric time series of ~1000 z<0.08 supernovae. These can serve to
anchor the Hubble diagram and quantify the relationship between luminosities
and heterogeneities within the Type Ia supernova class, reducing systematics.
Larger aperture (>4-m) telescopes are capable of discovering supernovae shortly
after explosion out to z~3. These can be fed to space telescopes, and can
isolate systematics and extend the redshift range over which we measure the
expansion history of the universe.
