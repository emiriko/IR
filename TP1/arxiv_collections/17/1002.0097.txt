We investigate the construction of prefix-free and fix-free codes with
specified codeword compositions. We present a polynomial time algorithm which
constructs a fix-free code with the same codeword compositions as a given code
for a special class of codes called distinct codes. We consider the
construction of optimal fix-free codes which minimizes the average codeword
cost for general letter costs with uniform distribution of the codewords and
present an approximation algorithm to find a near optimal fix-free code with a
given constant cost.
