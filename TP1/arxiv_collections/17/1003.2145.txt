The electrodynamical formulae for the transition radiation are applied to the
case of partons crossing the surface of the deconfined region in heavy ion
collisions. The chromopermittivity is used in place of the dielectric
permittivity. The corresponding energy-angular distributions of emitted gluons
are discussed. They could be of interest at LHC energies.
