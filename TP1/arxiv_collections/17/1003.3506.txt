Many proposals have been put forth for controlling quantum phenomena,
including open-loop, adaptive feedback, and real-time feedback control. Each of
these approaches has been viewed as operationally, and even physically,
distinct from the others. This work shows that all such scenarios inherently
share the same fundamental control features residing in the topology of the
landscape relating the target physical observable to the applied controls. This
unified foundation may provide a basis for development of hybrid control
schemes that would combine the advantages of the existing approaches to achieve
the best overall performance.
