We consider the ground state of a single "spin-down" impurity atom
interacting attractively with a "spin-up" atomic Fermi gas. By constructing
variational wave functions for polarons, molecules and trimers, we perform a
detailed study of the transitions between each of these dressed bound states as
a function of mass ratio $r=m_\uparrow/m_\downarrow$ and interaction strength.
We find that the presence of a Fermi sea enhances the stability of the $p$-wave
trimer, which can be viewed as a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)
molecule that has bound an additional majority atom. For sufficiently large
$r$, we find that the transitions lie outside the region of phase separation in
imbalanced Fermi gases and should thus be observable in experiment, unlike the
well-studied equal-mass case.
