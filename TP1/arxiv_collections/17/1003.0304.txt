The effect of nonlinear friction forces in quantum mechanics is studied via
dissipative Madelung hydrodynamics. A new thermo-quantum diffusion equation is
derived, which is solved for the particular case of quantum Brownian motion
with a cubic friction. It is extended also by a chemical reaction term to
describe quantum reaction-diffusion systems with nonlinear friction as well.
