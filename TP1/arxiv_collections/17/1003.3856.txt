Establishing the origin of the short-lived radionuclide (SLR) 26-Al, which
was present in refractory inclusions in primitive meteorites, has profound
implications for the astrophysical context of solar system formation. Recent
observations that 26-Al was homogeneously distributed in the inner solar system
prove that this SLR has a stellar origin. In this Letter, we address the issue
of the incorporation of hot 26-Al-rich stellar ejecta into the cold protosolar
nebula. We first show that the 26-Al atoms produced by a population of massive
stars in an OB association cannot be injected into protostellar cores with
enough efficiency. We then show that this SLR likely originated in a Wolf-Rayet
star that escaped from its parent cluster and interacted with a neighboring
molecular cloud. The explosion of this runaway star as a supernova probably
triggered the formation of the solar system. This scenario also accounts for
the meteoritic abundance of 41-Ca.
