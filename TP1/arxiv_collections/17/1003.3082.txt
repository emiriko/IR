This paper is concern about developing a semantic agreement maintenance
method based on semantic distance by calculating the change of local schema or
ontology. This approach is important in dynamic and autonomous environment, in
which the current approach assumed that agreement or mapping in static
environment. The contribution of this research is to develop a framework based
on semantic agreement maintenance approach for P2P environment. This framework
based on two level hybrid P2P model architecture, which consist of two peer
type: (1) super peer that use to register and manage the other peers, and (2)
simple peer, as a simple peer, it exports and shares its contents with others.
This research develop a model to maintain the semantic agreement in P2P
environment, so the current approach which does not have the mechanism to know
the change, since it assumed that ontology and local schema are in the static
condition, and it is different in dynamic condition. The main issues are how to
calculate the change of local schema or common ontology and the calculation
result is used to determine which algorithm in maintaining the agreement. The
experiment on the job matching domain in Indonesia have been done to show how
far the performance of the approach. From the experiment, the main result are
(i) the more change so the F-measure value tend to be decreased, (ii) there is
no significant different in F-measure value for various modification type (add,
delete, rename), and (iii) the correct choice of algorithm would improve the
F-measure value.
