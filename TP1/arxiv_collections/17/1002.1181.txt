Recently, the academic community has been giving much attention to
Cooperative Learning System, a group learning method combined with pedagogy and
social psychology. It allows group members to gain knowledge through
collaborations and interactions. Nowadays, most Internet cooperative learning
systems are designed to provide students mainly with a convenient online
environment to study theoretical courses but rarely with an online environment
to operate practical instruments. Hence, this paper designed a 3D online
cooperative learning system for operating virtual instruments with
circuit-measuring function. By integrating with Virtual Reality, Remote Control
Parameter Transmission and embedded system techniques, this system gives
learners not only a cooperative learning environment via networking to jointly
operate the 3D virtual instruments (for example, multi-meters, power supplies
and oscilloscopes) but also the functions of instant messages and 3D puzzles to
interact with one another. Therefore, learners can effectively improve learning
interests and results.
