We utilise a recently developed minimal MOM scheme to determine the QCD
Lambda parameter from the gluon and ghost propagators in lattice Landau gauge.
We discuss uncertainties in the analysis and report our preliminary zero and
two flavour results, which are r_0*LambdaMS^{(0)}=0.62(1) and
r_0*LambdaMS^{(2)}=0.60(3)(2), with the second error due to an extrapolation
uncertainty.
