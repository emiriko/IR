Recently, scientists from The Craig J. Venter Institute reported construction
of very long DNA molecules using a variety of experimental procedures adopting
a number of working hypotheses. Finding a mathematical rule for generation of
such a long sequence would revolutionize our thinking on various advanced areas
of biology, viz. evolution of long DNA chains in chromosomes, reasons for
existence of long stretches of non-coding regions as well as would usher
automated methods for long DNA chains preparation for chromosome engineering.
However, this mathematical principle must have room for editing / correcting
DNA sequences locally in those areas of genomes where mutation and / or DNA
polymerase has introduced errors over millions of years. In this paper, we
report the basics and applications of L-system (a mathematical principle) which
could answer all the aforesaid issues. At the end, we present the whole human
mitochondrial genome which has been generated using this mathematical principle
using PC computation power. We can claim now that we can make any stretch of
DNA, be it 936 bp of olfactory receptor, with or without introns, mitochondrial
DNA to 3 x 109 bp DNA sequences of the whole human genome with even a PC
computation power.
