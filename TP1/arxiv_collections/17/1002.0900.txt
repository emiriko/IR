In the last decade, huge progress in experimentally measuring and
theoretically understanding flavor physics has been achieved. In particular,
the accuracy in the determination of the CKM elements has been greatly
improved, and a large number of flavor changing neutral current processes,
involving b -> d, b -> s and c -> u transitions, and of CP violating
asymmetries, have been measured. No evidence for new physics has been
established. Consequently, strong constraints on new physics at high scale
apply. In particular, the flavor structure of new physics at the TeV scale is
strongly constrained. We review these constraints and we discuss which are the
future prospects to better understand the flavor structure of physics beyond
the Standard Model.
