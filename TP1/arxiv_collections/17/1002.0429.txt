In this paper, we investigate some applications of commutator subgroups to
homotopy groups and geometric groups. In particular, we show that the
intersection subgroups of some canonical subgroups in certain link groups
modulo their symmetric commutator subgroups are isomorphic to the (higher)
homotopy groups. This gives a connection between links and homotopy groups.
Similar results hold for braid and surface groups.
