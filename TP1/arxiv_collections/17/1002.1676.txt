We consider the moduli space of bordered Riemann surfaces with boundary and
marked points. Such spaces appear in open-closed string theory, particularly
with respect to holomorphic curves with Lagrangian submanifolds. We consider a
combinatorial framework to view the compactification of this space based on the
pair-of-pants decomposition of the surface, relating it to the well-known
phenomenon of bubbling. Our main result classifies all such spaces that can be
realized as convex polytopes. A new polytope is introduced based on truncations
of cubes, and its combinatorial and algebraic structures are related to
generalizations of associahedra and multiplihedra.
