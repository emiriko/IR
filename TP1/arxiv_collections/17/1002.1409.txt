Astronomical spectropolarimeters can be subject to many sources of systematic
error which limit the precision and accuracy of the instrument. We present a
calibration method for observing high-resolution polarized spectra using
chromatic liquid-crystal variable retarders (LCVRs). These LCVRs allow for
polarimetric modulation of the incident light without any moving optics at
frequencies >10Hz. We demonstrate a calibration method using pure Stokes input
states that enables an achromatization of the system. This Stokes-based
deprojection method reproduces input polarization even though highly chromatic
instrument effects exist. This process is first demonstrated in a laboratory
spectropolarimeter where we characterize the LCVRs and show example
deprojections. The process is then implemented the a newly upgraded HiVIS
spectropolarimeter on the 3.67m AEOS telescope. The HiVIS spectropolarimeter
has also been expanded to include broad-band full-Stokes spectropolarimetry
using achromatic wave-plates in addition to the tunable full-Stokes
polarimetric mode using LCVRs. These two new polarimetric modes in combination
with a new polarimetric calibration unit provide a much more sensitive
polarimetric package with greatly reduced systematic error.
