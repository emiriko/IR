The finite-size scaling method in the equilibrium Monte Carlo(MC) simulations
and the finite-time scaling method in the nonequilibrium-relaxation simulations
are compromised. MC time data of various physical quantities are scaled by the
MC time data of the dynamic correlation length, which corresponds to changing
the system size in the finite-size scaling method. This scaling method is
tested in the three-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising spin model and in the three
dimensional $\pm J$ Ising spin-glass model. The transition temperature and the
critical exponents, $\eta$ and $\nu$, are obtained by the nonequilibrium
relaxation data of the susceptibility and the dynamic correlation length apart
from the dynamic exponent. We also comment on the definition of the dynamic
correlation length in the nonequilibrium relaxation process. The
Ornstein-Zernike formula is not always appropriate.
