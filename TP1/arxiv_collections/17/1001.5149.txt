The observation of very large microwave-enhanced critical currents in
superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) junctions at temperatures well
below the critical temperature of the electrodes has remained without a
satisfactory theoretical explanation for more than three decades. Here we
present a theory of the supercurrent in diffusive SNS junctions under microwave
irradiation based on the quasiclassical Green's function formalism. We show
that the enhancement of the critical current is due to the energy
redistribution of the quasiparticles in the normal wire induced by the
electromagnetic field. The theory provides predictions across a wide range of
temperatures, frequencies, and radiation powers, both for the critical current
and the current-phase relationship.
