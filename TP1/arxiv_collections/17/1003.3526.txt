We present a solid state magnetic field imaging technique using a two
dimensional array of spins in diamond. The magnetic sensing spin array is made
of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers created at shallow depths. Their optical
response is used for measuring external magnetic fields in close proximity.
Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is readout from a 60x60 $\mu$m
field of view in a multiplexed manner using a CCD camera. We experimentally
demonstrate full two-dimensional vector imaging of the magnetic field produced
by a pair of current carrying micro-wires. The presented widefield NV
magnetometer offers in addition to its high magnetic sensitivity of 20
nT/$\sqrt{Hz}$ and vector reconstruction, an unprecedented spatio-temporal
resolution and functionality at room temperature.
