We discuss the science motivations and prospects for a joint analysis of
gravitational-wave (GW) and low-energy neutrino data to search for prompt
signals from nearby supernovae (SNe). Both gravitational-wave and low-energy
neutrinos are expected to be produced in the innermost region of a
core-collapse supernova, and a search for coincident signals would probe the
processes which power a supernova explosion. It is estimated that the current
generation of neutrino and gravitational-wave detectors would be sensitive to
Galactic core-collapse supernovae, and would also be able to detect
electromagnetically dark SNe. A joint GW-neutrino search would enable
improvements to searches by way of lower detection thresholds, larger distance
range, better live-time coverage by a network of GW and neutrino detectors, and
increased significance of candidate detections. A close collaboration between
the GW and neutrino communities for such a search will thus go far toward
realizing a much sought-after astrophysics goal of detecting the next nearby
supernova.
