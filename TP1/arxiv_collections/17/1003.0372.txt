We compute a number of distance-dependent universal scaling functions
characterizing the distance statistics of large maps of genus one. In
particular, we obtain explicitly the probability distribution for the length of
the shortest non-contractible loop passing via a random point in the map, and
that for the distance between two random points. Our results are derived in the
context of bipartite toroidal quadrangulations, using their coding by
well-labeled 1-trees, which are maps of genus one with a single face and
appropriate integer vertex labels. Within this framework, the distributions
above are simply obtained as scaling limits of appropriate generating functions
for well-labeled 1-trees, all expressible in terms of a small number of basic
scaling functions for well-labeled plane trees.
