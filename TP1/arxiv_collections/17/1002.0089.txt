The search for novel spintronic devices brings about new ways to control
switching in magnetic thin-films. In this work we experimentally demonstrate a
device based on thermoelectrically controlled exchange coupling. The read out
signal from a giant magnetoresistance element is controlled by exchange
coupling through a weakly ferromagnetic Ni-Cu alloy. This exchange coupling is
shown to vary strongly with changes in temperature, and both internal Joule
heating and external heating is used to demonstrate magnetic switching. The
device shows no degradation upon thermal cycling. Ways to further optimize the
device performance are discussed. Our experimental results show a new way to
thermoelectrically control magnetic switching in multilayers.
