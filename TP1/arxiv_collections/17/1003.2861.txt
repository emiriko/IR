We compute the vacuum expectation values of torus knot operators in
Chern-Simons theory, and we obtain explicit formulae for all classical gauge
groups and for arbitrary representations. We reproduce a known formula for the
HOMFLY invariants of torus links and we obtain an analogous formula for
Kauffman invariants. We also derive a formula for cable knots. We use our
results to test a recently proposed conjecture that relates HOMFLY and Kauffman
invariants.
