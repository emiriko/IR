Several approaches have been introduced in literature for active noise
control (ANC) systems. Since FxLMS algorithm appears to be the best choice as a
controller filter, researchers tend to improve performance of ANC systems by
enhancing and modifying this algorithm. In this paper, modification is done in
the existing FxLMS algorithm that provides a new structure for improving the
tracking performance and convergence rate. The secondary signal y(n) is dynamic
thresholded by Wavelet transform to improve tracking. The convergence rate is
improved by dynamically varying the step size of the error signal.
