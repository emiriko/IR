We discuss an open driven-dissipative many-body system, in which the
competition of unitary Hamiltonian and dissipative Liouvillian dynamics leads
to a nonequilibrium phase transition. It shares features of a quantum phase
transition in that it is interaction driven, and of a classical phase
transition, in that the ordered phase is continuously connected to a thermal
state. Within a generalized Gutzwiller approach which includes the description
of mixed state density matrices, we characterize the complete phase diagram and
the critical behavior at the phase transition approached as a function of time.
We find a novel fluctuation induced dynamical instability, which occurs at long
wavelength as a consequence of a subtle dissipative renormalization effect on
the speed of sound.
