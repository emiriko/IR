In Part I we discuss accumulating experimental evidence related to the
structure and origin of the bosonic spectral function in high-temperature
superconducting (HTSC) cuprates at and near optimal doping. Some global
properties of the spectral function, such as number and positions of peaks, are
extracted by combining optics, neutron scattering, ARPES and tunnelling
measurements. These methods give convincing evidence for strong electron-phonon
interaction (EPI) with the coupling constant between 1-3 in cuprates near
optimal doping. Here we clarify how these results are in favor of the
Eliashberg-like theory for HTSC cuprates near optimal doping. In Part II we
discuss some theoretical ingredients - such as strong EPI, strong correlations
- which are necessary to explain the experimental results related to the
mechanism of d-wave pairing in optimally doped cuprates. These comprise the
Migdal-Eliashberg theory for EPI in strongly correlated systems which give rise
to the forward scattering peak. The latter is further supported by the weakly
screened Madelung interaction in the ionic-metallic structure of layered
cuprates. In this approach EPI is responsible for the strength of pairing while
the residual Coulomb interaction (by including spin fluctuations) triggers the
d-wave pairing.
