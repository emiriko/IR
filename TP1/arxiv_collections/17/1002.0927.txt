We study the limit of quasilocal energy defined in [7] and [8] for a family
of spacelike 2-surfaces approaching null infinity of an asymptotically flat
spacetime. It is shown that Lorentzian symmetry is recovered and an
energy-momentum 4-vector is obtained. In particular, the result is consistent
with the Bondi-Sachs energy-momentum at a retarded time. The quasilocal mass in
[7] and [8] is defined by minimizing quasilocal energy among admissible
isometric embeddings and observers. The solvability of the Euler-Lagrange
equation for this variational problem is also discussed in both the
asymptotically flat and asymptotically null cases. Assuming analyticity, the
equation can be solved and the solution is locally minimizing in all orders. In
particular, this produces an optimal reference hypersurface in the Minkowski
space for the spatial or null exterior region of an asymptotically flat
spacetime.
