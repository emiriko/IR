Star formation theories are currently divergent regarding the fundamental
physical processes that dominate the substellar regime. Observations of nearby
young open clusters allow the brown dwarf (BD) population to be characterised
down to the planetary mass regime, which ultimately must be accommodated by a
successful theory. We hope to uncover the low-mass population of the Rho
Ophiuchi molecular cloud and investigate the properties of the newly found
brown dwarfs. We use near-IR deep images (reaching completeness limits of
approximately 20.5 mag in J, and 18.9 mag in H and Ks) taken with the Wide
Field IR Camera (WIRCam) at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) to
identify candidate members of Rho Oph in the substellar regime. A spectroscopic
follow-up of a small sample of the candidates allows us to assess their
spectral type, and subsequently their temperature and membership. We select 110
candidate members of the Rho Ophiuchi molecular cloud, from which 80 have not
previously been associated with the cloud. We observed a small sample of these
and spectroscopically confirm six new brown dwarfs with spectral types ranging
from M6.5 to M8.25.
