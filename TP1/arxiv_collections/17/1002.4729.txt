The planar Dirac and the topologically massive vector gauge fields are
unified into a supermultiplet involving no auxiliary fields. The
superPoincar\'e symmetry emerges from the $osp(1|2)$ supersymmetry realized in
terms of the deformed Heisenberg algebra underlying the construction. The
non-relativistic limit yields spin 1/2 as well as new, spin 1
"L\'evy-Leblond-type" equations which, together, carry an N=2
superSchr\"odinger symmetry. Part of the latter has its origin in the universal
enveloping algebra of the superPoincar\'e algebra.
