Electrical-resistivity and magnetic-susceptibility measurements under
hydrostatic pressure up to p = 2.75 GPa have been performed on superconducting
LiFeP. A broad superconducting (SC) region exists in the temperature - pressure
(T-p) phase diagram. No indications for a spin-density-wave transition have
been found, but an enhanced resistivity coefficient at low pressures hints at
the presence of magnetic fluctuations. Our results show that the
superconducting state in LiFeP is more robust than in the isostructural and
isoelectronic LiFeAs. We suggest that this finding is related to the nearly
regular [FeP_4] tetrahedron in LiFeP.
