We demonstrate, for the first time, a spatially dependent metamaterial
perfect absorber operating in the infrared regime. We achieve an experimental
absorption of 97% at a wavelength of 6.0 microns, and our results agree well
with numerical full-wave simulations. By using two different metamaterial
sublattices we experimentally demonstrate a spatial and frequency varying
absorption which may have many relevant applications including hyperspectral
sub-sampling imaging
