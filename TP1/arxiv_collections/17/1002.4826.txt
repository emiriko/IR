Geroch, Held and Penrose invented a formalism for studying spacetimes
admitting one or two preferred null directions. This approach is very useful
for studying algebraically special spacetimes and their perturbations. In the
present paper, the formalism is generalized to higher-dimensional spacetimes.
This new formalism leads to equations that are considerably simpler than those
of the higher-dimensional Newman-Penrose formalism employed previously. The
dynamics of p-form test fields is analyzed using the new formalism and some
results concerning algebraically special p-form fields are proved.
