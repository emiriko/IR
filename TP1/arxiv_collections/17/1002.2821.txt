This is a survey article prepared for the submission to "Handbook of moduli".
The following topics are discussed: (i) Basic facts and examples of resolutions
for nilpotent orbit (ii) Q-factorial terminalizations of nilpotent orbit
closures and related birational geometry (iii) Poisson deformations of
nilpotent orbit closures.
