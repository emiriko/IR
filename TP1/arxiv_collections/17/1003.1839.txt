A Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ is said to be noise sensitive if
inserting a small random error in its argument makes the value of the function
almost unpredictable. Benjamini, Kalai and Schramm showed that if the sum of
squares of influences in $f$ is close to zero then $f$ must be noise sensitive.
We show a quantitative version of this result which does not depend on $n$, and
prove that it is tight for certain parameters. Our results hold also for a
general product measure $\mu_p$ on the discrete cube, as long as $\log 1/p \ll
\log n$. We note that in [BKS], a quantitative relation between the sum of
squares of the influences and the noise sensitivity was also shown, but only
when the sum of squares is bounded by $n^{-c}$ for a constant $c$. Our results
require a generalization of a lemma of Talagrand on the Fourier coefficients of
monotone Boolean functions. In order to achieve it, we present a considerably
shorter proof of Talagrand's lemma, which easily generalizes in various
directions, including non-monotone functions.
