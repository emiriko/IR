We investigate systems of spinless one-dimensional chiral fermions realized,
e.g., in the arms of electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometers, at high energies.
Taking into account the curvature of the fermionic spectrum and a finite
interaction range, we find a new scattering mechanism where high-energy
electrons scatter off plasmons (density excitations). This leads to an
exponential decay of the single-particle Green's function even at zero
temperature with an energy-dependent rate. As a consequence of this
electron-plasmon scattering channel, we observe the coherent excitation of a
plasmon wave in the wake of a high-energy electron resulting in the buildup of
a monochromatic sinusoidal density pattern.
