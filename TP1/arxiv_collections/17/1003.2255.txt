The increased use of LEDs for lighting purposes has led to the development of
numerous applications requiring a pre-selection of LEDs by their luminance and
/ or their chromaticity coordinate. This paper demonstrates how a manual
pre-selection process can be realized using a relatively simple configuration.
Since a manual selection service can only be commercially viable as long as
only small quantities of LEDs need to be sorted, an automated solution suggests
itself. This paper introduces such a solution, which has been developed by
Harzoptics in close cooperation with Rundfunk Gernrode. The paper also
discusses current challenges in measurement technology as well as market
trends.
