Using the modular invariance of the torus, constraints on the 1D patterns are
derived that are associated with various fractional quantum Hall ground states,
e.g. through the thin torus limit. In the simplest case, these constraints
enforce the well known odd-denominator rule, which is seen to be a necessary
property of all 1D patterns associated to quantum Hall states with minimum
torus degeneracy. However, the same constraints also have implications for the
non-Abelian states possible within this framework. In simple cases, including
the $\nu=1$ Moore-Read state and the $\nu=3/2$ level 3 Read-Rezayi state, the
filling factor and the torus degeneracy uniquely specify the possible patterns,
and thus all physical properties that are encoded in them. It is also shown
that some states, such as the "strong p-wave pairing state", cannot in
principle be described through patterns.
