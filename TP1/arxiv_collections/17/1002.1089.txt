We study properties of (bi-infinite) arrays having all adjacent $k\times k$
adjacent minors equal to one. If we further add the condition that all adjacent
$(k-1)\times (k-1)$ minors be nonzero, then these arrays are necessarily of
rank $k$. It follows that we can explicit construct all of them. Several nice
properties are made apparent. In particular, we revisit, with this perspective,
the notion of frieze patterns of Coxeter. This shed new light on their
properties. A connexion is also established with the notion of $T$-systems of
Statistical Physics.
