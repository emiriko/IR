We report the discovery of gamma-ray emission from the Galactic globular
cluster Terzan 5 using data taken with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope,
from 2008 August 8 to 2010 January 1. Terzan 5 is clearly detected in the
0.5-20 GeV band by Fermi at ~27\sigma level. This makes Terzan 5 as the second
gamma-ray emitting globular cluster seen by Fermi after 47 Tuc. The energy
spectrum of Terzan 5 is best represented by an exponential cutoff power-law
model, with a photon index of ~1.9 and a cutoff energy at ~3.8 GeV. By
comparing to 47 Tuc, we suggest that the observed gamma-ray emission is
associated with millisecond pulsars, and is either from the magnetospheres or
inverse Compton scattering between the relativistic electrons/positrons in the
pulsar winds and the background soft photons from the Galactic plane.
Furthermore, it is suggestive that the distance to Terzan 5 is less than 10 kpc
and > 10 GeV photons can be seen in the future.
