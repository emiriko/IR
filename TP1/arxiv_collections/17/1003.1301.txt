Wasp-10b is a very interesting transiting extrasolar planet. Although its
transit is very deep, about 40 mmag, there are very different estimates of its
radius in the literature. We present new photometric observations of four
complete transits of this planet. The whole event was detected for each transit
and the final light curve consists of more than 1500 individual CCD exposures.
We determine the following system parameters: planet to star radius ratio
R_p/R_star=0.168 +- 0.001, star radius to semimajor axis ratio R_star/a = 0.094
+- 0.001 and inclination i=87.3 +- 0.1 deg. Assuming that the semimajor axis is
0.036 9 +- ^{0.0012}_{0.0014} AU (Christian et al. 2009), we obtain the
following radius of the planet R_p=1.22 +- 0.05 R_J, and radius of the star
R_star = 0.75 +- 0.03. The errors include the uncertainty in the stellar mass
and the semimajor axis of the planet. Surprisingly, our estimate of the planet
radius is significantly higher (by about 12 percent) than the most recent value
of Johnson et al. (2009). We also improve the orbital period P_orb=3.092 731 +-
1x10^{-6} days and estimate the average transit duration T_D=0.097 4 +-
8x10^{-4} days.
