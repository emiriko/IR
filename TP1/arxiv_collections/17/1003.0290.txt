The reaction pp -> K+ + (Lambda p) was measured at Tp=1.953 GeV and Theta = 0
deg with a high missing mass resolution in order to study the Lambda p final
state interaction. The large final state enhancement near the Lambda p
threshold can be described using the standard Jost-function approach. The
singlet and triplet scattering lengths and effective ranges are deduced by
fitting simultaneously the Lambda p invariant mass spectrum and the total cross
section data of the free Lambda p scattering.
