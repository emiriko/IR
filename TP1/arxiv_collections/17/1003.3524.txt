In this paper, we present a simple, yet versatile, analytical model of
one-dimensional photonic crystal (1D PC). In our theoretical model, we take
into account direction of propagation and therefore do not neglect anisotropic
nature of photonic crystals. We derive analytical expressions for mode spectrum
and density of states in 1D photonic crystal. With those formulas, we obtain
mode spectrum characteristics, which depict formation of photonic band gap and
reveal properties of photonic crystals.
