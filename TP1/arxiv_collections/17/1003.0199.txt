We consider a slight modification to the monocyte and T-lymphocyte boundary
conditions of Little et al. (PLoS Comput Biol 2009 5(10) e1000539) and derive
alternative parameter estimates. No changes to the results and conclusions of
the paper of Little et al. (PLoS Comput Biol 2009 5(10) e1000539) are implied.
