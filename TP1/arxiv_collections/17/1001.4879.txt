Stars with spectral types earlier than about F0 on (or close) to the main
sequence have long been believed to lack observable surface convection,
although evolutionary models of A-type stars do predict very thin surface
convective zones. We present evidence for granulation in two delta Scuti stars
of spectral type A2: HD174936 and HD50844. Recent analyses of space-based CoRoT
(Convection, Rotation, and planetary Transits) data revealed up to some 1000
frequencies in the photometry of these stars. The frequencies were interpreted
as individual pulsation modes. If true, there must be large numbers of
nonradial modes of very high degree l which should suffer cancellation effects
in disk-integrated photometry (even of high space-based precision). The p-mode
interpretation of all the frequencies in HD174936 and HD50844 depends on the
assumption of white (frequency independent) noise. Our independent analyses of
the data provide an alternative explanation: most of the peaks in the Fourier
spectra are the signature of non-white granulation background noise, and less
than about 100 of the frequencies are actual stellar p-modes in each star. We
find granulation time scales which are consistent with scaling relations that
describe cooler stars with known surface convection. If the granulation
interpretation is correct, the hundreds of low-amplitude Fourier peaks reported
in recent studies are falsely interpreted as independent pulsation modes and a
significantly lower number of frequencies are associated with pulsation,
consistent with only modes of low degree.
