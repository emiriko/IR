In this Letter we have studied dressed bound states in Fermi-Bose mixtures
near broad interspecies resonance, and implications on many-body correlations.
We present the evidence for a first order phase transition between a mixture of
Fermi gas and condensate, and a fully paired mixture where extended fermionic
molecules occupy a single pairing channel instead of forming a molecular Fermi
surface. We have further investigated the effect of Fermi surface dynamics,
pair fluctuations and discussed the validity of our results.
