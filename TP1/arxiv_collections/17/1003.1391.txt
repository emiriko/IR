The RENO experiment is a short baseline neutrino experiment in Korea aiming
to measure the neutrino mixing angle theta_13 or set limit to sin^2(2 theta_13)
less than 0.02. This document describes physics goals, experimental site,
detector design, scintillator, electronics, calibration, simulation, and
physics reach.
