We discuss a method based on sampling minimally entangled typical thermal
states (METTS) that can simulate finite temperature quantum systems with a
computational cost comparable to ground state DMRG. Detailed implementations of
each step of the method are presented, along with efficient algorithms for
working with matrix product states and matrix product operators. We furthermore
explore how properties of METTS can reveal characteristic order and excitations
of systems and discuss why METTS form an efficient basis for sampling. Finally,
we explore the extent to which the average entanglement of a METTS ensemble is
minimal.
