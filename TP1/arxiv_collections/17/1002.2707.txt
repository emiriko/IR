On a Riemann surface there are relations among the periods of holomorphic
differential forms, called Riemann's relations. If one looks carefully in
Riemann's proof, one notices that he uses iterated integrals. What I have done
in this paper is to generalize these relations to relations among generating
series of iterated integrals. Since the main result is formulated in terms of
generating series, it gives infinitely many relations - one for each
coefficient of the generating series. The lower order terms give the well known
classical relations. The new result is reciprocity for the higher degree terms,
which give non-trivial relations among iterated integrals on a Riemann surface.
As an application we refine the definition of Manin's noncommutative modular
symbol in order to include Eisenstein series. Finally, we have to point out
that this paper contains some constructions needed for multidimensional
reciprocity laws like a refinement of one of the Kato-Parshin reciprocity laws.
