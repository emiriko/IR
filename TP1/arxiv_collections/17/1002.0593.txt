It has been proposed that the gamma ray burst - supernova connection may
manifest itself in a significant fraction of core collapse supernovae
possessing mildly relativistic jets that do not break out of the stellar
envelope. Neutrinos would provide proof of the existence of these jets. In the
present letter we calculate the event rate of ~100 GeV neutrino-induced
cascades in km^3 detectors. We also calculate the event rate for ~10 GeV
neutrinos of all flavors with the DeepCore low energy extension of IceCube. The
added event rate significantly improves the ability of km^3 detectors to search
for these gamma-ray dark bursts. For a core collapse supernova at 10 Mpc we
find ~4 events expected in DeepCore and ~6 neutrino-induced cascades in
IceCube/KM3Net. Observations at ~10 GeV are mostly sensitive to the pion
component of the neutrino production in the choked jet, while the ~100 GeV
depends on the kaon component. Finally we discuss extensions of the on-going
optical follow-up programs by IceCube and Antares to include neutrinos of all
flavors at ~10 GeV and neutrino-induced cascades at ~100 GeV energies.
