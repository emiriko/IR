In this work we suggest that higher-dimensional modifications to the matter
content in FRW spacetimes can be obtained not only, as first considered by
Ponce de Leon, referring to "moving" 4D hypersurfaces non-orthogonal to the
time-dependent extra dimension of an embedding 5D manifold, but also referring
to "fixed" 4D hypersurfaces orthogonal to a suitable scalar function which
defines a static foliation of the 5D manifold and takes the role of the extra
dimension in a suitable coordinate system. Results obtained in each approach
crucially depend on the method used to identify the 4D metric of our brane
universe from the 5D metric of the bulk manifold.
