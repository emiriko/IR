In this Comment, we reanalyze the experiments on the collision frequency
shift of the b-c and a-d hyperfine transitions in three-dimensional atomic
hydrogen in the presence of, respectively, a and b-state atoms. Accurate
consideration of the symmetry of the spatial and spin part of the diatomic
wavefunction yields the difference a_T-a_S=0.30(5) \AA between the triplet and
singlet s-wave scattering lengths of hydrogen atoms. This corrects the
factor-of two error of the commented work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 263003
(2008)].
