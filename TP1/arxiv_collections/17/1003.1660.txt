Besides the conventional spin-density-wave (SDW) state, a new kind of
orbital-transverse density-wave (OTDW) state is shown to exist generally in
multi-orbital systems. We demonstrate that the orbital character of Fermi
surface nesting plays an important role in density responses. The relationship
between antiferromagnetism and structural phase transition in LaFeAsO (1111)
and BaFe$_2$As$_2$ (122) compounds of iron-based superconductors may be
understood in terms of the interplay between the SDW and OTDW with a
five-orbital Hamiltonian. We propose that the essential difference between 1111
and 122 compounds is crucially determined by the presence of the
two-dimensional $d_{xy}$-like Fermi surface around (0,0) being only in 1111
parent compounds.
