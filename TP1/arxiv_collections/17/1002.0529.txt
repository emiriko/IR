We describe a new, convenient, recursive tensor integral reduction scheme for
one-loop $n$-point Feynman integrals. The reduction is based on the algebraic
Davydychev-Tarasov formalism where the tensors are represented by scalars with
shifted dimensions and indices, and then expressed by conventional scalars with
generalized recurrence relations. The scheme is worked out explicitly for up to
$n=6$ external legs and for tensor ranks $R\leq n$. The tensors are represented
by scalar one- to four-point functions in $d$ dimensions. For the evaluation of
them, the Fortran code for the tensor reductions has to be linked with a
package like QCDloop or LoopTools/FF. Typical numerical results are presented.
