Using high resolution VLT spectra, we study the multi-component outflow
systems of two quasars exhibiting intrinsic Fe II absorption (QSO 2359-1241 and
SDSS J0318-0600). From the extracted ionic column densities and using
photoionization modeling we determine the gas density, total column density,
and ionization parameter for several of the components. For each object the
largest column density component is also the densest, and all other components
have densities of roughly 1/4 of that of the main component. We demonstrate
that all the absorbers lie roughly at the same distance from the source.
Further, we calculate the total kinetic luminosities and mass outflow rates of
all components and show that these quantities are dominated by the main
absorption component.
