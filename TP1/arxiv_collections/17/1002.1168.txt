This paper presents a gradient based motion estimation algorithm based on
shape-motion prediction, which takes advantage of the correlation between
neighboring Binary Alpha Blocks (BABs), to match with the Mpeg-4 shape coding
case and speed up the estimation process. The PSNR and computation time
achieved by the proposed algorithm seem to be better than those obtained by
most popular motion estimation techniques.
