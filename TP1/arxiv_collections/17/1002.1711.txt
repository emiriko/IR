We use the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations for the AdS_5 \times S^5
mirror model to derive the five-loop anomalous dimension of the Konishi
operator. We show numerically that the corresponding result perfectly agrees
with the one recently obtained via the generalized Luscher formulae. This
constitutes an important test of the AdS/CFT TBA system.
