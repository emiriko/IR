We study the determination of supersymmetric parameters at the LHC from a
global fit including cross sections and edges of kinematic distributions. For
illustration, we focus on a minimal supergravity scenario and discuss how well
it can be constrained at the LHC operating at 7 and 14 TeV collision energy,
respectively. We find that the inclusion of cross sections greatly improves the
accuracy of the SUSY parameter determination, and allows to reliably extract
model parameters even in the initial phase of LHC data taking with 7 TeV
collision energy and 1/fb integrated luminosity. Moreover, cross section
information may be essential to study more general scenarios, such as those
with non-universal gaugino masses, and distinguish them from minimal,
universal, models.
