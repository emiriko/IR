We find a dimming during optical quiescence of the cataclysmic variable WZ
Sge by about half a magnitude between superoutbursts. We connect the dimming
with the development of a cavity in the inner part of the accretion disk. We
suggest that, when the cavity is big enough, accretion of material is governed
by the magnetic field of the white dwarf and pulsations from the weakly
magnetic white dwarf appear. The time scale of forming the cavity is about a
decade, and it persists throughout the whole quiescent phase. Such a cavity can
be accommodated well by the proposed magnetic propeller model for WZ Sge, where
during quiescence mass is being expelled by the magnetic white dwarf from the
inner regions of the accretion disk to larger radii.
