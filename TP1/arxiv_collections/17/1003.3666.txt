The properties of non-equilibrium magnetized plasmas confined in planar
geometry are studied on the basis of the first principle microscopic Langevin
dynamics computer simulations. The non-equilibrium state of plasmas is
maintained due to the recombination and generation of charges.The intrinsic
microscopic structure of non-equilibrium steady-state magnetized plasmas, in
particular, the inter-particle correlations and self-organization of vortex
structures are examined. The simulations have been performed for a wide range
of parameters including strong plasma coupling, high charge recombination and
generation rates, and intense magnetic field. As is shown in simulations, the
non-equilibrium recombination and generation processes trigger the formation of
ordered dissipative or coherent drift vortex states in 2D plasmas with
distinctly spatially separated components, which are far from thermal
equilibrium. This is evident from the unusual properties of binary
distributions and behavior of the Coulomb energy of the system, which turn out
to be quite different from the ones typical for the equilibrium state of
plasmas under the same conditions.
