We report a metal-insulator transition in disordered graphene with low
coverages of hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen interacting with graphene creates
short-range disorder and localizes states near the neutrality point. The energy
range of localization grows with increasing of H concentration. Calculations
show that the conductances through low-energy propagating channels decay
exponentially with sample size and are well fitted by one-parameter scaling
function, similar to a disorder-driven metal-insulator transition in
2-dimensional disordered systems.
