Understanding the acid-base behavior of silica surfaces is critical for many
nanoscience and bio-nano interface applications. Silanol groups (SiOH) on
silica surfaces exhibit two acidity constants--one as acidic as vinegar--but
their structural basis remains controversial. The atomic details of the more
acidic silanol site govern not just the overall surface charge density at near
neutral solution pH, but also how ions and bio-molecules interacts with and
bind to silica immersed in water. Using initio molecular dynamics simulations
and multiple representative crystalline silica surfaces, we determine the
deprotonation free energies of silanol groups with different structural motifs.
We show that previously proposed motifs related to chemical connectivity or
inter-silanol hydrogen bonds do not yield high acidity. Instead, a plausible
candiate for pKa=4.5 silanol groups may be found in locally strained or
defected regions with sparse silanol coverage. In the process, irreversible
ring-opening reactions of strained silica trimer rings in contact with liquid
water are observed.
