The sensitivity of the zero position of the forward backward asymmetry
$\mathcal{A}_{FB}$ for the exclusive $B\rightarrow K_{1}(1270)\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$
decay is examined by using most general non-standard 4-fermion interactions.
Our analysis shows that the zero position of the forward backward asymmetry is
very sensitive to the sign and size of the Wilson coefficients corresponding to
the new vector type interactions, which are the counter partners of the usual
Standard Model operators but have opposite chirality. In addition to these, the
other significant effect comes from the interference of Scalar-Pseudoscalar and
Tensor type operators. These results will not only enhance our theoretical
understanding about the axial vector mesons but will also serve as a good tool
to look for physics beyond the SM.
