An experimental setup was developed for the measurement of the thermoelectric
power (TEP, Seebeck coefficient) in the temperature range from 2 to 350 K and
magnetic fields up to 140 kOe. The system was built to fit in a commercial
cryostat and is versatile, accurate and automated; using two heaters and two
thermometers increases the accuracy of the TEP measurement. High density data
of temperature sweeps from 2 to 350 K can be acquired in under 16 hours and
high density data of isothermal field sweeps from 0 to 140 kOe can be obtained
in under 2 hours. Calibrations for the system have been performed on a platinum
wire and Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$ high $T_{c}$ superconductors.
The measured TEP of phosphor-bronze (voltage lead wire) turns to be very small,
where the absolute TEP value of phosphor-bronze wire is much less than 0.5
$\mu$V/K below 80 K. For copper and platinum wires measured against to the
phosphor-bronze wire, the agreement between measured results and the literature
data is good. To demonstrate the applied magnetic field response of the system,
we report measurements of the TEP on single crystal samples of LaAgSb$_{2}$ and
CeAgSb$_{2}$ in fields up to 140 kOe.
