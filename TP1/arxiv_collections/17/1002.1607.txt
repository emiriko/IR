Recently, Fukushima [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{78} 115105 (2008)] proposed a
systematic derivation of the Gutzwiller approximation for the t-J model. In the
present paper, using this approach we construct an effective single-particle
Hamiltonian, which leads to a renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). We also
use the method proposed by us recently and based on the maximum entropy
principle (MaxEnt), which in turn, yields a consistent statistical description
of the problem. On the examples of non-magnetic superconducting d-wave
resonating valence bond (dRVB) and normal staggered-flux (SF) solutions, we
compare two selections of the Gutzwiller renormalization schemes, i.e. the one
proposed by Fukushima with that used earlier by Sigrist et al. [Phys. Rev. B
\textbf{49}, 12 058 (1994)]. We also confront the results coming from our
variational solutions with the self-consistency conditions build in, with those
of the non-variational approach based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes
self-consistent equations. Combination of the present variational approach with
the new renormalization scheme (taken from Fukushima's work) provides, for $t/J
=3$, an upper critical hole concentration $x_{c} \approx 0.27$ for the
disappearance of the d-wave superconductivity. Also, the hole concentration $x
\approx 0.125$ is obtained for the optimal doping. These results are in rough
accordance with experimental results for high-$T_c$ superconducting cuprates.
