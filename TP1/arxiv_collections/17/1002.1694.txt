We compute the top quark decay rate in the Unhiggs model. In this model, the
longitudinally polarized W's are unparticles, owing to their Goldstone boson
nature, while the transversely polarized W's are not. Thus the fraction of
decays with a longitudinal W emitted is different than in the Standard Model.
Comparing this calculation to CDF data, we are able to rule out some of the
Unhiggs model parameter space. We also use the expected increased accuracy of
top decay measurements at the LHC to anticipate further constraints on the
Unhiggs.
