We develop a scheme to distill entanglement from bipartite Fermionic systems
in an arbitrary quasifree state. It can be applied if either one system
containing infinite one-copy entanglement is available or if an arbitrary
amount of equally prepared systems can be used. We show that the efficiency of
the proposed scheme is in general very good and in some cases even optimal.
Furthermore we apply it to Fermions hopping on an infinite lattice and
demonstrate in this context that an efficient numerical analysis is possible
for more then 10^6 lattice sites.
