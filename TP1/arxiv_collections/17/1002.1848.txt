Young, massive stars in the Galactic halo are widely supposed to be the
result of an ejection event from the Galactic disk forcing some stars to leave
their place of birth as so-called runaway stars. Here, we present a detailed
spectroscopic and kinematic analysis of the runaway B-star HIP 60350 to
determine which runaway scenario - a supernova explosion disrupting a binary
system or dynamical interaction in star clusters - may be responsible for HIP
60350's peculiar orbit. Based on a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium
approach, a high-resolution optical echelle spectrum was examined to revise
spectroscopic quantities and for the first time to perform a differential
chemical abundance analysis with respect to the B-type star 18 Peg. The results
together with proper motions from the Hipparcos Catalog further allowed the
three-dimensional kinematics of the star to be studied numerically. The
abundances derived for HIP 60350 are consistent with a slightly supersolar
metallicity agreeing with the kinematically predicted place of birth ca. 6 kpc
away from the Galactic center. However, they do not exclude the possibility of
an alpha-enhanced abundance pattern expected in the case of the supernova
scenario. Its outstanding high Galactic rest frame velocity of 530 plus-minus
35 km/s is a consequence of ejection in the direction of Galactic rotation and
slightly exceeds the local Galactic escape velocity in a standard Galactic
potential. Hence HIP 60350 may be unbound to the Galaxy.
