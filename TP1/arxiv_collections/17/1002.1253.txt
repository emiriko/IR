We define a multiparty entanglement measure, called generalized geometric
measure, that can detect and quantify genuine multiparty entanglement for any
number of parties. The quantum phase transitions in exactly solvable models
like the anisotropic XY model can be detected by this measure. We find that the
multisite measure can be a useful tool to detect quantum phenomena in more
complex systems like quasi 2D and 2D frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets. We
propose an order parameter, called bound generalized geometric measure, in the
spirit of bound quantum states, that can recognize the gapless and gapped
phases of the frustrated models by its sign. The vanishing of the order
parameter therefore signals the transition between such phases.
