It is shown that a non-minimal coupling between the scalar curvature and the
matter Lagrangian density may account for the accelerated expansion of the
Universe and provide, through mimicking, for a viable unification of dark
energy and dark matter. An analytical exploration is first performed, and a
numerical study is then used to validate the obtained results. The encountered
scenario allows for a better grasp of the proposed mechanism, and sets up the
discussion for improvements that can lead to a complete agreement with the
observational data.
