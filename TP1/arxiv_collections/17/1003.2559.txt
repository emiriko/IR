The clustering of X-ray selected AGN appears to be a valuable tool for
extracting cosmological information. Using the recent high-precision angular
clustering results of ~30000 XMM-Newton soft (0.5-2 keV) X-ray sources (Ebrero
et al. 2009), which have a median redshift of $z\sim 1$, and assuming a flat
geometry, a constant in comoving coordinates AGN clustering evolution and the
AGN bias evolution model of Basilakos et al. (2008), we manage to break the
Omega_m-sigma_8 degeneracy. The resulting cosmological constraints are:
Omega_m=0.27 (+0.03 -0.05), w=-0.90 (+0.10 -0.16) and sigma_8=0.74 (+0.14
-0.12), while the dark matter host halo mass, in which the X-ray selected AGN
are presumed to reside, is M=2.50 (+0.50 -1.50) X 10^13 h^{-1} M(solar). For
the constant Lambda model (w=-1) we find Omega_m=0.24 (+- 0.06) and
sigma_8=0.83 (+0.11 -0.16), in good agreement with recent studies based on
cluster abundances, weak lensing and the CMB, but in disagreement with the
recent bulk flow analysis.
