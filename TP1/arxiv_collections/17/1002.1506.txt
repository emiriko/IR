We report systematic ^{75}As-NQR and ^{139}La-NMR studies on nickel-pnictide
superconductors LaNiAsO_{1-x}F_x (x=0, 0.06, 0.10 and 0.12). The spin lattice
relaxation rate 1/T_1 decreases below T_c with a well-defined coherence peak
and follows an exponential decay at low temperatures. This result indicates
that the superconducting gap is fully opened, and is strikingly different from
that observed in iron-pnictide analogs. In the normal state, 1/T_1T is constant
in the temperature range T_c \sim 4 K < T <10 K for all compounds and up to
T=250 K for x=0 and 0.06, which indicates weak electron correlations and is
also different from the iron analog. We argue that the differences between the
iron and nickel pnictides arise from the different electronic band structure.
Our results highlight the importance of the peculiar Fermi-surface topology in
iron-pnictides.
