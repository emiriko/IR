We describe an algorithm for quantum state tomography that converges in
polynomial time to an estimate, together with a rigorous error bound on the
fidelity between the estimate and the true state. The result suggests that
state tomography on large quantum systems may be much more feasible than the
exponential size of state space suggests. In many situations, the correctness
of the state estimate can be certified from the data alone, with no a priori
assumptions on the form of the measured state.
