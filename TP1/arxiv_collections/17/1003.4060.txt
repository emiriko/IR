We report the first experimental observation of trapped rainbow1 in graded
metallic gratings2-4, designed to validate theoretical predictions for this new
class of plasmonic structures. One-dimensional tapered gratings were fabricated
and their surface dispersion properties tailored by varying the grating period
and depth, whose dimensions were confirmed by atomic force microscopy. Reduced
group velocities and the plasmonic bandgap were observed. Direct measurements
on graded grating structures show that light of different wavelengths in the
500-700nm region is "trapped" at different positions along the grating,
consistent with computer simulations, thus verifying the "rainbow" trapping
effect. The trapped rainbow effect offers exciting pathways for optical
information storage and optical delays in photonic circuits at ambient
temperature.
