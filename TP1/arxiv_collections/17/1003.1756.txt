We use one-dimensional two-zone time-dependent accretion disk models to study
the long-term evolution of protostellar disks subject to mass addition from the
collapse of a rotating cloud core. Our model consists of a constant surface
density magnetically coupled active layer, with transport and dissipation in
inactive regions only via gravitational instability. We start our simulations
after a central protostar has formed, containing ~ 10% of the mass of the
protostellar cloud. Subsequent evolution depends on the angular momentum of the
accreting envelope. We find that disk accretion matches the infall rate early
in the disk evolution because much of the inner disk is hot enough to couple to
the magnetic field. Later infall reaches the disk beyond ~10 AU, and the disk
undergoes outbursts of accretion in FU Ori-like events as described in Zhu et
al. 2009c. If the initial cloud core is moderately rotating most of the central
star's mass is built up by these outburst events. Our results suggest that the
protostellar "luminosity problem" is eased by accretion during these FU
Ori-like outbursts. After infall stops the disk enters the T Tauri phase. An
outer, viscously evolving disk has structure that is in reasonable agreement
with recent submillimeter studies and its surface density evolves from $\Sigma
\propto R^{-1}$ to $R^{-1.5}$. An inner, massive belt of material-- the "dead
zone" -- would not have been observed yet but should be seen in future high
angular resolution observations by EVLA and ALMA. This high surface density
belt is a generic consequence of low angular momentum transport efficiency at
radii where the disk is magnetically decoupled, and would strongly affect
planet formation and migration.
