We compute the resummed hadronic transverse energy (E_T) distribution due to
initial-state QCD radiation in vector boson and Higgs boson production at
hadron colliders. The resummed exponent, parton distributions and coefficient
functions are treated consistently to next-to-leading order. The results are
matched to fixed-order calculations at large E_T and compared with
parton-shower Monte Carlo predictions at Tevatron and LHC energies.
