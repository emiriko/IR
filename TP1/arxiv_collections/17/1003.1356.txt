The dynamical nucleus-nucleus potentials for fusion reactions 40Ca+40Ca,
48Ca+208Pb and 126Sn+130Te are studied with the improved quantum molecular
dynamics (ImQMD) model together with the extended Thomas-Fermi approximation
for the kinetic energies of nuclei. The obtained fusion barrier for 40Ca+40Ca
is in good agreement with the extracted fusion barrier from the measured fusion
excitation function, and the depth of the fusion pockets are close to the
results of time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations. The energy dependence of
fusion barrier is also investigated. For heavy fusion system, the fusion pocket
becomes shallow and almost disappears for symmetric systems and the obtained
potential at short distances is higher than the adiabatic potential.
