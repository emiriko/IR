Simulations of astrophysical disks in the shearing box that are subject to
the magnetorotational instability (MRI) show that activity appears to be
reduced as the magnetic Prandtl number (Pm) is lowered. On the other hand,
calculations for laboratory experiments show that saturation is achieved
through modification of the background shear for Pm << 1. Guided by the results
of calculations appropriate for laboratory experiments when Pm is very low, the
axisymmetric stability of inviscid disturbances in a shearing box model
immersed in a constant vertical background magnetic field is considered under a
variety of shear profiles and boundary conditions in order to evaluate the
hypothesis that modifications of the shear bring about saturation of the
instability. It is found that the emergence and stability of the MRI is
sensitive to the boundary conditions adopted. Channel modes do not appear to be
stabilized through any modification of the background shear whose average
remains Keplerian. However, systems that have non-penetrative boundaries can
saturate the MRI through modification of the background shear. Conceptually
equating the qualitative results from laboratory experiments to the conditions
in a disk may therefore be misleading.
