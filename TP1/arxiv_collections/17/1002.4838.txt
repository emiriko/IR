There is now an increased understanding of the need for realistic link layer
models in the wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we have used
mathematical techniques from communication theory to model and analyze low
power wireless links. Our work provides theoretical models for the link layer
showing how Packet Reception Rate vary with Signal to Noise Ratio and distance
for different modulation schemes and a comparison between MICA2 and TinyNode in
terms of PRR.
