A comparison of the compact and non-compact lattice versions of the
low-energy theory of graphene is presented. The compact theory is found to
exhibit a chiral phase transition which appears to be of first order, at a
critical coupling of beta_c = 0.42 +/- 0.01. We confirm that the non-compact
theory exhibits a second-order transition at beta_c = 0.072 +/- 0.003, and
determine the effects of UV-divergent tadpole contributions in both cases. Upon
tadpole improvement of the non-compact theory we find beta_c^{TI} = 0.163 +/-
0.002, which strengthens the case for a semimetal-insulator transition in
graphene at strong Coulomb coupling. Finally, we highlight the need for
systematic studies using improved lattice actions.
