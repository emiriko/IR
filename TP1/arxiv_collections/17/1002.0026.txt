Steganography is an information hiding application which aims to hide secret
data imperceptibly into a commonly used media. Unfortunately, the theoretical
hiding asymptotical capacity of steganographic systems is not attained by
algorithms developed so far. In this paper, we describe a novel coding method
based on Z2Z4-linear codes that conforms to +/-1-steganography, that is secret
data is embedded into a cover message by distorting each symbol by one unit at
most. This method solves some problems encountered by the most efficient
methods known today, based on ternary Hamming codes. Finally, the performance
of this new technique is compared with that of the mentioned methods and with
the well-known theoretical upper bound.
