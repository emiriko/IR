The level lifetimes have been measured for a Shears band of $^{108}$Cd which
exhibits bandcrossing. The observed level energies and B(M1) rates have been
successfully described by a semi-classical geometric model based on shear
mechanism. In this geometric model, the bandcrossing in Shears band has been
described as the reopening of the angle between the blades of a shear.
