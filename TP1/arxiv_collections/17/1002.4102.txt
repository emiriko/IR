The observed intermittent light emission from colloidal semiconductor
nanocrystals has long been associated with Auger recombination assisted
quenching. We test this view by observing transient emission dynamics of
CdSe/CdS/ZnS semiconductor nanocrystals using time-resolved photon counting.
The size and intensity dependence of the observed decay dynamics are
inconsistent with the those expected from Auger processes. Moreover, the data
suggests that in the `off' state the quantum dot cycles in a three-step
process: photoexcitation, rapid trapping and subsequent slow nonradiative
decay.
