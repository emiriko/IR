A signature of the dark energy equation of state may be observed in the shape
of voids. We estimate the constraints on cosmological parameters that would be
determined from the ellipticity distribution of voids from future spectroscopic
surveys already planned for the study of large scale structure.
  The constraints stem from the sensitivity of the distribution of ellipticity
to the cosmological parameters through the variance of fluctuations of the
density field smoothed at some length scale. This length scale can be chosen to
be of the order of the comoving radii of voids at very early times when the
fluctuations are Gaussian distributed. We use Fisher estimates to show that the
constraints from void ellipticities are promising. Combining these constraints
with other traditional methods results in the improvement of the Dark Energy
Task Force Figure of Merit on the dark energy parameters by an order of hundred
for future experiments. The estimates of these future constraints depend on a
number of systematic issues which require further study using simulations. We
outline these issues and study the impact of certain observational and
theoretical systematics on the forecasted constraints on dark energy
parameters.
