Nearest-neighbor-interaction Ising spin glasses are studied on three
different hierarchical lattices, all of them belonging to the Wheatstone-Bridge
family. It is shown that the spin-glass lower critical dimension in these
lattices should be greater than 2.32. Finite-temperature spin-glass phases are
found for a lattice of fractal dimension $D \approx 3.58$ (whose unit cell is
obtained from a simple construction of a part of the cubic lattice), as well as
for a lattice of fractal dimension close to five.
