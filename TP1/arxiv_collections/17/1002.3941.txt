We present a theory to study gas molecules adsorption on armchair graphene
nanoribbons (AGNRs) by applying the results of \emph{ab} \emph{initio}
calculations to the single-band tight-binding approximation. In addition, the
effect of edge states on the electronic properties of AGNR is included in the
calculations. Under the assumption that the gas molecules adsorb on the ribbon
sites with uniform probability distribution, the applicability of the method is
examined for finite concentrations of adsorption of several simple gas
molecules (CO, NO, CO$_2$, NH$_3$) on 10-AGNR. We show that the states
contributed by the adsorbed CO and NO molecules are quite localized near the
center of original band gap and suggest that the charge transport in such
systems cannot be enhanced considerably, while CO$_2$ and NH$_3$ molecules
adsorption acts as acceptor and donor, respectively. The results of this theory
at low gas concentration are in good agreement with those obtained by
density-functional theory calculations.
