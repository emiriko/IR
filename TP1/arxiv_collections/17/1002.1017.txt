Formulas for calculation of transverse dielectric function and transverse
electric conductivity in quantum collisional plasmas under arbitrary degree of
degeneracy of the electron gas are received. The Wigner - Vlasov - Boltzmann
kinetic equation with collision integral in BGK (Bhatnagar, Gross and Krook)
form in coordinate space is used. Various special cases are investigated. The
case of fully degenerate quantum plasma was considered separately. Comparison
with Lindhard's formula has been realized.
