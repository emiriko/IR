We introduce the concept of initial-phase spectroscopy as a control of the
dynamics of entangled states encoded into a two-atom system interacting with a
broadband squeezed vacuum field. We illustrate our considerations by examining
the transient spectrum of the field emitted by two systems, the small sample
(Dicke) and the spatially extended (non-Dicke) models. It is found that the
shape of the spectral components depends crucially on the relative phase
between the initial entangled state and the squeezed field. We follow the
temporal evolution of the spectrum and show that depending on the relative
phase a hole burning can occur in one of the two spectral lines. We compare the
transient behavior of the spectrum with the time evolution of the initial
entanglement and find that the hole burning can be interpreted as a
manifestation of the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death. In addition, we
find that in the case of the non-Dicke model, the collective damping rate may
act like an artificial tweezer that rotates the phase of the squeezed field.
