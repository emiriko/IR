This paper contains our comments on the work of the authors A. I. Ahmadov
\textit{et al.} "Single meson production in photon-photon collisions and
infrared renormalons" [arXiv:0911.5226v1 27 Nov 2009]. We draw attention to
errors made in this work in calculation of the subprocess cross sections within
the frozen and running coupling approaches, in deriving the Borel transforms
and Borel resummed expressions for the cross sections in the running coupling
approach. We show that the same fatal errors were made by these authors also in
their work published in Phys. Rev. D80, 016003 (2009).
