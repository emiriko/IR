We introduce a quasi-geostrophic model of core dynamics, which aims at
describing core processes on geomagnetic secular variation timescales. It
extends the formalism of Alfv\'en torsional oscillations by incorporating
non-zonal motions. Within this framework, the magnetohydrodynamics takes place
in the equatorial plane; it involves quadratic magnetic quantities, which are
averaged along the direction of rotation of the Earth. In addition, the
equatorial flow is projected on the core-mantle boundary. It interacts with the
magnetic field at the core surface, through the radial component of the
magnetic induction equation. That part of the model connects the dynamics and
the observed secular variation, with the radial component of the magnetic field
acting as a passive tracer. We resort to variational data assimilation to
construct formally the relationship between model predictions and observations.
Variational data assimilation seeks to minimize an objective function, by
computing its sensitivity to its control variables. The sensitivity is
efficiently calculated after integration of the adjoint model. We illustrate
that framework with twin experiments, performed first in the case of the
kinematic core flow inverse problem, and then in the case of Alfv\'en torsional
oscillations. In both cases, using the adjoint model allows us to retrieve core
state variables which, while taking part in the dynamics, are not directly
sampled at the core surface. We study the effect of several factors on the
solution (width of the assimilation time window, amount and quality of data),
and we discuss the potential of the model to deal with real geomagnetic
observations.
