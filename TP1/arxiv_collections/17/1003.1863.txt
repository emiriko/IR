In Horava's theory of gravity coupled to a global monopole source, we seek
for static, spherically symmetric spacetime solutions for general values of
$\lambda$. We obtain the explicit solutions with deficit solid angles, in the
IR modified Horava gravity model, at the IR fixed point $\lambda=1$ and at the
conformal point $\lambda=1/3$. For the other values of $1>\lambda>0$ we also
find special solutions to the inhomogenous equation of the gravity model with
detailed balance, and we discuss an possibility of astrophysical applications
of the $\lambda=1/2$ solution that has a deficit angle for a finite range.
