The surface phase behavior of binary mixtures of colloidal hard rods in
contact with a solid substrate (hard wall) is studied, with special emphasis on
the region of the phase diagram that includes the smectic A phase. The
colloidal rods are modelled as hard cylinders of the same diameter and
different lengths, in the approximation of perfect alignment. A
fundamental--measure density functional is used to obtain equilibrium density
profiles and thermodynamic properties such as surface tensions and adsorption
coefficients. The bulk phase diagram exhibits nematic-smectic and
smectic-smectic demixing, with smectic phases having different compositions; in
some cases they are microfractionated. The calculated surface phase diagram of
the wall-nematic interface shows a very rich phase behavior, including layering
transitions and complete wetting at high pressures, whereby an infinitely thick
smectic film grows at the wall via an infinite sequence of stepwise
first--order layering transitions. For lower pressures complete wetting also
obtains, but here the smectic film grows in a continuous fashion. Finally, at
very low pressures, the wall-nematic interface exhibits critical adsorption by
the smectic phase, due to the second-order character of the bulk
nematic-smectic transition.
