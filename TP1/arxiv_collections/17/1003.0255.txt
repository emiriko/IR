The carrier or medium of electromagnetic waves has been vainly searched for
many years, and now it has been caught after the establishment of the dynamic
equations in photon gas. The photon's rest mass has been estimated from the
cosmic background temperature in space where the photon gas is at an open state
of thermal equilibrium, and the photon's proper magnetic moment is calculated
from the dynamic equations of photon gas too. As the carrier of electromagnetic
waves, the photon gas is a discrete medium at very high frequency, and then the
Bohr's electron is hardly to emit energy in wave form and can be stably
rounding the nuclei in discrete orbits at lower temperature.
