A series of polycrystalline pyrochlore rare-earth titanate
Ho_{2-x}Cr_xTi_2O_7 are synthesized in order to enhance the ferroelectricity of
pyrochlore Ho2Ti2O7. For the sample close to the doping level x=0.4, a giant
enhancement of polarization P up to 660\muC/m2 from 0.54\muC/m2 at x=0 is
obtained, accompanied with an increment of ferroelectric transition point Tc up
to ~140K from ~60K. A magnetic anomaly at T~140K together with the polarization
response to magnetic field, is identified, implying the multiferroic effect in
Ho2-xCrxTi2O7.
