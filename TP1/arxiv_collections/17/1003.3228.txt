The physical solutions of Lagrangian of octonionics are researched in the
paper. It is shown, the gravitational interaction in Friedmann space and in
spherically symmetric space in such model is to be described by pair of charged
massless vectorial D-bosons of Minkowski space. It is proposed to use the
formalism for the description of jet and supernova.
