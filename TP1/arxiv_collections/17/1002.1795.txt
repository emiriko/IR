We report on a study of the large-scale temperature structure of the Perseus
cluster with Suzaku, using the observational data of four pointings of 30'
offset regions, together with the data from the central region. Thanks to the
Hard X-ray Detector (HXD-PIN: 10 - 60 keV), Suzaku can determine the
temperature of hot galaxy clusters. We performed the spectral analysis, by
considering the temperature structure and the collimator response of the PIN
correctly. As a result, we found that the upper limit of the temperature in the
outer region is $\sim$ 14 keV, and an extremely hot gas, which was reported for
RXJ 1347.5-1145 and A 3667, was not found in the Perseus cluster. This
indicates that the Perseus cluster has not recently experienced a major merger.
