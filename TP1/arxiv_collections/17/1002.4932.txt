In N = 1 rigid supersymmetric theories, there exist three standard
realizations of the supercurrent multiplet corresponding to the (i) old
minimal, (ii) new minimal and (iii) non-minimal off-shell formulations for N =
1 supergravity. Recently, Komargodski and Seiberg in arXiv:1002.2228 put
forward a new supercurrent and proved its consistency, although in the past it
was believed not to exist. In this paper, three new variant supercurrent
multiplets are proposed. Implications for supergravity-matter systems are
discussed.
