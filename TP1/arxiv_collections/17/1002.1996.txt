We present an occultation of the newly discovered hot Jupiter system WASP-19,
observed with the HAWK-I instrument on the VLT, in order to measure thermal
emission from the planet's dayside at ~2 um. The light curve was analysed using
a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo method to find the eclipse depth and the central
transit time. The transit depth was found to be 0.366+-0.072 %, corresponding
to a brightness temperature of 2540+-180 K. This is significantly higher than
the calculated (zero-albedo) equilibrium temperature, and indicates that the
planet shows poor redistribution of heat to the night side, consistent with
models of highly irradiated planets. Further observations are needed to confirm
the existence of a temperature inversion, and possibly molecular emission
lines. The central eclipse time was found to be consistent with a circular
orbit.
