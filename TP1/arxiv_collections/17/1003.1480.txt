For driven Markovian dynamics on a network of (biomolecular) states, the
generalized mobilities, i.e., the response of any current to changes in an
external parameter, are expressed by an integral over an appropriate
current-current correlation function and thus related to the generalized
diffusion constants. As only input, a local detailed balance condition is
required typically even valid for biomolecular systems operating deep in the
non-equilibrium regime.
