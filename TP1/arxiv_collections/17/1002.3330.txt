Formal semantics offers a complete and rigorous definition of a language. It
is important to define different semantic models for a language and different
models serve different purposes. Building equivalence between different
semantic models of a language strengthen its formal foundation. This paper
shows the derivation of denotational semantics from operational semantics of
the language cCSP. The aim is to show the correspondence between operational
and trace semantics. We extract traces from operational rules and use induction
over traces to show the correspondence between the two semantics of cCSP.
