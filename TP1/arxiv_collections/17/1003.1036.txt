In an inhomogeneous magnetised plasma the transport of energy and particles
perpendicular to the magnetic field is in general mainly caused by quasi
two-dimensional turbulent fluid mixing. The physics of turbulence and structure
formation is of ubiquitous importance to every magnetically confined laboratory
plasma for experimental or industrial application. Specifically, high
temperature plasmas for fusion energy research are also dominated by the
properties of this turbulent transport. Self-organisation of turbulent vortices
to mesoscopic structures like zonal flows is related to the formation of
transport barriers that can significantly enhance the confinement of a fusion
plasma. This subject of great importance in research is rarely touched on in
introductory plasma physics or continuum dynamics courses. Here a brief
tutorial on 2D fluid and plasma turbulence is presented as an introduction to
the field, appropriate for inclusion in undergraduate and graduate courses.
