We introduce a second-order stochastic model to explore the variability in
growth of biological shapes with applications to medical imaging. Our model is
a perturbation with a random force of the Hamiltonian formulation of the
geodesics. Starting with the finite-dimensional case of landmarks, we prove
that the random solutions do not blow up in finite time. We then prove the
consistency of the model by demonstrating a strong convergence result from the
finite-dimensional approximations to the infinite-dimensional setting of
shapes. To this end we introduce a suitable Hilbert space close to a Besov
space that leads to our result being valid in any dimension of the ambient
space and for a wide range of shapes.
