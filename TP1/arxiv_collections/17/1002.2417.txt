We present and analyze two new high-resolution (approx 0.3 arcsec),
high-sensitivity (approx 50 uJy beam-1) Very Large Array 3.6 cm observations of
IRAS 16293-2422 obtained in 2007 August and 2008 December. The components
A2alpha and A2beta recently detected in this system are still present, and have
moved roughly symmetrically away from source A2 at a projected velocity of
30-80 km s-1. This confirms that A2alpha and A2beta were formed as a
consequence of a very recent bipolar ejection from A2. Powerful bipolar
ejections have long been known to occur in low-mass young stars, but this is
-to our knowledge-- the first time that such a dramatic one is observed from
its very beginning. Under the reasonable assumption that the flux detected at
radio wavelengths is optically thin free-free emission, one can estimate the
mass of each ejecta to be of the order of 10^-8 Msun. If the ejecta were
created as a consequence of an episode of enhanced mass loss accompanied by an
increase in accretion onto the protostar, then the total luminosity of IRAS
16293-2422 ought to have increased by 10-60% over the course of at least
several months. Between A2alpha and A2beta, component A2 has reappeared, and
the relative position angle between A2 and A1 is found to have increased
significantly since 2003-2005. This strongly suggests that A1 is a protostar
rather than a shock feature, and that the A1/A2 pair is a tight binary system.
Including component B, IRAS 16293-2422 therefore appears to be a very young
hierarchical multiple system.
