We investigate the dynamic quantum tunneling between two attractors of a
mesoscopic driven Duffing oscillator. We find that, in addition to inducing
remarkable quantum shift of the bifurcation point, the mesoscopic nature also
results in a perfect linear scaling behavior for the tunneling rate with the
driving distance to the shifted bifurcation point.
