We present a new geometric construction of Loewner chains in one and several
complex variables which holds on a complete hyperbolic complex manifold M and
prove that there is essentially a one-to-one correspondence between evolution
families of order d and Loewner chains of the same order. As a consequence we
obtain a solution for any Loewner-Kufarev PDE, given by univalent mappings
(f_t) from M to a complex manifold N. The problem of finding solutions given by
univalent mappings with range in C^n is reduced to investigating whether the
union of the images f_t(M) is biholomorphic to a domain in C^n. We apply such
results to the study of univalent mappings from the unit ball B^n to C^n.
