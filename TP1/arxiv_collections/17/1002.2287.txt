In an attempt to merge the microscopic with the macroscopic worlds, we
present a brief study about a force which depends on the Planck force and on
the coupling constant that in turn depends on the size of a particle in a
particular direction (space dimension).We then apply this force to black body
radiations from which we deduce Hawking Radiations, Stefan radiation law and
the level at which the profound theories of physics are consistent. In
conclusion, it true that the world exists in both macro and microscopic
situations, in away that, the higher the value of the space dimension the
smaller the size of the particles we are studying and the smaller the value of
the space dimension the larger the size of the particle.
