We evaluate the shadowing effect in deeply virtual and real Compton
scattering on nuclei in the framework of the color dipole model. We rely on the
soft photon wave function derived in the instanton vacuum model, and employ the
impact parameter dependent phenomenological elastic dipole amplitude. Both the
effects of quark and the gluon shadowing are taken into account.
