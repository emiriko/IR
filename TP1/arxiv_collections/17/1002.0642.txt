We study the properties of hot neutrino-trapped beta-stable stellar matter
using an equation of state of nuclear matter within the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock
approach including three-body forces, combined with a standard chiral model for
kaon condensation at finite temperature. The properties of (proto)neutron stars
are then investigated within this framework.
