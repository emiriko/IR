Recent developments in observational cosmology call for understanding the
nature of the cosmological singularity (CS). Our work proposes modelling the
vicinity of CS by a time dependent orbifold (TDO). Our model makes sense if
quantum elementary objects (particle, string, membrane) can go across the
singularity of TDO, and our work addresses this issue. We find quantum states
of elementary objects, that can propagate in TDO. Our results open door for
more detailed examination.
