We introduce the triple crossing number, a variation of crossing number, of a
graph, which is the minimal number of crossing points in all drawings with only
triple crossings of the graph. It is defined to be zero for a planar graph, and
to be infinite unless a graph admits a drawing with only triple crossings. In
this paper, we determine the triple crossing numbers for all complete
multipartite graphs including all complete graphs.
