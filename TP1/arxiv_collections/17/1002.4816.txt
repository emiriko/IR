We propose a new entanglement switch of qubits consisting of electric
dipoles, oriented along or against an external electric field and coupled by
the electric dipole-dipole interaction. The pairwise entanglement can be tuned
and controlled by the ratio of the Rabi frequency and the dipole-dipole
coupling strength. Tuning the entanglement can be achieved for one, two and
three-dimensional arrangements of the qubits. The feasibility of building such
an entanglement switch is also discussed.
