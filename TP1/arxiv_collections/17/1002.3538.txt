Discovering and studying obscured AGN at z>1-3 is important not only to
complete the AGN census, but also because they can pinpoint galaxies where
nuclear accretion and star-formation are coeval, and mark the onset of AGN
feedback. We present the latest results on the characterization of z=1-3
galaxies selected for their high mid-infrared to optical flux ratio, showing
that they are massive and strongly star-forming galaxies, and that many do host
highly obscured AGN. We present a pilot program to push the search of
moderately obscured AGN up to z=5-6 and discuss the perspectives of this line
of research.
