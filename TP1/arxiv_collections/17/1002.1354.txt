In this paper, we investigate the particle entanglement in 2D
weakly-interacting rotating Bose and Fermi gases. We find that both particle
localization and vortex localization can be indicated by particle entanglement.
We also use particle entanglement to show the occurrence of edge reconstruction
of rotating fermions. The different properties of condensate phase and vortex
liquid phase of bosons can be reflected by particle entanglement and in vortex
liquid phase we construct a trial wave function in the viewpoint of
entanglement to relate the ground state with quantum Hall state. Finally, the
relation between particle entanglement and interaction strength is studied.
