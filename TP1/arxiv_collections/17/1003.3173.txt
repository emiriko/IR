We consider gq -> Zt, gq -> gamma t and gq -> t production (q=u,c) mediated
by strong flavour-changing neutral interactions within an effective operator
framework. We provide total cross sections for Tevatron and LHC, showing
explicitly that the six processes can be described in full generality in terms
of only two parameters (anomalous couplings) for q=u plus two for q=c. In our
work we take into account and study in detail the effects of top quark decay.
For gamma t, the inclusion of the top quark decay in the matrix element reveals
an striking result: the largest contribution to the final state, e.g. gamma l
nu b, with l = e, mu, tau, does not result from gq -> gamma t -> gamma l nu b
but from on-shell gq -> t production with t -> gamma l nu b, being the photon
radiated off the top decay products. This contribution, missed in previous
literature, increases the signal cross sections by factors ranging between 3
and 6.5.
