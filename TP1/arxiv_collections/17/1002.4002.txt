Geometric programming problems occur frequently in engineering design and
management. In multiobjective optimization, the trade-off information between
different objective functions is probably the most important piece of
information in a solution process to reach the most preferred solution. In this
paper we have discussed the basic concepts and principles of multiple objective
optimization problems and developed a solution procedure to solve this
optimization problem where the cost coefficients are continuous functions using
weighted method to obtain the non-inferior solutions.
