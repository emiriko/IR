Planetary nebulae (PNe) can be roughly categorized into several broad
morphological classes. The high quality images of PNe acquired in recent years,
however, have revealed a wealth of fine structures that preclude simplistic
models for their formation. Here we present narrow-band, sub-arcsecond images
of a sample of relatively large PNe that illustrate the complexity and variety
of small-scale structures. This is especially true for bipolar PNe, for which
the images reveal multi-polar ejections and, in some cases, suggest turbulent
gas motions. Our images also reveal the presence or signs of jet-like outflows
in several objects in which this kind of component has not been previously
reported.
