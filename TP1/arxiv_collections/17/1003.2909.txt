We present an algorithm, based on the iteration of conformal maps, that
produces independent samples of self-avoiding paths in the plane. It is a
discrete process approximating radial Schramm-Loewner evolution growing to
infinity. We focus on the problem of reproducing the parametrization
corresponding to that of lattice models, namely self-avoiding walks on the
lattice, and we propose a strategy that gives rise to discrete paths where
consecutive points lie an approximately constant distance apart from each
other. This new method allows us to tackle two non-trivial features of
self-avoiding walks that critically depend on the parametrization: the
asphericity of a portion of chain and the correction-to-scaling exponent.
