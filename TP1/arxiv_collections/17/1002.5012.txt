This report presents the results of studies that investigate the physics
reach at a Super $B$ factory, an asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider with a
design luminosity of $8 \times 10^{35}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, which is around 50
times as large as the peak luminosity achieved by the KEKB collider. The
studies focus on flavor physics and CP violation measurements that could be
carried out in the LHC era. The physics motivation, key observables,
measurement methods and expected precisions are presented.
