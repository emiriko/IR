Quantum particles can be obtained from a classical probability distribution
in phase space by a suitable coarse graining, whereby simultaneous classical
information about position and momentum can be lost. For a suitable time
evolution of the classical probabilities and choice of observables all features
of a quantum particle in a potential follow from classical statistics. This
includes interference, tunneling and the uncertainty relation.
