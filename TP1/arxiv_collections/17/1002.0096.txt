We study the ground state of three-leg $S=1/2$ Heisenberg tube using the
density-matrix renormalization group method. The dimerization order-parameter
and spin-excitation gap are calculated in a wide range of leg exchange
interactions. We confirm that a gapped state with the dimerization order is
realized even when the leg exchange interactions are ferromagnetic.
Furthermore, the topological configuration of spin-singlet pairs in the ordered
state is determined from the results of the Berry phase of each spin coupling
as well as the structure factor of singlet-singlet correlation functions. We
find that there exist three kinds of configurations of the valence-bond states
depending on the ratio of leg and rung exchange interactions.
