It is shown that the vacuum state in presence of Lorentz violation can be
followed by a particle-full universe that represents the current status of the
universe. In this model the modification in dispersion relation (Lorentz
violation) is picked up representing the regime of quantum gravity. The result
can be interpreted such that the existence of the particles is an evidence for
quantum effects of gravity in the past. It is concluded that only the vacuum
state is sufficient to appear the matter fields spontaneously after the process
of semi-classical analysis.
