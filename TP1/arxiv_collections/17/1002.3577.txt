This is an investigation of the role of shuffling and concatenating in the
theory of graph drawing. A simple syntactic description of these and related
operations is proved complete in the context of finite partial orders, as
general as possible. An explanation based on that is given for a previously
investigated collapse of the permutohedron into the associahedron, and for
collapses into other less familiar polyhedra, including the cyclohedron. Such
polyhedra have been considered recently in connection with the notion of
tubing, which is closely related to tree-like finite partial orders defined
simply and investigated here in detail. Like the associahedron, some of these
other polyhedra are involved in categorial coherence questions, which will be
treated in a sequel to this paper. (Printed versions of our papers have
sometimes been spoiled by referees and editorial assistants, and the versions
posted here in the arXiv are always to be preferred. However, due to the
irresponsible refereeing and the massive and misguided editorial assistance
commissioned by Cambridge University Press, the text of the present paper
printed in the journal "Mathematical Structures in Computer Science", where
even the title has been changed without our consent, is such that we can bear
responsibility only for the text posted here in the arXiv.)
