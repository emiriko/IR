Near-field enhanced, nano-Raman spectroscopy has been successfully used to
probe the surface chemistry of silicon prepared using standard wafer cleaning
and processing techniques. The results demonstrate the utility of this
measurement for probing the local surface chemical nano-environment with very
high sensitivity. Enhancements were observed for the vibrational (stretching)
modes of Si-H, F-Si-H and possibly also B-O-Si consistent with the surface
treatments applied. The nano-probes did not enhance the phononic features of
the silicon substrate.
