We present recent results from the BES experiment on the observation of the
Y(2175) in $J/\psi\to \phi f_0(980) \eta$, and $\eta(2225)$ in $J/\psi\to
\gamma \phi \phi$, and X(1440) in $J/\psi$ hadronic decays, together with the
new observation of $\psi(2S)$ radiative decays and hadronic decays into
$n\ks\ldb+c.c., \ld\ldb\pi^0, \ld\ldb\eta$. The effort to search for $J/\psi$
decays into $\gamma\gamma$ and invisible decays are also reported.
