We find that ferromagnetism can be induced in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by
introducing hydrogen. Multiwalled CNTs grown inside porous alumina templates
contain a large density of defects resulting in significant hydrogen uptake
when annealed at high temperatures. This hydrogen incorporation produces
H-complex and adatom magnetism which generates a sizeable ferromagnetic moment
and a Curie temperature near Tc=1000 K. We studied the conditions for the
incorporation of hydrogen, the temperature-dependent magnetic behavior, and the
dependence of the ferromagnetism on the size of the nanotubes.
