It is well known that magnons, elementary excitations in a magnetic material,
behave as bosons when their density is low. We study how the bosonic character
of magnons is governed by the amount of a multipartite entanglement in the
vacuum state on which magnons are excited. We show that if the multipartite
entanglement is strong, magnons cease to be bosons. We also consider some
examples, such as ground states of the Heisenberg ferromagnet and the
transverse Ising model, the condensation of magnons, the one-way quantum
computer, and Kitaev's toric code. Our result provides insights into the
quantum statistics of elementary excitations in these models, and into the
reason why a non-local transformation, such as the Jordan-Wigner
transformation, is necessary for some many-body systems.
