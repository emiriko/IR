We propose a dynamical model with a (2 + 1)-structure of composite Higgs
doublets: two nearly degenerate composites of the fourth family quarks t' and
b', $\Phi_{t^{\prime}} \sim \bar{t^{\prime}}_{R}(t^{\prime},b^{\prime})_L$ and
$\Phi_{b^{\prime}} \sim \bar{b^{\prime}}_{R}(t^{\prime},b^{\prime})_L$, and a
heavier top-Higgs resonance $\Phi_t \sim \bar{t}_{R}(t,b)_L$. This model
naturally describes both the top quark mass and the electroweak symmetry
breaking. Also, a dynamical mechanism providing the quark mass hierarchy can be
reflected in the model. The properties of these composites are analyzed in
detail.
