There has been renewed interest in the possibility of additional fermion
generations. At the same time there have been significant changes in the
relevant electroweak precision constraints, in particular, in the
interpretation of several of the low energy experiments. We summarize the
various motivations for extra families and analyze them in view of the latest
electroweak precision data.
