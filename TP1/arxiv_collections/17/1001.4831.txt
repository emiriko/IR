We use a non-Markovian approach to study the decoherence dynamics of a qubit
in either a low- or high-frequency bath modeling the qubit environment. This
approach is based on a unitary transformation and does not require the
rotating-wave approximation. We show that for low-frequency noise, the bath
shifts the qubit energy towards higher energies (blue shift), while the
ordinary high-frequency cutoff Ohmic bath shifts the qubit energy towards lower
energies (red shift). In order to preserve the coherence of the qubit, we also
investigate the quantum Zeno effect in two cases: low- and high-frequency
baths. For very frequent projective measurements, the low-frequency bath gives
rise to the quantum anti-Zeno effect on the qubit. The quantum Zeno effect only
occurs in the high-frequency cutoff Ohmic bath, after considering
counter-rotating terms. For a high-frequency environment, the decay rate should
be faster (without frequent measurements) or slower (with frequent
measurements, in the Zeno regime), compared to the low-frequency bath case. The
experimental implementation of our results here could distinguish the type of
bath (either a low- or high-frequency one) and protect the coherence of the
qubit by modulating the dominant frequency of its environment.
