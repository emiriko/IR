The strong interaction shift and broadening in pionic deuterium have been
remeasured with high statistics by means of the (3p-1s) X-ray transition using
the cyclotron trap and a high-resolution crystal spectrometer. Preliminary
results are (-2325+/-31) meV (repulsive) for the shift and (1171+23/-49} meV
for the width, which yields precise values for the pion-deuteron scattering
length and the threshold parameter for pion production.
