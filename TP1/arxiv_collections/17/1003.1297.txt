A topological geon black hole with gauge charges may have a gauge bundle that
necessarily incorporates charge conjugation as a gauge symmetry. This happens
for example for the Reissner-Nordstrom geon. We show that gauging the charge
conjugation leaves an imprint in the Unruh effect: the geon's exterior region
contains non-thermal correlations for particle pairs of the same, rather than
opposite, charge. The phenomenon occurs also in topologically similar Rindler
spacetimes with a background gauge field.
