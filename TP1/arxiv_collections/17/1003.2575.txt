In order to examine the rotational effect around neutron star in
tensor-vector-scalar (TeVeS) theory, we consider the slowly rotating
relativistic stars with a uniform angular velocity. As a result, we find that
similar to the case in general relativity (GR), the angular momentum is
proportional to the angular velocity. Additionally, as the value of coupling
constant $K$ becomes higher, the frame dragging in TeVeS becomes quite
different distribution from that in GR, where we can also see the deviation
even in the interior of star. While with smaller value of $K$, although the
frame dragging approaches to that expected in GR, the induced vector field due
to the rotation does not vanish and still exists. Thus, through the
observations associated with relativistic object, one could be possible to
distinguish the gravitational theory in strong field regime even in the case
that the value of coupling constant $K$ is quite small.
