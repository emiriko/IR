Time-resolved photometry of the eclipsing polar CSS 081231:071126+44040 was
obtained with the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT) on four nights
in October 2009. The light curve shows a single accretion hotspot lagging 10
degrees behind the secondary. The last two nights of data show "sputtering"
accretion and the hotspot nearly disappears in consecutive orbits.
