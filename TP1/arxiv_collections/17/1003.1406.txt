We extend the Langevin approach to a class of driving noises whose generating
processes have independent increments with super-heavy-tailed distributions.
The time-dependent generalized Fokker-Planck equation that corresponds to the
first-order Langevin equation driven by such a noise is derived and solved
exactly. This noise generates two probabilistic states of the system, survived
and absorbed, that are equivalent to those for a classical particle in an
absorbing medium. The connection between the rate of absorption and the
super-heavy-tailed distribution of the increments is established analytically.
A numerical scheme for the simulation of the Langevin equation with
super-heavy-tailed noise is developed and used to verify our theoretical
results.
