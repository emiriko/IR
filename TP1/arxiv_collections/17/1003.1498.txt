We present a search for long-period variable (LPV) stars among giant branch
stars in M15 which, at [Fe/H] ~ -2.3, is one of the most metal-poor Galactic
globular clusters. We use multi-colour optical photometry from the 0.6-m Keele
Thornton and 2-m Liverpool Telescopes. Variability of delta-V ~ 0.15 mag is
detected in K757 and K825 over unusually-long timescales of nearly a year,
making them the most metal-poor LPVs found in a Galactic globular cluster. K825
is placed on the long secondary period sequence, identified for metal-rich
LPVs, though no primary period is detectable. We discuss this variability in
the context of dust production and stellar evolution at low metallicity, using
additional spectra from the 6.5-m Magellan (Las Campanas) telescope. A lack of
dust production, despite the presence of gaseous mass loss raises questions
about the production of dust and the intra-cluster medium of this cluster.
