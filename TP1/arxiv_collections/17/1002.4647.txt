We study minimal graphs in the homogeneous Riemannian 3-manifold
$\widetilde{PSL_2(\mathbb{R})}$ and we give examples of invariant surfaces. We
derive a gradient estimate for solutions of the minimal surface equation in
this space and develop the machinery necessary to prove a Jenkins-Serrin type
theorem for solutions defined over bounded domains of the hyperbolic plane.
