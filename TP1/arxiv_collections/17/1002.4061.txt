We present an approach for flux analysis in process algebra models of
biological systems. We perceive flux as the flow of resources in stochastic
simulations. We resort to an established correspondence between event
structures, a broadly recognised model of concurrency, and state transitions of
process models, seen as Petri nets. We show that we can this way extract the
causal resource dependencies in simulations between individual state
transitions as partial orders of events. We propose transformations on the
partial orders that provide means for further analysis, and introduce a
software tool, which implements these ideas. By means of an example of a
published model of the Rho GTP-binding proteins, we argue that this approach
can provide the substitute for flux analysis techniques on ordinary
differential equation models within the stochastic setting of process algebras.
