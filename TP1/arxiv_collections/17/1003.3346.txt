We present measurements of the beta-factor, describing the coupling
efficiency of light emitted by single InAs/GaAs semiconductor quantum dots into
a photonic crystal waveguide mode. The beta-factor is evaluated by means of
time-resolved frequency-dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy. The emission
wavelength of single quantum dots is temperature tuned across the band edge of
a photonic crystal waveguide and the spontaneous emission rate is recorded.
Decay rates up to 5.7 ns^(-1), corresponding to a Purcell factor of 5.2, are
measured and beta-factors up to 85% are extracted. These results prove the
potential of photonic crystal waveguides in the realization of on-chip
single-photon sources.
