We present a compact experimental design for producing an arbitrarily large
optical continuous-variable cluster state using just one single-mode vacuum
squeezer and one quantum nondemolition gate. Generating the cluster state and
computing with it happen simultaneously: more entangled modes become available
as previous modes are measured, thereby making finite the requirements for
coherence and stability even as the computation length increases indefinitely.
