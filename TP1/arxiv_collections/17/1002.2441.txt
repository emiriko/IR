The effect of the higher-energy 2nd resonance and the associated
adiabatic-to-nonadiabatic transition on neutrino propagation in solar matter is
presented. For WIMP-annihilation neutrinos injected with energies in the "sweet
region" between 300 MeV and 10 GeV at the Sun's center, a significant and
revealing dependence on the neutrino mass hierarchy and the mixing angle
theta_13 down to 0.5 degrees is found in the flavor ratios arriving at Earth.
In addition, the amplification of flavor ratios in the sweet region allows a
better discrimination among possible annihilation modes of the solar dark
matter. Under mild assumptions on WIMP properties, it is estimated that 200
neutrino events in the sweet region would be required for inferences of
theta_13, the mass hierarchy, and the dominant WIMP annihilation mode. Future
large-volume, low-energy neutrino detectors are likely needed if the
measurement is to be made.
