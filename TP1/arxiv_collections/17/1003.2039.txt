Using a combination of local spin density and Hubbard 1 approximations we
study the mechansim of exchange interacion in EuX (X=O, S, Se and Te). We
reproduce known experimental results about bulk modulus, critical pressure for
structural phase transition, magnetic ordering temperature, spin--wave
dispersions as well as momentum-- and tempearuture--dependent band shift. Our
numerical results show pressure induced competition between the hybirization
enhanced exchange interaction and Kondo--like coupling in EuO. Possible ways to
enhance T_{c} are discussed.
