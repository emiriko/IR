Phase fluctuations in finite thickness layered superconducting films are
studied theoretically. The model consists of a set of layers, coupled to each
other via a gradient-like term in the phase-only action. It is shown that the
effective phase stiffness of the whole system is proportional to its thickness
(i.e. the number of individual layers). This result leads to a
superconductor-insulator transition and an inverse dependence of $T_c$ on
thickness,$T_c\sim d^{-1}$, both in accord with the experimental findings. The
relevance to disordered thin films is discussed.
