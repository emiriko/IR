We have derived energy conservation equations from the quaternionic Newton's
law that is compatible with Lorentz transformation. This Newton's law yields
directly the Euler equation and other equations governing the fluid motion.
With this formalism, the pressure contributes positively to the dynamics of the
system in the same way mass does. Hydrodynamic equations are derived from
Maxwell's equations by adopting an electromagnetohydrodynamics (EMH) analogy.
In this analogy the hydroelectric field is related to the local acceleration of
the fluid and the Lorentz gauge is related to the incompressible fluid
condition. An analogous Lorentz gauge in hydrodynamics is proposed. We have
shown that the vorticity of the fluid is developed whenever the particle local
acceleration of the fluid deviates from the velocity direction. We have also
shown that Lorentz force in electromagnetism corresponds to Euler force in
fluids. Moreover, we have obtained Gauss's, Faraday's and Ampere's -like laws
in Hydrodynamics.
