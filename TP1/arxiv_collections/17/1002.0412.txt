Ear biometric is considered as one of the most reliable and invariant
biometrics characteristics in line with iris and fingerprint characteristics.
In many cases, ear biometrics can be compared with face biometrics regarding
many physiological and texture characteristics. In this paper, a robust and
efficient ear recognition system is presented, which uses Scale Invariant
Feature Transform (SIFT) as feature descriptor for structural representation of
ear images. In order to make it more robust to user authentication, only the
regions having color probabilities in a certain ranges are considered for
invariant SIFT feature extraction, where the K-L divergence is used for keeping
color consistency. Ear skin color model is formed by Gaussian mixture model and
clustering the ear color pattern using vector quantization. Finally, K-L
divergence is applied to the GMM framework for recording the color similarity
in the specified ranges by comparing color similarity between a pair of
reference model and probe ear images. After segmentation of ear images in some
color slice regions, SIFT keypoints are extracted and an augmented vector of
extracted SIFT features are created for matching, which is accomplished between
a pair of reference model and probe ear images. The proposed technique has been
tested on the IITK Ear database and the experimental results show improvements
in recognition accuracy while invariant features are extracted from color slice
regions to maintain the robustness of the system.
