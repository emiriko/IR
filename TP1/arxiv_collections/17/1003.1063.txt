We have studied the electronic structure of hexagonal MnAs, as epitaxial
continuous film on GaAs(001) and as nanocrystals embedded in GaAs, by Mn 2p
core-level photoemission spectroscopy. Configuration-interaction analyses based
on a cluster model show that the ground state of the embedded MnAs nanocrystals
is dominated by a d5 configuration that maximizes the local Mn moment.
Nanoscaling and strain significantly alter the properties of MnAs. Internal
strain in the nanocrystals results in reduced p-d hybridization and enhanced
ionic character of the Mn-As bonding interactions. The spatial confinement and
reduced p-d hybridization in the nanocrystals lead to enhanced d-electron
localization, triggering d-d electron correlations and enhancing local Mn
moments. These changes in the electronic structure of MnAs have an advantageous
effect on the Curie temperature of the nanocrystals, which is measured to be
remarkably higher than that of bulk MnAs.
