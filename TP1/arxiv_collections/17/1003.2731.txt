The paper contains a development of the previously proposed generalized
lattice model (GLM). In contrast to usual lattice models, the difference of the
specific atomic volumes of the components is taken in account in GLM. In
addition to GLM, the dependence of the specific atomic volumes on local atomic
environments taken into account in new variable-lattice model (VLM).
Thermodynamic functions of multi-component homogeneous phases in the VLM are
obtained. Equations of equilibrium between gaseous and condensed phases are
derived.
