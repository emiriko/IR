We demonstrate that many features ascribed to strong correlation effects in
various spectroscopies of the cuprates are captured by a calculation of the
self-energy incorporating effects of spin and charge fluctuations. The self
energy is calculated over the full doping range from half filling to the
overdoped system. In the normal state, the spectral function reveals four
subbands: two widely split incoherent bands representing the remnant of the two
Hubbard bands, and two additional coherent, spin- and charge-dressed in-gap
bands split by a spin-density wave, which collapses in the overdoped regime.
The resulting coherent subbands closely resemble our earlier mean-field
results. Here we present an overview of the combined results of our mean-field
calculations and the newer extensions into the intermediate coupling regime.
