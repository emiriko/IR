Evidence is provided that the global distribution of tropical hurricanes is
principally determined by a universal function H of a single variable z that in
turn is expressible in terms of the local sea surface temperature and latitude.
The data-driven model presented here carries stark implications for the large
increased numbers of hurricanes which it predicts for a warmer world. Moreover,
the rise in recent decades in the numbers of hurricanes in the Atlantic, but
not the Pacific basin, is shown to have a simple explanation in terms of the
specific form of H(z), which yields larger percentage increases when a fixed
increase in sea surface temperature occurs at higher latitudes and lower
temperatures.
