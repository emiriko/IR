Tunneling of electrons through the barriers in heterostructures has been
studied, within unified transfer matrix approach. The effect of barrier width
on the transmission coefficient of the electrons has been investigated for
different pairs of semi conducting materials that are gaining much importance
recently. These pairs include CdS/CdSe, AlGaAs/GaAs and InAs/AlSb. Barrier
dimensions have been reduced from 20nm to 5nm to observe the effect of scaling
on tunneling properties. Material depended is highlighted for electrons with
energy varying from below the barrier height to above it. The electron
effective mass inside the barrier and the well are often different. The results
show that the coupling effect leads to significant changes on the transmission
effect. . The effective-mass dependant transmission coefficient has been
plotted with respect to electron energy. The computation is based on the
transfer matrix method by using MATLAB.
