We present a detailed synthesis of the development of the Human Genome
Project (HGP) from 1986 to 2003 in order to test the "social bubble" hypothesis
that strong social interactions between enthusiastic supporters of the HGP
weaved a network of reinforcing feedbacks that led to a widespread endorsement
and extraordinary commitment by those involved in the project, beyond what
would be rationalized by a standard cost-benefit analysis in the presence of
extraordinary uncertainties and risks. The vigorous competition and race
between the initially public project and several private initiatives is argued
to support the social bubble hypothesis. We also present quantitative analyses
of the concomitant financial bubble concentrated on the biotech sector.
Confirmation of this hypothesis is offered by the present consensus that it
will take decades to exploit the fruits of the HGP, via a slow and arduous
process aiming at disentangling the extraordinary complexity of the human
complex body. The HGP has ushered other initiatives, based on the recognition
that there is much that genomics cannot do, and that "the future belongs to
proteomics". We present evidence that the competition between the public and
private sector actually played in favor of the former, since its financial
burden as well as its horizon was significantly reduced (for a long time
against its will) by the active role of the later. This suggests that
governments can take advantage of the social bubble mechanism to catalyze
long-term investments by the private sector, which would not otherwise be
supported.
