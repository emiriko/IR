The masses and decay constants of the ground state heavy $\chi_{Q2}(Q=b,c)$
tensor mesons are calculated in the framework of the QCD sum rules approach.
The obtained results on the masses are in good consistency with the
experimental values. Our predictions on the decay constants can be verified in
the future experiments.
