This paper exploits the gravitational magnification of SNe Ia to measure
properties of dark matter haloes. The magnification of individual SNe Ia can be
computed using observed properties of foreground galaxies and dark matter halo
models. We model the dark matter haloes of the galaxies as truncated singular
isothermal spheres with velocity dispersion and truncation radius obeying
luminosity dependent scaling laws. A homogeneously selected sample of 175 SNe
Ia from the first 3-years of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) in the redshift
range 0.2 < z < 1 is used to constrain models of the dark matter haloes
associated with foreground galaxies. The best-fitting velocity dispersion
scaling law agrees well with galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. We further
find that the normalisation of the velocity dispersion of passive and star
forming galaxies are consistent with empirical Faber-Jackson and Tully-Fisher
relations, respectively. If we make no assumption on the normalisation of these
relations, we find that the data prefer gravitational lensing at the 92 per
cent confidence level. Using recent models of dust extinction we deduce that
the impact of this effect on our results is very small. We also investigate the
brightness scatter of SNe Ia due to gravitational lensing. The gravitational
lensing scatter is approximately proportional to the SN Ia redshift. We find
the constant of proportionality to be B = 0.055 +0.039 -0.041 mag (B < 0.12 mag
at the 95 per cent confidence level). If this model is correct, the
contribution from lensing to the intrinsic brightness scatter of SNe Ia is
small for the SNLS sample.
