The increasing role of home automation in routine life and the rising demand
for sensor networks enhanced wireless personal area networks (WPANs)
development, pervasiveness of wireless & wired network, and research. Soon
arose the need of implementing the Internet Protocol in these devices in order
to WPAN standards, raising the way for questions on how to provide seamless
communication between wired and wireless technologies. After a quick overview
of the Low-rate WPAN standard (IEEE 802.15.4) and the Zigbee stack, this paper
focuses on understanding the implications when interconnecting low powered IEEE
802.15.4 devices and a wired IPv6 domain. Subsequently the focus will be on
existing approaches to connect LoWPAN devices to the internet and on how these
approaches try to solve these challenges, concluding with a critical analysis
of interoperability problems.
