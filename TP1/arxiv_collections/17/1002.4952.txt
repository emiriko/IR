We present a detailed investigation of Ba(Fe0.65Ru0.35)2As2 by transport
measurements and Angle Resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We observe that Fe
and Ru orbitals hybridize to form a coherent electronic structure and that Ru
does not induce doping. The number of holes and electrons, deduced from the
area of the Fermi Surface pockets, are both about twice larger than in
BaFe2As2. The contribution of both carriers to the transport is evidenced by a
change of sign of the Hall coefficient with decreasing temperature. Fermi
velocities increase significantly with respect to BaFe2As2, suggesting a
significant reduction of correlation effects. This may be a key to understand
the appearance of superconductivity at the expense of magnetism in undoped iron
pnictides.
