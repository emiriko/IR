This work extends the results of the recently developed theory of a rather
complete thermodynamic formalism for discrete-state, continuous-time Markov
processes with and without detailed balance. We aim at investigating the
question that whether and how the thermodynamic structure is invariant in a
multiscale stochastic system. That is, whether the relations between
thermodynamic functions of state and process variables remain unchanged when
the system is viewed at different time scales and resolutions. Our results show
that the dynamics on a fast time scale contribute an entropic term to the
"internal energy function", $u_S(x)$, for the slow dynamics. Based on the
conditional free energy $u_S(x)$, one can then treat the slow dynamics as if
the fast dynamics is nonexistent. Furthermore, we show that the free energy,
which characterizes the spontaneous organization in a system without detailed
balance, is invariant with or without the fast dynamics: The fast dynamics is
assumed to reach stationarity instantaneously on the slow time scale; they have
no effect on the system's free energy. The same can not be said for the entropy
and the internal energy, both of which contain the same contribution from the
fast dynamics. We also investigate the consequences of time-scale separation in
connection to the concepts of quasi-stationaryty and steady-adiabaticity
introduced in the phenomenological steady-state thermodynamics.
