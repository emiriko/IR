We study the structural transition from `B' form of DNA to 'A' form of DNA
using group theoretic methods. The transition is not of the order-disorder type
and hence to construct a Landau kind of theory for the transition we define a
higher symmetry and relevant order parameters. We also discuss the issue of all
the conformations, observed experimentally during the course of transition,
being fundamentally different or not.
