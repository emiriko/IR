Protocols of quantum energy teleportation (QET), while retaining causality
and local energy conservation, enable the transportation of energy from a
subsystem of a many-body quantum system to a distant subsystem by local
operations and classical communication through ground-state entanglement. We
prove two energy-entanglement inequalities for a minimal QET model. These
relations help us to gain a profound understanding of entanglement itself as a
physical resource by relating entanglement to energy as an evident physical
resource.
