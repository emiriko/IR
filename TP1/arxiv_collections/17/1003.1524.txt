The decays of the Langmuir waves in dense plasmas are computed using the
dielectric function theory widely used in the solid state physics.
  Four cases are considered: a classical plasma, a Maxwellian plasma, a
degenerate quantum plasma, and a partially degenerate plasma. The result is
considerably different from the conventional Landau damping theory.
