We use scaling arguments and coarse grained Monte Carlo simulations to study
the fluctuation mediated interactions between a pair of adhesion sites of a
bilayer membrane and a supporting surface. We find that the potential of mean
force is an infinitely long range attractive potential that grows
logarithmically with the pair distance $r$: $\phi(\vec{r})/k_BT=c\ln r$, where
the constant $c=2$ and $c=1$ for non-stressed and stressed membranes,
respectively. When, in addition to excluded volume repulsion, the membrane also
interacts with the underlying surface through a height-dependent attractive
potential, the potential $\phi(\vec{r})$ is screened at large pair distances.
