We argue that supersymmetric transformation could be applied across the
heterojunction formed by joining of two mixed semiconductors. A general
framework is described by specifying the structure of ladder operators at the
junction for making quantitative estimation of physical quantities. For a
particular heterojunction device, we show that an exponential grading inside a
nanoscale doped layer is amenable to exact analytical treatment for a class of
potentials distorted by the junctions through the solutions of transformed
Morse-Type potentials.
