We construct dyon solutions in SU(N) with topological electric and magnetic
charge. Assuming a |\Phi|^4-like potential for the Higgs field we show that the
mass of the dyons is relatively insensitive to the coupling parameter \lambda
characterizing the potential. We then apply the methodology of constructing
dyon solutions in SU(N) to G2. In order to define the electromagnetic field
consistently in the manner that we propose we find that dyon solutions exist
only when G2 is considered under the action of its maximal and regular subgroup
SU(3). In this case we find two different types of dyons, one of which has
properties identical to dyons in SU(3). The other dyon has some properties
which are seemingly atypical, e.g. the magnetic charge g_m = 4 \pi 3/e, which
differs from the 't Hooft/Polyakov monopole where g_m = 4 \pi 1/e.
