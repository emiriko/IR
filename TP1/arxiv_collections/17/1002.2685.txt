A relationship between Painleve systems and infinite-dimensional integrable
hierarchies is studied. We derive a class of higher order Painleve systems from
Drinfeld-Sokolov (DS) hierarchies of type A by similarity reductions. This
result allows us to understand some properties of Painleve systems, Hamiltonian
structures, Lax pairs and affine Weyl group symmetries.
