Commercial cellular networks, like the systems based on DS-CDMA, face many
types of interferences such as multi-user interference inside each sector in a
cell to interoperate interference. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has
been used as an advanced preprocessing tool for blind suppression of
interfering signals in DS-CDMA communication systems. The role of ICA is to
provide an interference-mitigated signal to the conventional detection. This
paper evaluates the performance of some major ICA algorithms like Cardoso's
joint approximate diagonalization of eigen matrices (JADE), Hyvarinen's fixed
point algorithm and Comon's algorithm to solve the symbol estimation problem of
the multi users in a DSCDMA communication system. The main focus is on blind
separation of convolved CDMA mixture and the improvement of the downlink symbol
estimation. The results of numerical experiment are compared with those
obtained by the Single User Detection (SUD) receiver, ICA detector and combined
SUD-ICA detector.
