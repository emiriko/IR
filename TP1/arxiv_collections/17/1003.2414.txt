We analyze the scattering from one-dimensional defects in intrinsic graphene.
The Coulomb repulsion between electrons is found to be able to induce
singularities of such scattering at zero temperature as in one-dimensional
conductors. In striking contrast to electrons in one space dimension, however,
repulsive interactions here can enhance transport. We present explicit
calculations for the scattering from vector potentials that appear when strips
of the material are under strain. There the predicted effects are exponentially
large for strong scatterers.
