The peculiarities of rotating frames of reference played an important role in
the genesis of general relativity. Considering them, Einstein became convinced
that coordinates have a different status in the general theory of relativity
than in the special theory. This line of thinking was confused, however. To
clarify the situation we investigate the relation between coordinates and the
results of space-time measurements in rotating reference frames. We argue that
the difference between rotating systems (or accelerating systems in general)
and inertial systems does not lie in a different status of the coordinates
(which are conventional in all cases), but rather in different global
chronogeometric properties of the various reference frames. In the course of
our discussion we comment on a number of related issues, such as the question
of whether a consideration of the behavior of rods and clocks is indispensable
for the foundation of kinematics, the influence of acceleration on the behavior
of measuring devices, the conventionality of simultaneity, and the Ehrenfest
paradox.
