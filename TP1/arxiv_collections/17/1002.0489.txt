The analysis of non-radiative sources of static or time-dependent
gravitational fields in the Solar System is crucial to accurately estimate the
free-fall orbits of the LISA space mission. In particular, we take into account
the gravitational effects of Interplanetary Dust (ID) on the spacecraft
trajectories. The perturbing gravitational field has been calculated for some
ID density distributions that fit the observed zodiacal light. Then we
integrated the Gauss planetary equations to get the deviations from the LISA
keplerian orbits around the Sun. This analysis can be eventually extended to
Local Dark Matter (LDM), as gravitational fields are expected to be similar for
ID and LDM distributions. Under some strong assumptions on the displacement
noise at very low frequency, the Doppler data collected during the whole LISA
mission could provide upper limits on ID and LDM densities.
