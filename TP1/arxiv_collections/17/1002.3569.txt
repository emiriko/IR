We prove various results on the cohomology of arithmetic lattices arising
from quaternion algebras over a number field with at least one complex place,
including a strong restriction on the allowable weights of cuspidal
cohomological automorphic forms and a conditional power saving for their
multiplicities when the associated locally symmetric space is a hyperbolic
3-manifold.
