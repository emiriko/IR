We fabricated large area infrared photodetector devices from thin film of
chemically reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets and studied their photoresponse
as a function of laser position. We found that the photocurrent either
increases, decreases or remain almost zero depending upon the position of the
laser spot with respect to the electrodes. The position sensitive photoresponse
is explained by Schottky barrier modulation at the RGO film-electrode
interface. The time response of the photocurrent is dramatically slower than
single sheet of graphene possibly due to disorder from the chemically synthesis
and interconnecting sheets.
