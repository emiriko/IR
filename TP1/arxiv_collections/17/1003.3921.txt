Scope of this contribution is twofold. First, it describes the potential of
the global astrometry mission Gaia for detecting and measuring planetary
systems based on detailed double-blind mode simulations and on the most recent
predictions of the satellite's astrometric payload performances (launch is
foreseen for late Summer 2012). Then, the identified capabilities are put in
context by highlighting the contribution that the Gaia exoplanet discoveries
will be able to bring to the science of extrasolar planets of the next decade.
