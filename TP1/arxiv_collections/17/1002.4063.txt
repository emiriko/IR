Compositionality is a key feature of process algebras which is often cited as
one of their advantages as a modelling technique. It is certainly true that in
biochemical systems, as in many other systems, model construction is made
easier in a formalism which allows the problem to be tackled compositionally.
In this paper we consider the extent to which the compositional structure which
is inherent in process algebra models of biochemical systems can be exploited
during model solution. In essence this means using the compositional structure
to guide decomposed solution and analysis.
  Unfortunately the dynamic behaviour of biochemical systems exhibits strong
interdependencies between the components of the model making decomposed
solution a difficult task. Nevertheless we believe that if such decomposition
based on process algebras could be established it would demonstrate substantial
benefits for systems biology modelling. In this paper we present our
preliminary investigations based on a case study of the pheromone pathway in
yeast, modelling in the stochastic process algebra Bio-PEPA.
