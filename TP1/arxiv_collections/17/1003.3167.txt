We investigate the superposition of four different quantum states based on
the $q$-oscillator. These quantum states are expressed by means of
Rogers-Szeg\"o polynomials. We show that such a superposition has the
properties of the quantum harmonic oscillator when $q\to 1$, and those of a
compass state with the appearance of chessboard-type interference patterns when
$q \to 0$.
