We use numerical simulations to study the crystallization of monodisperse
systems of hard aspherical particles. We find that particle shape and
crystallizability can be easily related to each other when particles are
characterized in terms of two simple and experimentally accessible order
parameters: one based on the particle surface-to-volume ratio, and the other on
the angular distribution of the perturbations away from the ideal spherical
shape. We present a phase diagram obtained by exploring the crystallizability
of 487 different particle shapes across the two-order-parameter spectrum.
Finally, we consider the physical properties of the crystalline structures
accessible to aspherical particles, and discuss limits and relevance of our
results.
