This note compares the performance of two multidimensional search and
optimization algorithms: Group Search Optimizer and Central Force Optimization.
GSO is a new state-of-the-art algorithm that has gained some notoriety,
consequently providing an excellent yardstick for measuring the performance of
other algorithms. CFO is a novel deterministic metaheuristic that has performed
well against GSO in previous tests. The CFO implementation reported here
includes architectural improvements in errant probe retrieval and decision
space adaptation that result in even better performance. Detailed results are
provided for the twenty-three function benchmark suite used to evaluate GSO.
CFO performs better than or essentially as well as GSO on twenty functions and
nearly as well on one of the remaining three. Includes update 24 February 2010.
