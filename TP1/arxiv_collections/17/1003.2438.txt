We report on our Chandra Cycle 9 program to observe half of the 60
(unobserved by Chandra) 3C radio sources at z<0.3 for 8 ksec each. Here we give
the basic data: the X-ray intensity of the nuclei and any features associated
with radio structures such as hot spots and knots in jets. We have measured
fluxes in soft, medium and hard bands and are thus able to isolate sources with
significant intrinsic column density. For the stronger nuclei, we have applied
the standard spectral analysis which provides the best fit values of X-ray
spectral index and column density. We find evidence for intrinsic absorption
exceeding a column density of 10^{22} cm^{-2} for one third of our sources.
