In a previous paper we have investigated quantum states evolving into
mutually orthogonal states at equidistant times, and the quantum anticipation
effect exhibited by measurements at one half step. Here we extend our analyzes
of quantum anticipation to general type quantum evolutions and spectral
measures and prove that quantum evolutions possessing an embedded orthogonal
evolution are characterized by positive joint spectral measure. Furthermore, we
categorize quantum evolution, assess anticipation strength and provide a
framework of analytic tools and results, thus preparing for further
investigation and experimental verification of anticipation in concrete
physical situations such as the H-atom, which we have found to exhibit
anticipation.
