Security issues are playing dominant role in today's high speed communication
systems. A fast and compact FPGA based implementation of the Data Encryption
Standard (DES) and Triple DES algorithm is presented in this paper that is
widely used in cryptography for securing the Internet traffic in modern day
communication systems. The design of the digital cryptographic circuit was
implemented in a Vertex 5 series (XCVLX5110T) target device with the use of
VHDL as the hardware description language. In order to confirm the expected
behavior of these algorithms, the proposed design was extensively simulated,
synthesized for different FPGA devices both in Spartan and Virtex series from
Xilinx viz. Spartan 3, Spartan 3AN, Virtex 5, Virtex E device families. The
novelty and contribution of this work is in three folds: (i) Extensive
simulation and synthesis of the proposed design targeted for various FPGA
devices, (ii) Complete hardware implementation of encryption and decryption
algorithms onto Virtex 5 series device (XCVLX5110T) based FPGA boards and,
(iii) Generation of ICON and VIO core for the design and on chip verification
and analyzing using Chipscope Pro. The experimental as well as implementation
results compared to the implementations reported so far are quite encouraging.
