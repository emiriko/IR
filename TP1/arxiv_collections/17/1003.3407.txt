Based on the methods developed in [Kashiwara-Rouquier], we consider
microlocalization of the rational Cherednik algebra of type $\Z/l\Z$. Our goal
is to construct the irreducible modules and standard modules of the rational
Cherednik algebra by using the microlocalization. As a consequence, we obtain
the sheaves of microlocal system corresponding to holonomic systems with
regular singularities.
