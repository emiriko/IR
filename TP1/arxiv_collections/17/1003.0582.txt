We study the dynamical correlation functions of the Richardson pairing model
(also known as the reduced or discrete-state BCS model) in the canonical
ensemble. We use the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz formalism, which gives exact
expressions for the form factors of the most important observables. By summing
these form factors over a relevant set of states, we obtain very precise
estimates of the correlation functions, as confirmed by global sum-rules
(saturation above 99% in all cases considered). Unlike the case of many other
Bethe Ansatz solvable theories, simple two-particle states are sufficient to
achieve such saturations, even in the thermodynamic limit. We provide explicit
results at half-filling, and discuss their finite-size scaling behavior.
