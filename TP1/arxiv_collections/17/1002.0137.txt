Let R be a complete local hypersurface over an algebraically closed field of
characteristic different from two, and suppose that R has countable
Cohen-Macaulay representation type. In this paper, it is proved that the
maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-modules which are locally free on the punctured
spectrum are dominated by the maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-modules which are not
locally free on the punctured spectrum. More precisely, there exists a single
R-module X such that the indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-modules not
locally free on the punctured spectrum are X and its syzygy \Omega X and that
any other maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-module is obtained from some extension of X
and \Omega X.
