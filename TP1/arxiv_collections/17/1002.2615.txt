This paper reviews some recent advances in the development and application of
polarized radiation diagnostics to infer the mean magnetization of the quiet
solar atmosphere, from the near equilibrium photosphere to the highly
non-equilibrium upper chromosphere. In particular, I show that interpretations
of the scattering polarization observed in some spectral lines suggest that
while the magnetization of the photosphere and upper chromosphere is very
significant, the lower chromosphere seems to be weakly magnetized.
