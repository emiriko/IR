We discuss various mechanisms for the creation of an asymmetric charge
fluctuation with respect to the reaction plane among hadrons emitted in
relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We show that such mechanisms exist in both,
the hadronic gas and the partonic phases of QCD. The mechanisms considered here
all require the presence of a strong magnetic field (the ``chiral magnetic
effect''), but they do not involve parity or charge-parity violations. We
analyze how a transient local electric current fluctuation generated by the
chiral magnetic effect can dynamically evolve into an asymmetric charge
distribution among the final-state hadrons in momentum space. We estimate the
magnitude of the event-by-event fluctuations of the final-state charge
asymmetry due to the partonic and hadronic mechanisms.
