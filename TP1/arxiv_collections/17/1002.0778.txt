A simple formalism to describe flavor and CP violation in a model independent
way is provided. Our method is particularly useful to derive robust bounds on
models with arbitrary mechanisms of alignment. Known constraints on flavor
violation in the K and D systems are reproduced in a straightforward and
covariant manner. Assumptions-free limits, based on top flavor violation at the
LHC, are then obtained. In the absence of signal, with 100 fb^{-1} of data, the
LHC will exclude weakly coupled (strongly coupled) new physics up to a scale of
0.6 TeV (7.6 TeV), while at present no general constraint can be set related to
Delta t=1 processes. Delta F=2 contributions will be constrained via same-sign
tops signal, with a model independent exclusion region of 0.08 TeV (1.0 TeV).
However, in this case, stronger bounds are found from the study of CP violation
in D-bar D mixing with a scale of 0.57 TeV (7.2 TeV). We also apply our
analysis to supersymmetric and warped extra dimension models.
