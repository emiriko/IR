We numerically investigate the impact on the two-body range by several
Newtonian and non-Newtonian dynamical effects for some Earth-planet (Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) pairs in view of the expected cm-level accuracy
in some future planned or proposed interplanetary ranging operations
(abridged).
