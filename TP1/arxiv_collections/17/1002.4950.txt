In this "Invisible Universe" proceedings, we introduce the Dark Energy
Universe Simulation Series (DEUSS) which aim at investigating the imprints of
realistic dark energy models on cosmic structure formation. It represents the
largest dynamical dark energy simulation suite to date in term of spatial
dynamics. We first present the 3 realistic dark energy models (calibrated on
latest SNIa and CMB data): LambdaCDM, quintessence with Ratra-Peebles
potential, and quintessence with Sugra potential. We then isolate various
contributions for non-linear matter power spectra from a series of pre-DEUSS
high-resolution simulations (130 million particles). Finally, we introduce
DEUSS which consist in 9 Grand Challenge runs with 1 billion particles each
thus probing scales from 4 Gpc down to 3 kpc at z=0. Our goal is to make these
simulations available to the community through the "Dark Energy Universe
Virtual Observatory" (DEUVO), and the "Dark Energy Universe Simulations" (DEUS)
consortium.
