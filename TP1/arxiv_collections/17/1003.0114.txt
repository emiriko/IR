A theorem on the existence of exactly $N$ limit cycles around a critical
point for the Lienard system $\ddot{x}+f(x) \dot{x}+g(x) =0$ is proved. An
alogrithm on the determination of a desired number of limit cycles for this
system has been considered which might become relevant for a Lienard system
with incomplete data.
