We provide an extension to lattice systems of the reptation quantum Monte
Carlo algorithm, originally devised for continuous Hamiltonians. For systems
affected by the sign problem, a method to systematically improve upon the
so-called fixed-node approximation is also proposed. The generality of the
method, which also takes advantage of a canonical worm algorithm scheme to
measure off-diagonal observables, makes it applicable to a vast variety of
quantum systems and eases the study of their ground-state and excited-states
properties. As a case study, we investigate the quantum dynamics of the
one-dimensional Heisenberg model and we provide accurate estimates of the
ground-state energy of the two-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model.
