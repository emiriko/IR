The anthropic principle is an inevitable constraint on the space of possible
theories. As such it is central to determining the limits of physics. In
particular, we contend that what is ultimately possible in physics is
determined by restrictions on the computational capacity of the universe, and
that observers are more likely to be found where more complicated calculations
are possible.
  Our discussion covers the inevitability of theoretical bias and how
anthropics and computation can be an aid to imposing these biases on the theory
landscape in a systematic way. Further, we argue for (as far as possible)
top-down rather than bottom-up anthropic measures, contending that that the
latter can often be misleading.
  We begin the construction of an explicit computational measure by examining
the effect of the cosmological constant on computational bounds in a given
universe, drawing from previous work on using entropy production as a proxy for
observers by Bousso, Harnik, Kribs and Perez. In addition, we highlight a few
of the additional computational considerations that may be used to extend such
a measure.
