We investigate the collider implications of Split Universal Extra Dimensions.
The non-vanishing fermion mass in the bulk, which is consistent with the
KK-parity, largely modifies the phenomenology of Minimal Universal Exta
Dimensions. We scrutinize the behavior of couplings and study the discovery
reach of the Tevatron and the LHC for level-2 Kaluza-Klein modes in the
dilepton channel, which would indicates the presence of the extra dimensions.
Observation of large event rates for dilepton resonances can result from a
nontrivial fermion mass profile along the extra dimensions, which, in turn, may
corroborate extra dimensional explanation for the observation of the positron
excess in cosmic rays.
