A new type of hemispherical electron energy analyzer that permits angle and
spin resolved photoelectron spectroscopy has been developed. The analyzer
permits standard angle resolved spectra to be recorded with a two-dimensional
detector in parallel with spin detection using a mini-Mott polarimeter. General
design considerations as well as technical solutions are discussed and test
results from the Au(111) surface state are presented.
