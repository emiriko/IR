This paper is concerned with one-dimensional sums in classical affine types.
We prove a conjecture of the third author and Zabrocki by showing they all
decompose in terms of one-dimensional sums related to affine type A provided
the rank of the root system considered is sufficiently large. As a consequence,
any one-dimensional sum associated to a classical affine root system with
sufficiently large rank can be regarded as a parabolic Lusztig q-analogue.
