We have publicly released a blinded mix of simulated SNe, with types (Ia, Ib,
Ic, II) selected in proportion to their expected rate. The simulation is
realized in the griz filters of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) with realistic
observing conditions (sky noise, point spread function and atmospheric
transparency) based on years of recorded conditions at the DES site.
Simulations of non-Ia type SNe are based on spectroscopically confirmed light
curves that include unpublished non-Ia samples donated from the Carnegie
Supernova Project (CSP), the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), and the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II). We challenge scientists to run their
classification algorithms and report a type for each SN. A spectroscopically
confirmed subset is provided for training. The goals of this challenge are to
(1) learn the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different classification
algorithms, (2) use the results to improve classification algorithms, and (3)
understand what spectroscopically confirmed sub-sets are needed to properly
train these algorithms. The challenge is available at
www.hep.anl.gov/SNchallenge, and the due date for classifications is May 1,
2010.
