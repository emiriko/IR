The SSIM-optimized exact global histogram specification (EGHS) is shown to
converge in the sense that the first order approximation of the result's
quality (i.e., its structural similarity with input) does not decrease in an
iteration, when the step size is small. Each iteration is composed of SSIM
gradient ascent and basic EGHS with the specified target histogram. Selection
of step size and other parameters is also discussed.
