This thesis describes a numerical study of binary boson stars within the
context of an approximation to general relativity. The approximation we adopt
places certain restrictions on the dynamical variables of general relativity
(conformal flatness of the 3-metric), and on the time-slicing of the spacetime
(maximal slicing). The resulting modeling problem requires the solution of a
coupled nonlinear system of 4 hyperbolic, and 5 elliptic partial differential
equations (PDEs) in three space dimensions and time. We approximately solve
this system as an initial-boundary value problem, using finite difference
techniques and well known, computationally efficient numerical algorithms such
as the multigrid method in the case of the elliptic equations. Careful
attention is paid to the issue of code validation, and a key part of the thesis
is the demonstration that, as the basic scale of finite difference
discretization is reduced, our numerical code generates results that converge
to a solution of the continuum system of PDEs as desired. The thesis concludes
with a discussion of results from some initial explorations of the orbital
dynamics of boson star binaries. In particular, we describe calculations in
which motion of such a binary is followed for more than two orbital periods,
which is a significant advance over previous studies. We also present results
from computations in which the boson stars merge, and where there is evidence
for black hole formation.
