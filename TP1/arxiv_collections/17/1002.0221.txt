We theoretically investigate the angular and spin dependent transport in
normal-metal/helical-multiferroic/ferromagnetic heterojunctions. We find a
tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR) effect due to the spiral
magnetic order in the tunnel junction and to an effective spin-orbit coupling
induced by the topology of the localized magnetic moments in the multiferroic
spacer.
  The predicted TAMR effect is efficiently controllable by an external electric
field due to the magnetoelectric coupling.
