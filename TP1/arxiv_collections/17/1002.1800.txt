A few binary open clusters with visually separable components are known in
the Galaxy. However there can be dual systems that overlap in the line of sight
and are seen as a single cluster. On the basis of the WEBDA database we studied
the V-band magnitude distributions of stars of the open clusters in the Galaxy.
Most of these distributions showed Gaussian-like shape with a single peak, but
some of them demonstrated two and more peaks which we considered as a
manifestation of duality or multiplicity of the object. We examined the
magnitude distributions of 563 rich open clusters from the WEBDA database with
more than 100 stars and revealed 70 of them with two and more statistically
significant peaks which we considered as binary and multiple cluster
candidates. On the basis of these clusters we comprised a catalogue of possible
binary and multiple clusters in the Galaxy overlapping in the line of sight.
Geometric centres of cluster components and corresponding numbers of cluster
members were estimated.
