We propose and experimentally demonstrate a universal quantum averaging
process implementing the harmonic mean of quadrature variances. The harmonic
mean protocol can be used to efficiently stabilize a set of fragile squeezed
light sources with statistically fluctuating noise levels. The averaged
variances are prepared probabilistically by means of linear optical
interference and measurement induced conditioning. We verify that the
implemented harmonic mean outperforms the standard arithmetic mean strategy.
The effect of quantum averaging is experimentally tested both for uncorrelated
and partially correlated noise sources with sub-Poissonian shot noise or
super-Poissonian shot noise characteristics.
