Generation of two-photon wavepackets, produced by spontaneous parametric down
conversion in crystals with linearly chirped quasi-phase matching grating, is
analyzed. Although being spectrally broad, two-photon wavepackets produced this
way are not Fourier transform limited. In the paper we discuss the temporal
compression of the wavepackets, exploiting the insertion of a standard optical
fiber in the path of one of the two photons. The effect is analyzed by means of
full numerical calculation and the exact dispersion dependencies in both the
crystal and the fiber are considered. The study opens the way to the practical
realization of this idea.
