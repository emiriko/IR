Among the combinations $L_e-L_\mu$, $L_e-L_\tau$ and $L_\mu-L_\tau$ any one
can be gauged in anomaly free way with the standard model gauge group. The
masses of these gauge bosons can be so light that it can induce long-range
forces on the Earth due to the electrons in the Sun. This type of forces can be
constrained significantly from neutrino oscillation. As the sign of the
potential is opposite for neutrinos and antineutrinos, a magnetized iron
calorimeter detector (ICAL) would be able to produce strong constraint on it.
We have made conservative studies of these long-range forces with atmospheric
neutrinos at ICAL considering only the muons of charge current interactions. We
find stringent bounds on the couplings $ \alpha_{e\mu, e\tau} \lapp 1.65 \times
10^{-53}$ at 3$\sigma$ CL with an exposure of 1 Mton$\cdot$yr if there is no
such force. For nonzero input values of the couplings we find that the
potential $V_{e\mu}$ opposes and $V_{e\tau}$ helps to discriminate the mass
hierarchy. However, both potentials help significantly to discriminate the
octant of $\theta_{23}$. The explanation of the anomaly in recent MINOS data
(the difference of $\Delta m^2_{32}$ for neutrinos and antineutrinos), using
long-range force originated from the mixing of the gauge boson $Z^\prime$ of
$L_\mu-L_\tau$ with the standard model gauge boson $Z$, can be tested at ICAL
at more than 5$\sigma$ CL. We have also discussed how to disentangle this from
the solution with CPT violation using the seasonal change of the distance
between the Earth and the Sun.
