We have investigated the upper critical field anisotropy and magnetotransport
properties of Fe1.14(1)Te0.91(2)S0.09(2) single crystals in stable magnetic
fields up to 35 T. The results show that u0Hc2(T) along the c axis and in the
ab-plane exhibit saturation at low temperatures. The anisotropy of u0Hc2(T)
decreases with decreasing temperature, becoming nearly isotropic for T->0. Our
analysis indicates that the spin-paramagnetic pair-breaking with spin-orbital
scattering is responsible for the behavior of u0Hc2(T). Furthermore, from
analysis of the normal state properties, we show evidence that the excess Fe
acting as Kondo-type impurities is a key factor determining the normal and
superconducting state physical properties.
