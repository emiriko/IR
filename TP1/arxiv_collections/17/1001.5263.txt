We reexamine Petrov type D gravitational fields generated by a perfect fluid
with spatially homogeneous energy density and in which the flow lines form a
timelike non-shearing and non-rotating congruence. It is shown that the
anisotropic such spacetimes, which comprise the vacuum C-metric as a limit
case, can have \emph{non-zero} expansion, contrary to the conclusion in the
original investigation by Barnes (Gen. Rel. Grav. 4, 105 (1973)). This class
consists of cosmological models with generically one and at most two Killing
vectors. We construct their line element and discuss some important properties.
The methods used in this investigation incite to deduce testable criteria
regarding shearfree normality and staticity op Petrov type $D$ spacetimes in
general, which we add in an appendix.
