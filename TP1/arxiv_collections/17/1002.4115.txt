The static, apparently cylindrically symmetric vacuum solution of Linet and
Tian for the case of a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is shown to
have toroidal symmetry and, besides $\Lambda$, to include three arbitrary
parameters. It possesses two curvature singularities, of which one can be
removed by matching it across a toroidal surface to a corresponding region of
the dust-filled Einstein static universe. In four dimensions, this clarifies
the geometrical properties, the coordinate ranges and the meaning of the
parameters in this solution. Some other properties and limiting cases of this
space-time are described. Its generalisation to any higher number of dimensions
is also explicitly given.
