We provide a transformation formula of non-commutative Donaldson-Thomas
invariants under a composition of mutations. Consequently, we get a description
of a composition of cluster transformations in terms of quiver Grassmannians.
As an application, we give an alternative proof of Fomin-Zelevinsky's
conjectures on $F$-polynomials and $g$-vectors.
