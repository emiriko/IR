We define matrix product states in the continuum limit, without any reference
to an underlying lattice parameter. This allows to extend the density matrix
renormalization group and variational matrix product state formalism to quantum
field theories and continuum models in 1 spatial dimension. We illustrate our
procedure with the Lieb-Liniger model.
