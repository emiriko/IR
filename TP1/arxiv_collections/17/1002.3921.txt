Longitudinal double-spin asymmetries of charged hadrons with high transverse
momentum $p_T$ have been measured in electroproduction using the \hermes\
detector at \hera. Processes involving gluons in the nucleon have been enhanced
relative to others by selecting hadrons with $p_T$ typically above 1 GeV. In
this kinematic domain the gluon polarization has been extracted in leading
order making use of the model embedded in the Monte Carlo Generator \Pythia\
6.2. The gluon polarization obtained from single inclusive hadrons in the $p_T$
range 1 GeV $< p_T <$ 2.5 GeV using a deuterium target is $\frac{\Delta
g}{g}(\langle x\rangle, \langle \mu^2\rangle)=0.049\pm 0.034 (stat)\pm 0.010
(sys\textrm{-}exp)^{+0.126}_{-0.099}(sys\textrm{-}models)$ at a scale
$\la\mu^2\ra=1.35~{\rm GeV}^2$ and $\langle x\rangle = 0.22$. For different
final states and kinematic domains, consistent values of \DGG\ have been found
within statistical uncertainties using hydrogen and deuterium targets.
