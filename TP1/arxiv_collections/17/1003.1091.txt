We apply divergence-type theory (DTT) dissipative hydrodynamics to study the
2+1 space-time evolution of the fireball created in Au+Au relativistic
heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV. DTTs are exact hydrodynamic
theories that do no rely on velocity gradient expansions and therefore go
beyond second-order theories. We numerically solve the equations of motion of
the DTT for Glauber initial conditions and compare the results with those of
second-order theory based on conformal invariants (BRSS) and with data. We find
that the charged-hadron minumum-bias elliptic flow reaches its maximum value at
lower $p_T$ in the DTT, and that the DTT allows for a value of $\eta/s$
slightly larger than that of the BRSS. Our results show that the differences
between viscous hydrodynamic formalisms are a significant source of uncertainty
in the precise extraction of $\eta/s$ from experiments.
