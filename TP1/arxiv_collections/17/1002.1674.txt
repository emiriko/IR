Long-lived coherent spin precession of 3He-B at low temperatures around 0.2
Tc is a manifestation of Bose-Einstein condensation of spin-wave excitations or
magnons in a magnetic trap which is formed by the order-parameter texture and
can be manipulated experimentally. When the number of magnons increases, the
orbital texture reorients under the influence of the spin-orbit interaction and
the profile of the trap gradually changes from harmonic to a square well, with
walls almost impenetrable to magnons. This is the first experimental example of
Bose condensation in a box. By selective rf pumping the trap can be populated
with a ground-state condensate or one at any of the excited energy levels. In
the latter case the ground state is simultaneously populated by relaxation from
the exited level, forming a system of two coexisting condensates.
