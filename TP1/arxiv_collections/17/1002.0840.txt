SARAH is a Mathematica package for studying supersymmetric models. It
calculates for a given model the masses, tadpole equations and all vertices at
tree-level. Those information can be used by \SARAH to write model files for
CalcHep/CompHep or FeynArts/FormCalc. In addition, the second version of SARAH
can derive the renormalization group equations for the gauge couplings,
parameters of the superpotential and soft-breaking parameters at one and
two-loop level. Furthermore, it calculates the one-loop self energies and the
one-loop corrections to the tadpoles. SARAH can handle all N=1 SUSY models
whose gauge sector is a direct product of SU(N) and U(1) gauge groups. The
particle content of the model can be an arbitrary number of chiral superfields
transforming as any irreducible representation with respect to the gauge
groups. To implement a new model, the user has just to define the gauge sector,
the particle, the superpotential and the field rotations to mass eigenstates.
