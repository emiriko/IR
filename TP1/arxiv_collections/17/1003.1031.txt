We evaluate 2 thermopile sensors as convenient detector options for a modern
integrated THz imaging system. Both a commercial single pixel device and a
32x32 pixel FPA are utilized in a simple setup with a single optical element to
achieve an outstanding resolution and SNR performance. Either a cryogenically
cooled quantum cascade laser (QCL) or a room temperature electronic THz
multiplier chain is used as source.
