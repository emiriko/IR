The nucleosynthetic characteristics of various explosion mechanisms of Type
Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is explored based on three two-dimensional explosion
simulations representing extreme cases: a pure turbulent deflagration, a
delayed detonation following an approximately spherical ignition of the initial
deflagration, and a delayed detonation arising from a highly asymmetric
deflagration ignition. Apart from this initial condition, the deflagration
stage is treated in a parameter-free approach. The detonation is initiated when
the turbulent burning enters the distributed burning regime. This occurs at
densities around $10^{7}$ g cm$^{-3}$ -- relatively low as compared to existing
nucleosynthesis studies for one-dimensional spherically symmetric models. The
burning in these multidimensional models is different from that in
one-dimensional simulations as the detonation wave propagates both into
unburned material in the high density region near the center of a white dwarf
and into the low density region near the surface. Thus, the resulting yield is
a mixture of different explosive burning products, from carbon-burning products
at low densities to complete silicon-burning products at the highest densities,
as well as electron-capture products synthesized at the deflagration stage. In
contrast to the deflagration model, the delayed detonations produce a
characteristic layered structure and the yields largely satisfy constraints
from Galactic chemical evolution. In the asymmetric delayed detonation model,
the region filled with electron capture species (e.g., $^{58}$Ni, $^{54}$Fe) is
within a shell, showing a large off-set, above the bulk of $^{56}$Ni
distribution, while species produced by the detonation are distributed more
spherically (abridged).
