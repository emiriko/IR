We provide evidence for the conjecture that the Wodzicki-Chern classes vanish
for all bundles with the group Z of invertible zeroth order pseudodifferential
operators as structure group. In particular, we prove this vanishing if the
structure group reduces to pseudodifferential operators with leading order
symbol the identity. The leading order Chern classes are nonzero in general,
and they detect elements of the de Rham cohomology groups of the classifying
space BZ.
