Supersolid phases, in which a superfluid component coexists with conventional
crystalline long range order, have recently attracted a great deal of attention
in the context of both solid helium and quantum spin systems. Motivated by
recent experiments on 2H-AgNiO$_2$, we study the magnetic phase diagram of a
realistic three-dimensional spin model with single-ion anisotropy and competing
interactions on a layered triangular lattice, using classical Monte Carlo
simulation techniques, complemented by spin-wave calculations. For parameters
relevant to experiment, we find a cascade of different phases as a function of
magnetic field, including three phases which are supersolids in the sense of
Liu and Fisher. One of these phases is continuously connected with the
collinear ground state of AgNiO$_2$, and is accessible at relatively low values
of magnetic field. The nature of this low-field transition, and the possibility
of observing this new supersolid phase in AgNiO$_2$, are discussed.
