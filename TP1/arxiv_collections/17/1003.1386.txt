Einstein Telescope (ET) is a possible third generation ground-based
gravitational wave observatory for which a design study is currently being
carried out. A brief (and non-exhaustive) overview is given of ET's projected
capabilities regarding astrophysics and cosmology through observations of
inspiraling and coalescing compact binaries. In particular, ET would give us
unprecedented insight into the mass function of neutron stars and black holes,
the internal structure of neutron stars, the evolution of coalescence rates
over cosmological timescales, and the geometry and dynamics of the Universe as
a whole.
