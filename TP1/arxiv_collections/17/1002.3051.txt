The properties of a prescription for the inner products of the resonance
(Gamow states), scattering (Dirac kets), and bound states for 1-dimensional
quantum barriers are worked out. The divergent asypmtotic behaviour of the
Gamow states is regularized using a Gaussian convergence factor first
introduced by Zel'dovich. With this prescription, most of these states (with
discrete complex energies) are found to be orthogonal to each other, to the
bound states, and to the Dirac kets, except when they are neighbors, in which
case the inner product is divergent. Therefore, as it happens for the continuum
scattering states, the norm of the resonant ones remains non-calculable. Thus,
they exhibit properties half way between the (continuum real) Dirac-delta
orthogonality and the (discrete real) Kronecker-delta orthogonality of the
bound states.
