We investigate the rare radiative decays of extra gauge neutral bosons. In
particular, we established the theoretical predictions for the production of
unparticle in decays of $Z^{\prime}$ - bosons. The implementation of our
prediction in the analysis at the LHC experiments should be straightforward and
lead to more precise determination or limits of unparticle couplings and/or
$Z^{\prime}$ couplings and masses.
