This is the author's 2008 thesis from the University of Chicago. We
generalize the notion of the Clifford index to an arbitrary very ample line
bundle and show how it determines when a curve and its various secant varieties
have determinantal equations. In particular we establish the scheme theoretic
version of a conjecture of Eisenbud-Koh-Stillman. If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are line
bundles of degree at least $2g+1+k$, then ${\rm Sec}^j(C)$ is determinantally
presented for $j \leq k$ and for $j \leq k+1$ if $L_1 \neq L_2$. We also give a
geometric characterization of the standard Clifford index in terms of which
secant varieties of $C$ are determinantal in the bicanonical embedding. The
relationship with Koszul cohomology and Green's conjecture is also discussed.
