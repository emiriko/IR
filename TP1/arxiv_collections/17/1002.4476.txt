We investigate the entanglement dynamics of two interacting qubits in a spin
environment, which is described by an XY model with Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM)
interaction. The competing effects of environmental noise and interqubit
coupling on entanglement generation for various system parameters are studied.
We find that the entanglement generation is suppressed remarkably in
weak-coupling region at quantum critical point (QCP). However, the suppression
of the entanglement generation at QCP can be compensated both by increasing the
DM interaction and by decreasing the anisotropy of the spin chain. Beyond the
weak-coupling region, there exist resonance peaks of concurrence when the
system-bath coupling equals to external magnetic field. We attribute the
presence of resonance peaks to the flat band of the self-Hamiltonian. These
peaks are highly sensitive to anisotropy parameter and DM interaction.
