We investigated a flat multidimensional cosmological model in Gauss-Bonnet
gravity in presence of a matter in form of perfect fluid. We found analytically
new stationary regimes (these results are valid for arbitrary number of spatial
dimensions) and studied their stability by means of numerical recipes in
4+1-dimensional case. In the vicinity of the stationary regime we discovered
numerically another non-singular regime which appears to be periodical.
Finally, we demonstrated that the presence of matter in form of a perfect fluid
lifts some constraints on the dynamics of the 4+1-dimensional model which have
been found earlier.
