A novel tool for tsunami wave modelling is presented. This tool has the
potential of being used for operational purposes: indeed, the numerical code
\VOLNA is able to handle the complete life-cycle of a tsunami (generation,
propagation and run-up along the coast). The algorithm works on unstructured
triangular meshes and thus can be run in arbitrary complex domains. This paper
contains the detailed description of the finite volume scheme implemented in
the code. The numerical treatment of the wet/dry transition is explained. This
point is crucial for accurate run-up/run-down computations. Most existing
tsunami codes use semi-empirical techniques at this stage, which are not always
sufficient for tsunami hazard mitigation. Indeed the decision to evacuate
inhabitants is based on inundation maps which are produced with this type of
numerical tools. We present several realistic test cases that partially
validate our algorithm. Comparisons with analytical solutions and experimental
data are performed. Finally the main conclusions are outlined and the
perspectives for future research presented.
