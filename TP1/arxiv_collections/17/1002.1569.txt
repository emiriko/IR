Plants at high population density compete for light, showing a series of
physiological responses known as the shade avoidance syndrome. These responses
are controlled by the synthesis of the hormone auxin, which is regulated by two
signals, an environmental one and an internal one. Considering that the auxin
signal induces plant growth after a time lag, this work shows that plant growth
can be modelled in terms of an energy-like function extremization, provided
that the Markov property is not applied. The simulated height distributions are
bimodal and right skewed, as in real community of plants. In the case of
isolated plants, the theoretical expressions for the growth dynamics and the
growth speed excellently fit experimental data for Arabidopsis thaliana.
Moreover, the growth dynamics of this model is shown to be consistent with the
biomass production function of an independent model. These results suggest that
memory effects play a non-negligible role in plant growth processes.
