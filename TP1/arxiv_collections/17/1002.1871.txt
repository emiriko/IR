Remarkable progress towards realizing quantum computation has been achieved
using natural and artificial atoms as qubits. This article presents a brief
overview of the current status of different types of qubits. On the one hand,
natural atoms (such as neutral atoms and ions) have long coherence times, and
could be stored in large arrays, providing ideal "quantum memories". On the
other hand, artificial atoms (such as superconducting circuits or semiconductor
quantum dots) have the advantage of custom-designed features and could be used
as "quantum processing units". Natural and artificial atoms can be coupled with
each other and can also be interfaced with photons for long-distance
communications. Hybrid devices made of natural/artificial atoms and photons may
provide the next-generation design for quantum computers.
