We construct density dependent Class $III$ charge symmetry violating (CSV)
potential due to mixing of $\pi$-$\eta$ meson with off-shell corrections. The
density dependence enters through the non-vanishing $\pi$-$\eta$ mixing driven
by both the neutron-proton mass difference and their asymmetric density
distribution. The contribution of density dependent CSV potential is found to
be appreciably larger than the contribution of vacuum CSV potential.
