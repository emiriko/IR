Studies of diffuse magnetic scattering largely benefit from the use of a
multi-detector covering wide scattering angles. Therefore, the different
contributions to the diffuse scattering that originate from magnetic, nuclear
coherent, and nuclear spin-incoherent scattering can be separated by the
so-called XYZ-polarization analysis. In the past this method has been
successfully applied to the analysis of diffuse scattering by polycrystalline
samples of magnetic disordered materials. Single crystal studies that exploit
the vector properties of spin correlations are of particular interest for
furthering our understanding of frustration effects in magnetism. Based on the
symmetry properties of polarised scattering a suitable extension of the
conventional XYZ method has been derived, which allows for the complete
separation and the analysis of features of diffuse magnetic scattering from
single crystals.
