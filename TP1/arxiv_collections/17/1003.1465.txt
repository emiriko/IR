We investigate and parameterise high proper motion red stars in the Torino
Observatory Parallax Program. Observations of 27 objects were made over the
period 1994 - 2001 on the 1.05m Torino telescope. The trigonometric parallaxes
and proper motions were determined using standard techniques. We determine
parallaxes and proper motions, and by comparison to models we infer masses,
ages, and {metallicities}. Of the 27 objects, 22 are within 25pc and 4 appear
to be subdwarfs. There are published parallaxes for 18 objects, and all but 4
agree to within 2$\sigma$. The discrepancies are discussed.
