The continuous-variable coherent (conat) channel is a useful resource for
coherent communication, producing coherent teleportation and coherent
superdense coding. We extend the conat channel to multiparty conditions by
proposing definitions about multiparty position-quadrature conat channel and
multiparty momentum-quadrature conat channel. We additionally provide two
methods to implement this channel using linear optics. One method is the
multiparty version of coherent communication assisted by entanglement and
classical communication (CCAECC). The other is multiparty coherent superdense
coding.
