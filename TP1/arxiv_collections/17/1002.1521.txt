We present an holographical soft wall model which is able to reproduce Regge
spectra for hadrons with an arbitrary number of constituents. The model
includes the anomalous dimension of operators that create hadrons, together
with a dilaton, whose form is suggested by Einstein`s equations and the AdS
metric
