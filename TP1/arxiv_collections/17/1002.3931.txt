This paper studies an interference interaction (game) between selfish and
independent wireless communication systems in the same frequency band. Each
system (player) has incomplete information about the other player's channel
conditions. A trivial Nash equilibrium point in this game is where players
mutually full spread (FS) their transmit spectrum and interfere with each
other. This point may lead to poor spectrum utilization from a global network
point of view and even for each user individually.
  In this paper, we provide a closed form expression for a non pure-FS
epsilon-Nash equilibrium point; i.e., an equilibrium point where players choose
FDM for some channel realizations and FS for the others. We show that operating
in this non pure-FS epsilon-Nash equilibrium point increases each user's
throughput and therefore improves the spectrum utilization, and demonstrate
that this performance gain can be substantial. Finally, important insights are
provided into the behaviour of selfish and rational wireless users as a
function of the channel parameters such as fading probabilities, the
interference-to-signal ratio.
