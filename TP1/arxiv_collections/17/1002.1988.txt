PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3/La0.67Sr0.33MnO3(PZT/LSMO) bilayer with surface roughness ~
1.8 nm thin films have been grown by pulsed laser deposition on LaAlO3(LAO)
substrates. High remnant polarization (30-54 micro C/cm2), dielectric
constant(400-1700), and well saturated magnetization were observed depending
upon the deposition temperature of the ferromagnetic layer and applied
frequencies. Giant frequency-dependent change in dielectric constant and loss
were observed above the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic temperature. The frequency
dependent dielectric anomalies are attributed to the change in metallic and
magnetic nature of LSMO and also the interfacial effect across the bilayer; an
enhanced magnetoelectric interaction may be due to the Parish-Littlewood
mechanism of inhomogeneity near the metal-dielectric interface.
