Globular clusters are found usually in galaxies and they are an excellent
tracer of dark matter. Long ago it was suggested that there may exist
intracluster globular clusters (IGCs) bound to a galaxy cluster rather than to
any single galaxy. Here we present a map showing the large scale distribution
of globular clusters over the entire Virgo cluster. It shows that IGCs are
found out to 5 million light years from the Virgo center, and that they are
concentrated in several substructures much larger than galaxies. These objects
might have been mostly stripped off from low-mass dwarf galaxies.
