A major challenge in quantum optics and quantum information technology is to
enhance the interaction between single photons and single quantum emitters.
Highly engineered optical cavities are generally implemented requiring
nanoscale fabrication precision. We demonstrate a fundamentally different
approach in which disorder is used as a resource rather than a nuisance. We
generate strongly confined Anderson-localized cavity modes by deliberately
adding disorder to photonic crystal waveguides. The emission rate of a
semiconductor quantum dot embedded in the waveguide is enhanced by a factor of
15 on resonance with the Anderson-localized mode and 94 % of the emitted
single-photons couple to the mode. Disordered photonic media thus provide an
efficient platform for quantum electrodynamics offering an approach to
inherently disorder-robust quantum information devices.
