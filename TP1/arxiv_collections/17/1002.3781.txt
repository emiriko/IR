Molecular dynamics simulations and instantaneous normal mode (INM) analysis
of a fluid with core-softened pair interactions and water-like liquid-state
anomalies are performed to obtain an understanding of the relationship between
thermodynamics, transport properties and the poten- tial energy landscape.
Rosenfeld-scaling of diffusivities with the thermodynamic excess and pair
correlation entropy is demonstrated for this model. The INM spectra are shown
to carry infor- mation about the dynamical consequences of the interplay
between length scales characteristic of anomalous fluids, such as bimodality of
the real and imaginary branches of the frequency distribu- tion. The INM
spectral information is used to partition the liquid entropy into two
contributions associated with the real and imaginary frequency modes; only the
entropy contribution from the imaginary branch captures the non-monotonic
behaviour of the excess entropy and diffusivity in the anomalous regime of the
fluid.
