Two-particle correlations of direct photon triggers with associated hadrons
are obtained by isolation method in p+p collisions at \sqrt{s} = 200 GeV in
PHENIX at RHIC. The initial momentum of the away-side parton is tightly
constrained, because the parton-photon pair is balanced in momentum at the
leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD). Therefore making
such correlations can be used as a tool to measure the away-side parton
fragmentation function. The direct photon associated yields in p+p collisions
are compared with PYTHIA and the effect of the $k_{T}$ smearing in the spectra
is discussed.
