The reduction of integral-field spectrograph (IFS) data is demanding work.
Many repetitive operations are required in order to convert raw data into,
typically a large number of, spectra. This effort can be markedly simplified
through the use of a tool or pipeline, which is designed to complete many of
the repetitive operations without human interaction. Here we present our
semi-automatic data-reduction tool p3d that is designed to be used with
fiber-fed IFSs. Important components of p3d include a novel algorithm for
automatic finding and tracing of spectra on the detector, and two methods of
optimal spectrum extraction in addition to standard aperture extraction. p3d
also provides tools to combine several images, perform wavelength calibration
and flat field data. p3d is at the moment configured for four IFSs. In order to
evaluate its performance we have tested the different components of the tool.
For these tests we used both simulated and observational data. We demonstrate
that for three of the IFSs a correction for so-called cross-talk due to
overlapping spectra on the detector is required. Without such a correction
spectra will be inaccurate, in particular if there is a significant intensity
gradient across the object. Our tests showed that p3d is able to produce
accurate results. p3d is a highly general and freely available tool. It is
easily extended to include improved algorithms, new visualization tools and
support for additional instruments. The program code can be downloaded from the
p3d-project web site http://p3d.sourceforge.net
