ASTEP South is an Antarctic Search for Transiting Exo- Planets in the South
pole field, from the Concordia station, Dome C, Antarctica. The instrument
consists of a thermalized 10 cm refractor observing a fixed 3.88\degree x
3.88\degree field of view to perform photometry of several thousand stars at
visible wavelengths (700-900 nm). The first winter campaign in 2008 led to the
retrieval of nearly 1600 hours of data. We derive the fraction of photometric
nights by measuring the number of detectable stars in the field. The method is
sensitive to the presence of small cirrus clouds which are invisible to the
naked eye. The fraction of night-time for which at least 50% of the stars are
detected is 74% from June to September 2008. Most of the lost time (18.5% out
of 26%) is due to periods of bad weather conditions lasting for a few days
("white outs"). Extended periods of clear weather exist. For example, between
July 10 and August 10, 2008, the total fraction of time (day+night) for which
photometric observations were possible was 60%. This confirms the very high
quality of Dome C for nearly continuous photometric observations during the
Antarctic winter.
