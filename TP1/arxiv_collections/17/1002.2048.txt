From a resolution graph with certain conditions, Neumann and Wahl constructed
an equisingular family of surface singularities called splice quotients. For
this class some fundamental analytic invariants have been computed from their
resolution graph. In this paper we give a method to compute the multiplicity of
an abelian covering of a splice quotient from its resolution graph and the
Galois group.
