At high energies, in particle-capture processes between ions and atoms,
classical kinematic requirements show that generally double collision Thomas
processes dominate. However, for certain mass-ratios these processes are
kinematically forbidden. This paper explores the possibility of capture for
such processes by triple or higher order collision processes.
