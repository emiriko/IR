The spin texture surrounding a non-magnetic impurity in a quantum
antiferromagnet is a sensitive probe of the novel physics of a class of quantum
phase transitions between a Neel ordered phase and a valence bond solid phase
in square lattice S=1/2 antiferromagnets. Using a newly developed T=0 Quantum
Monte Carlo technique, we compute this spin texture at these transitions and
find that it does not obey the universal scaling form expected at a scale
invariant quantum critical point. We also identify the precise logarithmic form
of these scaling violations. Our results are expected to yield important clues
regarding the probable theory of these unconventional transitions.
