The characteristic pseudogap temperature T* in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 system has been
systematically evaluated as a function of doping, especially focusing on its
overdoped region, by measuring the out-of-plane resistivity under the magnetic
fields. Overdoped samples have been prepared by annealing TSFZ-grown
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 single crystals under the high oxygen pressures (990 kgf/cm2). At
a zero field, the out-of-plane resistivity showed a metallic behavior down to
Tc (= 62 K), while under the magnetic fields of over 3 T,it showed typical
upturn behavior from around 65 K upon decreasing temperature. This result
suggests that the pseudogap and superconductivity are different phenomena.
