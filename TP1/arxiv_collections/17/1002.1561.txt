We report our new observations of redshifted carbon monoxide emission from
six z~6 quasars, using the PdBI. CO (6-5) or (5-4) line emission was detected
in all six sources. Together with two other previous CO detections, these
observations provide unique constraints on the molecular gas emission
properties in these quasar systems close to the end of the cosmic reionization.
Complementary results are also presented for low-J CO lines observed at the GBT
and the VLA, and dust continuum from five of these sources with the SHARC-II
bolometer camera at the CSO. We then present a study of the molecular gas
properties in our combined sample of eight CO-detected quasars at z~6. The
detections of high-order CO line emission in these objects indicates the
presence of highly excited molecular gas, with estimated masses on the order of
10^10 M_sun within the quasar host galaxies. No significant difference is found
in the gas mass and CO line width distributions between our z~6 quasars and
samples of CO-detected $1.4\leq z\leq5$ quasars and submillimeter galaxies.
Most of the CO-detected quasars at z~6 follow the far infrared-CO luminosity
relationship defined by actively star-forming galaxies at low and high
redshifts. This suggests that ongoing star formation in their hosts contributes
significantly to the dust heating at FIR wavelengths. The result is consistent
with the picture of galaxy formation co-eval with supermassive black hole
(SMBH) accretion in the earliest quasar-host systems. We investigate the black
hole--bulge relationships of our quasar sample, using the CO dynamics as a
tracer for the dynamical mass of the quasar host. The results place important
constraints on the formation and evolution of the most massive SMBH-spheroidal
host systems at the highest redshift.
