For a d-dimensional convex lattice polytope P, a formula for the boundary
volume is derived in terms of the number of boundary lattice points on the
first $\floor{d/2}$ dilations of P. As an application we give a necessary and
sufficient condition for a polytope to be reflexive, and derive formulae for
the f-vector of a smooth polytope in dimensions 3, 4, and 5. We also give
applications to reflexive order polytopes, and to the Birkhoff polytope.
