We investigate a natural realization of a light Abelian hidden sector in an
extended Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. In addition to the usual RS bulk we
consider a second warped space containing a bulk U(1)_x gauge theory with a
characteristic IR scale of order a GeV. This Abelian hidden sector can couple
to the standard model via gauge kinetic mixing on a common UV brane. We show
that if such a coupling induces significant mixing between the lightest U(1)_x
gauge mode and the standard model photon and Z, it can also induce significant
mixing with the heavier U(1)_x Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes. As a result it might be
possible to probe several KK modes in upcoming fixed-target experiments and
meson factories, thereby offering a new way to investigate the structure of an
extra spacetime dimension.
