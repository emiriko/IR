I report a tight upper bound of the maximum speed of evolution from one
quantum state $\rho$ to another $\rho'$ with fidelity $F(\rho,\rho')$ less than
or equal to an arbitrary but fixed value under the action of a time-independent
Hamiltonian. Since the bound is directly proportional to the average absolute
deviation from the median of the energy of the state ${\mathscr D}E$, one may
interpret ${\mathscr D}E$ as a meaningful measure of the maximum information
processing capability of a system.
