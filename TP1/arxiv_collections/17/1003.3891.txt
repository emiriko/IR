In this work a physical modelling framework is presented, describing the
intelligent, non-local, and anisotropic behaviour of pedestrians. Its
phenomenological basics and constitutive elements are detailed, and a
qualitative analysis is provided. Within this common framework, two first-order
mathematical models, along with related numerical solution techniques, are
derived. The models are oriented to specific real world applications: a
one-dimensional model of crowd-structure interaction in footbridges and a
two-dimensional model of pedestrian flow in an underground station with several
obstacles and exits. The noticeable heterogeneity of the applications
demonstrates the significance of the physical framework and its versatility in
addressing different engineering problems. The results of the simulations point
out the key role played by the physiological and psychological features of
human perception on the overall crowd dynamics.
