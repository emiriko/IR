Rediscovered by a systematic search, a forgotten class of integrable surfaces
is shown to disprove the Finkel-Wu conjecture. The associated integrable
nonlinear partial differential equation $$ z_{yy} + (1/z)_{xx} + 2 = 0 $$
possesses a zero curvature representation, a third-order symmetry, and a
nonlocal transformation to the sine-Gordon equation $\phi_{\xi\eta} =
\sin\phi$. We leave open the problem of finding a Backlund autotransformation
and a recursion operator that would produce a local hierarchy.
