(Abriged) Our goal here is to provide merger frequencies that encompass both
major and minor mergers, derived from close pair statistics. We use B-band
luminosity- and mass-limited samples from an Spitzer/IRAC-selected catalogue of
GOODS-S. We present a new methodology for computing the number of close
companions, Nc, when spectroscopic redshift information is partial. We select
as close companions those galaxies separated by 6h^-1 kpc < rp < 21h^-1 kpc in
the sky plane and with a difference Delta_v <= 500 km s^-1 in redshift space.
We provide Nc for four different B-band-selected samples. Nc increases with
luminosity, and its evolution with redshift is faster in more luminous samples.
We provide Nc of M_star >= 10^10 M_Sun galaxies, finding that the number
including minor companions (mass ratio >= 1/10) is roughly two times the number
of major companions alone (mass ratio >= 1/3) in the range 0.2 <= z < 1.1. We
compare the major merger rate derived by close pairs with the one computed by
morphological criteria, finding that both approaches provide similar merger
rates for field galaxies when the progenitor bias is taken into account.
Finally, we estimate that the total (major+minor) merger rate is ~1.7 times the
major merger rate. Only 30% to 50% of the M_star >= 10^10 M_Sun early-type
(E/S0/Sa) galaxies that appear z=1 and z=0 may have undergone a major or a
minor merger. Half of the red sequence growth since z=1 is therefore unrelated
to mergers.
