A search for the production and non-standard decay of a Higgs boson, h, into
four taus through intermediate pseudoscalars, a, is conducted on 683 pb-1 of
data collected by the ALEPH experiment at centre-of-mass energies from 183 to
209 GeV. No excess of events above background is observed, and exclusion limits
are placed on the combined production cross section times branching ratio,
\xi^2 = \sigma(e+e- --> Zh)/\sigma_{SM}(e+e- --> Zh) x B(h --> aa)x B(a -->
\tau^+\tau^-)^2. For mh < 107 GeV/c2 and 4 < ma < 10 GeV/c2, \xi^2 > 1 is
excluded at the 95% confidence level.
