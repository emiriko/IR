We provided accurate estimates of distances, radii and iron abundances for
four metal-rich Cepheids, namely V340 Ara, UZ Sct, AV Sgr and VY Sgr. The main
aim of this investigation is to constrain their pulsation properties and their
location across the Galactic inner disk. We adopted new accurate NIR (J,H,K)
light curves and new radial velocity measurements for the target Cepheids to
determinate their distances and radii using the Baade-Wesselink technique. In
particular, we adopted the most recent calibration of the IR surface brightness
relation and of the projection factor. Moreover, we also provided accurate
measurements of the iron abundance of the target Cepheids. Current distance
estimates agree within one sigma with similar distances based either on
empirical or on theoretical NIR Period-Luminosity relations. However, the
uncertainties of the Baade-Wesselink distances are on average a factor of 3-4
smaller when compared with errors affecting other distance determinations. Mean
Baade-Wesselink radii also agree at one sigma level with Cepheid radii based
either on empirical or on theoretical Period-Radius relations. Iron abundances
are, within one sigma, similar to the iron contents provided by Andrievsky and
collaborators, thus confirming the super metal-rich nature of the target
Cepheids. We also found that the luminosity amplitudes of classical Cepheids,
at odds with RR Lyrae stars, do not show a clear correlation with the
metal-content. This circumstantial evidence appears to be the consequence of
the Hertzsprung progression together with the dependence of the topology of the
instability strip on metallicity, evolutionary effects and binaries.
