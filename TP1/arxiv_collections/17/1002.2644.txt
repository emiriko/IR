In non-viral gene delivery, the variance of transgenic expression stems from
the low number of plasmids successfully transferred. Here, we experimentally
determine Lipofectamine- and PEI-mediated exogenous gene expression
distributions from single cell time-lapse analysis. Broad Poisson-like
distributions of steady state expression are observed for both transfection
agents, when used with synchronized cell lines. At the same time,
co-transfection analysis with YFP- and CFP-coding plasmids shows that multiple
plasmids are simultaneously expressed, suggesting that plasmids are delivered
in correlated units (complexes). We present a mathematical model of
transfection, where a stochastic, two-step process is assumed, with the first
being the low-probability entry step of complexes into the nucleus, followed by
the subsequent release and activation of a small number of plasmids from a
delivered complex. This conceptually simple model consistently predicts the
observed fraction of transfected cells, the cotransfection ratio and the
expression level distribution. It yields the number of efficient plasmids per
complex and elucidates the origin of the associated noise, consequently
providing a platform for evaluating and improving non-viral vectors.
