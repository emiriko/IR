In this paper we study the optimal stopping problem for L\'evy processes
studied by Novikov and Shiryayev, Stochastics, 2007 In particular, we are
interested in finding the representing measure of the value function. It is
seen that that this can be expressed in terms of the Appell polynomials. An
important tool in our approach and computations is the Wiener-Hopf
factorization.
