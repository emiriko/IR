The draft paper defines a system, which is capable of maintaining bases of
test cases for logical specifications. The specifications, which are subject to
this system are transformed from their original shape in first-order logic to
form-based expressions as originally introduced in logics of George
Spencer-Brown. The innovation comes from the operations the system provides
when injecting faults - so-called mutations - to the specifications. The system
presented here applies to logical specifications from areas as different as
programming, ontologies or hardware specifications.
