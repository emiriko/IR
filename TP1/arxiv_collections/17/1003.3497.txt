The charmonium yields are expected to be considerably suppressed if a
deconfined medium is formed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. In addition,
the bottomonium states, with the possible exception of the Upsilon(1S) state,
are also expected to be suppressed in heavy-ion collisions. However, in
proton-nucleus collisions the quarkonium production cross sections, even those
of the Upsilon(1S), are also suppressed. These "cold nuclear matter" effects
need to be accounted for before signals of the high density QCD medium can be
identified in the measurements made in nucleus-nucleus collisions. We identify
two cold nuclear matter effects important for midrapidity quarkonium
production: "nuclear absorption", typically characterized as a final-state
effect on the produced quarkonium state and shadowing, the modification of the
parton densities in nuclei relative to the nucleon, an initial-state effect. We
characterize these effects and study the energy, rapidity, and impact-parameter
dependence of initial-state shadowing in this paper.
