In this paper, a unified mathematical expression for the constraints leading
to the equilibrium distributions of both extensive and non-extensive systems is
presented. Based on this expression, a recommendation is made to replace
Tsallis' q-average without obvious physical meaning with the statistical
harmonic mean for a generalized system.
