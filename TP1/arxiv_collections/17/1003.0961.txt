(Abridged) Spitzer data at 24, 70, and 160 micron and ground-based H-alpha
images are analyzed for a sample of 189 nearby star-forming and starburst
galaxies to investigate whether reliable star formation rate (SFR) indicators
can be defined using the monochromatic infrared dust emission centered at 70
and 160 micron. We compare recently published recipes for SFR measures using
combinations of the 24 micron and observed H-alpha luminosities with those
using 24 micron luminosity alone. From these comparisons, we derive a reference
SFR indicator for use in our analysis. Linear correlations between SFR and the
70 and 160 micron luminosity are found for L(70)>=1.4x10^{42} erg/s and
L(160)>=2x10^{42} erg/s, corresponding to SFR>=0.1-0.3 M_sun/yr. Below those
two luminosity limits, the relation between SFR and 70 micron (160 micron)
luminosity is non-linear and SFR calibrations become problematic. The
dispersion of the data around the mean trend increases for increasing
wavelength, becoming about 25% (factor ~2) larger at 70 (160) micron than at 24
micron. The increasing dispersion is likely an effect of the increasing
contribution to the infrared emission of dust heated by stellar populations not
associated with the current star formation. The non-linear relation between SFR
and the 70 and 160 micron emission at faint galaxy luminosities suggests that
the increasing transparency of the interstellar medium, decreasing effective
dust temperature, and decreasing filling factor of star forming regions across
the galaxy become important factors for decreasing luminosity. The SFR
calibrations are provided for galaxies with oxygen abundance 12+Log(O/H)>8.1.
At lower metallicity the infrared luminosity no longer reliably traces the SFR
because galaxies are less dusty and more transparent.
