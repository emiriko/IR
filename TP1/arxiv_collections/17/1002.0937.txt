Sensor networks are rather challenging to deploy, program, and debug. Current
programming languages for these platforms suffer from a significant semantic
gap between their specifications and underlying implementations. This fact
precludes the development of (type-)safe applications, which would potentially
simplify the task of programming and debugging deployed networks. In this paper
we define a core calculus for programming sensor networks and propose to use it
as an assembly language for developing type-safe, high-level programming
languages.
