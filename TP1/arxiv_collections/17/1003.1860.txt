We present a calculation of the scalar field self-force (SSF) acting on a
scalar-charge particle in a strong-field orbit around a Kerr black hole. Our
calculation specializes to circular and equatorial geodesic orbits. The
analysis is an implementation of the standard mode-sum regularization scheme:
We first calculate the multipole modes of the scalar-field perturbation using
numerical integration in the frequency domain, and then apply a certain
regularization procedure to each of the modes. The dissipative piece of the SSF
is found to be consistent with the flux of energy and angular momentum carried
by the scalar waves through the event horizon and out to infinity. The
conservative (radial) component of the SSF is found to be attractive (inward
pointing) for $r_0>r_{\rm c}(a)$ and repulsive (outward pointing) for
$r_0<r_{\rm c}(a)$, where $a$ is the Kerr spin parameter, $r_0$ is the
Boyer-Lindquist orbital radius, and $r_{\rm c}$ is a critical $a$-dependent
radius at which the conservative SSF vanishes. When the motion is retrograde
the conservative SSF is repulsive for all $r_0$ (as in the Schwarzschild case).
The dominant conservative effect of the SSF in Schwarzschild spacetime is known
to be of 3rd post-Newtonian (PN) order (with a logarithmic running). Our
numerical results suggest that the leading-order PN correction due to the black
hole's spin arises from spin-orbit coupling at 3PN, which dominates the overall
SSF effect at large $r_0$. In PN language, the change-of-sign of the radial SSF
is attributed to an interplay between the spin-orbit term ($\propto
-ar_0^{-4.5}$) and the "Schwarzschild" term ($\propto r_0^{-5}\log r_0$).
