In this paper we study the relation between long cycles and Bose-Einstein
condensation in the Infinite-Range Bose-Hubbard Model. We obtain an expression
for the cycle density involving the partition function for a Bose-Hubbard
Hamiltonian with a single-site correction. Inspired by the Approximating
Hamiltonian method we conjecture a simplified expression for the short cycle
density as a ratio of single-site partition functions. In the absence of
condensation we prove that this simplification is exact and use it to show that
in this case the long-cycle density vanishes. In the presence of condensation
we can justify this simplification when a gauge-symmetry breaking term is
introduced in the Hamiltonian. Assuming our conjecture is correct, we compare
numerically the long-cycle density with the condensate and find that though
they coexist, in general they are not equal.
