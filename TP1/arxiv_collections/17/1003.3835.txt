We analyze the symmetry breaking of matter-wave solitons in a pair of
cigar-shaped traps coupled by tunneling of atoms. The model is based on a
system of linearly coupled nonpolynomial Schr\"odinger equations (NPSEs).
Unlike the well-known spontaneous-symmetry-breaking (SSB) bifurcation in
coupled cubic equations, in the present model the SSB competes with the onset
of collapse in this system. Stability regions of symmetric and asymmetric
solitons, as well as the collapse region, are identified in the parameter space
of the system.
