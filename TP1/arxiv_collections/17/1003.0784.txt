We prove that for symmetric Markov processes of diffusion type admitting a
"carr\'e du champ", the Poincar\'e inequality is equivalent to the exponential
convergence of the associated semi-group in one (resp. all) $\L^p(\mu)$ spaces
for $p\in (1,+\infty)$. Part of this result extends to the stationary non
necessarily symmetric situation.
