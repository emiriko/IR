Electron-positron pair creation by multiphoton absorption in the collision of
a relativistic electron with a strong laser beam is calculated within
laser-dressed quantum electrodynamics. Total production rates, positron
spectra, and relative contributions of different reaction channels are obtained
in various interaction regimes. We study the process in a manifestly
nonperturbative domain which is shown accessible to future experiments
utilizing the electron beamlines at novel x-ray laser facilities or all-optical
setups based on laser acceleration. Our theory moreover allows us to add
further insights into the experimental data from SLAC [D. Burke {\it et al.},
Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 79}, 1626 (1997)].
