In this paper we formulate Bulgac-Kusnezov constant temperature dynamics in
phase space by means of non-Hamiltonian brackets. Two generalized versions of
the dynamics are similarly defined: one where the Bulgac-Kusnezov demons are
globally controlled by means of a single additional Nos\'e variable, and
another where each demon is coupled to an independent Nos\'e-Hoover thermostat.
Numerically stable and efficient measure-preserving time-reversible algorithms
are derived in a systematic way for each case. The chaotic properties of the
different phase space flows are numerically illustrated through the
paradigmatic example of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. It is found
that, while the simple Bulgac-Kusnezov thermostat is apparently not ergodic,
both of the Nos\'e-Hoover controlled dynamics sample the canonical distribution
correctly.
