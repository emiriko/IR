In this paper we present a scheme for generation of two-photon EPR and W
states in the cavity QED context. The scheme requires only one three-level
Rydberg atom and two or three cavities. The atom is sent to interact with
cavities previously prepared in vacuum states, via two-photon process. An
appropriate choice of the interaction times one obtains the mentioned state
with maximized fidelities. These specific times and the values of success
probability and fidelity are discussed.
