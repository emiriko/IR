Cyclic liftings are proposed to lower the error floor of low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes. The liftings are designed to eliminate dominant
trapping sets of the base code by removing the short cycles which form the
trapping sets. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the cyclic
permutations assigned to the edges of a cycle $c$ of length $\ell(c)$ in the
base graph such that the inverse image of $c$ in the lifted graph consists of
only cycles of length strictly larger than $\ell(c)$. The proposed method is
universal in the sense that it can be applied to any LDPC code over any channel
and for any iterative decoding algorithm. It also preserves important
properties of the base code such as degree distributions, encoder and decoder
structure, and in some cases, the code rate. The proposed method is applied to
both structured and random codes over the binary symmetric channel (BSC). The
error floor improves consistently by increasing the lifting degree, and the
results show significant improvements in the error floor compared to the base
code, a random code of the same degree distribution and block length, and a
random lifting of the same degree. Similar improvements are also observed when
the codes designed for the BSC are applied to the additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) channel.
