In our studies of the dynamics and energetics of the solar atmosphere, we
have detected, in high-quality observations from Hinode SOT/NFI, ubiquitous
small-scale upflows which move horizontally with supersonic velocities in the
quiet Sun. We present the properties of these fast moving upflows (FMUs) and
discuss different interpretations.
