The new EUV Lithography tools for IC High Volume Manufacture at 22nm make use
of EUV radiation at \lambda = 13.5nm. High power Laser (LPP) and Discharge
(DPP)EUV light sources are based on Sn plasmas for the optimum conversion of
electrical power to in-band radiation. Sn-fueled sources emit debris such as Sn
particles in a rather wide energy spectrum: from thermalized Sn to several tens
keV fast ions. Tin interaction with the collector mirrors surfaces facing the
high power EUV light source leads to the degradation of the optical performance
and productivity of the litho tool, therefore debris must be suppressed and the
surface modification of the mirror materials during the particle irradiation
must be carefully investigated both theoretically and experimentally. For DPP
Sn-fueled sources the collector is a grazing incidence mirror that reflects the
EUV light in the grazing angle range from about 1\degree to 20\degree. The most
used material for these collector mirrors is Ru. The knowledge of the
interaction process of Sn particles at different energies and angles with Ru
mirrors is crucial to understand mirror degradation and to tune the parameters
of the source and of the debris suppression devices to reach optimal mirror
lifetime. We carried out a study of the modification of the ruthenium surface
exposed to the simultaneous flux of thermalized and energetic Sn at grazing
incidence, for energies varying from 300eV to 30keV. The computational study is
performed with the Monte Carlo codes TRIDYN and TRIM.SP based on binary
collision approximation assumptions. These tools allow to follow dynamically
and at steady state the evolution of the surface composition and to model
surface binding energy and density for predicting sputtering, reflection,
ion-assisted deposition and depth profiles in the nm surface region.
