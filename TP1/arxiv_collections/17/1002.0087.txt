We re-evaluate the impact of wire resistance on the noise voltage and current
in the Johnson-(like)-noise based secure communicator, correcting the result
presented in [Physics Letters A 359 (2006) 737]. The analysis shown here is
based on the fluctuation-dissipation and the linear response theorems. The
results indicate that the impact of wire resistance in practical communicators
is significantly lower than the previous estimation.
