The interaction between dust grains is an important process in fields as
diverse as planetesimal formation or the plasma processing of silicon wafers
into computer chips. This interaction depends in large part on the material
properties of the grains, for example whether the grains are conducting,
non-conducting, ferrous or non-ferrous. This work considers the effects that
electrostatic and magnetic forces, alone or in combination, can have on the
coagulation of dust in various environments. A numerical model is used to
simulate the coagulation of charged, charged-magnetic and magnetic dust
aggregates formed from ferrous material and the results are compared to each
other as well as to those from uncharged, non-magnetic material. The
interactions between extended dust aggregates are also examined, specifically
looking at how the arrangement of charge over the aggregate surface or the
inclusion of magnetic material produces dipole-dipole interactions. It will be
shown that these dipole-dipole interactions can affect the orientation and
structural formation of aggregates as they collide and stick. Analysis of the
resulting dust populations will also demonstrate the impact that grain
composition and/or charge can have on the structure of the aggregate as
characterized by the resulting fractal dimension.
