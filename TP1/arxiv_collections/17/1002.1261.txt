We review results from general relativistic axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of accretion in Sgr A*. We use general relativistic radiative
transfer methods and to produce a broad band (from millimeter to gamma-rays)
spectrum. Using a ray tracing scheme we also model images of Sgr A* and compare
the size of image to the VLBI observations at 230 GHz. We perform a parameter
survey and study radiative properties of the flow models for various black hole
spins, ion to electron temperature ratios, and inclinations. We scale our
models to reconstruct the flux and the spectral slope around 230 GHz. The
combination of Monte Carlo spectral energy distribution calculations and 230
GHz image modeling constrains the parameter space of the numerical models. Our
models suggest rather high black hole spin ($a_*\approx 0.9$), electron
temperatures close to the ion temperature ($T_i/T_e \sim 3$) and high
inclination angles ($i \approx 90 \deg$).
