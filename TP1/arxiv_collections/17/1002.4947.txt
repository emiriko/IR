In this Letter we report the first LDA+DMFT results (method combining Local
Density Approximation with Dynamical Mean-Field Theory) for spectral properties
of superconductor LaFePO. Calculated {\bf k}-resolved spectral functions
reproduce recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data [D. H.
Lu {\it et al}., Nature {\bf 455}, 81 (2008)]. Obtained effective electron mass
enhancement values $m^{*}/m\approx$ 1.9 -- 2.2 are in good agreement with
infrared and optical studies [M. M. Qazilbash {\it et al}., Nature Phys. {\bf
5}, 647 (2009)], de Haas--van Alphen, electrical resistivity, and electronic
specific heat measurements results, that unambiguously evidence for moderate
correlations strength in LaFePO. Similar values of $m^{*}/m$ were found in the
other Fe-based superconductors with substantially different superconducting
transition temperatures. Thus, the dynamical correlation effects are essential
in the Fe-based superconductors, but the strength of electronic correlations
does not determine the value of superconducting transition temperature.
