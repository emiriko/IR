A question of B. Teissier, inspired by a previous problem of R. Thom, asks
whether for any germ of complex analytic hypersurface there exists a germ of
complex algebraic hypersurface with the same topological type. Up to now only
the case of germs with an isolated singularity is kwown. In this article we
answer in the affirmative the case 1-dimensional singular set, also for
embedded topological types.
