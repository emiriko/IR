This is a summary of lectures in superstring cosmology given by the author at
the CORFU 2009 School and Workshops "Theory - Cosmology - Phenomenology", Corfu
Institute, Greece, Sept 6-13, 2009. These lectures are based on some recent
developments and ideas, in the framework of superstring theory, concerning the
evolution and structure of the universe in (i) the very early "non-geometric"'
cosmological era, (ii) the intermediate "radiation-like" era and (iii) the late
time cosmological era characterized by the electroweak phase transition.
