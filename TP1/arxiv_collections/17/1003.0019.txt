A new method is presented for finding Killing tensors in spacetimes with
symmetries. The method is used to find all the Killing tensors of Melvin's
magnetic universe and the Schwarzschild vacuum. We show that they are all
trivial. The method requires less computation than solving the full Killing
tensor equations directly, and it can be used even when the spacetime is not
algebraically special.
