With the start-up of the LHC, we can hope to find evidences for new physics
beyond the Standard Model, and particle candidates for dark matter. Determining
the parameters of the full underlying theory will be a long process requiring
the combination of LHC and ILC data, flavor physics constraints, and
cosmological observations. However, the Very Early Universe properties, from
which the relic particles originate, are poorly known, and the relic density
calculation can be easily falsified by hidden processes. We consider
supersymmetry and show that determining the underlying particle physics
parameters will help understanding the Very Early Universe properties.
