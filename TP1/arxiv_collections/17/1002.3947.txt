This paper presents an elementary, approximate analytical treatment of cold
field electron emission (CFE) from a classical nanowall. A simple model is used
to bring out some of the basic physics of a class of field emitter where
quantum confinement effects exist transverse to the emitting direction. A
high-level methodology is presented for developing CFE equations more general
than the usual Fowler-Nordheim-type (FN-type) equations, and is applied to the
classical nanowall. If the nanowall is sufficiently thin, then significant
transverse-energy quantization effects occur, and affect the overall form of
theoretical CFE equations; also, the tunnelling barrier shape exhibits
"fall-off" in the local field value with distance from the surface. A conformal
transformation technique is used to derive an analytical expression for the
on-axis tunnelling probability.
