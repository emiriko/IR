Using multiband k*p theory we study the size and geometry dependence on the
slow light properties of conical semiconductor quantum dots. We find the V-type
scheme for electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) to be most favorable,
and identify an optimal height and size for efficient EIT operation. In case of
the ladder scheme, the existence of additional dipole allowed intraband
transitions along with an almost equidistant energy level spacing adds
additional decay pathways, which significantly impairs the EIT effect. We
further study the influence of strain and band mixing comparing four different
k*p band structure models. In addition to the separation of the heavy and light
holes due to the biaxial strain component, we observe a general reduction in
the transition strengths due to energy crossings in the valence bands caused by
strain and band mixing effects. We furthermore find a non-trivial quantum dot
size dependence of the dipole moments directly related to the biaxial strain
component. Due to the separation of the heavy and light holes the optical
transition strengths between the lower conduction and upper most valence-band
states computed using one-band model and eight-band model show general
qualitative agreement, with exceptions relevant for EIT operation.
