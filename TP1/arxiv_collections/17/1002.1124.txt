We have performed the first-principles calculations to study the elasticity,
electronic structure, and magnetism of InNCo3 and InNNi3. The independent
elastic constants are derived from the second derivative of total energy as a
function of strain, and the elastic modulus are predicted according to the
Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximation. Our calculations show that the bulk modulus of
InNCo3 is slightly larger than that of InNNi3. For InNCo3 the ferromagnetic
state is energetically preferable to the paramagnetic state, while the ground
state of InNNi3 is a stable paramagnetic (non-magnetic) state. This is due to
the different strength of 2p-3d hybridization for the N-Co and N-Ni atoms in
InNCo3 and InNNi3.
