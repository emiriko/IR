We present a sufficient condition for the presence of spontaneous
magnetization for the Ising model on a general graph, related to its long-range
topology. Applying this condition we are able to prove the existence of a phase
transition at temperature T > 0 on a wide class of general networks. The
possibility of further extensions of our results is discussed.
