We introduce and discuss a nonlinear kinetic equation of Boltzmann type which
describes the evolution of wealth in a pure gambling process, where the entire
sum of wealths of two agents is up for gambling, and randomly shared between
the agents. For this equation the analytical form of the steady states is found
for various realizations of the random fraction of the sum which is shared to
the agents. Among others, Gibbs distribution appears as steady state in case of
a uniformly distributed random fraction, while Gamma distribution appears for a
random fraction which is Beta distributed. The case in which the gambling game
is only conservative-in-the-mean is shown to lead to an explicit heavy tailed
distribution.
