We study the electrical and transport properties of monoatomic Mo wires with
different structural characteristics. We consider first periodic wires with
inter-atomic distances ranging between the dimerized wire to that formed by
equidistant atoms. We find that the dimerized case has a gap in the electronic
structure which makes it insulating, as opposed to the equidistant or
near-equidistant cases which are metallic. We also simulate two conducting
one-dimensional Mo electrodes separated by a scattering region which contains a
number of dimers between 1 and 6. The $I-V$ characteristics strongly depend on
the number of dimers and vary from ohmic to tunneling, with the presence of
different gaps. We also find that stretched chains are ferromagnetic.
