We consider a polymerization (fragmentation) model with size-dependent
parameters involved in prion proliferation. Using power laws for the different
rates of this model, we recover the shape of the polymerization rate using
experimental data. The technique used is inspired from an article of Zampieri
et al. where the fragmentation dependency on prion strains is investigated. Our
improvement is to use power laws for the rates whereas Zampieri et al. used a
constant polymerization coefficient and linear fragmentation.
