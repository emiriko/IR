A rigorous analytical study of the dispersion relations of weakly amplified
transverse fluctuations with wave vectors ($\vec{k}\parallel \vec{B}$) parallel
to the uniform background magnetic field $\vec{B}$ in an anisotropic
bi-Maxwellian magnetized electron-proton plasma is presented. We determine the
conditions for which the weakly amplified LH-handed polarized
Alfven-proton-cyclotron and RH-handed polarized
Alfven-Whistler-electron-cyclotron branches can be excited. The results of our
instability study are applied to the observed solar wind magnetic turbulence.
The Alfvenic instability diagram explains well the main characteristic
properties of the observed solar wind fluctuations. Especially, the observed
confinement limits at small parallel plasma beta values are explained.
