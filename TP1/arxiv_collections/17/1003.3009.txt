We study cosmological constraints on metric f(R) gravity models that are
designed to reproduce the LCDM expansion history with modifications to gravity
described by a supplementary cosmological freedom, the Compton wavelength
parameter B_0. We conduct a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis on the parameter
space, utilizing the geometrical constraints from supernovae distances, the
baryon acoustic oscillation distances, and the Hubble constant, along with all
of the cosmic microwave background data, including the largest scales, its
correlation with galaxies, and a probe of the relation between weak
gravitational lensing and galaxy flows. The strongest constraints, however, are
obtained through the inclusion of data from cluster abundance. Using all of the
data, we infer a bound of B_0<0.0011 at the 95% C.L.
