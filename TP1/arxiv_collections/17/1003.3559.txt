Fundamental thermodynamical concepts and a solid-state point defect elastic
model are used to formulate a diffusivity-density scaling function for viscous
liquids. It is proved in a straightforward manner that the scaling exponent
describing the density scaling of the diffusivity, is related with the pressure
derivative of the isothermal bulk modulus.
