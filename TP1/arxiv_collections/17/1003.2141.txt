We present a general framework for the model-independent decomposition of the
fully differential cross section of the reactions e+e- -> gamma* -> (pi0 pi0
gamma) and e+e- -> gamma* -> (pi0 eta gamma), which can provide important
information on the properties of scalar mesons: f0(600), f0(980) and a0(980).
For the model-dependent ingredients in the differential cross section, an
approach is developed, which relies on Resonance Chiral Theory with vector and
scalar mesons. Numerical results are compared to data. The framework is
convenient for development of a Monte Carlo generator and can also be applied
to the reaction e+e- -> gamma* -> (pi+ pi- gamma).
