We are developing electronic dictionaries and transducers for the automatic
processing of the Albanian Language. We will analyze the words inside a linear
segment of text. We will also study the relationship between units of sense and
units of form. The composition of words takes different forms in Albanian. We
have found that morphemes are frequently concatenated or simply juxtaposed or
contracted. The inflected grammar of NooJ allows constructing the dictionaries
of flexed forms (declensions or conjugations). The diversity of word structures
requires tools to identify words created by simple concatenation, or to treat
contractions. The morphological tools of NooJ allow us to create grammatical
tools to represent and treat these phenomena. But certain problems exceed the
morphological analysis and must be represented by syntactical grammars.
