We investigate the electron transport through a mesoscopic ring side-coupled
with a quantum dot(QD) in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit(SO) interaction. It
is shown that both the Fano resonance and the spin interference effects play
important roles in the electron transport properties. As the QD level is around
the Fermi energy, the total conductance shows typical Fano resonance line
shape. By applying an electrical gate voltage to the QD, the total transmission
through the system can be strongly modulated. By threading the mesoscopic ring
with a magnetic flux, the time-reversal symmetry of the system is broken, and a
spin polarized current can be obtained even though the incident current is
unpolarized.
