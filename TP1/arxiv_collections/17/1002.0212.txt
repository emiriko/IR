Two-photon ionization of Rubidium atoms in a magneto-optical trap and a
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is experimentally investigated. Using 100 ns
laser pulses, we detect single ions photoionized from the condenstate with a
35(10)% efficiency. The measurements are performed using a quartz cell with
external electrodes, allowing large optical access for BECs and optical
lattices.
