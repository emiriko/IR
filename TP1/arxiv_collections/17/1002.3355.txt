We report specific heat measurements on the Fe-based superconductor
BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2, a material on which previous penetration depth, NMR, and
thermal conductivity measurements have observed a high density of low-energy
excitations, which have been interpreted in terms of order parameter nodes.
Within the resolution of our measurements, the low temperature limiting C/T is
found to be linear in field, i.e. we find no evidence for a Volovik effect
associated with nodal quasiparticles in either the clean or dirty limit. We
discuss possible reasons for this apparent contradiction.
