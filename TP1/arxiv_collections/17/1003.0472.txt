Using three-dimensional cosmological simulations, we study the assembly
process of one of the first galaxies, with a total mass of 10^8 M_sun,
collapsing at z = 10. Our main goal is to trace the transport of the heavy
chemical elements produced and dispersed by a pair-instability supernova
exploding in one of the minihalo progenitors. To this extent, we incorporate an
efficient algorithm into our smoothed particle hydrodynamics code which
approximately models turbulent mixing as a diffusion process. We study this
mixing with and without the radiative feedback from Population III stars that
subsequently form in neighboring minihalos. Our simulations allow us to
constrain the initial conditions for second-generation star formation, within
the first galaxy itself, and inside of minihalos that virialize after the
supernova explosion. We find that most minihalos remain unscathed by ionizing
radiation or the supernova remnant, while some are substantially photoheated
and enriched to supercritical levels, likely resulting in the formation of
low-mass Population III or even Population II stars. At the center of the newly
formed galaxy, 10^5 M_sun of cold, dense gas uniformly enriched to 10^-3 Z_sun
are in a state of collapse, suggesting that a cluster of Population II stars
will form. The first galaxies, as may be detected by the James Webb Space
Telescope, would therefore already contain stellar populations familiar from
lower redshifts.
