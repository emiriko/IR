The plasma density enhancements recently observed by the Large-Angle
Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) instrument onboard the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft have sparked considerable interest. In our
previous theoretical study of the formation and initial motion of these density
enhancements it is found that beyond the helmet cusp of a coronal streamer the
magnetized wake configuration is resistively unstable, that a traveling
magnetic island develops at the center of the streamer, and that density
enhancements occur within the magnetic islands. As the massive magnetic island
travels outward, both its speed and width increase. The island passively traces
the acceleration of the inner part of the wake.
  In the present paper a few spherical geometry effects are included, taking
into account either the radial divergence of the magnetic field lines and the
average expansion suffered by a parcel of plasma propagating outward, using the
Expanding Box Model (EBM), and the diamagnetic force due to the overall
magnetic field radial gradients, the so-called melon-seed force. It is found
that the values of the acceleration and density contrasts can be in good
agreement with LASCO observations, provided the spherical divergence of the
magnetic lines starts beyond a critical distance from the Sun and the initial
stage of the formation and acceleration of the plasmoid is due to the cartesian
evolution of MHD instabilities. This result provides a constraint on the
topology of the magnetic field in the coronal streamer.
