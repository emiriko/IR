We give sufficient conditions for some underdetermined elliptic PDE of any
order to construct smooth compactly supported solutions. In particular we show
that two smooth elements in the kernel of certain underdetermined linear
elliptic operators $P$ can be glued in a chosen region in order to obtain a new
smooth solution. This new solution is exactly equal to the starting elements
outside the gluing region. This result completely contrasts with the usual
unique continuation for determined or overdetermined elliptic operators. As a
corollary we obtain compactly supported solutions in the kernel of $P$ and also
solutions vanishing in a chosen relatively compact open region. We apply the
result for natural geometric and physics contexts such as divergence free
fields or TT-tensors.
