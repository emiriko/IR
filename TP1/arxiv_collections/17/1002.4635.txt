The Fermi surface may be usefully viewed as a collection of 1+1 dimensional
chiral conformal field theories. This approach permits straightforward
calculation of many anomalous ground state properties of the Fermi gas
including entanglement entropy and number fluctuations. The 1+1 dimensional
picture also generalizes to finite temperature and the presence of
interactions. Finally, I argue that the low energy entanglement structure of
Fermi liquid theory is universal, depending only on the geometry of the
interacting Fermi surface.
