This paper investigates the five-dimensional(5D) spherically symmetric
gravitational collapse with positive cosmological constant in the presence of
an electromagnetic field. The junction conditions between the 5D non-static
interior and the static exterior spacetimes are derived using the Israel
criteria modified by Santos. We use the energy conditions to discuss solution
to the field equations of the interior spacetime with a charged perfect fluid
for the marginally bound and the non-marginally bound cases. We found that the
range of apparent horizon was larger than that for 4D gravitational collapse
with an electromagnetic field. This analysis gives the irreducible and the
reducible extensions of 4D perfect fluid collapse with an electromagnetic field
and 5D perfect fluid collapse, respectively. Moreover, for the later case, the
results can be recovered under some restrictions.
