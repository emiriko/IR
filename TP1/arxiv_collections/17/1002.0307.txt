We carry out 2-D high resolution numerical simulations of type I planet
migration with different disk viscosities. We find that the planet migration is
strongly dependent on disk viscosities. Two kinds of density wave damping
mechanisms are discussed. Accordingly, the angular momentum transport can be
either viscosity dominated or shock dominated, depending on the disk
viscosities. The long term migration behavior is different as well. Influences
of the Rossby vortex instability on planet migration are also discussed. In
addition, we investigate very weak shock generation in inviscid disks by small
mass planets and compare the results with prior analytic results.
