We present criteria for the Cohen-Macaulayness of a monomial ideal in terms
of its primary decomposition. These criteria allow us to use tools of graph
theory and of linear programming to study the Cohen-Macaulayness of monomial
ideals which are intersections of prime ideal powers. We can characterize the
Cohen-Macaulayness of the second symbolic power or of all symbolic powers of a
Stanley-Reisner ideal in terms of the simplicial complex. These
characterizations show that the simplicial complex must be very compact if some
symbolic power is Cohen-Macaulay. In particular, all symbolic powers are
Cohen-Macaulay if and only if the simplicial complex is a matroid complex. We
also prove that the Cohen-Macaulayness can pass from a symbolic power to
another symbolic powers in different ways.
