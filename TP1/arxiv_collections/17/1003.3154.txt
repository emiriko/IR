We extend the Type I and Type III seesaw mechanisms to generate neutrino
masses within the left-right symmetric theories where parity is spontaneously
broken. We construct a next to minimal left-right symmetric model where
neutrino masses are generated through a variant $double$ seesaw mechanism. In
our model at least one of the triplet fermions and the right handed neutrinos
are at TeV scale and others are heavy. The phenomenological aspects and
testability of the TeV scale particles at collider experiments are discussed.
The decays of heavy fermions leading to leptogenesis are pointed out.
