We propose a model based on the primitive system of the Navier-Stokes
equations in a bidimensional framework as the $l$ - plane approximation, which
allows us to explain the variety of tracks of tropical cyclones (typhoons). Our
idea is to construct special analytical solutions with a linear velocity
profile for the Navier-Stokes systems. The evidence of the structure of linear
velocity near the center of vortex can be proven by the observational data. We
study solutions with the linear-velocity property for both barotropic and
baroclinic cases and show that they follow the same equations in describing the
trajectories of the typhoon eye at the equilibrium state (that relates to the
conservative phase of the typhoon dynamics). Moreover, at the equilibrium
state, the trajectories can be viewed as a superposition of two circular
motions: one has period $2\pi/l,$ the other one has period $2\pi/b_0,$ where
$l$ is the Coriolis parameter and $b_0$ is the height-averaged vorticity at the
center of cyclone.
  Also, we compare our theoretical trajectories based on initial conditions
from the flow with tracks obtained from the observational database. It is worth
to mention that under certain conditions our results are still compatible with
observational data although we did not truly consider the influence of steering
effect. %Note that the %motion of the typhoon eye can not be totally
determinated by initial %conditions due to the effect of ambient pressure field
("steering" %effect). Finally, we propose the parameter-adopting method so that
one could correct the weather prediction in real time. Examples of our analysis
and the use of parameter-adopting method for the historic trajectories are
provided.
