We investigate a driven two-channel system where particles on different lanes
mutually obstruct each others motion extending an earlier model by Popkov and
Peschel [1]. This obstruction may occur in biological contexts due to steric
hinderance where motor proteins carry cargos by `walking' on microtubules.
Similarly, the model serves as a description for classical spin transport where
charged particles with internal states move unidirectionally on a lattice.
Three regimes of qualitatively different behavior are identified depending on
the strength of coupling between the lanes. For small and large coupling
strengths the model can be mapped to a one-channel problem, whereas a new and
rich phase behavior emerges for intermediate ones. We derive an approximate but
quantitatively accurate theoretical description in terms of a one-site cluster
approximation, and obtain insight into the phase behavior through the
current-density relations combined with an extremal-current principle. Our
results are confirmed by stochastic simulations.
