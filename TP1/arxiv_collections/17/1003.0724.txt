A new hydrodynamics code aimed at astrophysical applications has been
developed. The new code and algorithms are presented along with a comprehensive
suite of test problems in one, two, and three dimensions.
  The new code is shown to be robust and accurate, equalling or improving upon
a set of comparison codes. Fyris Alpha will be made freely available to the
scientific community.
