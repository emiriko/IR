Holographic dark energy (HDE), presents a dynamical view of dark energy which
is consistent with the observational data and has a solid theoretical
background. Its definition follows from the entropy-area relation $S(A)$, where
$S$ and $A$ are entropy and area respectively. In the framework of loop quantum
gravity, a modified definition of HDE called "entropy-corrected holographic
dark energy" (ECHDE) has been proposed recently to explain dark energy with the
help of quantum corrections to the entropy-area relation. Using this new
definition, we establish a correspondence between modified variable Chaplygin
gas, new modified Chaplygin gas and the viscous generalized Chaplygin gas with
the entropy corrected holographic dark energy and reconstruct the corresponding
scalar potentials which describe the dynamics of the scalar field.
