The reweighting method is applied to improve the chiral property of
domain-wall fermions. One way to achieve this is to enlarge $L_s$, the size of
fifth dimension, which controls the size of the induced chiral symmetry
breaking. While this is a type of reweighting method for shifting the action
parameter, it seems non-trivial since this reweighting means change of the five
dimensional lattice volume. In this report, we address issues in this direction
of reweighting and evaluate its effectiveness.
