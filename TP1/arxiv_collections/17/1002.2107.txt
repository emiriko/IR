We present a detailed analysis of the H_2 and HD absorption lines detected in
the Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) system at z_abs=2.3377 towards the quasar
Q1232+082. We show that this intervening cloud has a covering factor smaller
than unity and covers only part of the QSO broad emission line region. The zero
flux level has to be corrected at the position of the saturated H_2 and
optically thin HD lines by about 10%. We accurately determine the Doppler
parameter for HD and CI lines (b = 1.86+/-0.20 km/s). We find a ratio
N(HD)/N(H_2)=(7.1 +3.7 -2.2)x10^-5 that is significantly higher than what is
observed in molecular clouds of the Galaxy. Chemical models suggest that in the
physical conditions prevailing in the central part of molecular clouds,
deuterium and hydrogen are mostly in their molecular forms. Assuming this is
true, we derive D/H = (3.6 +1.9 -1.1)x10^-5. This implies that the
corresponding baryon density of the Universe is \Omega_b h^2 = (0.0182 +0.0047
-0.0042). This value coincides within 1\sigma with that derived from
observations of the CMBR as well as from observations of the D/H atomic ratio
in low-metallicity QSO absorption line systems. The observation of HD at high
redshift is therefore a promising independent method to constrain \Omega_b.
This observation indicates as well a low astration factor of deuterium. This
can be interpreted as the consequence of an intense infall of primordial gas
onto the associated galaxy.
