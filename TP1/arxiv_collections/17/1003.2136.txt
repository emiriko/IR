The third US Naval Observatory (USNO) CCD Astrograph Catalog, UCAC3 was
released at the IAU General Assembly on 2009 August 10. It is the first all-sky
release in this series and contains just over 100 million objects, about 95
million of them with proper motions, covering about R = 8 to 16 magnitudes.
Current epoch positions are obtained from the observations with the 20 cm
aperture USNO Astrograph's "red lens", equipped with a 4k by 4k CCD. Proper
motions are derived by combining these observations with over 140 ground- and
space-based catalogs, including Hipparcos/Tycho and the AC2000.2, as well as
unpublished measures of over 5000 plates from other astrographs. For most of
the faint stars in the Southern Hemisphere the Yale/San Juan first epoch plates
from the SPM program (YSJ1) form the basis for proper motions. These data are
supplemented by all-sky Schmidt plate survey astrometry and photometry obtained
from the SuperCOSMOS project, as well as 2MASS near-IR photometry. Major
differences of UCAC3 data as compared to UCAC2 include a completely new raw
data reduction with improved control over systematic errors in positions,
significantly improved photometry, slightly deeper limiting magnitude, coverage
of the north pole region, greater completeness by inclusion of double stars and
weak detections. This of course leads to a catalog which is not as "clean" as
UCAC2 and problem areas are outlined for the user in this paper. The positional
accuracy of stars in UCAC3 is about 15 to 100 mas per coordinate, depending on
magnitude, while the errors in proper motions range from 1 to 10 mas/yr
depending on magnitude and observing history, with a significant improvement
over UCAC2 achieved due to the re-reduced SPM data and inclusion of more
astrograph plate data unavailable at the time of UCAC2.
