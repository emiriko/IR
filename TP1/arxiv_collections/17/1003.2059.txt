Oxygen annealing dramatically improved the superconducting properties of
solid-state-reacted FeTe0.8S0.2, which showed only a broad onset of
superconducting transition just after the synthesis. The zero resistivity
appeared and reached 8.5 K by the oxygen annealing at 200\degree C. The
superconducting volume fraction was also enhanced from 0 to almost 100%. The
lattice constants were compressed by the oxygen annealing, indicating that the
evolution of bulk superconductivity in FeTe0.8S0.2 was correlated to the
shrinkage of lattice.
