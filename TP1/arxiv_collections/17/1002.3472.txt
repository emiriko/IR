We consider cosmological evolution in Brans-Dicke theory with a population of
primordial black holes. Hawking radiation from the primordial black holes
impacts various astrophysical processes during the evolution of the Universe.
The accretion of radiation by the black holes in the radiation dominated era
may be effective in imparting them a longer lifetime. We present a detailed
study of how this affects various standard astrophysical constraints coming
from the evaporation of primordial black holes. We analyze constraints from the
present density of the Universe, the present photon spectrum, the distortion of
the cosmic microwave background spectrum and also from processes affecting
light element abundances after nucleosynthesis. We find that the constraints on
the initial primordial black hole mass fractions are tightened with increased
accretion efficiency.
