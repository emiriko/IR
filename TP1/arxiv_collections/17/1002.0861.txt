In contrast with most Monte Carlo integration algorithms, which are used to
estimate ratios, the replica gas identities recently introduced by Adib enable
the estimation of absolute integrals and partition functions using multiple
copies of a system and normalized transition functions. Here, an optimized form
is presented. After generalizing a replica gas identity with an arbitrary
weighting function, we obtain a functional form that has the minimal asymptotic
variance for samples from two replicas and is provably good for a larger
number. This equation is demonstrated to improve the convergence of partition
function estimates in a 2D Ising model.
