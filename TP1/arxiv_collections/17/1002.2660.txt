In this work, we focus on the fermionic structure of the low-energy
excitations of graphene (a monolayer of carbon atoms) to propose a new
supersymmetric field-theoretic model for this physical system. In the current
literature, other proposals for describing graphene physics have been
contemplated at the level of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Also, by
observing the inhomogeneities between neighbor carbon atoms, Jackiw {\it et
al.} have set up an interesting chiral Abelian gauge theory. We show in this
paper that our formulation encompasses models discussed previously as sectors
of an actually richer (supersymmetric) planar gauge model. Possible
interpretations for the fields involved in the present graphene model are
proposed and the question of supersymmetry breaking is discussed.
