We consider a cavity with a vibrating end mirror and coupled to a
Bose-Einstein condensate. The cavity field mediates the interplay between
mirror and collective oscillations of the atomic density. We study the
implications of this dynamics and the possibility of an indirect diagnostic.
Our predictions can be observed in a realistic setup that is central to the
current quest for mesoscopic quantumness.
