We consider the problem of obtaining locally D-optimal designs for factorial
experiments with qualitative factors at two levels each with binary response.
Our focus is primarily on the 2^2 experiment. In this paper, we derive analytic
results for some special cases and indicate how to handle the general case. The
performance of the uniform design in examined and we show that this design is
highly efficient in general. For the general 2^k case we show that the uniform
design has a maximin property.
