We have synthesized epitaxial NdNiO$_{3}$ ultra-thin films in a
layer-by-layer growth mode under tensile and compressive strain on SrTiO$_{3}$
(001) and LaAlO$_3$ (001), respectively. A combination of X-ray diffraction,
temperature dependent resistivity, and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy has
been applied to elucidate electronic and structural properties of the samples.
In contrast to the bulk NdNiO$_{3}$, the metal-insulator transition under
compressive strain is found to be completely quenched, while the transition
remains under the tensile strain albeit modified from the bulk behavior.
