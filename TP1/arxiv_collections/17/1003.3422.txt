We study the flashing ratchet model of a Brownian motor, which consists in
cyclical switching between the Fokker-Planck equation with an asymmetric
ratchet-like potential and the pure diffusion equation. We show that the motor
really performs unidirectional transport of mass, for proper parameters of the
model, by analyzing the attractor of the problem and the stationary vector of a
related Markov chain.
