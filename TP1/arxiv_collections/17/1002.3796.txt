We report on three key processes involving atomic step motion during the
dewetting of thin solid films: (i) the growth of an isolated island nucleated
far from a hole, (ii) the spreading of a monolayer rim, and (iii) the zipping
of a monolayer island along a straight dewetting front. Kinetic Monte Carlo
results are in good agreement with simple analytical models assuming
diffusion-limited dynamics.
