The next-to-leading order (NLO) evolution of the parton distribution
functions (PDFs) in QCD is a common tool in the lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron
collider data analysis. The standard NLO DGLAP evolution is formulated for
inclusive (integrated) PDFs and done using inclusive NLO kernels. We report
here on the ongoing project, called KRKMC, in which NLO DGLAP evolution is
performed for the exclusive multiparton (fully unintegrated) distributions
(ePDFs) with the help of the exclusive kernels. These kernels are calculated
within the two-parton phase space for the non-singlet evolution, using
Curci-Furmanski-Petronzio factorization scheme. The multiparton distribution,
with multiple use of the exclusive NLO kernels, is implemented in the Monte
Carlo program simulating multi-gluon emission from single quark emitter. High
statistics tests ($\sim 10^{10}$ events) show that the new scheme works
perfectly well in practice and, at the inclusive (integrated) level, is
equivalent with the traditional inclusive NLO DGLAP evolution. Once completed,
this new technique is aimed as a building block for the new more precise NLO
parton shower Monte Carlo, for W/Z production at LHC and for ep scattering, as
well as a starting point for other perturbative QCD based Monte Carlo projects.
