A simplicial polytope is combinatorially rigid if its combinatorial structure
is determined by its graded Betti numbers which are important invariant coming
from combinatorial commutative algebra. We find a necessary condition to be
combinatorially rigid for 3-dimensional reducible simplicial polytopes and
provide some rigid reducible simplicial polytopes.
