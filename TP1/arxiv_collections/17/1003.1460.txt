The existing information retrieval techniques do not consider the context of
the keywords present in the user's queries. Therefore, the search engines
sometimes do not provide sufficient information to the users. New methods based
on the semantics of user keywords must be developed to search in the vast web
space without incurring loss of information. The semantic based information
retrieval techniques need to understand the meaning of the concepts in the user
queries. This will improve the precision-recall of the search results.
Therefore, this approach focuses on the concept based semantic information
retrieval. This work is based on Word sense disambiguation, thesaurus WordNet
and ontology of any domain for retrieving information in order to capture the
context of particular concept(s) and discover semantic relationships between
them.
