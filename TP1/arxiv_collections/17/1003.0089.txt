The new EAS Cherenkov array Tunka-133 with about 1 km**2 geometric acceptance
area is installed in the Tunka Valley (50 km from Lake Baikal). The array
willpermit a detailed study of cosmic ray energy spectrum and mass composition
in the energy range of 10**15 - 10**18 eV with uniform method. The array
consistsof 19 clusters, each composed of 7 optical detectors with 20 cm PMTs.
Since November 2008, the first 12 clusters are in operation, commissioning of
the whole array is planned for September 2009 (At the time of submission of
this paperto electronic arXiv(February 2010) the completed Tunka-133 array is
already taking data). We describe the array construction and DAQ, preliminary
results and plans for the future development: deployment of radio-antennas and
muon detectors network.
