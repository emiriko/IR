Einstein-Cartan theory is formulated in (1+2)-dimensions using the algebra of
exterior differential forms. A Dirac spinor is coupled to gravity and the field
equations are obtained by a variational principle. The space-time torsion is
found to be given algebraically in terms of the Dirac field. Circularly
symmetric, exact solutions that collapse to AdS_3 geometry in the absence of a
Dirac spinor are found.
