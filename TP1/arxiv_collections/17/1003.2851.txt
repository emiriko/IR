This paper investigates the popular card game UNO from the viewpoint of
algorithmic combinatorial game theory. We define simple and concise
mathematical models for the game, including both cooperative and uncooperative
versions, and analyze their computational complexity. In particular, we prove
that even a single-player version of UNO is NP-complete, although some
restricted cases are in P. Surprisingly, we show that the uncooperative
two-player version is also in P.
