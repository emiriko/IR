We report on several features present in the energy spectrum from an ultra
low-noise germanium detector operated at 2,100 m.w.e. By implementing a new
technique able to reject surface events, a number of cosmogenic peaks can be
observed for the first time. We discuss several possible causes for an
irreducible excess of bulk-like events below 3 keVee, including a dark matter
candidate common to the DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation effect, the hint of a
signal in CDMS, and phenomenological predictions. Improved constraints are
placed on a cosmological origin for the DAMA/LIBRA effect.
