Poles of integrale tritronquee are in bijection with cubic oscillators that
admit the simultaneous solutions of two quantization conditions. We show that
the poles lie near the solutions of a pair of Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization
conditions (the Bohr-Sommerfeld-Boutroux system): the distance between a pole
and the corresponding solution of the Bohr-Sommerfeld-Boutroux system vanishes
asymptotically.
