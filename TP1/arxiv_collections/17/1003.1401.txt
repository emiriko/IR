This paper describes visualization of chaotic attractor and elements of the
singularities in 3D space. 3D view of these effects enables to create a
demonstrative projection about relations of chaos generated by physical
circuit, the Chua's circuit. Via macro views on chaotic attractor is obtained
not only visual space illustration of representative point motion in state
space, but also its relation to planes of singularity elements. Our created
program enables view on chaotic attractor both in 2D and 3D space together with
plane objects visualization -- elements of singularities.
