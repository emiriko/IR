The isothermal remanent magnetization is used to investigate dynamical
magnetic properties of spatially three dimensional spin glasses with different
spin dimensionality (Ising, XY, Heisenberg). The isothermal remanent
magnetization is recorded vs. temperature after intermittent application of a
weak magnetic field at a constant temperature $T_h$. We observe that in the
case of the Heisenberg spin glasses, the equilibrated spin structure and the
direction of the excess moment are recovered at $T_h$. The isothermal remanent
magnetization thus reflects the directional character of the
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction present in Heisenberg systems.
