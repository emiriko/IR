The $e-e$, $e-i$, $i-i$ and charge-charge static structure factors are
calculated for alkali and Be$^{2+}$ plasmas using the method described by
Gregori et al. in \cite{bibGreg2006}. The dynamic structure factors for alkali
plasmas are calculated using the method of moments \cite{bibAdam83},
\cite{bibAdam93}. In both methods the screened Hellmann-Gurskii-Krasko
potential, obtained on the basis of Bogolyubov's method, has been used taking
into account not only the quantum-mechanical effects but also the ion structure
\cite{bib73}.
