One-dimensional nanobeam photonic crystal cavities are fabricated in an
Er-doped amorphous silicon nitride layer. Photoluminescence from the cavities
around 1.54 um is studied at cryogenic and room temperatures at different
optical pump powers. The resonators demonstrate Purcell enhanced absorption and
emission rates, also confirmed by time-resolved measurements. Resonances
exhibit linewidth narrowing with pump power, signifying absorption bleaching
and the onset of stimulated emission in the material at both 5.5 K and room
temperature. We estimate from the cavity linewidths that Er has been pumped to
transparency at the cavity resonance wavelength.
