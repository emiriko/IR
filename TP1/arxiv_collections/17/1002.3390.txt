Following the work of Abrikosov and Gor'kov on the pair-breaking effects, one
can derive the temperature dependencies of the electronic specific heat
$C_s/T=\gamma^\prime+\mu T^2$ (with the jump at the superconducting transition
$\Delta C \propto T_c^3$) for materials with zero Fermi surface average of the
order parameter $<\Delta>=0$ (e.g. d-wave) or for those with $<\Delta> \ll
\Delta_{max}$ (e.g., $\pm s$ of iron-pnictides) in the presence of strong
pair-breaking. Moreover, the London penetration depth satisfies
$\lambda^{-2}=\lambda_0^{-2}(1-T^2/T_c^2)$ (or $\lambda -\lambda_0=\beta T^2 $
at low temperatures) and the slope of the upper critical field near $T_c$ is
$H_{c2}^\prime \propto T_c$. Remarkably simple relations between these at first
sight unrelated quantities take place: $\mu \lambda_0^2
T_c^3/|H_{c2}^\prime|=3\phi_0/8\pi^2$ and $\Delta C \beta^2
  T_c^4/|H_{c2,c}^\prime| = \phi_0/16\pi^2 $ are universal constants. The
prediction is checked on two samples of Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_2$As$_2$ and on
CeCoIn$_5$ for which the data needed are available.
