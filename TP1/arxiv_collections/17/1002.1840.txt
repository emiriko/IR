We review the case for light U(1) gauge bosons in the hidden-sector of
heterotic and type II string compactifications, present estimates of the size
of their kinetic mixing with the visible-sector hypercharge U(1), and discuss
their possibly very interesting phenomenological consequences in particle
physics and cosmology.
