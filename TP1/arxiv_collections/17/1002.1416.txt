This is a pedagogical review on primordial non-Gaussianities from inflation
models. We introduce formalisms and techniques that are used to compute such
quantities. We review different mechanisms which can generate observable large
non-Gaussianities during inflation, and distinctive signatures they leave on
the non-Gaussian profiles. They are potentially powerful probes to the dynamics
of inflation. We also provide a non-technical and qualitative summary of the
main results and underlying physics.
