In this paper, we report a new scheme to amplify a microwave signal carried
on a laser light at $\lambda$=852nm. The amplification is done via a
semiconductor tapered amplifier and this scheme is used to drive stimulated
Raman transitions in an atom interferometer. Sideband generation in the
amplifier, due to self-phase and amplitude modulation, is investigated and
characterized. We also demonstrate that the amplifier does not induce any
significant phase-noise on the beating signal. Finally, the degradation of the
performances of the interferometer due to the amplification process is shown to
be negligible.
