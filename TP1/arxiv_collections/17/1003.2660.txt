In this paper we will describe all necessary parts of Brain-Computer
Interface (BCI), such as source of signals, hardware, software, analysis,
architectures of complete system. We also will go along various applications of
BCI, view some subject fields and their specifics. After preface we will
consider the main point of this work-concepts of using BCI in education.
Represented direction of BCI development has not been reported prior. In this
work a computer system, currently being elaborated in author's laboratory, will
be specified. A purpose of it is to determine a degree of clearness of studied
information for certain user according to their indications of brain electrical
signals. On the basis of this information the system is able to find an optimal
approach to interact with each single user. Feedback individualization leads to
learning effectiveness increasing. Stated investigations will be supplemented
by author's analytical reasoning on the nature of thinking process.
