We discuss the implications of the suggested interpretation of the recently
reported narrow pi N resonance (width \approx 25 MeV at 1680 MeV) as a
pentaquark in the same multiplet as the Theta+. We consider a diquark-triquark
pentaquark model involving a recoupling of the five quarks into a
diquark-triquark system in non-standard color representations. We estimate the
mass using a well-tested simple mass formula. Our rough numerical estimate puts
the pi N pentaquark resonance at 1720 MeV, sufficiently close to the reported
value of 1680 MeV to indicate that this approach deserves further more accurate
investigation.
