We report on numerical lattice QCD calculations of some of the low moments of
the nucleon structure functions. The calculations are carried out with gauge
configurations generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations with (2+1)-flavors
of dynamical domain wall fermions and the Iwasaki gauge action ($\beta =
2.13$). The inverse lattice spacing is $a^{-1} = 1.73$ GeV, and two spatial
volumes of ((2.7{\rm fm})^3) and ((1.8 {\rm fm})^3) are used. The up and down
quark masses are varied so the pion mass lies between 0.33 and 0.67 GeV while
the strange mass is about 12 % heavier than the physical one. The structure
function moments we present include fully non-perturbatively renormalized
iso-vector quark momentum fraction, (< x >_{u-d}), helicity fraction, (< x
>_{\Delta u - \Delta d}), and transversity, (< 1 >_{\delta u - \delta d}), as
well as an unrenormalized twist-3 coefficient, (d_1). The ratio of the momentum
to helicity fractions, (< x >_{u-d}/< x >_{\Delta u - \Delta d}), does not show
dependence on the light quark mass and agrees well with the value obtained from
experiment. Their respective absolute values, fully renormalized, show
interesting trends toward their respective experimental values at the lightest
quark mass. A prediction for the transversity, (0.7 < < 1 >_{\delta u -\delta
d} < 1.1), in the (\bar{\rm MS}) scheme at 2 GeV is obtained. The twist-3
coefficient, (d_1), though yet to be renormalized, supports the perturbative
Wandzura-Wilczek relation.
