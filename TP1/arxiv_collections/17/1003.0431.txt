The timed automata formalism is an important model for specifying and
analysing real-time systems. Robustness is the correctness of the model in the
presence of small drifts on clocks or imprecision in testing guards. A symbolic
algorithm for the analysis of the robustness of timed automata has been
implemented. In this paper, we re-analyse an industrial case lip
synchronization protocol using the new robust reachability algorithm. This lip
synchronization protocol is an interesting case because timing aspects are
crucial for the correctness of the protocol. Several versions of the model are
considered: with an ideal video stream, with anchored jitter, and with
non-anchored jitter.
