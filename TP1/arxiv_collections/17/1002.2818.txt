Recently Verlinde has suggested a new approach to gravity which interprets
gravitational interaction as a kind of entropic force. The new approach uses
the holographic principle by stating that the information is kept on the
holographic screens which coincide with equipotential surfaces. Motivated by
this new interpretation of gravity (but not being limited by it) we study
equipotential surfaces, the Unruh-Verlinde temperature, energy and acceleration
for various static space-times: generic spherically symmetric solutions,
axially symmetric black holes immersed in a magnetic field, traversable
spherically symmetric wormholes of an arbitrary shape function, system of two
and more extremely charged black holes in equilibrium. In particular, we have
shown that the Unruh-Verlinde temperature of the holographic screen reaches
absolute zero on the wormhole throat independently of the particular form of
the wormhole solution.
