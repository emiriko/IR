In this note we prove an existence and uniqueness result for the solution of
multidimensional stochastic delay differential equations with normal
reflection. The equations are driven by a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst
parameter $H>1/2$. The stochastic integral with respect to the fractional
Brownian motion is a pathwise Riemann--Stieltjes integral.
