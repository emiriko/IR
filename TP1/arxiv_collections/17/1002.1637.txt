We compare chemical solution deposition (CSD), and pulsed-laser-deposition
(PLD), specimens of the new room-temperature, single-phase, multiferroic
magnetoelectric, [PbFe2/3W1/3O3]x[PbZr0.53Ti0.47O3]1-x (PZTFWx ~ 0.40<x<0.20)
with polarization, loss (<1%), and resistivity (typically 108 ohm.cm) equal to
or superior to BiFeO3. Single phase polycrystalline multiferroics PZTFWx thin
films were fabricated on platinized silicon substrate by CSD and as epitaxial
single-crystal films on MgO substrate by PLD. High dielectric constants (1200-
3000), high polarization (30 - 60 micro C/cm2), weak saturation magnetization
(0.48 - 4.53 emu/cm3), a broad dielectric temperature peak, high-frequency
dispersion, low dielectric loss and low leakage current were observed in these
materials, suggesting the family as candidates for room-temperature
multiferroic devices. The ferroelectric switching in these materials can be
suppressed or quenched with applied magnetic field.
