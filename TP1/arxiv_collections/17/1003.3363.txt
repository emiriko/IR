Combined results are presented on the search for a neutral Higgs boson in the
di-tau final state using 1.8fb-1 and 2.2fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected
at the CDF and D0 experiments respectively. Data were collected in ppbar
collisions at a centre of mass energy of 1.96TeV during RunII of the Tevatron.
Limits are set on the cross section times branching ratio ranging from 13.6pb
to 0.653pb for Higgs masses from 90GeV to 200GeV respectively. The results are
then interpreted as limits in four different benchmark scenarios within the
framework of the MSSM.
