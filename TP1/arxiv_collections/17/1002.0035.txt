We exhibit the rich structure of the set of correlated equilibria by
analyzing the simplest of polynomial games: the mixed extension of matching
pennies. We show that while the correlated equilibrium set is convex and
compact, the structure of its extreme points can be quite complicated. In
finite games the ratio of extreme correlated to extreme Nash equilibria can be
greater than exponential in the size of the strategy spaces. In polynomial
games there can exist extreme correlated equilibria which are not finitely
supported; we construct a large family of examples using techniques from
ergodic theory. We show that in general the set of correlated equilibrium
distributions of a polynomial game cannot be described by conditions on
finitely many moments (means, covariances, etc.), in marked contrast to the set
of Nash equilibria which is always expressible in terms of finitely many
moments.
