Polycrystalline samples with a nominal composition of NdFe1-xRhxAsO (0 <= x
<= 0.25) were synthesized using a solid state reaction method. Bulk
superconductivity with a maximum Tc = 13 K is observed in the x = 0.1 sample. A
temperature-composition phase diagram is established for the NdFe1-xRhxAsO
system based on the electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements. A
first-order-like transition from an antiferromagnetic state to the
superconducting state at a critical Rh-doping point xc = 0.045 is observed in
the present phase diagram. The value for the upper critical field Hc2(0) is
estimated to be about 26 T for the x = 0.10 sample by using the WHH theory.
