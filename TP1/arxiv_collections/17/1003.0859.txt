Many mesh refinement simulations currently performed in numerical relativity
counteract instabilities near the outer boundary of the simulation domain
either by changes to the mesh refinement scheme or by changes to the gauge
condition. We point out that the BSSN Gamma Driver gauge condition introduces a
time step size limitation in a similar manner as a CFL condition, but which is
independent of the spatial resolution. We give a didactic explanation of this
issue, show why especially mesh refinement simulations suffer from it, and
point to a simple remedy.
