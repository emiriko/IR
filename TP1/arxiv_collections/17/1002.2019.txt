We investigate an intra-cavity coupled down-conversion scheme to generate
quadripartite entanglement using concurrently resonant nonlinearities. We
verify that quadripartite entanglement is present in this system by calculating
the output fluctuation spectra and then considering violations of optimized
inequalities of the van Loock-Furusawa type. The entanglement characteristics
both above and below the oscillation threshold are considered. We also present
analytic solutions for the quadrature operators and the van Loock-Furusawa
correlations in the undepleted pump approximation.
