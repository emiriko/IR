We describe a Monte Carlo scheme for the grand canonical simulation study of
fluid phase equilibria in highly size-asymmetrical binary mixtures. The method
utilizes an expanded ensemble in which the insertion and deletion of large
particles is accomplished {\em gradually} by traversing a series of states in
which a large particle interacts only partially with the environment of small
particles. Free energy barriers arising from interfacial coexistence states are
surmounted with the aid of multicanonical preweighting, the associated weights
being determined from the transition matrix. As an illustration, we present
results for the liquid-vapour coexistence properties of a Lennard-Jones binary
mixture having a 10:1 size ratio.
