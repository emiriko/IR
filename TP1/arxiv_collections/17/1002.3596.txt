A model using wake oscillators is developed to predict the 2D motion in a
transverse plan of two rigid cylinders in tandem arrangement. This model of the
wake dynamics is validated with experimental data from previous trials which
took place at the Ifremer flume tank in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. The agreement
between the model and the experimental results allows using this model as a
simple computational tool in the prediction of 2D Vortex-Induced Vibrations
(VIV) and, after some futher developments, Wake-Induced Oscillations (WIO)
effects.
