Security of any software can be enhanced manifolds if multiple factors for
authorization and authentication are used .The main aim of this work was to
design and implement an Academy Automation Software for IPS Academy which uses
OpenID and Windows CardSpace as Authentication Techniques in addition to Role
Based Authentication (RBA) System to ensure that only authentic users can
access the predefined roles as per their Authorization level. The Automation
covers different computing hardware and software that can be used to digitally
create, manipulate, collect, store, and relay Academy information needed for
accomplishing basic Operation like admissions and registration, student and
faculty interaction, online library, medical and business development. Raw data
storage, electronic transfer, and the management of electronic business
information comprise the basic activities of the Academy automation system.
Further Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol has been implemented to provide
security and data integrity for communications over networks. TLS encrypts the
segments of network connections at the Transport
