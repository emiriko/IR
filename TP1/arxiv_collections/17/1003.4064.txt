Parallel computing plays a major role in almost all the fields from research
to major concern problem solving purposes. Many researches are till now
focusing towards the area of parallel processing. Nowadays it extends its usage
towards the end user application such as GPU as well as multi-core processor
development. The bandwidth measurement is essential for resource management and
for studying the various performance factors of the existing super computer
systems which will be helpful for better system utilization since super
computers are very few and their resources should be properly utilized. In this
paper the real workload trace of one of the super computers LANL is taken and
shown how the bandwidth is estimated with the given parameters.
