Huffman coding is often presented as the optimal solution to Twenty
Questions. However, a caveat is that Twenty Questions games always end with a
reply of "Yes," whereas Huffman codewords need not obey this constraint. We
bring resolution to this issue, and prove that the average number of questions
still lies between H(X) and H(X)+1.
