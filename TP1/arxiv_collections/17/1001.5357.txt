Using an associated branching process as the basis of our approximation, we
show that typical inter-point distances in a multitype random intersection
graph have a defective distribution, which is well described by a mixture of
translated and scaled Gumbel distributions, the missing mass corresponding to
the event that the vertices are not in the same component of the graph.
