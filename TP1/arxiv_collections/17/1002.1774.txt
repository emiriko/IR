The paper presents the position analysis of a spatial structure composed of
two platforms mutually connected by one RRP and three SS serial kinematic
chains, where R, P, and S stand for revolute, prismatic, and spherical
kinematic pair respectively. A set of three compatibility equations is laid
down that, following algebraic elimination, results in a 28th-order univariate
algebraic equation, which in turn provides the addressed problem with 28
solutions in the complex domain. Among the applications of the results
presented in this paper is the solution to the forward kinematics of the
Tricept, a well-known in-parallel-actuated spatial manipulator. Numerical
examples show adoption of the proposed method in dealing with two case studies.
