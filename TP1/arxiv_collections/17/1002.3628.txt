First LHC data have been collected and collisions at a center-of-mass energy
of 7 TeV are anticipated for the next months. The commissioning of the
detectors and the re-establishment of the Standard Model in the new energy
regime will be the main tasks for the experimental collaborations in the year
to come. This report summarizes the measurement plans and performance
expectations of the ATLAS and CMS experiments for a selected number of QCD and
electroweak analyses with an emphasis on the early data taking phase. Some
longer term prospects are pointed out.
