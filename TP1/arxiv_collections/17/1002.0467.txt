Let C be a soluble smooth genus one curve over a Henselian discrete valuation
field. There is a unique minimal Weierstrass equation defining C up to
isomorphism. In this paper we consider genus one equations of degree n defining
C, namely a (generalised) binary quartic when n = 2, a ternary cubic when n =
3, and a pair of quaternary quadrics when n = 4. In general, minimal genus one
equations of degree n are not unique up to isomorphism. We explain how the
number of minimal genus one equations of degree n varies according to the
Kodaira symbol of the Jacobian of C. Then we count these equations up to
isomorphism over a number field of class number 1.
