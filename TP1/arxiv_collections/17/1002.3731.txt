The observation of a stable doublet pattern in the field-emission electron
microscopy of a linear atomic chain requires a stable mechanism breaking the
axial symmetry, which is not identified correctly by Mikhailovskij et al.
[Phys. Rev. B 80, 165404 (2009)]. Using microscopic calculations, we attribute
the observed pattern to the symmetry breaking produced by the ligand where the
chain is attached, plus carbon pi-bonding alternation.
