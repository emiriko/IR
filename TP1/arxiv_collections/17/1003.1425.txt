We demonstrate with a fully quantum-mechanical approach that graphene can
function as gate-controllable transistors for pumped spin currents, i.e., a
stream of angular momentum induced by the precession of adjacent
magnetizations, which exists in the absence of net charge currents.
Furthermore, we propose as a proof of concept how these spin currents can be
modulated by an electrostatic gate. Because our proposal involves nano-sized
systems that function with very high speeds and in the absence of any applied
bias, it is potentially useful for the development of transistors capable of
combining large processing speeds, enhanced integration and extremely low power
consumption.
