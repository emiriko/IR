Software design in Software Engineering is a critical and dynamic cognitive
process. Accurate and flawless system design will lead to fast coding and early
completion of a software project. Blooms taxonomy classifies cognitive domain
into six dynamic levels such as Knowledge at base level to Comprehension,
Application, Analysis, Synthesis and Evaluation at the highest level in the
order of increasing complexity. A case study indicated in this paper is a gira
system, which is a gprs based Intranet Remote Administration which monitors and
controls the intranet from a mobile device. This paper investigates from this
case study that the System Design stage in Software Engineering uses all the
six levels of Blooms Taxonomy. The application of the highest levels of Blooms
Taxonomy such as Synthesis and Evaluation in the design of gira indicates that
Software Design in Software Development Life Cycle is a complex and critical
cognitive process.
