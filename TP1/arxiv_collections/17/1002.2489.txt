Burgers vortices are explicit stationary solutions of the Navier-Stokes
equations which are often used to describe the vortex tubes observed in
numerical simulations of three-dimensional turbulence. In this model, the
velocity field is a two-dimensional perturbation of a linear straining flow
with axial symmetry. The only free parameter is the Reynolds number $Re =
\Gamma/\nu$, where $\Gamma$ is the total circulation of the vortex and $\nu$ is
the kinematic viscosity. The purpose of this paper is to show that Burgers
vortex is asymptotically stable with respect to general three-dimensional
perturbations, for all values of the Reynolds number. This definitive result
subsumes earlier studies by various authors, which were either restricted to
small Reynolds numbers or to two-dimensional perturbations. Our proof relies on
the crucial observation that the linearized operator at Burgers vortex has a
simple and very specific dependence upon the axial variable. This allows to
reduce the full linearized equations to a vectorial two-dimensional problem,
which can be treated using an extension of the techniques developped in earlier
works. Although Burgers vortices are found to be stable for all Reynolds
numbers, the proof indicates that perturbations may undergo an important
transient amplification if $Re$ is large, a phenomenon that was indeed observed
in numerical simulations.
