We argue that the ratio of $\phi$ mesons multiplicity over cube of the mean
$p_T$ is proportional to the degeneracy of the medium produced in
ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The ratio extracted from the existing
$\phi$ meson data in the energy range $\sqrt{s}$=6.3-200 GeV, indicate that
beyond a threshold energy $\sqrt{s}_{th}=15.74\pm 8.10$ GeV, the medium crosses
over from a confined phase to a deconfined phase.
