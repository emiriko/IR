Previous results from the authors concerning the arising a tiny photon
anomalous paramagnetic moment $\mu_{\gamma}$ due to its interaction with a
magnetized virtual electron-positron background are complemented and discussed.
It is argued that such magnetic moment it cannot be a linear function of the
angular momentum and that there is no room for the existence of an hypothetical
perpendicular component, as recently claimed in the literature. It is discussed
that in the region beyond the first threshold, where photons may decay in
electron-positron pairs, the photon magnetic moment cannot be defined
independently of the magnetic moment of the created pairs. It is shown that for
magnetic fields large enough, the vacuum becomes unstable and decays also in
electron-positron pairs.
