As more and more service providers choose Cloud platforms, a resource
provider needs to provision resources and supporting runtime environments (REs)
for heterogeneous workloads in different scenarios. Previous work fails to
resolve this issue in several ways: (1) it fails to pay attention to diverse RE
requirements, and does not enable creating coordinated REs on demand; (2) few
work investigates coordinated resource provisioning for heterogeneous
workloads. In this paper, our contributions are three-fold: (1) we present an
RE agreement that expresses diverse RE requirements, and build an innovative
system PhoenixCloud that enables a resource provider to create REs on demand
according to RE agreements; (2) we propose two coordinated resource
provisioning solutions for heterogeneous workloads in two typical Cloud
scenarios: first, a large organization operates a private Cloud for two
heterogeneous workloads; second, a large organization or two service providers
running heterogeneous workloads revert to a public Cloud; and (3) A
comprehensive evaluation has been performed in experiments. For typical
workload traces of parallel batch jobs and Web services, our experiments show
that: a) In the first Cloud scenario, when the throughput is almost same like
that of a dedicated cluster system, our solution decreases the configuration
size of cluster by about 40%; b) in the second scenario, our solution decreases
not only the total resource consumption, but also the peak resource consumption
maximally to 31% with respect to that of EC2 + RightScale solution.
