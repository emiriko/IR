Molecular dynamics computer simulation has been used to compute the
self-diffusion coefficient, and shear viscosity of soft-sphere fluids, in which
the particles interact through the soft-sphere or inverse power pair potential.
The calculations have been made along the melting line in a wide range of
pressures and temperatures. The validity of scaling relations for thermodynamic
parameters and kinetic coefficients was checked. It was shown that the
Stokes-Einstein relationship is obeyed if the Barker diameter is used as a
characteristic length scale. It was also shown that the viscosity is
non-monotonic along the isochores as predicted by Ya. Rosenfeld. It was shown
that the viscosity is strongly growing along the melting line, however, this
increase does not stimulate the glass transition because the relaxation time is
decreasing.
