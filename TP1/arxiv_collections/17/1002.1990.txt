Laser based photoemission with photons of energy 6 eV is used to examine the
fine details of the very low energy electron dispersion and associated dynamics
in the nodal region of optimally doped Bi2212. A "kink" in the dispersion in
the immediate vicinity of the Fermi energy is associated with scattering from
an optical phonon previously identified in Raman studies. The identification of
this phonon as the appropriate mode is confirmed by comparing the scattering
rates observed experimentally with the results of calculated scattering rates
based on the properties of the phonon mode.
