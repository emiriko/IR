This Paper deals design and simulation of electrostatically actuated clamped
clamped beam and cantilever beam using finite element analysis method (FEM). A
detailed study and performance analysis for various bias voltages is provided
in this paper. The pull in voltages for different dimensions of the beams and
the natural or the dominant modes and the corresponding eigenvalues have been
studied for different bias voltages. The displacement of the beam is also
studied for various dimensions of the beam. The results were obtained for the
length and the width of both clamped clamped beam and cantilever beam through
extensive simulations. The results obtained shows that pull in voltages varies
from 2348V to 772V and the natural frequencies vary from 102.92 KHz to 916.35
KHz.
