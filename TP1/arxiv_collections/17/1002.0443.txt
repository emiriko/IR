In deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) it is found that in some
kinematics angular momentum is not conserved if the amplitudes are calculated
in terms of widely used reduced operators. Consequently, those kinematics will
lead to the wrong analysis of experimental data in terms of generalized parton
distributions. Contrary to common lore, the contribution of the longitudinally
polarized virtual photon should not be neglected in the analysis of DVCS
amplitudes.
