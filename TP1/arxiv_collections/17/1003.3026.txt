This work summarises some of the attempts to explain the phenomenon of dark
energy as an effective description of complex gravitational physics and the
proper interpretation of observations. Cosmological backreaction has been shown
to be relevant for observational (precision) cosmology, nevertheless no
convincing explanation of dark energy by means of backreaction has been given
so far.
