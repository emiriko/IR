High-resolution and high-flux neutron as well as X-ray powder-diffraction
experiments were performed on the oxypnictide series LaO(1-x)FxFeAs with
0<x<0.15 in order to study the crystal and magnetic structure. The magnetic
symmetry of the undoped compound corresponds to those reported for ReOFeAs
(with Re a rare earth) and for AFe2As2 (A=Ba, Sr) materials. We find an ordered
magnetic moment of 0.63(1)muB at 2 K in LaOFeAs, which is significantly larger
than the values previously reported for this compound. A sizable ordered
magnetic moment is observed up to a F-doping of 4.5% whereas there is no
magnetic order for a sample with a F concentration of x=0.06. In the undoped
sample, several interatomic distances and FeAs4 tetrahedra angles exhibit
pronounced anomalies connected with the broad structural transition and with
the onset of magnetism supporting the idea of strong magneto-elastic coupling
in this material.
