Voice over IP (VoIP) is unquestionably the most popular real-time service in
IP networks today. Recent studies have shown that it is also a suitable carrier
for information hiding. Hidden communication may pose security concerns as it
can lead to confidential information leakage. In VoIP, RTP (Real-time Transport
Protocol) in particular, which provides the means for the successful transport
of voice packets through IP networks, is suitable for steganographic purposes.
It is characterised by a high packet rate compared to other protocols used in
IP telephony, resulting in a potentially high steganographic bandwidth. The
modification of an RTP packet stream provides many opportunities for hidden
communication as the packets may be delayed, reordered or intentionally lost.
In this paper, to enable the detection of steganographic exchanges in VoIP, we
examined real RTP traffic traces to answer the questions, what do the "normal"
delays in RTP packet streams look like? and, is it possible to detect the use
of known RTP steganographic methods based on this knowledge?
