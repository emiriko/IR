We study the full counting statistics of charge transport through a quantum
dot tunnel-coupled to one normal and one superconducting lead with a large
superconducting gap. As function of the level detuning, there is a crossover
from a regime with strong superconducting correlations in the quantum dot to a
regime in which the proximity effect on the quantum dot is suppressed. We
analyze the current fluctuations of this crossover in the shot-noise regime. In
particular, we predict that the full counting statistics changes from
Poissonian with charge 2e, typical for Cooper pairs, to Poissonian with charge
e, when the superconducting proximity effect is present. Thus, the onset of the
superconducting proximity effect is revealed by the reduction of the Fano
factor from 2 to 1.
