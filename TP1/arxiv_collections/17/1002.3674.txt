We report the detection and measurement of the absolute brightness and
spatial fluctuations of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) with the AKARI
satellite. We have carried out observations at 65, 90, 140 and 160 um as a
cosmological survey in AKARI Deep Field South (ADF-S), which is one of the
lowest cirrus regions with contiguous area on the sky. After removing bright
galaxies and subtracting zodiacal and Galactic foregrounds from the measured
sky brightness, we have successfully measured the CIB brightness and its
fluctuations across a wide range of angular scales from arcminutes to degrees.
The measured CIB brightness is consistent with previous results reported from
COBE data but significantly higher than the lower limits at 70 and 160 um
obtained with the Spitzer satellite from the stacking analysis of 24-um
selected sources. The discrepancy with the Spitzer result is possibly due to a
new galaxy population at high redshift obscured by hot dust. From power
spectrum analysis at 90 um, three components are identified: shot noise due to
individual galaxies; Galactic cirrus emission dominating at the largest angular
scales of a few degrees; and an additional component at an intermediate angular
scale of 10-30 arcminutes, possibly due to galaxy clustering. The spectral
shape of the clustering component at 90 um is very similar to that at longer
wavelengths as observed by Spitzer and BLAST. Moreover, the color of the
fluctuations indicates that the clustering component is as red as
Ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at high redshift, These galaxies are
not likely to be the majority of the CIB emission at 90 um, but responsible for
the clustering component. Our results provide new constraints on the evolution
and clustering properties of distant infrared galaxies.
