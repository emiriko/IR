This article presents some qualitative results for entire solutions of the
fully nonlinear elliptic equations of Allen Cahn type . Precisely under some
additional assumptions on the forcing term, if the solution is bounded and
converges uniformly at infinity in a fixed direction to its extrema, then the
solution depends only on one variable.
