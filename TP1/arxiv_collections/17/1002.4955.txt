The exclusive ability of acoustic waves to probe the structural, mechanical
and fluidic properties of foams may offer novel approaches to characterise the
porous scaffolds employed in tissue engineering. Motivated by this we conduct a
preliminary investigation into the acoustic properties of a typical biopolymer
and the feasibility of acoustic propagation within a foam scaffold thereof.
Focussing on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), we use a pulse-echo method to
determine the longitudinal speed of sound, whose temperature-dependence reveals
the glass transition of the polymer. Finally, we demonstrate the first
topographic and tomographic acoustic images of polymer foam tissue scaffolds.
