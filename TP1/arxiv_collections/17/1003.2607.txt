We have performed an experimental characterization of the dynamics of
oscillating quartz tuning forks which are being increasingly used in scanning
probe microscopy as force sensors. We show that tuning forks can be described
as a system of coupled oscillators. Nevertheless, this description requires the
knowledge of the elastic coupling constant between the prongs of the tuning
fork, which has not yet been measured. Therefore tuning forks have been usually
described within the single oscillator or the weakly coupled oscillators
approximation that neglects the coupling between the prongs. We propose three
different procedures to measure the elastic coupling constant: an
opto-mechanical method, a variation of the Cleveland method and a thermal noise
based method. We find that the coupling between the quartz tuning fork prongs
has a strong influence on the dynamics and the measured motion is in remarkable
agreement with a simple model of coupled harmonic oscillators. The precise
determination of the elastic coupling between the prongs of a tuning fork
allows to obtain a quantitative relation between the resonance frequency shift
and the force gradient acting at the free end of a tuning fork prong.
