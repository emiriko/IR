We consider a simplest extension of the Standard Model (SM) through the
incorporation of a real scalar singlet and an additional discrete $Z_2$
symmetry. The model admits the neutral scalar singlet to be stable and thus, a
viable component of dark matter. We explore the parameter space of the model
keeping in view the constraints arise from different dark matter direct
detection experiments through WIMP-nucleon scattering. First of all, we have
utilised the data obtained from CDMS, XENON-10 and XENON-100 collaborations. We
further constraint the parameter space from the DAMA collaboration results
(both with and without channelling) and CoGeNT collaboration results.
Throughout our analysis, the constraint arises due to the observed relic
density of dark matter reported by WMAP experiment, is also incorporated.
Utilising all those constraints, on the model parameter space, we calculate the
event rates and the annual variation of event rates in the context of a Liquid
Argon Detector experiment.
