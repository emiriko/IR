We present an analysis of the baryon-octet and -decuplet masses using
covariant SU(3)-flavor chiral perturbation theory up to next-to-leading order.
Besides the description of the physical masses we address the problem of the
lattice QCD extrapolation. Using the PACS-CS collaboration data we show that a
good description of the lattice points can be achieved at next-to-leading order
with the covariant loop amplitudes and phenomenologically determined values for
the meson-baryon couplings. Moreover, the extrapolation to the physical point
up to this order is found to be better than the linear one given at
leading-order by the Gell-Mann-Okubo approach. The importance that a reliable
combination of lattice QCD and chiral perturbation theory may have for hadron
phenomenology is emphasized with the prediction of the pion-baryon and
strange-baryon sigma terms.
