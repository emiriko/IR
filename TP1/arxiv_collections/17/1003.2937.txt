We report an NMR and magnetometry study on the expanded intercalated
fulleride Cs_3C_60 in both its A15 and face centered cubic structures. NMR
allowed us to evidence that both exhibit a first-order Mott transition to a
superconducting (SC) state, occuring at distinct critical pressures p_c and
temperatures T_c. Though the ground state magnetism of the Mott phases differs,
their high $T$ paramagnetic and SC properties are found similar, and the phase
diagrams versus unit volume per C_60 are superimposed. Thus, as expected for a
strongly correlated system, the inter-ball distance is the relvevant parameter
driving the electronic behavior and quantum transitions of these systems.
