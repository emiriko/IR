Pulsars are known to be efficient accelerators that produce copious amounts
of relativistic particles and inject them into the Galactic medium. The
radiation emitted by such a pulsar wind can be seen from radio through
gamma-rays as a pulsar-wind nebula (PWN). Here we overview and summarize recent
progress in X-ray and TeV observations of PWNe.
