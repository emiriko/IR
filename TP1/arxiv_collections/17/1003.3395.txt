We consider dimensional reduction techniques for the Liouville-von Neumann
equation for the evaluation of the expectation values in a mixed quantum
system. In applications such as nuclear spin dynamics the main goal for
simulations is being able to simulate a system with as many spins as possible,
for this reason it is very important to have an efficient method that scales
well with respect to particle numbers. We describe several existing methods
that have appeared in the literature, pointing out their limitations
particularly in the setting of large systems. We introduce a method for direct
computation of expectations via Chebyshev polynomials (DEC) based on evaluation
of a trace formula combined with expansion in modified Chebyshev polynomials.
This reduction is highly efficient and does not destroy any information. We
demonstrate the practical application of the scheme for a nuclear spin system
and compare with several alternatives, focusing on the performance of the
various methods with increasing system dimension. Our method may be applied to
autonomous quantum problems where the desired outcome of quantum simulation,
rather than being a full description of the system dynamics, is only the
expectation value of some given observable.
