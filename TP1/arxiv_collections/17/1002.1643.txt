High resolution observations in the region of the lines Halpha, He II 4686
and Hgamma of the spectrum of the symbiotic binary Z And were performed during
its small-amplitude brightening at the end of 2002. The profiles of the
hydrogen lines were double-peaked. These profiles give a reason to suppose that
the lines can be emitted mainly by an optically thin accretion disc. The Halpha
line is strongly contaminated by the emission of the envelope, therefore for
consideration of accretion disc properties we use the Hgamma line. The Halpha
line had broad wings which are supposed to be determined mostly from radiation
damping but high velocity stellar wind from the compact object in the system
can also contribute to their appearance. The Hgamma line had a broad emission
component which is assumed to be emitted mainly from the inner part of the
accretion disc. The line He II 4686 had a broad emission component too, but it
is supposed to appear in a region of a high velocity stellar wind. The outer
radius of the accretion disc can be calculated from the shift between the
peaks. Assuming, that the orbit inclination can ranges from 47$^\circ$ to
76$^\circ$, we estimate the outer radius as 20 - 50 R_sun. The behaviour of the
observed lines can be considered in the framework of the model proposed for
interpretation of the line spectrum during the major 2000 - 2002 brightening of
this binary.
