Biaxially textured LuNi2BC thin films with Tc up to 15.8 K and a residual
resistivity ratio up to 15 have been prepared. The films were deposited on
MgO(110) substrates using pulsed laser deposition from a stoichiometric target.
Via the precise control of the deposition rate, a biaxial texture is favored
within a broad range of the deposition temperature. The full epitaxial
relationship between the borocarbide film, the \luo interface layer and the
substrate is (110)[001]MgO II (110)[001]Lu2O3 II (001)[100]LuNi2B2C. A very
sharp in--plane alignment of about 1\textdegree and an out--of--plane order of
about 2.5\textdegree was achieved in the \luni layer. However, a systematic
study using different deposition temperatures shows that the temperature is
crucial for phase formation and appealing superconducting properties. Applying
optimized deposition conditions, critical temperatures of up to 15.8 K and
steep superconducting transitions of about 0.3 K are reproducibly obtained. We
further analyzed the upper critical field Hc2 of one film deposited under
optimized conditions. It was resistively measured along the [001] direction and
fitted with a power law. The value of Hc2(0) = 9.82 T obtained from that fit is
in very good agreement with single crystal data and the power exponent
describing the positive curvature for small external magnetic fields of about
0.19 indicates a relatively low intraband scattering in the films.
