In this paper, effective factors for success of Microlensing and Radial
Velocity methods were choose. A semi-Delphi process applied on the factors to
evaluating them and finding the most important factors for present situation of
ML and RV, with help from about 100 experts, in or related exoplanets
detection. I found the public definition on "success of exoplanets detection
methods" is not correct and we should change it, as some experts did it, in the
form of fundamental questions in planetary science. Also, the views of "Special
Experts" are different from other experts that help us to choose the right way
in evaluating. The next step was choosing the best strategy for future and
finally, from SWOT landscape and with a new objective of ML method (New Game
Board Strategy) I suggested four critical future strategies for completing
current strategic directions.
