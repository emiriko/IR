We present the dynamical origin of the P11 nucleon resonances resulting from
a dynamical coupled-channels (DCC) analysis of meson production reactions off a
nucleon target, which is conducted at Excited Baryon Analysis Center (EBAC) of
Jefferson Lab. Two resonance poles are found in the energy region where the
Roper resonance P11(1440) was identified. Furthermore, the two resonance poles
and the next higher resonance pole corresponding to P11(1710) are found to
originate from a single bare state.
