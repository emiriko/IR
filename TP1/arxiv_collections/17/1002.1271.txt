We study the strange and non-strange quark mass dependence of the parameters
of the f_0(600), kappa(800), rho(770) and K*(892) resonances generated from
elastic meson-meson scattering using unitarized one-loop Chiral Perturbation
Theory. We fit simultaneously all experimental scattering data up to 0.8-1 GeV
together with lattice results on decay constants and scattering lengths up to a
pion mass of 440 MeV. Then, the strange and non-strange quark masses are varied
from the chiral limit up to values of interest for lattice studies. In these
amplitudes, the mass and width of the rho(770) and K*(892) present a similar
and smooth quark mass dependence. In contrast, both scalars present a similar
non-analyticity at high quark masses. Nevertheless the f_0(600) dependence on
both quark masses is stronger than for the kappa(800) and the vectors. We also
confirm the lattice assumption of quark mass independence of the vector
two-meson coupling that, in contrast, is violated for scalars.
