A general method for focusing of waves, based on phase and amplitude
compensation, is applied to monochromatic, polychromatic and diffusive waves.
Monochromatic waves may form spatially localized waves in free space, whereas
polychromatic waves form non-decaying traveling evanescent modes conned to
subwavelength regions in media where the frequency depends on the wave vector.
We suggest an analogy between the phase compensation method and the
transformation of frequencies between inertial, relativistic coordinate
systems.
