$^{19}$F NMR measurements in SmFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$, for $0.15\leq x\leq 0.2$,
are presented. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ increases upon
cooling with a trend analogous to the one already observed in
CeCu$_{5.2}$Au$_{0.8}$, a quasi two-dimensional heavy-fermion intermetallic
compound with an antiferromagnetic ground-state. In particular, the behaviour
of the relaxation rate either in SmFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ or in
CeCu$_{5.2}$Au$_{0.8}$ can be described in the framework of the self-consistent
renormalization theory for weakly itinerant electron systems. Remarkably, no
effect of the superconducting transition on $^{19}$F $1/T_1$ is detected, a
phenomenon which can hardly be explained within a single band model.
