We present here the first results from a high-resolution survey of the
12CO(J=1-0) emission across the northern part of the poorly-enriched Small
Magellanic Cloud, made with the ATNF Mopra telescope. Three molecular complexes
detected in the lower resolution NANTEN survey are mapped with a beam FWHM of
~42'', to sensitivities of approximately 210 mK per 0.9 km/s channel, resolving
each complex into 4-7 small clouds of masses in the range of Mvir~10^3-4 Msol
and with radii no larger than 16 pc.
  The northern SMC CO clouds follow similar empirical relationships to the
southern SMC population, yet they appear relatively under-luminous for their
size, suggesting that the star-forming environment in the SMC is not
homogeneous. Our data also suggests that the CO cloud population has little or
no extended CO envelope on scales<30 pc, further evidence that the weak CO
component in the north SMC is being disassociated by penetrating UV radiation.
  The new high-resolution data provide evidence for a variable correlation of
the CO integrated brightness with integrated HI and um emission; in particular
CO is often, but not always, found coincident with peaks of um emission,
verifying the need for matching-resolution um and HI data for a complete
assessment of the SMC H2 mass.
