We derive general expressions for the Kaehler form of the L^2-metric in terms
of standard 2-forms on vortex moduli spaces. In the case of abelian vortices in
gauged linear sigma-models, this allows us to compute explicitly the Kaehler
class of the L^2-metric. As an application we compute the total volume of the
moduli space of abelian semi-local vortices. In the strong coupling limit, this
then leads to conjectural formulae for the volume of the space of holomorphic
maps from a compact Riemann surface to projective space. Finally we show that
the localization results of Samols in the abelian Higgs model extend to more
general models. These include linear non-abelian vortices and vortices in
gauged toric sigma-models.
