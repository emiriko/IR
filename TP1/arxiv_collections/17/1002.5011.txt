We study the Lefschetz standard conjecture on a smooth complex projective
variety X. In degree 2, we reduce it to a local statement concerning
deformations of vector bundles on X. When X is hyperk\"ahler, we show that the
existence of nontrivial deformations of stable hyperholomorphic bundles implies
the Lefschetz standard conjecture in codimension 2.
