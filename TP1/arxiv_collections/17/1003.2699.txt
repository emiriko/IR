We find an explicit integral formula for the eigenfunctions of a fourth order
differential operator against the kernel involving two Bessel functions. Our
formula establishes the relation between K-types in two different realizations
of the minimal representation of the indefinite orthogonal group, namely the
L^2-model and the conformal model.
