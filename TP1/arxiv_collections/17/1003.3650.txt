The effects of short range correlations (SRC) in inclusive (A(e,e')X) and
exclusive (A(e,e'N)X and A(e,e'2N)X) are reviewed. A new approach to the
analysis of inclusive cross sections is illustrated, based upon the
introduction of proper scaling functions and variables which incorporate the
effects of two- and three-nucleon SRC. The approach is used to interpret the
plateaux observed in the CLAS inclusive cross section ratios of 4He, 12C and
56Fe to 3He.
