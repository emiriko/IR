We investigate the leading lattice spacing effects in mesonic two-point
correlators computed with twisted mass Wilson fermions in the epsilon-regime.
By generalizing the procedure already introduced for the untwisted Wilson
chiral effective theory, we extend the continuum chiral epsilon expansion to
twisted mass WChPT. We define different regimes, depending on the relative
power counting for the quark masses and the lattice spacing. We explicitly
compute, for arbitrary twist angle, the leading O(a^2) corrections appearing at
NLO in the so-called GSM^* regime. As in untwisted WChPT, we find that in this
situation the impact of explicit chiral symmetry breaking due to lattice
artefacts is strongly suppressed. Of particular interest is the case of maximal
twist, which corresponds to the setup usually adopted in lattice simulations
with twisted mass Wilson fermions. The formulae we obtain can be matched to
lattice data to extract physical low energy couplings, and to estimate
systematic uncertainties coming from discretization errors.
