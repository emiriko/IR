Resizable elastomeric nanopores have been used to measure pulses of ionic
current caused by carboxylated polystyrene spheres of diameter 200 nm and 800
nm. The nanopores represent a novel technology which enables nanoscale resizing
of a pore by macroscopic actuation of an elastomeric membrane. Three different
pores were employed with variable applied strain, transmembrane potential,
particle concentration and sphere radius. Theory describing current pulse
magnitude has been extended to conical pore geometry. A consistent method for
interpretation of data close to the noise threshold has been introduced, and
experimental data has been used to compare several methods for efficient,
non-destructive calculation of pore dimensions. The most effective models
emphasize the absolute pulse size, which is predominantly determined by the
opening radius at the narrowest part of the roughly conical pores, rather than
the profile along the entire pore length. Experiments were carried out in a
regime for which both electro-osmotic and electrophoretic transport are
significant.
