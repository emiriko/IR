We present a measurement of the top quark mass and of the top-antitop pair
production cross section using p-pbar data collected with the CDFII detector at
the Tevatron Collider at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.9 fb-1. We select events with
six or more jets satisfying a number of kinematical requirements imposed by
means of a neural network algorithm. At least one of these jets must originate
from a b quark, as identified by the reconstruction of a secondary vertex
inside the jet. The mass measurement is based on a likelihood fit incorporating
reconstructed mass distributions representative of signal and background, where
the absolute jet energy scale (JES) is measured simultaneously with the top
quark mass. The measurement yields a value of 174.8 +- 2.4(stat+JES)
^{+1.2}_{-1.0}(syst) GeV/c^2, where the uncertainty from the absolute jet
energy scale is evaluated together with the statistical uncertainty. The
procedure measures also the amount of signal from which we derive a cross
section, sigma_{ttbar} = 7.2 +- 0.5(stat) +- 1.0 (syst) +- 0.4 (lum) pb, for
the measured values of top quark mass and JES.
