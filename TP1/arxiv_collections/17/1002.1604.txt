The serial harness introduced by Hammersley is equivalent, in the Gaussian
case, to the Gaussian Solid-On-Solid interface model with parallel heat bath
dynamics. Here we consider sub-lattice parallel dynamics, and give exact
results about relaxation dynamics, based on the equivalence to the infinite
time limit of a time periodic random field. We also give a numerical comparison
to the harness process in continuous time studied by Hsiao and by Ferrari,
Niederhauser and Pechersky.
