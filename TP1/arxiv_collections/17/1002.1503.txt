We present a framework for the hierarchical identification and
characterization of voids based on the Watershed Void Finder. The Hierarchical
Void Finder is based on a generalization of the scale space of a density field
invoked in order to trace the hierarchical nature and structure of cosmological
voids. At each level of the hierarchy, the watershed transform is used to
identify the voids at that particular scale. By identifying the overlapping
regions between watershed basins in adjacent levels, the hierarchical void tree
is constructed. Applications on a hierarchical Voronoi model and on a set of
cosmological simulations illustrate its potential.
