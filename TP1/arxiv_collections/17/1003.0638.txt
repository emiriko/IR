The propagation of a coherent optical linear wave in an ensemble of
semiconductor quantum dots is considered. It is shown that a distribution of
transition dipole moments of the quantum dots changes significantly the
polarization and Beer's absorption length of the ensemble of quantum dots.
Explicit analytical expressions for these quantities are presented.
