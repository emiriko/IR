A Lorentz and gauge symmetry preserving regularization method is proposed in
4 dimension based on momentum cutoff. We use the conditions of gauge invariance
or freedom of shift of the loop-momentum to define the evaluation of the terms
carrying Lorentz indices, e.g. proportional to k_{\mu}k_{\nu}. The remaining
scalar integrals are calculated with a four dimensional momentum cutoff. The
finite terms (independent of the cutoff) are unambiguous and agree with the
result of dimensional regularization.
