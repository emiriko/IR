Nuclei are transparent for a heavy intrinsic charm (IC) component of the beam
hadrons, what leads to an enhanced nuclear dependence of open charm production
at large Feynman x_F. Indeed, such an effect was observed recently in the SELEX
experiment. Our calculations reproduce well the data, providing strong support
for the presence of IC in hadrons in amount less than 1%. Moreover, we
performed an analysis of nuclear effects in J/Psi production and found a
similar, although weaker effect
