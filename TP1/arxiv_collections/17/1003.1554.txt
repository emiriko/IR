This article discusses the limits of the Anthropogenic Global Warming Theory
advocated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. A phenomenological
theory of climate change based on the physical properties of the data
themselves is proposed. At least 60% of the warming of the Earth observed since
1970 appears to be induced by natural cycles which are present in the solar
system. A climatic stabilization or cooling until 2030-2040 is forecast by the
phenomenological model.
