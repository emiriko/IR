We classify the nilpotent orbits in a simple Lie algebra for which the
restriction of the adjoint quotient map to a Slodowy slice is the universal
Poisson deformation of its central fibre. This generalises work of Brieskorn
and Slodowy on subregular orbits. In particular, we find in this way new
singular symplectic hypersurfaces of dimension 4 and 6.
