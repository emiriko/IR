The purpose of this paper is applying minimality of hyperplane arrangements
to local system cohomology groups. It is well known that twisted cohomology
groups with coefficients in a generic rank one local system vanish except in
the top degree, and bounded chambers form a basis of the remaining cohomology
group. We determine precisely when this phenomenon happens for two-dimensional
arrangements.
