In this invited presentation I review some recent developments in the theory
of charmonium that appear likely to be of importance for future experimental
studies in this field. The specific areas considered are double charmonium
production, LQCD studies of charmonium, recent results for hadron loops, c-cbar
production cross sections at PANDA, charm molecules, and two recent
developments, "charmiscelleny".
