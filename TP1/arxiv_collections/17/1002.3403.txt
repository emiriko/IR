We study the transport properties of a serial double quantum dot (DQD)
coupled to two superconducting leads, focusing on the Josephson current through
the DQD and the associated 0-$\pi$ transitions which result from the subtle
interplay between the superconductivity, the Kondo physics, and the inter-dot
superexchange interaction. We examine the competition between the
superconductivity and the Kondo physics by tuning the relative strength
$\Delta/T_K$ of the superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the Kondo temperature
$T_K$, for different strengths of the superexchange coupling determined by the
interdot tunneling $t$ relative to the dot level broadening $\Gamma$. We find
strong renormalization of $t$, a significant role of the superexchange coupling
$J$, and a rich phase diagram of the 0 and $\pi$-junction regimes. In
particular, when both the superconductivity and the exchange interaction are in
close competion with the Kondo physics ($\Delta\sim J\sim T_K$), there appears
an island of $\pi'$-phase at large values of the superconducting phase
difference.
