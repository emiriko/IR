The LCDM cosmological model assumes the existence of a small cosmological
constant in order to explain the observed accelerating cosmic expansion.
Despite the dramatic improvement of the quality of cosmological data during the
last decade it remains the simplest model that fits remarkably well (almost)
all cosmological observations. In this talk I review the increasingly
successful fits provided by LCDM on recent geometric probe data of the cosmic
expansion. I also briefly discuss some emerging shortcomings of the model in
attempting to fit specific classes of data (eg cosmic velocity dipole flows and
cluster halo profiles). Finally, I summarize recent results on the
theoretically predicted matter overdensity ($\delta_m=\frac{\delta
\rho_m}{\rho_m}$) evolution (a dynamical probe of the cosmic expansion),
emphasizing its scale and gauge dependence on large cosmological scales in the
context of general relativity. A new scale dependent parametrization which
describes accurately the growth rate of perturbations even on scales larger
than 100h^{-1}Mpc is shown to be a straightforward generalization of the well
known scale independent parametrization f(a)=\omms(a)^\gamma valid on smaller
cosmological scales.
