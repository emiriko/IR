Using quaternions, we give a concise derivation of the Ricci tensor for
homogeneous spaces with topology of the 3-dimensional sphere. We derive
explicit and numerical solutions for the Ricci flow PDE and discuss their
properties. In the collapse (or expansion) of these models, the interplay of
the various components of the Ricci tensor are studied. We dedicate this paper
to honor the work of Josh Goldberg.
