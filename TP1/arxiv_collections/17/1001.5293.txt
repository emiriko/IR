We develop the theory for shallow-core to valence excitations when the
multiplet spread is larger than the core-hole attraction, e.g., if the core and
valence orbitals have the same principal quantum number. This results in a
cross-over from bound to virtual-bound excited states with increasing energy
and in large differences between dipole and high-order multipole transitions,
as observed in inelastic x-ray scattering. The theory is important to obtain
ground state information from x-ray spectroscopies of strongly correlated
transition metal, rare-earth and actinide systems.
