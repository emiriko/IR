We have performed an angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study
of lightly-doped to underdoped YBa2Cu3Oy (YBCO) untwinned single crystals and a
core-level x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) study of YBCO single and
polycrystals. In the zone diagonal (nodal) direction, dispersive quasi-particle
(QP) features crossing the Fermi level were observed down to the hole
concentration of ~ 4%, which explains the metallic transport of the
lightly-doped YBCO. The chemical potential shift estimated from XPS was more
rapid than in the Bi2212 cuprates. Upon hole doping, very rapid spectral weight
transfer from high binding energies to the QP feature, even faster than
La2-xSrxCuO4, was observed.
