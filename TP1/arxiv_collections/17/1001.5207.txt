In the beginning there was the internet, then came the world wide web, and
now there is the grid. In the future perhaps there will be the cloud. In the
age of persistent, pervasive, and pandemic networks I review how the lattice
QCD community embraced the open source paradigm for both code and data whilst
adopting the emerging grid technologies, and why having your data persistently
accessible via standardized protocols and services might be a good idea.
