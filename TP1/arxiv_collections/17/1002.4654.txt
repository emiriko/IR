As developed previously the physical behavior of space-time near to an event
horizon can be surmised from the behavior of a superfluid near to a critical
point where the speed of sound vanishes. In this talk we note that this
critical behavior can be given a geometrical interpretation by regarding the
tuning parameter as a radial coordinate for anti-de Sitter space. We also draw
attention to a mathematical model for a layered conductor with strong
spin-orbit interactions which provides a physical explanation for why the
behavior of space-time near an event horizon is related to the behavior of high
Tc superconductors.
