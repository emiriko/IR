We investigate universal time-dependent exact deformations of Schrodinger
geometry. We present 1) scale invariant but non-conformal deformation, 2)
non-conformal but scale invariant deformation, and 3) both scale and conformal
invariant deformation. All these solutions are universal in the sense that we
could embed them in any supergravity constructions of the Schrodinger invariant
geometry. We give a field theory interpretation of our time-dependent
solutions. In particular, we argue that any time-dependent chemical potential
can be treated exactly in our gravity dual approach.
