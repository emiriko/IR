In this paper we discuss the basket options valuation for a jump-diffusion
model. The underlying asset prices follow some correlated local volatility
diffusion processes with systematic jumps. We derive a forward partial integral
differential equation (PIDE) for general stochastic processes and use the
asymptotic expansion method to approximate the conditional expectation of the
stochastic variance associated with the basket value process. The numerical
tests show that the suggested method is fast and accurate in comparison with
the Monte Carlo and other methods in most cases.
