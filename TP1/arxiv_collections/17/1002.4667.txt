We present a brief summary of the main results from our multi-dimensional,
time-dependent simulations of gas dynamics in AGN. We focus on two types of
outflows powered by radiation emitted from the AGN: disk winds and winds driven
from large-scale inflows. We show spectra predicted by the simulations and
discuss their relevance to observations of broad- and narrow-line regions of
the AGN. We finish with a few remarks on whether these outflows can have a
significant impact on their environment and host galaxy.
