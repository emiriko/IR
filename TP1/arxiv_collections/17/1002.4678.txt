In this work we will consider the calculation of Groebner-Shirshov bases of
Coxeter groups. This will be the main focus of the work. In \cite{Bokut-Shiao},
Bokut & Shiao gave the Groebner-Shirshov bases of positive definite classical
Coxeter groups $A_l, B_l, D_l$ by using the techniques of Elimination of
Leading Word.
  We will give a counter example to a hypothesis which is introduced by Bokut &
Shiao in \cite{Bokut-Shiao} and we will calculate the Groebner-Shirshov bases
of the positive degenerate infinite affine Weyl group $\widetilde{A}_n $ which
is isomorphic to semi-direct product group $\Sigma_n \ltimes {\mathbb
Z}^{n-1}$, and further we classify all the reduced elements of the group by
using the Composition Diamond Lemma.
