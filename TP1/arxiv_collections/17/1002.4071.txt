Electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) is applied to mm size devices
with implanted leads and a 50 micron square gap laid down on bulk phosphorus
doped silicon. Devices with a range of phosphorus concentrations and surface
types were prepared and measured to examine the interplay between donor and
charge trap states in producing EDMR signals.
