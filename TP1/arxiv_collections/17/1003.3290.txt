We study the dynamics of the photon entanglement, $E_{\mathrm{N}}(t)$, for
the two-mode Jaynes-Cummings model in the few-photon case. The atomic
transitions associated with the photons with different polarizations are
assumed to be independent and, hence, the evolution of the "+"- and
"-"-polarized photons is formally separable. However, due to the photons
indistinguishability such interaction still leads to entanglement of initially
disentangled states owing to the non-linear dependence of the characteristic
frequencies on the photon population numbers. The time dependence of
entanglement is the result of superimposing oscillations with incommensurate
frequencies. Therefore, $E_{\mathrm{N}}(t)$ is a quasi-periodic function of
time with the complex profile strongly depending on the number of photons.
