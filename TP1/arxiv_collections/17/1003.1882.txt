Modelling heat transfer of carbon nanotubes is important for the thermal
management of nanotube-based composites and nanoelectronic device. By using a
finite element method for three-dimensional anisotropic heat transfer, we have
simulated the heat conduction and temperature variations of a single nanotube,
a nanotube array and a part of nanotube-based composite surface with heat
generation. The thermal conductivity used is obtained from the upscaled value
from the molecular simulations or experiments. Simulations show that nanotube
arrays have unique cooling characteristics due to its anisotropic thermal
conductivity.
