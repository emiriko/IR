The microreversibility principle implies that the conductance of a
two-terminal Aharonov-Bohm interferometer is an even function of the applied
magnetic flux. Away from linear response, however, this symmetry is not
fulfilled and the conductance phase of the interferometer when a quantum dot is
inserted in one of its arms can be a continuous function of the bias voltage.
Such magnetoasymmetries have been investigated in related mesoscopic systems
and arise as a consequence of the asymetric response of the internal potential
of the conductor out of equilibrium. Here we discuss magnetoasymmetries in
quantum-dot Aharonov-Bohm interferometers when strong electron-electron
interactions are taken into account beyond the mean-field approach. We find
that at very low temperatures the asymmetric element of the differential
conductance shows an abrupt change for voltages around the Fermi level. At
higher temperatures we recover a smooth variation of the magnetoasymmetry as a
function of the bias. We illustrate our results with the aid of the electron
occupation at the dot, demonstrating that its nonequilibrium component is an
asymmetric function of the flux even to lowest order in voltage. We also
calculate the magnetoasymmetry of the current-current correlations (the noise)
and find that it is given, to a good extent, by the magnetoasymmetry of the
weakly nonlinear conductance term. Therefore, both magnetoasymmetries (noise
and conductance) are related to each other via a higher-order
fluctuation-dissipation relation. This result appears to be true even in the
low temperature regime, where Kondo physics and many-body effects dominate the
transport properties.
