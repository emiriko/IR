We offer a unified approach to several phenomena related to the
electromagnetic vacuum of a complex medium made of point electric dipoles. To
this aim, we apply the linear response theory to the computation of the
polarization field propagator and study the spectrum of vacuum fluctuations.
The physical distinction among the local density of states which enter the
spectra of light propagation, total dipole emission, coherent emission, total
vacuum energy and Schwinger-bulk energy is made clear. Analytical expressions
for the spectrum of dipole emission and for the vacuum energy are derived.
Their respective relations with the spectrum of external light and with the
Schwinger-bulk energy are found. The light spectrum and the Schwinger-bulk
energy are determined by the Dyson propagator. The emission spectrum and the
total vacuum energy are determined by the polarization propagator. An exact
relationship of proportionality between both propagators is found in terms of
local field factors. A study of the nature of stimulated emission from a single
dipole is carried out. Regarding coherent emission, it contains two components.
A direct one which is transferred radiatively and directly from the emitter
into the medium and whose spectrum is that of external light. And an indirect
one which is radiated by induced dipoles. The induction is mediated by one (and
only one) local field factor. Regarding the vacuum energy, we find that in
addition to the Schwinger-bulk energy the vacuum energy of an effective medium
contains local field contributions proportional to the resonant frequency and
to the spectral line-width.
