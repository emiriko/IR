We consider the recent limits on dark matter - nucleon elastic scattering
cross section from the analysis of CDMS II collaboration using the two signal
events observed in CDMS experiment. With these limits we try to interpret the
Super-Kamiokande (SK) bounds on the detection rates of up-going muons induced
by the neutrinos that are produced in the sun from the decay of annihilation
products of dark matter (WIMPs) captured in the solar core. Calculated rates of
up-going muons for different annihilation channels at SK using CDMS bounds are
found to be orders below the predicted upper limits of such up-going muon rates
at SK. Thus there exists room for enhancement (boost) of the calculated rates
using CDMS limits for interpreting SK bounds. Such a feature is expected to
represent the PAMELA data with the current CDMS limits. We also show the
dependence of such a possible enhancement factor (boost) on WIMP mass for
different WIMP annihilation channels.
