I suggest the existence of a still undiscovered interaction: repulsion
between matter and antimatter. The simplest and the most elegant candidate for
such a force is gravitational repulsion between particles and antiparticles. I
argue that such a force may give birth to a new Universe; by transforming an
eventual Big Crunch of our universe, to an event similar to Big Bang. In fact,
when a collapsing Universe is reduced to a supermassive black hole of a small
size, a very strong field of the conjectured force may create
particle-antiparticle pairs from the surrounding vacuum. The amount of the
antimatter created from the physical vacuum is equal to the decrease of mass of
"black hole Universe" and violently repelled from it. When the size of the
black hole is sufficiently small the creation of antimatter may become so huge
and fast, that matter of our Universe may disappear in a fraction of the Planck
time. So fast transformation of matter to antimatter may look like a Big Bang
with the initial size about 30 orders of magnitude greater than the Planck
length, questioning the need for inflation. In addition, a Big Crunch, of a
Universe dominated by matter, leads to a new Universe dominated by antimatter,
and vice versa; without need to invoke CP violation as explanation of
matter-antimatter asymmetry. Simply, our present day Universe is dominated by
matter, because the previous Universe was dominated by antimatter.
