We study the mesons matter D-\bar{D} in the framework of sigma and omega
meson exchange model using Walecka's mean field theory. We choose the equal
number of D and anti-D meson then we get <omega^0>=0 and the field sigma
exhibits a critical temperature around 1.2 GeV. We investigate effective mass,
pressure, energy density and energy per pair. We conclude that this matter is a
gas and these results are not favorable for the existence of D-\bar{D} bound
state.
  Note: in arXiv:1211.5505 this interpretation has been updated where these
results are favorable for the existence of $D-\bar{D}$ bound state.
