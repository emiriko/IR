Charge conservation law ($\partial_{\beta} J^\beta =0$) usually is considered
as a corollary of Maxwell's equations. A circular reasoning, however, is found
in the derivation. A similar fallacy exists in the matter source's conservation
law ($\nabla^{\mu}T_{\mu\nu}=0$) and Einstein's field equations. Therefore, the
source's conservation laws are NOT consequence of field equations.
