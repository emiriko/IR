We offer some, hopefully clarifying, comments on Verlinde's recent claim that
gravity is an entropic force. A suitable identification of quantities shows
that both formulations of Newtonian gravity, the classical and the
thermodynamical one, are actually equivalent. It turns out that some additional
assumptions made by Verlinde are unnecessary. However, when it comes to General
Relativity there remain some gaps in the argument. We comment on whether this
identification can be done also for electrostatics. Finally, some thoughts on
the use of this reinterpretation are offered.
