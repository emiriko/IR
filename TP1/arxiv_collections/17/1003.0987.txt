One consequence of the continued downwards scaling of transistors is the
reliance on only a few discrete atoms to dope the channel, and random
fluctuations of the number of these dopants is already a major issue in the
microelectonics industry. While single-dopant signatures have been observed at
low temperature, studying the impact of only one dopant up to room temperature
requires extremely small lengths. Here, we show that a single arsenic dopant
dramatically affects the off-state behavior of an advanced microelectronics
field effect transistor (FET) at room temperature. Furthermore, the ionization
energy of this dopant should be profoundly modified by the close proximity of
materials with a different dielectric constant than the host semiconductor. We
measure a strong enhancement, from 54meV to 108meV, of the ionization energy of
an arsenic atom located near the buried oxide. This enhancement is responsible
for the large current below threshold at room temperature and therefore
explains the large variability in these ultra-scaled transistors. The results
also suggest a path to incorporating quantum functionalities into silicon CMOS
devices through manipulation of single donor orbitals.
