In this work we study the high pressure behaviour of liquid and glassy GeO2
by means of molecular dynamics simulations. The interaction potential, which
includes dipole polarization effects, was parameterized from first-principles
calculations. Our simulations reproduce the most recent experimental data to a
high degree of precision. The proportion of the various GeOn polyhedra is
determined as a function of the pressure: a smooth transition from tetrahedral
to octahedral network is observed. Finally, the study of high-pressure, liquid
germania confirms that this material presents an anomalous behaviour of the
diffusivity as observed in analog systems such as silica and water. The
importance of penta-coordinated germanium ions for such behaviour is stressed.
