Context. The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase marks the end of the
evolution for low- and intermediate-mass stars, which are fundamental
contributors to the mass return to the interstellar medium and to the chemical
evolution of galaxies. The detailed understanding of mass loss processes is
hampered by the poor knowledge of the luminosities and distances of AGB stars.
Aims. In a series of papers we are trying to establish criteria permitting a
more quantitative determination of luminosities for the various types of AGB
stars, using the infrared (IR) fluxes as a basis. An updated compilation of the
mass loss rates is also required, as it is crucial in our studies of the
evolutionary properties of these stars. In this paper we concentrate our
analysis on the study of the mass loss rates for a sample of galactic S stars.
Methods. We reanalyze the properties of the stellar winds for a sample of
galactic MS, S, SC stars with reliable estimates of the distance on the basis
of criteria previously determined. We then compare the resulting mass loss
rates with those previously obtained for a sample of C-rich AGB stars. Results.
Stellar winds in S stars are on average less efficient than those of C-rich AGB
stars of the same luminosity. Near-to-mid infrared colors appear to be crucial
in our analysis. They show a good correlation with mass loss rates in
particular for the Mira stars. We suggest that the relations between the rates
of the stellar winds and both the near-to-mid infrared colors and the periods
of variability improve the understanding of the late evolutionary stages of low
mass stars and could be the origin of the relation between the rates of the
stellar winds and the bolometric magnitudes.
