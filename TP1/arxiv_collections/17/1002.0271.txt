We show that a nonvanishing analytic function on a domain in the unit disc
can be approximated by (a scalar multiple of) a Blaschke product whose zeros
lie on a prescribed circle enclosing the domain. We also give a new proof of
the analogous classical result for polynomials. A connection is made to
universality results for the Riemann zeta function.
