DAMA/LIBRA is running at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory of the I.N.F.N..
Here the results obtained with a further exposure of 0.34 ton x yr are
presented. They refer to two further annual cycles collected one before and one
after the first DAMA/LIBRA upgrade occurred on September/October 2008. The
cumulative exposure with those previously released by the former DAMA/NaI and
by DAMA/LIBRA is now 1.17 ton x yr, corresponding to 13 annual cycles. The data
further confirm the model independent evidence of the presence of Dark Matter
(DM) particles in the galactic halo on the basis of the DM annual modulation
signature (8.9 sigma C.L. for the cumulative exposure). In particular, with the
cumulative exposure the modulation amplitude of the single-hit events in the (2
-- 6) keV energy interval measured in NaI(Tl) target is (0.0116 +- 0.0013)
cpd/kg/keV; the measured phase is (146 +- 7) days and the measured period is
(0.999 +- 0.002) yr, values well in agreement with those expected for the DM
particles.
