We propose a way for realizing a two-qubit controlled phase gate with
superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) coupled to a
superconducting resonator. In this proposal, the two lowest levels of each
SQUID serve as the logical states and two intermediate levels of each SQUID are
used for the gate realization. We show that neither adjustment of SQUID level
spacings during the gate operation nor uniformity in SQUID parameters is
required by this proposal. In addition, this proposal does not require the
adiabatic passage or a second-order detuning and thus the gate is much faster.
