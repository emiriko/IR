In this study a new numerical approach of the fluid dynamic, the lattice
Boltzmann method (LBM), is used to solved the stream in a atmospheric
Argon-nitrogen plasma jet. The axial symmetry and the variation of density,
viscosity and conductivity with the temperature are taken into account. The
reliability of the results are evaluated from the shareware GENMIX and Jets &
Poudres.
