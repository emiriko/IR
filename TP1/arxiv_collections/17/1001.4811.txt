It is shown that 21 cm intensity mapping could be used in the near term to
make cosmologically useful measurements. Large scale structure could be
detected using existing radio telescopes, or using prototypes for dedicated
redshift survey telescopes. This would provide a measure of the mean neutral
hydrogen density, using redshift space distortions to break the degeneracy with
the linear bias. We find that with only 200 hours of observing time on the
Green Bank Telescope, the neutral hydrogen density could be measured to 25%
precision at redshift 0.54<z<1.09. This compares favourably to current
measurements, uses independent techniques, and would settle the controversy
over an important parameter which impacts galaxy formation studies. In
addition, a 4000 hour survey would allow for the detection of baryon acoustic
oscillations, giving a cosmological distance measure at 3.5% precision. These
observation time requirements could be greatly reduced with the construction of
multiple pixel receivers. Similar results are possible using prototypes for
dedicated cylindrical telescopes on month time scales, or SKA pathfinder
aperture arrays on day time scales. Such measurements promise to improve our
understanding of these quantities while beating a path for future generations
of hydrogen surveys.
