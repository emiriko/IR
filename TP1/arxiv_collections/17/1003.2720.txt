We report the results of de-Haas-van-Alphen (dHvA) measurements in Cd doped
CeCoIn$_5$ and LaCoIn$_5$. Cd doping is known to induce an antiferromagnetic
order in the heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_5$, whose effect can be
reversed with applied pressure. We find a slight but systematic change of the
dHvA frequencies with Cd doping in both compounds, reflecting the chemical
potential shift due to the addition of holes. The frequencies and effective
masses are close to those found in the nominally pure compounds with similar
changes apparent in the Ce and La compounds with Cd substitution. We observe no
abrupt changes to the Fermi surface in the high field paramagnetic state for $x
\sim x_c$ corresponding to the onset of antiferromagnetic ordering at H=0 in
CeCo(In$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$)$_5$. Our results rule out $f-$electron localization as
the mechanism for the tuning of the ground state in CeCoIn$_5$ with Cd doping.
