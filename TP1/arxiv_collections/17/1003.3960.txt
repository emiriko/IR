Storage time extension in photon echoes using optical deshelving via a robust
spin state has been investigated for absorption-dependent optical leakage,
where an incomplete population transfer, even by a \pi optical pulse obviates
the phase recovery condition of the deshelving. We analyze an optical
depth-dependent echo leakage mechanism in the storage time extended photon
echoes for the usage of optical deshelving to photon echo-based quantum
memories.
