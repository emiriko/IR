We provide a broad overview of the theoretical status and phenomenological
applications of the Color Glass Condensate effective field theory describing
universal properties of saturated gluons in hadron wavefunctions that are
extracted from deeply inelastic scattering and hadron-hadron collision
experiments at high energies.
