We derive a general set of fluctuation relations for a nonequilibrium open
quantum system described by a Lindblad master equation. In the special case of
conservative Hamiltonian dynamics, these identities allow us to retrieve
quantum versions of Jarzynski and Crooks relations. In the linear response
regime, these fluctuation relations yield a fluctuation-dissipation theorem
(FDT) valid for a stationary state arbitrarily far from equilibrium. For a
closed system, this FDT reduces to the celebrated Callen-Welton-Kubo formula.
