A star will become brighter and brighter with stellar evolution, and the
distance of its habitable zone will become farther and farther. Some planets
outside the habitable zone of a host star during the main sequence phase may
enter the habitable zone of the host star during other evolutionary phases. A
terrestrial planet within the habitable zone of its host star is generally
thought to be suited to life existence. Furthermore, a rocky moon around a
giant planet may be also suited to life survive, provided that the planet-moon
system is within the habitable zone of its host star. Using Eggleton's code and
the boundary flux of habitable zone, we calculate the habitable zone of our
Solar after the main sequence phase. It is found that Mars' orbit and Jupiter's
orbit will enter the habitable zone of Solar during the subgiant branch phase
and the red giant branch phase, respectively. And the orbit of Saturn will
enter the habitable zone of Solar during the He-burning phase for about 137
million years. Life is unlikely at any time on Saturn, as it is a giant gaseous
planet. However, Titan, the rocky moon of Saturn, may be suitable for
biological evolution and become another Earth during that time. For low-mass
stars, there are similar habitable zones during the He-burning phase as our
Solar, because there are similar core masses and luminosities for these stars
during that phase.
