The definition method of the limit for the neutrino mass of rest by using the
analysis of the extreme values of the beta-particles distribution under
beta-decay is given. The anomaly of distribution at the end of the curve was
analyzed. The results of the experiments by spectrum analysis of electrons
under tritium disintegration and the results recording of the stream of
neutrinos from the supernova SN-1987A flash to estimate the limit for the
neutrino mass were analyzed and compared. The problems of interpretation of the
results obtained disappear in the case the mass less flavor of neutrino along
with mass neutrino.
