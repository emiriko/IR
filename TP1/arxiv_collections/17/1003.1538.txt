The crossover from a BEC (Bose-Einstein condensation) to a BCS
(Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) superfluid in dilute gases of ultracold Fermi atoms
creates an ideal environment to enrich our knowledge of strongly correlated
many-body systems. These experiments are relevant to a wide range of fields
from condensed matter to astrophysics. The nature of pairing in strongly
interacting Fermi gases can be readily studied, thus aiding our understanding
of related problems in high-T_{c} superconductors, whose mechanism is still
under debate. These are not well-understood due to the large interaction
parameter. Here, we calculate the dynamical properties of a normal, trapped,
and strongly correlated Fermi gas, by developing a quantum cluster expansion.
In ultra-cold atomic physics one can measure the elementary excitations, using
rf or Bragg spectroscopy. Our calculations for the single-particle spectral
function agree with the recent measurements, and clearly demonstrate pseudogap
pairing in the strongly interacting regime.
