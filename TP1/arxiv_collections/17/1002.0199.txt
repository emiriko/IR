Controlled synthesis of nano materials is critical for the development of
nanotechnologies concerned with respect to shape and size. Especially, ZnO
nanosystems, such as wires, belts, needles and films can be easily formed by
either physical or chemical approaches such as, Chemical Vapour Deposition,
Metal Organic Chemical Vapour Deposition, Pulsed Laser Deposition, Molecular
Beam Epitaxy, Sol Gel process, Thermal Annealing method and Solvothermal
Oxidation. ZnO has polar surfaces that help in the formation of a wide range of
nanostructures such as needles,films rings, springs, bows and helices
