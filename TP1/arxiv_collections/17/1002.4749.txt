Local phase transition from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic state in the region
of the ballistic Ni nanocontacts (NCs) has been experimentally observed. We
found that contact size reduction leads to an increase in the bias voltage at
which the local phase transition occurs. Presented theoretical interpretation
of this phenomena takes into the account the specificity of the local heating
of the ballistic NC and describes the electron's energy relaxation dependences
on the applied voltage. The experimental data are in good qualitative and
quantitative agreement with the theory proposed.
