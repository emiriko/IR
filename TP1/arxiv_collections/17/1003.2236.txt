We have examined the commonly used Tersoff and Brenner empirical interatomic
potentials in the context of the phonon dispersions in graphene. We have found
a parameter set for each empirical potential that provides improved fits to
some structural data and to the in-plane phonon dispersion data for graphite.
These optimized parameter sets yield values of the acoustic phonon velocities
that are in better agreement with measured data. They also provide lattice
thermal conductivity values in single-walled carbon nanotubes that are
considerably improved compared to those obtained from the original parameter
sets.
