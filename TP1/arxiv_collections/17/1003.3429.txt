We demonstrate the existence of localized electron and hole states in a
ring-shaped potential kink in biased bilayer graphene. Within the continuum
description, we show that for sharp potential steps the Dirac equation
describing carrier states close to the K (or K') point of the first Brillouin
zone can be solved analytically for a circular kink/anti-kink dot. The
solutions exhibit interfacial states which exhibit Aharonov-Bohm oscillations
as functions of the height of the potential step and/or the radius of the ring.
