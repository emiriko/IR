In a conventional superconductor, the spin-lattice relaxation rate on all
nuclei should have the same temperature dependence below Tc. We performed
$^{23}$Na, $^{75}$As, and $^{59}$Co NMR studies on single crystals of
NaFe0.95Co0.05As, and found that spin-lattice relaxation rates show very
different temperature dependent power-law behavior on three sites. We propose
that such site-dependent behavior is due to the facts that the superconductor
has two gaps of very different sizes. The power-law exponent of each nucleus is
affected by the strength of the hyperfine coupling to the small gap. We also
found that the large superconducting gap on the cobalt site is smaller than on
other two sites. It suggests a local suppression of the superconducting gap on
the dopant site.
