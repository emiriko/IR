An alternative method to generate J0 Bessel beams with controlled spatial
partial coherence properties is introduced. Far field diffraction from a
discrete number of source points on an annular region is calculated. The
average for different diffracted fields produced at several rotation angles is
numerically calculated and experimentally detected. Theoretical and
experimental results show that for this particular case, J0 Bessel beam is a
limit when the number of points tends towards infinity and the associated
complex degree of coherence is also a function of the number of points.
