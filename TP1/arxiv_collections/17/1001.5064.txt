We study the CP(1) system in (2+1)-dimensional noncommutative space with and
without Chern-Simons term. Using the Seiberg-Witten map we convert the
noncommutative CP(1) system to an action written in terms of the commutative
fields. We find that this system presents the same infinite size instanton
solution as the commutative Chern-Simons-CP(1) model without a potential term.
Based on this result we argue that the BPS equations are compatible with the
full variational equations of motion, rejecting the hypothesis of an "energy
crisis". In addition we examine the noncommutative CP(1) system with a
Chern-Simons interaction. In this case we find that when the theory is
transformed by the Seiberg-Witten map it also presents the same instanton
solution as the commutative Chern-Simons-CP(1) model.
