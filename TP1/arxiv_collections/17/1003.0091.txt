The transformation of organic molecules into the simplest self-replicating
living system,a microorganism, is accomplished from a unique event or rare
events that occurred early in the Universe. The subsequent dispersal on cosmic
scales and evolution of life is guaranteed, being determined by well-understood
processes of physics and biology. Entire galaxies and clusters of galaxies can
be considered as connected biospheres, with lateral gene transfers, as
initially theorized by Joseph (2000), providing for genetic mixing and
Darwinian evolution on a cosmic scale. Big bang cosmology modified by modern
fluid mechanics suggests the beginning and wide intergalactic dispersal of life
occurred immediately after the end of the plasma epoch when the gas of
protogalaxies in clusters fragmented into clumps of planets. Stars are born
from binary mergers of such planets within such clumps. When stars devour their
surrounding planets to excess they explode, distributing necessary fertilizing
chemicals created only in stars with panspermial templates created only in
adjacent planets, moons and comets, to be gravitationally collected by the
planets and further converted to living organisms. Recent infrared images of
nearby star forming regions suggest that life formation on planets like Earth
is possible, but not inevitable.
