Employing the Kernel Polynomial method (KPM), we study the electronic
properties of the graphene bilayers in the presence of diagonal disorder,
within the tight-binding approximation. The KPM method enables us to calculate
local density of states (LDOS) without need to exactly diagonalize the
Hamiltonian. We use the geometrical averaging of the LDOS's at different
lattice sites as a criterion to distinguish the localized states from extended
ones. We find that bilayer graphene undergoes Anderson metal-insulator
transition at a critical value of disorder strength.
