We study the interaction of saddle-node and transcritical bifurcations in a
Lotka-Volterra model with a constant term representing harvesting or migration.
Because some of the equilibria of the model lie on an invariant coordinate
axis, both the saddle-node and the transcritical bifurcations are of
codimension one. Their interaction can be associated with either a single or a
double zero eigenvalue. We show that in the former case, the local bifurcation
diagram is given by a nonversal unfolding of the cusp bifurcation whereas in
the latter case it is a nonversal unfolding of a degenerate Bogdanov-Takens
bifurcation. We present a simple model for each of the two cases to illustrate
the possible unfoldings. We analyse the consequences of the generic phase
portraits for the Lotka-Volterra system.
