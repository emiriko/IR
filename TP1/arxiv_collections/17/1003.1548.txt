We introduce mesoscopic and macroscopic model equations of chemotaxis with
anomalous subdiffusion for modelling chemically directed transport of
biological organisms in changing chemical environments with diffusion hindered
by traps or macro-molecular crowding. The mesoscopic models are formulated
using Continuous Time Random Walk master equations and the macroscopic models
are formulated with fractional order differential equations. Different models
are proposed depending on the timing of the chemotactic forcing.
Generalizations of the models to include linear reaction dynamics are also
derived. Finally a Monte Carlo method for simulating anomalous subdiffusion
with chemotaxis is introduced and simulation results are compared with
numerical solutions of the model equations. The model equations developed here
could be used to replace Keller-Segel type equations in biological systems with
transport hindered by traps, macro-molecular crowding or other obstacles.
