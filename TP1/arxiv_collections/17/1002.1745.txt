We show that if G is a discrete group which does not have the Haagerup
property but does have an unbounded cocycle into a C_0 representation and if G
acts on a finite von Neumann algebra B such that the inclusion B \subset (B
\rtimes G) has the Haagerup property from below then any group-measure space
Cartan subalgebra must have a corner which embeds into B inside B \rtimes G.
  Taking the action to be trivial we produce examples of II_1 factors N such
that N \otimes M is not a group-measure space construction whenever M is a
finite factor with the Haagerup property. Taking the action on a probability
space with the Haagerup property from below we produce examples of von Neumann
algebras which have unique group-measure space Cartan subalgebras. Taking
profinite actions of certain products of groups we use the unique Cartan
decomposition theorem of N. Ozawa and S. Popa and the cocycle superrigidity
theorem of A. Ioana to produce actions which are virtually W*-superrigid.
