We report the realization of a dual surface plasmon polariton (SPP)
microscope based on leakage radiation (LR) analysis. The microscope can either
image SPP propagation in the direct space or tin the Fourier space. This
particularity allows in turn manipulation of the LR image for a clear
separation of different interfering SPP contributions present close to optical
nanoelements.
