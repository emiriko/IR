In this article we give our contribution to the problem of segmentation with
plug-in procedures. We give general sufficient conditions under which plug in
procedure are efficient. We also give an algorithm that satisfy these
conditions. We give an application of the used algorithm to hyperspectral
images segmentation. Hyperspectral images are images that have both spatial and
spectral coherence with thousands of spectral bands on each pixel. In the
proposed procedure we combine a reduction dimension technique and a spatial
regularisation technique. This regularisation is based on the mixlet
modelisation of Kolaczyck and Al.
