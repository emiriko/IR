Given any smooth circle diffeomorphism with irrational rotation number, we
show that its invariant probability measure is the only invariant distribution
(up to multiplication by a real constant). As a consequence of this, we show
that the space of real smooth coboundaries of such a diffeomorphism is closed
if and only if its rotation number is Diophantine.
