We present large-scale density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and
temperature programmed desorption measurements to characterize the structural,
energetic and vibrational properties of the functionalized molecular switch
3,3',5,5'-tetra-tert-butyl-azobenzene (TBA) adsorbed at Au(111). Particular
emphasis is placed on exploring the accuracy of the semi-empirical dispersion
correction approach to semi-local DFT (DFT-D) in accounting for the substantial
van der Waals component in the surface chemical bond. In line with previous
findings for benzene and pure azobenzene at coinage metal surfaces, DFT-D
significantly overbinds the molecule, but seems to yield an accurate adsorption
geometry as far as can be judged from the experimental data. Comparing the
trans adsorption geometry of TBA and azobenzene at Au(111) reveals a remarkable
insensitivity of the structural and vibrational properties of the -N=N- moiety.
This questions the established view of the role of the bulky tert-butyl-spacer
groups for the switching of TBA in terms of a mere geometric decoupling of the
photochemically active diazo-bridge from the gold substrate.
