Ultradiscrete soliton equations and B\"acklund transformation for a
generalized soliton solution are presented. The equations include the
ultradiscrete KdV equation or the ultradiscrete Toda equation in a special
case. We also express the solution by the ultradiscrete permanent, which is
defined by ultradiscretizing the signature-free determinant, that is, the
permanent. Moreover, we discuss a relation between B\"acklund transformations
for discrete and ultradiscrete KdV equations.
