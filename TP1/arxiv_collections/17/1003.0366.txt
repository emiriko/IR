We study a conjecture by Fendley, Ludwig and Saleur for the nonlinear
conductance in the boundary sine-Gordon model. They have calculated the
perturbative series of twisted partition functions, which require particular
(unphysical) imaginary values of the bias, by applying the tools of Jack
symmetric functions to the "log-sine" Coulomb gas on a circle. We have analyzed
the conjectured relation between the analytically continued free energy and the
nonlinear conductance in various limits. We confirm the conjecture for weak and
strong tunneling, in the classical regime, and in the zero temperature limit.
We also shed light on this special variant of the ${\rm Im} F$-method and
compare it with the real-time Keldysh approach. In addition, we address the
issue of quantum statistical fluctuations.
