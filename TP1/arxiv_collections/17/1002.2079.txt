The interaction of (linearized) gravitation with matter is studied in the
causal approach up to the second order of perturbation theory. We consider the
generic case and prove that gravitation is universal in the sense that the
existence of the interaction with gravitation does not put new constraints on
the Lagrangian for lower spin fields. We use the formalism of quantum off-shell
fields which makes our computation more straightforward and simpler.
