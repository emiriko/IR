We investigate the prompt photon production in deep inelastic scattering at
HERA in the framework of kt-factorization QCD approach. Our study is based on
the off-shell partonic amplitude e q* -> e gamma q, where the photon radiation
from the leptons as well as from the quarks is taken into account. The
unintegrated quark densities in a proton are determined using the
Kimber-Martin-Ryskin prescription. The conservative error analisys is
performed. We investigate both inclusive and jet associated prompt photon
production rates. Our predictions are compared with the recent experimental
data taken by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations. We demonstrate that in the
kt-factorization approach the contribution from the quark radiation subprocess
(QQ mechanism) is enhanced as compared to the leading-order collinear
approximation.
