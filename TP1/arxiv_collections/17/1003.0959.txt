Previous work shows request tracing systems help understand and debug the
performance problems of multi-tier services. However, for large-scale data
centers, more than hundreds of thousands of service instances provide online
service at the same time. Previous work such as white-box or black box tracing
systems will produce large amount of log data, which would be correlated into
large quantities of causal paths for performance debugging. In this paper, we
propose an innovative algorithm to eliminate valueless logs of multitiers
services. Our experiment shows our method filters 84% valueless causal paths
and is promising to be used in large-scale data centers.
