Some recent developments in exact results in relativistic hydrodynamics is
reviewed. We discuss phenomenological applications in high-energy collisions
and theoretical features of the solutions. We compare the method of numerical
modelling to the strategy based on exact solutions. We argue that the efforts
made and progress achieved in this seemingly purely theoretical topic is of
interest for phenomenology.
