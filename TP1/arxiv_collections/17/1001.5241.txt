It is well known among phylogeneticists that adding an extra taxon (e.g.
species) to a data set can alter the structure of the optimal phylogenetic tree
in surprising ways. However, little is known about this "rogue taxon" effect.
In this paper we characterize the behavior of balanced minimum evolution (BME)
phylogenetics on data sets of this type using tools from polyhedral geometry.
First we show that for any distance matrix there exist distances to a "rogue
taxon" such that the BME-optimal tree for the data set with the new taxon does
not contain any nontrivial splits (bipartitions) of the optimal tree for the
original data. Second, we prove a theorem which restricts the topology of
BME-optimal trees for data sets of this type, thus showing that a rogue taxon
cannot have an arbitrary effect on the optimal tree. Third, we construct
polyhedral cones computationally which give complete answers for BME rogue
taxon behavior when our original data fits a tree on four, five, and six taxa.
We use these cones to derive sufficient conditions for rogue taxon behavior for
four taxa, and to understand the frequency of the rogue taxon effect via
simulation.
