We adapt a variational procedure to calculate ground state properties of the
Holstein model in the adiabatic limit. At strong coupling, this adaption leads
to rapid convergence of results. The intermediate coupling regime is further
handled with an adaptive algorithm. We also use semi-classically derived
results for the adiabatic end-point, along with weak coupling perturbation
theory. These establish weak and strong coupling (or large and small polaron,
respectively) regimes in two dimensions or higher. As is well known, these are
connected smoothly, but the cross-over becomes increasingly abrupt as the
phonon frequency decreases.
