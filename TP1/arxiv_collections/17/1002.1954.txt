WiMAX technology is based on the IEEE 802.16 specification of which IEEE
802.16-2004 and 802.16e amendment are Physical (PHY) layer specifications. IEEE
802.16-2004 currently supports several multiple-antenna options including
Space-Time Codes (STC), Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) antenna systems
and Adaptive Antenna Systems (AAS). The most recent WiMAX standard (802.16e)
supports broadband applications to mobile terminals and laptops. Using Adaptive
Modulation and Coding (AMC) we analyze the performance of OFDM physical layer
in WiMAX based on the simulation results of Bit Error Rate (BER), and data
throughput. The performance analysis of OFDM PHY is done. In this paper, an
extension to the basic SISO mode, a number of 2 by 2 MIMO extensions are
analysed under different combinations of digital modulation (QPSK, 16QAM and
64QAM) and Convolutional Code (CC) with half, two-third and three quarter rated
codes. The intent of this paper is to provide an idea of the benefits of
multiple antenna systems over single antenna systems in WiMAX type deployments.
