Up to now, it is not possible to obtain analytical solutions for complex
molecular association processes (e.g. Molecule recognition in Signaling or
catalysis). Instead Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations are commonly used to
estimate the rate of diffusional association, e.g. to be later used in
mesoscopic simulations. Meanwhile a portfolio of diffusional association (DA)
methods have been developed that exploit BD.
  However, DA methods do not clearly distinguish between modeling, simulation,
and experiment settings. This hampers to classify and compare the existing
methods with respect to, for instance model assumptions, simulation
approximations or specific optimization strategies for steering the computation
of trajectories.
  To address this deficiency we propose FADA (Flexible Architecture for
Diffusional Association) - an architecture that allows the flexible definition
of the experiment comprising a formal description of the model in SpacePi,
different simulators, as well as validation and analysis methods. Based on the
NAM (Northrup-Allison-McCammon) method, which forms the basis of many existing
DA methods, we illustrate the structure and functioning of FADA. A discussion
of future validation experiments illuminates how the FADA can be exploited in
order to estimate reaction rates and how validation techniques may be applied
to validate additional features of the model.
