Symmetry properties are at the basis of integrability. In recent years, it
appeared that so called "twisted symmetries" are as effective as standard
symmetries in many respects (integrating ODEs, finding special solutions to
PDEs). Here we discuss how twisted symmetries can be used to detect
integrability of Lagrangian systems which are not integrable via standard
symmetries.
