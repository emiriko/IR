Jet deflection by a flowing medium is one of the ideas brought forward to
explain the splitting of the correlation function of hadrons associated with a
high transverse momentum trigger from a jet-like structure observed in p-p and
d-Au collisions to a double-hump structure on the away side in Au-Au
collisions. However, just considering the parton kinematics needed to explain
the data shows that any attempt of detailed modelling deflected jets either
cannot agree with the data or leads to internal contradictions and violations
of basic physics principles. The idea that the deflection of jets by the medium
can explain the experimentally observed structures should therefore be
discarded.
