An ongoing effort to compute the topological susceptibility for the SU(3)
Yang-Mills theory in the continuum limit with a precison of about 2% is
reported. The susceptibility is computed by using the definition of the charge
suggested by Neuberger fermions for two values of the negative mass parameter
s. Finite volume and discretization effects are estimated to meet this level of
precision. The large statistics required has been obtained by using PCs of the
INFN-GRID. Simulations with larger lattice volumes are necessary in order to
better understanding the continuum limit at small lattice spacing values.
