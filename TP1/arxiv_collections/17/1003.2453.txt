A systematic method is presented to provide various equivalent solution
formulas for exact solutions to the sine-Gordon equation. Such solutions are
analytic in the spatial variable $x$ and the temporal variable $t,$ and they
are exponentially asymptotic to integer multiples of $2\pi$ as $x\to\pm\infty.$
The solution formulas are expressed explicitly in terms of a real triplet of
constant matrices. The method presented is generalizable to other integrable
evolution equations where the inverse scattering transform is applied via the
use of a Marchenko integral equation. By expressing the kernel of that
Marchenko equation as a matrix exponential in terms of the matrix triplet and
by exploiting the separability of that kernel, an exact solution formula to the
Marchenko equation is derived, yielding various equivalent exact solution
formulas for the sine-Gordon equation.
