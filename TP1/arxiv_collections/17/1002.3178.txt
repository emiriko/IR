We study the Cauchy initial-value problem for the Benjamin-Ono equation in
the zero-disperion limit, and we establish the existence of this limit in a
certain weak sense by developing an appropriate analogue of the method invented
by Lax and Levermore to analyze the corresponding limit for the Korteweg-de
Vries equation.
