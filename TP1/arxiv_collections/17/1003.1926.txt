We use polarized inelastic neutron scattering to show that the neutron spin
resonance below $T_c$ in superconducting BaFe$_{1.9}$Ni$_{0.1}$As$_2$ ($T_c=20$
K) is purely magnetic in origin. Our analysis further reveals that the
resonance peak near 7~meV only occurs for the planar response. This challenges
the common perception that the spin resonance in the pnictides is an isotropic
triplet excited state of the singlet Cooper pairs, as our results imply that
only the $S_{001}=\pm1$ components of the triplet are involved.
