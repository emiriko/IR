Investigations of natural variation among cells within a population are
essential for understanding the stochastic nature of tissue cell deformation
under applied load. In the existing literature, the population variation of
single-cell creep compliance has so far been modeled universally by using a
log-normal distribution. Here we use optical stretching, a non-contact and
relatively high-throughput technique for probing cell mechanics, to accumulate
a sufficient data set that demonstrates robustly that cell compliance varies
according to the similar but distinct gamma distribution. Additionally, we
re-examine existing simulations that were originally proposed to justify a
log-normal fit, and show that in fact these simulation data also correspond to
the gamma distribution. Finally, we propose a general stochastic differential
equation that analytically predicts a gamma distribution of creep compliance
during cell stretching, as well as the Gaussian distribution of cell recovery
that we observe experimentally upon removal of applied load. The population
variation is well characterized by just a single parameter in each of the creep
and recovery regimes. We expect our correction of a phenomenological
distribution fit, enabled by an expansive data set for mesenchymal stem cells,
to enable the development of more accurate constitutive laws to describe
cytoskeletal deformation. These findings thus serve to replace an empirical
distribution with a better-fitting model that rests on a more solid
experimental and theoretical foundation, and also provides a basis to predict
and understand the stochastic nature of the mechanical response of individual
cells within populations.
