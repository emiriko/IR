In a Poincare'-covariant vector-boson-exchange theory, the pion possesses
components of pseudovector origin, which materially influence its observable
properties. For a range of such quantities, we explore the consequences of a
momentum-independent interaction, regularised in a symmetry-preserving manner.
The contact interaction, whilst capable of describing pion static properties,
produces a form factor whose: evolution for Q^2>0.17GeV^2 disagrees markedly
with experiment; and asymptotic power-law behaviour conflicts strongly with
perturbative-QCD.
