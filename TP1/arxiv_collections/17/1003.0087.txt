We discuss the potential of observing effects of CP-violation phases in
squark decay chains at the LHC. As the CP-odd observable, we use the asymmetry
composed by triple products of final state momenta. There are good prospects of
observing these effects using the method of kinematic reconstruction for the
final and intermediate state particles. We also discuss the main experimental
factors and the expected sensitivity.
