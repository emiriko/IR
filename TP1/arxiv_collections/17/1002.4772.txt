Some aspects of the "exotic" particle, associated with the two-parameter
central extension of the planar Galilei group are reviewed. A fundamental
property is that it has non-commuting position coordinates. Other and
generalized non-commutative models are also discussed. Minimal as well as
anomalous coupling to an external electromagnetic field is presented.
Supersymmetric extension is also considered. Exotic Galilean symmetry is also
found in Moyal field theory. Similar equations arise for a semiclassical Bloch
electron, used to explain the anomalous/spin/optical Hall effects.
