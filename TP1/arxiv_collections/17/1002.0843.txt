We test a Markov chain approximation to the segment description (Li, 2007) of
chaos (and turbulence) on a tent map, the Minea system, the H\'enon map, and
the Lorenz system. For the tent map, we compute the probability transition
matrix of the Markov chain on the segments for segment time length (iterations)
$T = 1, 2, 3, 100$. The matrix has $1, 2, 4$ tents corresponding to $T = 1, 2,
3$; and is almost uniform for $T = 100$. As $T \ra +\infty$, our conjecture is
that the matrix will approach a uniform matrix (i.e. every entry is the same).
For the simple fixed point attractor in the Minea system, the Reynolds average
performs excellently and better than the maximal probability Markov chain and
segment linking. But for the strange attractors in the H\'enon map, and the
Lorenz system, the Reynolds average performs very poorly and worse than the
maximal probability Markov chain and segment linking.
