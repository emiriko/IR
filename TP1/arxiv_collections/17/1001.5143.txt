While photospheric magnetic elements appear mainly as Bright Points (BPs) at
the disk center and as faculae near the limb, high-resolution images reveal the
coexistence of BPs and faculae over a range of heliocentric angles. This is not
explained by a "hot wall" effect through vertical flux tubes, and suggests that
the transition from BPs to faculae needs to be quantitatively investigated. To
achieve this, we made the first recorded attempt to discriminate BPs and
faculae, using a statistical classification approach based on Linear
Discriminant Analysis(LDA). This paper gives a detailed description of our
method, and shows its application on high-resolution images of active regions
to retrieve a center-to-limb distribution of BPs and faculae. Bright "magnetic"
features were detected at various disk positions by a segmentation algorithm
using simultaneous G-band and continuum information. By using a selected sample
of those features to represent BPs and faculae, suitable photometric parameters
were identified in order to carry out LDA. We thus obtained a Center-to-Limb
Variation (CLV) of the relative number of BPs and faculae, revealing the
predominance of faculae at all disk positions except close to disk center (mu >
0.9). Although the present dataset suffers from limited statistics, our results
are consistent with other observations of BPs and faculae at various disk
positions. The retrieved CLV indicates that at high resolution, faculae are an
essential constituent of active regions all across the solar disk. We speculate
that the faculae near disk center as well as the BPs away from disk center are
associated with inclined fields.
