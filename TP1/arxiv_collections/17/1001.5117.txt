We present simulations of atmospheres of Earth-like aquaplanets that are
tidally locked to their star, that is, planets whose orbital period is equal to
the rotation period about their spin axis, so that one side always faces the
star and the other side is always dark. As extreme cases illustrating the
effects of slow and rapid rotation, we consider planets with rotation periods
equal to one current Earth year and one current Earth day. The dynamics
responsible for the surface climate (e.g., winds, temperature, precipitation)
and the general circulation of the atmosphere are discussed in light of
existing theories of atmospheric circulations. For example, as expected from
the increasing importance of Coriolis accelerations relative to inertial
accelerations as the rotation rate increases, the winds are approximately
isotropic and divergent at leading order in the slowly rotating atmosphere but
are predominantly zonal and rotational in the rapidly rotating atmosphere.
Free-atmospheric horizontal temperature variations in the slowly rotating
atmosphere are generally weaker than in the rapidly rotating atmosphere.
Interestingly, the surface temperature on the night side of the planets does
not fall below ~240 K in either the rapidly or slowly rotating atmosphere; that
is, heat transport from the day side to the night side of the planets
efficiently reduces temperature contrasts in either case. Rotational waves
shape the distribution of winds, temperature, and precipitation in the rapidly
rotating atmosphere; in the slowly rotating atmosphere, these distributions are
controlled by simpler divergent circulations. The results are of interest in
the study of tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets and as illustrations of how
planetary rotation and the insolation distribution shape climate.
