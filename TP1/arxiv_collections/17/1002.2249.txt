A LiFeAs single crystal with $T_c^{onset}$$\sim$19.7 K was grown successfully
in a sealed tungsten crucible using the Bridgeman method. The electrical
resistivity experiments revealed a ratio of room temperature to residual
resistivity (RRR) of approximately 46 and 18 for the in-plane and out-of plane
directions. The estimated anisotropic resistivity, $\gamma_\rho$=$\rho_c$ /
$\rho_{ab}$, was approximately 3.3 at $T_c^{onset}$. The upper critical fields
had large $H_{c2} ^{\shortparallel ab}$ and $H_{c2}^{\shortparallel c}$ values
of 83.4 T and 72.5 T, respectively, and an anisotropy ratio is
$\gamma_H$=$H_{c2}^{\shortparallel ab}$ / $H_{c2} ^{\shortparallel
c}$$\sim$1.15. The high upper critical field value and small anisotropy
highlight the potential use of LiFeAs in a variety of applications. The
calculated critical current density $(J_c)$ from the $M$-$H$ loop is
approximately 10$^3$ A/cm$^2$
