We propose a scheme for encoding many qubits in a single rotor, that is, a
continuous and periodic degree of freedom. A key feature of this scheme is its
ability to manipulate and entangle the encoded qubits with a single operation
on the system. We also show, using quantum error-correcting codes, how to
protect the qubits against small errors in angular position and momentum which
may affect the rotor. We then discuss the feasibility of this scheme and
suggest several candidates for its implementation. The proposed scheme is
immediately generalizable to qudits of any finite dimension.
