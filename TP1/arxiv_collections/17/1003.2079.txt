The magnetic phase variations under hydrostatic pressure on multiferroic
BiMnO3 have been examined by the dc magnetization [Mg(T)], magnetic hysteresis
[Ueff(H)], and ac susceptibility [X'g(T)]. Three magnetic transitions,
manifested as kinks I, II, and III on the Mg(T)], curves, were identified at
8.7 and 9.4 kbar. With increasing pressure, transition temperatures of kink I
and kink II TkI and TkII tend to decrease, but the temperature of kink III
TkIII showed more complex variation. Under increasing magnetic field, TkI and
TkII increase; however, TkIII decreases. Combining [Mg(T)] curves with Ueff(H)
and X'g(T), more detailed properties of these three kinks would be shown as
follows. Kink I is a long-range soft ferromagnetic transition which occurs at
TkI 100 K under ambient pressure but is suppressed completely at 11.9 kbar.
Kink II emerges at 8.7 kbar along with TkII 93 K which is also long-range soft
ferromagnetic but canted in nature. Kink III, a canted antiferromagnetic
transition, appears at TkIII 72.5 K along with kink II also at 8.7 kbar. The
proposed phase diagrams at ambient pressure, 9.4 and 11.9 kbar show the
different magnetic features of BiMnO3. These findings are believed to result
from the variations in crystal structure influenced by the external pressure.
These results also indicate the common complicated
