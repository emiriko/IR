Spin polarized current can excite the magnetization of a ferromagnet through
the transfer of spin angular momentum to the local spin system. This pure
spin-related transport phenomena leads to alluring possibilities for the
achievement of a nanometer scale, CMOS compatible and tunable microwave
generator operating at low bias for future wireless communications. Microwave
emission generated by the persitent motion of magnetic vortices induced by spin
transfer effect seems to be a unique manner to reach appropriate spectral
linewidth. However, in metallic systems, where such vortex oscillations have
been observed, the resulting microwave power is much too small. Here we present
experimental evidences of spin-transfer induced core vortex precessions in
MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions with similar good spectral quality but an
emitted power at least one order of magnitude stronger. More importantly,
unlike to others spin transfer excitations, the thorough comparison between
experimental results and models provide a clear textbook illustration of the
mechanisms of vortex precessions induced by spin transfer.
