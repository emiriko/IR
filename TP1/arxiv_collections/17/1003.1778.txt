We report magnetic field control of the quantum chaotic dynamics of hydrogen
analogues in an anisotropic solid state environment. The chaoticity of the
system dynamics was quantified by means of energy level statistics. We analyzed
the magnetic field dependence of the statistical distribution of the impurity
energy levels and found a smooth transition between the Poisson limit and the
Wigner limit, i.e. transition between regular Poisson and fully chaotic Wigner
dynamics. Effect of the crystal field anisotropy on the quantum chaotic
dynamics, which manifests itself in characteristic transitions between
regularity and chaos for different field orientations, was demonstrated.
