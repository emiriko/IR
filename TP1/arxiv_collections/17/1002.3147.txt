We calculate the geometric phase of a bipartite two-level system coupled to
an external environment. We analyze the reduced density matrix for an arbitrary
initial state of the composite system and compute the correction to the unitary
geometric phase through a kinematic approach. In all cases considered, we
observe a similar structure as a function of the degree of the entanglement of
the initial state. Further, we compute the entanglement entropy and concurrence
of the bipartite state and analyze if there is any relation among these
quantities and the geometric phase acquired during the nonunitary system's
evolution. Finally, we discuss the results obtained.
