We have investigated the resonant production of a stop at the Large Hadron
Collider, driven by baryon number violating interactions in supersymmetry. We
work in the framework of minimal supergravity models with the lightest
neutralino being the lightest supersymmetric particle which decays within the
detector. We look at various dilepton and trilepton final states, with or
without b-tags. A detailed background simulation is performed, and all possible
decay modes of the lighter stop are taken into account. We find that higher
stop masses are sometimes easier to probe, through the decay of the stop into
the third or fourth neutralino and their subsequent cascades. We also comment
on the detectability of such signals during the 7 TeV run, where, as expected,
only relatively light stops can be probed. Our conclusion is that the resonant
process may be probed, at both 10 and 14 TeV, with the R-parity violating
coupling {\lambda}"_{312} as low as 0.05, for a stop mass of about 1 TeV. The
possibility of distinguishing between resonant stop production and
pair-production is also discussed.
