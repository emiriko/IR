We study the electronic states of graphene in piecewise constant potentials
using the continuum Dirac equation appropriate at low energies, and a transfer
matrix method. For superlattice potentials, we identify patterns of induced
Dirac points which are present throughout the band structure, and verify for
the special case of a particle-hole symmetric potential their presence at zero
energy. We also consider the cases of a single trench and a p-n junction
embedded in neutral graphene, which are shown to support confined states. An
analysis of conductance across these structures demonstrates that these
confined states create quantum interference effects which evidence their
presence.
