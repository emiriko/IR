We study the molecular correlations in a lattice model of a solution of a
low-solubility solute, with emphasis on how the thermodynamics is reflected in
the correlation functions. The model is treated in Bethe-Guggenheim
approximation, which is exact on a Bethe lattice (Cayley tree). The solution
properties are obtained in the limit of infinite dilution of the solute. With
$h_{11}(r)$, $h_{12}(r)$, and $h_{22}(r)$ the three pair correlation functions
as functions of the separation $r$ (subscripts 1 and 2 referring to solvent and
solute, respectively), we find for $r \geq 2$ lattice steps that
$h_{22}(r)/h_{12}(r) \equiv h_{12}(r)/h_{11}(r)$. This illustrates a general
theorem that holds in the asymptotic limit of infinite $r$. The three
correlation functions share a common exponential decay length (correlation
length), but when the solubility of the solute is low the amplitude of the
decay of $h_{22}(r)$ is much greater than that of $h_{12}(r)$, which in turn is
much greater than that of $h_{11}(r)$. As a consequence the amplitude of the
decay of $h_{22}(r)$ is enormously greater than that of $h_{11}(r)$. The
effective solute-solute attraction then remains discernible at distances at
which the solvent molecules are essentially no longer correlated, as found in
similar circumstances in an earlier model. The second osmotic virial
coefficient is large and negative, as expected. We find that the
solvent-mediated part $W(r)$ of the potential of mean force between solutes,
evaluated at contact, $r=1$, is related in this model to the Gibbs free energy
of solvation at fixed pressure, $\Delta G_p^*$, by $(Z/2) W(1) + \Delta G_p^*
\equiv p v_0$, where $Z$ is the coordination number of the lattice, $p$ the
pressure, and $v_0$ the volume of the cell associated with each lattice site. A
large, positive $\Delta G_p^*$ associated with the low solubility is thus
reflected in a strong attraction (large negative $W$ at contact), which is the
major contributor to the second osmotic virial coefficient. In this model, the
low solubility (large positive $\Delta G_p^*$) is due partly to an unfavorable
enthalpy of solvation and partly to an unfavorable solvation entropy, unlike in
the hydrophobic effect, where the enthalpy of solvation itself favors high
solubility, but is overweighed by the unfavorable solvation entropy.
