In this paper we study entanglement of the reduced density matrix of a
bipartite quantum system in a random pure state.
  It transpires that this involves the computation of the smallest eigenvalue
distribution of the fixed trace Laguerre ensemble of $N\times N$ random
matrices. We showed that for finite $N$ the smallest eigenvalue distribution
may be expressed in terms of Jack polynomials.
  Furthermore, based on the exact results, we found, a limiting distribution,
when the smallest eigenvalue is suitably scaled with $N$ followed by a large
$N$ limit. Our results turn out to be the same as the smallest eigenvalue
distribution of the classical Laguerre ensembles without the fixed trace
constraint. This suggests in a broad sense, the global constraint does not
influence local correlations, at least, in the large $N$ limit.
  Consequently, we have solved an open problem: The determination of the
smallest eigenvalue distribution of the reduced density matrix---obtained by
tracing out the environmental degrees of freedom---for a bipartite quantum
system of unequal dimensions.
