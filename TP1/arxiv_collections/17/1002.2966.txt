Quantum computers theoretically are able to solve certain problems more
quickly than any deterministic or probabilistic computers. A quantum computer
exploits the rules of quantum mechanics to speed up computations. However, one
has to mitigate the resulting noise and decoherence effects to avoid
computational errors in order to successfully build quantum computers.
  In this paper, we construct asymmetric quantum codes to protect quantum
information over asymmetric quantum channels, $\Pr Z \geq \Pr X$. Two generic
methods are presented to derive asymmetric quantum cyclic codes using the
generator polynomials and defining sets of classical cyclic codes.
Consequently, the methods allow us to construct several families of quantum
BCH, RS, and RM codes over asymmetric quantum channels. Finally, the methods
are used to construct families of asymmetric subsystem codes.
