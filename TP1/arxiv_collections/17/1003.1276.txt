Supersymmetry and extra dimension need not be mutually exclusive options of
physics for the TeV scale and beyond. In this paper, we envisage a
phenomenological scenario by embedding the 4d constrained minimal
supersymmetric standard model in a flat 5d $S_1 /Z_2$ orbifold, with the
inverse radius of compactification at the TeV scale. The gauge, Higgs and the
third generation matter multiplets are placed in the bulk. From a 4d
perspective, the bulk has N=2 supersymmetry which entails a special
non-renormalization theorem giving rise to a significant numerical impact on
the renormalization group running of various parameters. The brane
supersymmetry corresponds to N=1 which we assume to be broken in an unspecified
but phenomenologically acceptable way. Given this set-up, we study how the
gauge and Yukawa couplings and the N=1 brane supersymmetry breaking soft masses
run through the energy scale exciting the Kaluza-Klein states at regular
interval. We present our results by showing the allowed/disallowed zone in the
plane of the common scalar mass ($m_0$) and common gaugino mass ($M_{1/2}$).
Our plots are the first 5d versions of the often displayed 4d $m_0$--$M_{1/2}$
plots, and we provide reasons behind the differences between the 4d and 5d
plots.
