We address the properties of surface-wave solitons on the interface between a
semi-infinite homogeneous linear medium and a semi-infinite homogeneous
nonlinear nonlocal medium. The stability, energy flow and FWHM of the surface
wave solitons can be affected by the degree of nonlocality of the nonlinear
medium. We find that the refractive index difference affects the power
distribution of the surface solitons in two media. We show that the different
boundary values at the interface can lead to the different peak position of the
surface solitons, but it can not influence the solitons stability with a
certain degree of nonlocality.
