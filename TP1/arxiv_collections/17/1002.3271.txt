Peripheral collisions give access to a set of events where hot
quasi-projectile (QP) sources are produced exploring a large range of
excitation energy. In this range evaporation and multifragmentation are both
observed for a similar charge/size of the sources. In this work, this
experimental fact will be described in terms of coexistence of two classes of
events in the first order phase transition formalism. For this, a detailed
study of the experimental correlation between the size/charge of the biggest
cluster/fragment (Z1) and the excitation energy (E*) is made. Making the
parallel with the same correlation derived from the canonical ensemble
description, a first value of the latent heat and boundaries of spinodal and
coexistence zone are extracted.
