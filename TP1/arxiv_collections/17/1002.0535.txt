We present an alternative approach to the Bayesian nonparametric analysis of
conditional species richness under two-parameter Poisson Dirichlet priors. We
rely on a known characterization by deletion of classes property and on results
for Beta-Binomial distributions. Besides leading to simplified and much more
direct proofs, our proposal provides a new scale mixture representation of the
conditional asymptotic law.
