This paper presents a new face identification system based on Graph Matching
Technique on SIFT features extracted from face images. Although SIFT features
have been successfully used for general object detection and recognition, only
recently they were applied to face recognition. This paper further investigates
the performance of identification techniques based on Graph matching topology
drawn on SIFT features which are invariant to rotation, scaling and
translation. Face projections on images, represented by a graph, can be matched
onto new images by maximizing a similarity function taking into account spatial
distortions and the similarities of the local features. Two graph based
matching techniques have been investigated to deal with false pair assignment
and reducing the number of features to find the optimal feature set between
database and query face SIFT features. The experimental results, performed on
the BANCA database, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system for
automatic face identification.
