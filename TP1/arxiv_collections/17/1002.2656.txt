This is a follow up on our previous work in which we have presented a
modified, simpler version of the remarkable recent result of Christodoulou on
the formation of trapped surfaces. In this paper we prove two related results.
First we extend the semi-global existence result, which was at the heart of our
previous work, to an optimal range. We then use it to establish the formation
of surfaces with multiple pre-scarred angular components.
