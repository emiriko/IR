In wireless ad hoc networks, the absence of any control on packets
forwarding, make these networks vulnerable by various deny of service attacks
(DoS). A node, in wireless ad hoc network, counts always on intermediate nodes
to send these packets to a given destination node. An intermediate node, which
takes part in packets forwarding, may behave maliciously and drop packets which
goes through it, instead of forwarding them to the following node. Such
behavior is called black hole attack. In this paper, after having specified the
black hole attack, a secure mechanism, which consists in checking the good
forwarding of packets by an intermediate node, was proposed. The proposed
solution avoids the black hole and the cooperative black hole attacks.
Evaluation metrics were considered in simulation to show the effectiveness of
the suggested solution.
