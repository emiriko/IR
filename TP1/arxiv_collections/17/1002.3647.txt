In this article, the quantum Hamilton- Jacobi theory based on the position
dependent mass model is studied. Two effective mass functions having different
singularity structures are used to examine the Morse and Poschl- Teller
potentials. The residue method is used to obtain the solutions of the quantum
effective mass- Hamilton Jacobi equation. Further, it is shown that the
eigenstates of the generalized non-Hermitian Swanson Hamiltonian for Morse and
Poschl-Teller potentials can be obtained by using the Riccati equation without
solving a differential equation.
