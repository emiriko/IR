We study the problem of computing all Nash equilibria of a subclass of finite
normal form games. With algebraic characterization of the games, we present a
method for computing all its Nash equilibria. Further, we present a method for
deciding membership to the class of games with its related results. An
appendix, containing an example to show working of each of the presented
methods, concludes the work.
