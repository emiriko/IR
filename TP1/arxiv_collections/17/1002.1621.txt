We report on the dissipative dynamics of an entangled, bipartite interacting
system. We show how to induce and control the so-called early stage
disentanglement (and the delayed entanglement generation) dynamics by means of
a driving laser field. We demonstrate that some of the features currently
associated with pure non-Markovian effects in such entanglement behavior can
actually take place in Markovian environments if background noise QED
fluctuations are considered. We illustrate this for the case of a dimer
interacting molecular system for which emission rates, interaction strength,
and radiative corrections have been previously measured. We also show that even
in the absence of collective decay mechanisms and qubit-qubit interactions, the
entanglement still exhibits collapse-revival behavior. Our results indicate
that zero point energy fluctuations should be taken into account when
formulating precise entanglement dynamics statements.
