We present analysis of the three-dimensional shape of intracluster gas in
clusters formed in cosmological simulations of the Lambda-CDM cosmology and
compare it to the shape of dark matter distribution and the shape of the
overall isopotential surfaces. We find that in simulations with radiative
cooling, star formation and stellar feedback (CSF), intracluster gas outside
the cluster core is more spherical compared to non-radiative (NR) simulations,
while in the core the gas in the CSF runs is more triaxial and has a distinctly
oblate shape. The latter reflects the ongoing cooling of gas, which settles
into a thick oblate ellipsoid as it loses thermal energy. The shape of the gas
in the inner regions of clusters can therefore be a useful diagnostic of gas
cooling. We find that gas traces the shape of the underlying potential rather
well outside the core, as expected in hydrostatic equilibrium. At smaller
radii, however, the gas and potential shapes differ significantly. In the CSF
runs, the difference reflects the fact that gas is partly rotationally
supported. Interestingly, we find that in NR simulations the difference between
gas and potential shape at small radii is due to random gas motions, which make
the gas distribution more spherical than the equipotential surfaces. Finally,
we use mock Chandra X-ray maps to show that the differences in shapes observed
in three-dimensional distribution of gas are discernible in the ellipticity of
X-ray isophotes. Contrasting the ellipticities measured in simulated clusters
against observations can therefore constrain the amount of cooling of the
intracluster medium and the presence of random gas motions in cluster cores.
