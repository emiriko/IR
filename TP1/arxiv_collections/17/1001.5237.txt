We study the light quark mass dependence of the f_0(600), kappa(800),
rho(770) and K*(892) resonance parameters generated from elastic meson-meson
scattering using unitarized one-loop Chiral Perturbation Theory. First, we show
that it is possible to fit simultaneously all experimental scattering data up
to 0.8-1 GeV together with lattice results on decay constants and scattering
lengths up to a pion mass of 400 MeV, using chiral parameters compatible with
existing determinations. Then, the strange and non-strange quark masses are
varied from the chiral limit up to values of interest for lattice studies. In
these amplitudes, the mass and width of the rho(770) and K*(892) present a
similar and smooth quark mass dependence. In contrast, both scalars present a
similar non-analyticity at high quark masses. Nevertheless, the f_0(600)
dependence on the non-strange quark mass is stronger than for the kappa(800)
and the vectors. We also confirm the lattice assumption of quark mass
independence of the vector two-meson coupling that, in contrast, is violated
for scalars. As a consequence, vector widths are very well approximated by the
KSRF relation, and their masses are shown to scale like their corresponding
meson decay constants.
