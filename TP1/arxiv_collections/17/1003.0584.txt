We study a ring cavity filled with a slab of a right-handed material and a
slab of a left-handed material. Both layers are assumed to be nonlinear Kerr
media. First, we derive a model for the propagation of light in a left-handed
material. By constructing a mean-field model, we show that the sign of
diffraction can be made either positive or negative in this resonator,
depending on the thicknesses of the layers. Subsequently, we demonstrate that
the dynamical behavior of the modulation instability is strongly affected by
the sign of the diffraction coefficient. Finally, we study the dissipative
structures in this resonator and reveal the predominance of a two-dimensional
up-switching process over the formation of spatially periodic structures,
leading to the truncation of the homogeneous hysteresis cycle.
