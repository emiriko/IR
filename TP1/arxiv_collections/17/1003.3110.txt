This is the first paper of a series in which we will attempt to put
constraints on the flattening of dark halos in disk galaxies. We observe for
this purpose the HI in edge-on galaxies, where it is in principle possible to
measure the force field in the halo vertically and radially from gas layer
flaring and rotation curve decomposition respectively. In this paper, we define
a sample of 8 HI-rich late-type galaxies suitable for this purpose and present
the HI observations.
