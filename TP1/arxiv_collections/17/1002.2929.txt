We propose a holographic tachyon model of dark energy with interaction
between the components of the dark sector. The correspondence between the
tachyon field and the holographic dark energy densities allows the
reconstruction of the potential and the dynamics of the tachyon scalar field in
a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. We show that this model can
describe the observed accelerated expansion of our universe with a parameter
space given by the most recent observational results.
