Weak gravitational lensing of background galaxies is a unique, direct probe
of the distribution of matter in clusters of galaxies. We review several
important aspects of cluster weak gravitational lensing together with recent
advances in weak lensing techniques for measuring cluster lensing profiles and
constraining cluster structure parameters.
