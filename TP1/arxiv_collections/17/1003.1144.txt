Positive results of dark matter searches in DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA
experiments, being put together with the results of other groups, can imply
nontrivial particle physics solutions for cosmological dark matter. Stable
particles with charge -2, bound with primordial helium in O-helium "atoms"
(OHe), represent a specific Warmer than Cold nuclear-interacting form of dark
matter. Slowed down in the terrestrial matter, OHe is elusive for direct
methods of underground Dark matter detection used in cryogenic experiments.
However radiative capture of OHe by Na and I nuclei can lead to annual
variations of energy release in the interval of energy 2-5 keV in DAMA/NaI and
DAMA/LIBRA experiments.
