Nuclear collisions recreate conditions in the universe microseconds after the
Big Bang. Only a very small fraction of the emitted fragments are light nuclei,
but these states are of fundamental interest. We report the observation of
antihypertritons - composed of an antiproton, antineutron, and antilambda
hyperon - produced by colliding gold nuclei at high energy. Our analysis yields
70 +- 17 antihypertritons and 157 +- 30 hypertritons. The measured yields of
hypertriton (antihypertriton) and helium3 (antihelium3) are similar, suggesting
an equilibrium in coordinate and momentum space populations of up, down, and
strange quarks and antiquarks, unlike the pattern observed at lower collision
energies. The production and properties of antinuclei, and nuclei containing
strange quarks, have implications spanning nuclear/particle physics,
astrophysics, and cosmology.
