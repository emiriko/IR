Model checking has been used to verify the correctness of digital circuits,
security protocols, communication protocols, as they can be modelled by means
of finite state transition model. However, modelling the behaviour of hybrid
systems like UAVs in a Kripke model is challenging. This work is aimed at
capturing the behaviour of an UAV performing cooperative search mission into a
Kripke model, so as to verify it against the temporal properties expressed in
Computation Tree Logic (CTL). SMV model checker is used for the purpose of
model checking.
