For cavity-assisted optomechanical cooling experiments, it has been shown in
the literature that the cavity bandwidth needs to be smaller than the
mechanical frequency in order to achieve the quantum ground state of the
mechanical oscillator, which is the so-called resolved-sideband or good-cavity
limit. We provide a new but physically equivalent insight into the origin of
such a limit: that is information loss due to a finite cavity bandwidth. With
an optimal feedback control to recover those information, we can surpass the
resolved-sideband limit and achieve the quantum ground state. Interestingly,
recovering those information can also significantly enhance the optomechanical
entanglement. Especially when the environmental temperature is high, the
entanglement will either exist or vanish critically depending on whether
information is recovered or not, which is a vivid example of a quantum eraser.
