We associate to any (suitable) bicovariant differential calculus on a quantum
group a Cartan Hopf algebra which has a left, respectively right,
representation in terms of left, respectively right, Cartan calculus operators.
The example of the Hopf algebra associated to the $4D_+$ differential calculus
on $SU_q(2)$ is described.
