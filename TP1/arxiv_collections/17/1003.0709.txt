We analyze the errors arising from discrete readjustment of the hedging
portfolio when hedging options in exponential Levy models, and establish the
rate at which the expected squared error goes to zero when the readjustment
frequency increases. We compare the quadratic hedging strategy with the common
market practice of delta hedging, and show that for discontinuous option
pay-offs the latter strategy may suffer from very large discretization errors.
For options with discontinuous pay-offs, the convergence rate depends on the
underlying Levy process, and we give an explicit relation between the rate and
the Blumenthal-Getoor index of the process.
