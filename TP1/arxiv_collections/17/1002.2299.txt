We investigate the ground-state magnetic order of the spin-1/2 J1-J2
Heisenberg model on the square lattice with ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor
exchange J1<0 and frustrating antiferromagnetic next-nearest neighbor exchange
J2>0. We use the coupled-cluster method to high orders of approximation and
Lanczos exact diagonalization of finite lattices of up to N=40 sites in order
to calculate the ground-state energy, the spin-spin correlation functions, and
the magnetic order parameter. We find that the transition point at which the
ferromagnetic ground state disappears is given by J2^{c1}=0.393|J1| (exact
diagonalization) and J2^{c1}=0.394|J1| (coupled-cluster method). We compare our
results for ferromagnetic J1 with established results for the spin-1/2 J1-J2
Heisenberg model with antiferromagnetic J1. We find that both models (i.e.,
ferro- and antiferromagnetic J1) behave similarly for large J2, although
significant differences between them are observed for J2/|J1| \lesssim 0.6.
Although the semiclassical collinear magnetic long-range order breaks down at
J2^{c2} \approx 0.6J1 for antiferromagnetic J1, we do not find a similar
breakdown of this kind of long-range order until J2 \sim 0.4|J1| for the model
with ferromagnetic J1. Unlike the case for antiferromagnetic J1, if an
intermediate disordered phase does occur between the phases exhibiting
semiclassical collinear stripe order and ferromagnetic order for ferromagnetic
J1 then it is likely to be over a very small range below J2 \sim 0.4|J1|.
