We report on ground-based FTIR observations being performed within the
framework of the ESA-NIVR-KNMI project 2907 entitled "OMI validation by ground
based remote sensing: ozone columns and atmospheric profiles" for the purpose
of OMI data validation. FTIR observations were performed during the time frames
August-October 2005, June-October 2006 and March-October 2007, mostly under
cloud free and clear sky conditions and in some days from early morning to
sunset covering the full range of solar zenith angles possible. Ozone column
and ozone profile data were obtained for the year 2005 using spectral modeling
of the ozone spectral band profile near 9.6 microns with the MODTRAN3 band
model based on the HITRAN-96 molecular absorption database. The total ozone
column values retrieved from FTIR observations are biased low with respect to
OMI-DOAS data by 8-10 DU on average, where they have a relatively small
standard error of about 2%. FTIR observations for the year 2006 were simulated
by MODTRAN4 modeling. For the retrieval of ozone column estimates and
particularly ozone profiles from our FTIR observations, we used the following
data sources to as input files to construct the (a priori) information for the
model: satellite Aqua-AIRS water vapor and temperature profiles; Aura-MLS
stratospheric ozone profiles (version 1.5), TEMIS climatological ozone profiles
and the simultaneously performed surface ozone measurements. Ozone total
columns obtained from our FTIR observations for year 2006 with MODTRAN4
modeling are matching rather well with OMI-TOMS and OMI-DOAS data where
standard errors are 0.68% and 1.11%, respectively. AURA-MLS data which have
become available in 2007 allow us to retrieve tropospheric ozone profiles.
