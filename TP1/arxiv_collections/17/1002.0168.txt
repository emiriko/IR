Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik ask in arXiv:math.QA/0203060 if every fusion
category can be completely defined over a cyclotomic field. We show that this
is not the case: in particular one of the fusion categories coming from the
Haagerup subfactor arXiv:math.OA/9803044 and one coming from the newly
constructed extended Haagerup subfactor arXiv:0909.4099 can not be completely
defined over a cyclotomic field. On the other hand, we show that the double of
the even part of the Haagerup subfactor is completely defined over a cyclotomic
field. We identify the minimal field of definition for each of these fusion
categories, compute the Galois groups, and identify their Galois conjugates.
