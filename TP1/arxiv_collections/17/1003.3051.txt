Over the last decade there has been significant progress in developing the
concepts and technologies needed to produce, capture, accelerate and collide
high intensity beams of muons. At present, a high-luminosity multi-TeV muon
collider presents a viable option for the next generation lepton-lepton
collider, which is believed to be needed to fully explore high energy physics
in the era following the LHC discoveries. This article briefly reviews the
status of the accelerator R&D, addresses the question of the feasibility of a
Muon Collider, what needs to be done to prove it and presents projected
timeline of the project.
