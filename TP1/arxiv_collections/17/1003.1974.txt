We investigate the power dependence of pure spin current injection in GaAs
bulk and quantum-well samples by a quantum interference and control technique.
Spin separation is measured as a function of the relative strength of the two
transition pathways driven by two laser pulses. By keeping the relaxation time
of the current unchanged, we are able to relate the spin separation to the
injected average velocity. We find that the average velocity is determined by
the relative strength of the two transitions in the same way as in classical
interference. Based on this, we conclude that the density of injected pure spin
current increases monotonically with the excitation laser intensities. The
experimental results are consistent with theoretical calculations based on
Fermi's golden rule.
