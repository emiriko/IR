In this paper we discuss canonical analysis of SO(4,1) constrained BF theory.
The action of this theory contains topological terms appended by a term that
breaks the gauge symmetry down to the Lorentz subgroup SO(3,1). The equations
of motion of this theory turn out to be the vacuum Einstein equations. By
solving the B field equations one finds that the action of this theory contains
not only the standard Einstein-Cartan term, but also the Holst term
proportional to the inverse of the Immirzi parameter, as well as a combination
of topological invariants. We show that the structure of the constraints of a
SO(4,1) constrained BF theory is exactly that of gravity in Holst formulation.
We also briefly discuss quantization of the theory.
