The Tevatron heavy flavor physics program is in full swing. The rapid
increase in the size of data samples is allowing significant improvements of
previous results, and opens the doors to new possibilities. A further doubling
of the current integrated luminosity is expected in the next couple of years.
This report summarizes the main current results and future prospects.
