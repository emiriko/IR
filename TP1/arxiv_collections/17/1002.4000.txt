Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC) allows multiple parties to compute some
function of their inputs without disclosing the actual inputs to one another.
Secure sum computation is an easily understood example and the component of the
various SMC solutions. Secure sum computation allows parties to compute the sum
of their individual inputs without disclosing the inputs to one another. In
this paper, we propose a modified version of our ck-Secure Sum protocol with
more security when a group of the computing parties conspire to know the data
of some party.
