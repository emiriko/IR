The Majorana representation of symmetric N-qubit states is employed here to
investigate how correlation information of the whole pure symmetric state gets
imprinted in its parts. It is shown that reduced states of (N - 1) qubits
uniquely specify the entire class of pure N qubit states containing two
distinct spinors.
