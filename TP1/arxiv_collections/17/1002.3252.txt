We study electron transport through a triple quantum dot in ring
configuration at finite bias. In particular, we analyze the influence of a gate
voltage that detunes one of the dots, such that one branch of the
interferometer becomes off-resonant. It turns out that then interference
effects fade away, i.e., the current becomes independent of a penetrating flux
and the detuning. The noise properties which are characterized by the
full-counting statistics, however, are governed by bunching effects that may be
tuned by the gate voltage. Analytical results for limiting cases support this
picture. A possible application is the construction of current sources with
widely tunable shot noise properties.
