Leftist grammars [Motwani et al., STOC 2000] are special semi-Thue systems
where symbols can only insert or erase to their left. We develop a theory of
leftist grammars seen as word transformers as a tool toward rigorous analyses
of their computational power. Our main contributions in this first paper are
(1) constructions proving that leftist transformations are closed under
compositions and transitive closures, and (2) a proof that bounded reachability
is NP-complete even for leftist grammars with acyclic rules.
