We investigate the formation of the one-dimensional channels on the
topological surface under the gate electrode. The energy dispersion of these
channels is almost linear in the momentum with the velocity sensitively
depending on the strength of the gate voltage. The energy is also restricted to
be positive or negative depending on the strength of the gate voltage.
Consequently, the local density of states near the gated region has an
asymmetric structure with respect to zero energy. In the presence of the
electron-electron interaction, the correlation effect can be tuned by the gate
voltage. We also suggest a tunneling experiment to verify the presence of these
bound states.
