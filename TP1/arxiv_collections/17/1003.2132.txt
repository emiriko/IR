Electroweak transition form factors of heavy meson decays are important
ingredients in the extraction of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix
elements from experimental data. In this work, within a light-front framework,
we calculate electroweak transition form factor for the semileptonic decay of
$D$ mesons into a pion or a kaon. The model results underestimate in both cases
the new data of CLEO for the larger momentum transfers accessible in the
experiment. We discuss possible reasons for that in order to improve the model.
