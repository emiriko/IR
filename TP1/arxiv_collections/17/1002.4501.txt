Graph invariants provide a powerful analytical tool for investigation of
abstract structures of graphs. They, combined in convenient relations, carry
global and general information about a graph and its various substructures such
as cycle structures, factors, matchings, colorings, coverings, and so on, whose
discovery is the primary problem of graph theory. The major goal of this paper
is to catalogue all pure relations between basic invariants of a graph and its
large cycle structures, namely Hamilton, longest and dominating cycles and some
their generalizations. Basic graph invariants and pure relations allow to focus
on results having no forerunners. These simplest kind of "ancestors" form a
source from which nearly all possible hamiltonian results can be developed
further by various additional new ideas, generalizations, extensions,
restrictions and structural limitations, as well as helping researchers to make
clear and simple imagination about "complicated" developmental mechanisms in
the area.
