A BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) superconductor, which is placed out of
equilibrium, can develop quantum instabilities, which manifest themselves in
oscillations of the superconductor's order parameter (pairing amplitude
$\Delta$). These instabilities are a manifestations of the Cooper instability.
Inelastic collisions are essential in resolving those instabilities.
Incorporating the quantum instabilities and collisions in a unified approach
based on Richardson's exact solution of the pairing Hamiltonian, we find that a
BCS superconductor may end up in a state in which the spectrum has more than
one gap.
