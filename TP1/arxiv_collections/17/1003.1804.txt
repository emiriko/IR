We demonstrate that repeated measurements in disordered systems can induce
quantum anti-Zeno effect under certain condition to enhance quantum transport.
The enhancement of energy transfer is really exhibited with a simple model
under repeated measurements. The optimal measurement interval for the anti-Zeno
effect and the maximal efficiency of energy transfer are specified in terms of
the relevant physical parameters. Since the environment acts as frequent
measurements on the system, the decoherence-induced energy transfer, which has
been discussed recently for photosynthetic complexes, may be interpreted in
terms of the anti-Zeno effect. We further find an interesting phenomenon, where
local decoherence or repeated measurements may even promote entanglement
generation between the non-local sites.
