On 16 March 2005, the Cluster spacecraft crossed a shock almost at the
transition between the quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel regimes
($\theta_{Bn}=46^{\circ}$) preceded by an upstream low-frequency ($\sim$ 0.02
Hz in the spacecraft frame) wavetrain observed for more than 10 mn. The wave
semi-cycle nearest to the shock was found to grow in time, steepen and reflect
an increasing fraction of the incoming ions. This gives strong indication that
this pulsation is becoming a new shock front, standing $\sim 5\lambda_p$
upstream of the main front and growing to shock-like amplitude on a time-scale
of $\sim 35\Omega_p$. Downstream of the main shock transition, remnants of an
older front are found indicating that the reformation is cyclic. This provides
a unique example where the dynamics of shock reformation can be sequentially
followed. The process shares many characteristics with simulations of reforming
quasi-parallel shocks.
