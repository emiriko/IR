We describe an algorithm for the factorization of non-commutative polynomials
over a field. The first sketch of this algorithm appeared in an unpublished
manuscript (literally hand written notes) by James H. Davenport more than 20
years ago. This version of the algorithm contains some improvements with
respect to the original sketch. An improved version of the algorithm has been
fully implemented in the Axiom computer algebra system.
