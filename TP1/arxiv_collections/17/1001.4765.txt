We relate the notions of BB-tilting and perverse derived equivalence at a
vertex. Based on these notions, we define mutations of algebras, leading to
derived equivalent ones.
  We present applications to endomorphism algebras of cluster-tilting objects
in 2-Calabi-Yau categories and to algebras of global dimension at most 2.
