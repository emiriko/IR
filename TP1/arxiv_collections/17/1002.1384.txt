Consider jump-type stochastic differential equations with the drift,
diffusion and jump terms. Logarithmic derivatives of densities for the solution
process are studied, and the Bismut-Elworthy-Li type formulae can be obtained
under the uniformly elliptic condition on the coefficients of the diffusion and
jump terms. Our approach is based upon the Kolmogorov backward equation by
making full use of the Markovian property of the process.
