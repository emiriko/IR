We propose a protocol for the creation of photonic
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and linear cluster states emitted from a single
atom---or ion---coupled to an optical cavity field. The method is based on
laser pulses with different polarizations and exploits the atomic transition
amplitudes to state-selectively achieve the desired transitions. The scheme
lies within reach of current technology.
