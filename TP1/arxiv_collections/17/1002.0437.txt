In this work we present a detailed computational study of structural and
elastic properties of cubic AlGaInN alloys in the framework of Keating valence
force field model, for which we perform accurate parametrization based on state
of the art DFT calculations. When analyzing structural properties, we focus on
concentration dependence of lattice constant, as well as on the distribution of
the nearest and the next nearest neighbour distances. Where possible, we
compare our results with experiment and calculations performed within other
computational schemes. We also present a detailed study of elastic constants
for AlGaInN alloy over the whole concentration range. Moreover, we include
there accurate quadratic parametrization for the dependence of the alloy
elastic constants on the composition. Finally, we examine the sensitivity of
obtained results to computational procedures commonly employed in the Keating
model for studies of alloys.
