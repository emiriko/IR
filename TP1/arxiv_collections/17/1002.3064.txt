We study entanglement dynamics of the three-qubit system which is initially
prepared in pure Greenberger-Horne- Zeilinger (GHZ) or W state and transmitted
through one of the Pauli channels $\sigma_z, \, \sigma_x, \, \sigma_y$ or the
depolarizing channel. With the help of the lower bound for three-qubit
concurrence we show that the W state preserves more entanglement than the GHZ
state in transmission through the Pauli channel $\sigma_z$. For the Pauli
channels $\sigma_x, \, \sigma_y$ and the depolarizing channel, however, the
entanglement of the GHZ state is more resistant against decoherence than the
W-type entanglement. We also briefly discuss how the accuracy of the lower
bound approximation depends on the rank of the density matrix under
consideration.
