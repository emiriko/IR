This paper is devoted to the extension of the recently proposed conditional
symmetry method to first order nonhomogeneous quasilinear systems which are
equivalent to homogeneous systems through a locally invertible point
transformation. We perform a systematic analysis of the rank-1 and rank-2
solutions admitted by the shallow water wave equations in (2 + 1) dimensions
and construct the corresponding solutions of the rotating shallow water wave
equations. These solutions involve in general arbitrary functions depending on
Riemann invariants, which allow us to construct new interesting classes of
solutions.
