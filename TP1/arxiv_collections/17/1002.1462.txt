We argue that the Quadratic Spinor Lagrangian approach allows us to approach
the problem of forming a geometrical condensate of spinorial tetrads in a
natural manner. This, along with considerations involving the discrete
symmetries of lattice triangulations, lead us to discover that the
quasiparticles of such a condensate are tetrahedra with braids attached to its
faces and that these braid attachments correspond to the preons in
Bilson-Thompson's model of elementary particles. These "spatoms" can then be
put together in a tiling to form more complex structures which encode both
geometry and matter in a natural manner. We conclude with some speculations on
the relation between this picture and the computational universe hypothesis.
