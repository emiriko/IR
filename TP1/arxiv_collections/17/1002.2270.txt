We present a review of features due to resonant tunnelling in transport
spectroscopy experiments on quantum dots and single donors. The review covers
features attributable to intrinsic properties of the dot as well as extrinsic
effects, with a focus on the most common operating conditions. We describe
several phenomena that can lead to apparently identical signatures in a bias
spectroscopy measurement, with the aim of providing experimental methods to
distinguish between their different physical origins. The correct
classification of the resonant tunnelling features is an essential requirement
to understand the details of the confining potential or predict the performance
of the dot for quantum information processing.
