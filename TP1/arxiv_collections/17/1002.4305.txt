Polycrystalline Sr0.6K0.4Fe2As2 samples with various Pb additions (0-20 wt%)
were prepared using a one-step solid state reaction. X-ray diffraction analysis
shows no evidence for chemical reaction between the Pb and the FeAs-based
superconductor. However, the presence of the Pb can affect the microstructure
and superconducting properties of the final products. The critical transition
temperature Tc indicates no degradation up to 20 wt% Pb addition, and dramatic
improvements of magnetic Jc and irreversibility field Hirr were observed for
appropriate Pb concentration. Transport critical current property of pure and
Pb-added Sr0.6K0.4Fe2As2 tapes was also measured by a four-probe technique, and
a remarkable enhancement of Jc at low fields was detected for the Pb added
tapes.
