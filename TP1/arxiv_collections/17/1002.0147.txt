Low loss magnetic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes characterized by
enhanced electrical field component and subwavelength confinement on the
dielectric and negative-index metamaterial interface are presented. We
demonstrate a possibility of storage and perfect retrieval of the low loss
magnetic SPP fields by using a photon echo quantum memory on Raman atomic
transition. We describe specific properties of the proposed technique which
opens a possibility for efficient nano scale multi-mode quantum memory.
