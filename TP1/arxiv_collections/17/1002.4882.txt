We study the tunneling magneto-transport properties of the Ferromagnetic
Insulator-Normal Insulator-Ferromagnetic Insulator(F$\mid$N$\mid$F) and
Ferromagnetic Insulator-Barrier Insulator-Ferromagnetic Insulator
(F$\mid$B$\mid$F) junctions on the surface of topological insulator in which
in-plane magnetization directions of both ferromagnetic sides can be parallel
and antiparallel. We derive analytical expressions for electronic conductances
of the two mentioned junctions with both parallel and antiparallel directions
of magnetization and using them calculate magnetoresistance of the two
junctions. We use thin barrier approximation for investigating the
F$\mid$B$\mid$F junction. We find that although magnetoresistance of the
F$\mid$N$\mid$F and F$\mid$B$\mid$F junctions are tunable by changing the
strength of magnetization texture, they show different behaviors with variation
of magnetization. In contrast to the magnetoresistance of F$\mid$N$\mid$F,
magnetoresistance of F$\mid$B$\mid$F junctions shows very smooth enhance by
increasing the strength of magnetization. We suggest an experimental set up to
detect our predicted effects.
