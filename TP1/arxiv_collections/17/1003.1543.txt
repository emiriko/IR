A rephasing invariant parametrization is introduced for three flavor neutrino
mixing. For neutrino propagation in matter, these parameters are shown to obey
evolution equations as functions of the induced neutrino mass. These equations
are found to preserve (approximately) some characteristic features of the
mixing matrix, resulting in solutions which exhibit striking patterns as the
induced mass varies. The approximate solutions are compared to numerical
integrations and found to be quite accurate.
