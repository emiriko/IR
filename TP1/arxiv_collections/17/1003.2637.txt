Our numerical simulations show that the reconnection of magnetic field
becomes fast in the presence of weak turbulence in the way consistent with the
Lazarian and Vishniac (1999) model of fast reconnection. We trace particles
within our numerical simulations and show that the particles can be efficiently
accelerated via the first order Fermi acceleration. We discuss the acceleration
arising from reconnection as a possible origin of the anomalous cosmic rays
measured by Voyagers.
