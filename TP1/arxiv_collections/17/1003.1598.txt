Biologically-inspired methods such as evolutionary algorithms and neural
networks are proving useful in the field of information fusion. Artificial
Immune Systems (AISs) are a biologically-inspired approach which take
inspiration from the biological immune system. Interestingly, recent research
has show how AISs which use multi-level information sources as input data can
be used to build effective algorithms for real time computer intrusion
detection. This research is based on biological information fusion mechanisms
used by the human immune system and as such might be of interest to the
information fusion community. The aim of this paper is to present a summary of
some of the biological information fusion mechanisms seen in the human immune
system, and of how these mechanisms have been implemented as AISs
