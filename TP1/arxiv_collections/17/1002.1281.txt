The question whether liquid atomization (or pulverization) resorts to
instability dynamics (through refinements of Rayleigh-Plateau, Rayleigh-Taylor
or Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism) or to turbulent cascades similar to Richardson
and Kolmogorov first ideas seems to be still open. In this paper, we report
experimental evidences that both mechanisms are needed to explain the spray
drop PDF obtained from an industrial nozzle. Instability of Rayleigh-Taylor
kind governs the size of the largest droplets while the smallest ones obey a
PDF given by a turbulent cascading mechanism resulting in a log-L\'evy stable
law of stability parameter close to 1.68. This value, very close to the inverse
of the Flory exponent, can be related to a recent model for intermittency
modeling stemming from self-avoiding random vortex stretching.
