Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and electroresistance (CER) induced by the
electric field in spinel multiferroic CdCr2S4 are reported. It is found that a
metal-insulator transition (MIT) in CdCr2S4 is triggered by the electrical
field. In magnetic fields, the resistivity of CdCr2S4 responds similarly to
that of CMR manganites. Combing previous reports, these findings make CdCr2S4
the unique compound to possess all four properties of the colossal
magnetocapacitive (CMC), colossal electrocapacitive (CEC), CER, and CMR. The
present results open a new venue for searching new materials to show CMR by
tuning electric and magnetic fields.
