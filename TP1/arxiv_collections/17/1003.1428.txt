The coupled motion of ions in a radiofrequency trap has been used to connect
the frequency- dependent laser-induced heating of a sympathetically cooled
spectroscopy ion with changes in the fluorescence of a laser-cooled control
ion. This technique, sympathetic heating spectroscopy, is demonstrated using
two isotopes of calcium. In the experiment, a few scattered photons from the
spectroscopy ion are transformed into a large deviation from the steady-state
fluorescence of the control ion. This allows us to detect an optical transition
where the number of scattered photons is below our fluorescence detection
limit. Possible applications of the technique to molecular ion spectroscopy are
briefly discussed.
