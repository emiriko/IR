Cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy (CE-DFCS) has demonstrated
powerful potential for trace gas detection based on its unique combination of
high bandwidth, rapid data acquisition, high sensitivity, and high resolution,
which is unavailable with conventional systems. However, previous
demonstrations have been limited to proof-of-principle experiments or studies
of fundamental laboratory science. Here we present the development of CE-DFCS
towards an industrial application -- measuring impurities in arsine, an
important process gas used in III-V semiconductor compound manufacturing. A
strongly absorbing background gas with an extremely complex, congested, and
broadband spectrum renders trace detection exceptionally difficult, but the
capabilities of CE-DFCS overcome this challenge and make it possible to
identify and quantify multiple spectral lines associated with water impurities.
Further, frequency combs allow easy access to new spectral regions via
efficient nonlinear optical processes. Here, we demonstrate detection of
multiple potential impurities across 1.75-1.95 um (5710-5130 cm-1) with
single-channel detection sensitivities of ~1 x 10-7 cm-1 Hz-1/2 in nitrogen and
identify water doped in arsine with a sensitivity of ~1 x 10-6 cm-1 Hz-1/2.
