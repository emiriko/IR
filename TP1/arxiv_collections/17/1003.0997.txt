White dwarfs typically have masses in a narrow range centered at about 0.6
solar masses (Msun). Only a few ultra-massive white dwarfs (M>1.2 Msun) are
known. Those in binary systems are of particular interest because a small
amount of accreted mass could drive them above the Chandrasekhar limit, beyond
which they become gravitationally unstable. Using data from the XMM-Newton
satellite, we show that the X-ray pulsator RX J0648.0-4418 is a white dwarf
with mass > 1.2 Msun, based only on dynamical measurements. This ultra-massive
white dwarf in a post-common envelope binary with a hot subdwarf can reach the
Chandrasekhar limit, and possibly explode as a Type Ia supernova, when its
helium-rich companion will transfer mass at an increased rate through Roche
lobe overflow.
