This Resource Letter provides a guide to the literature on Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD), the relativistic quantum field theory of the strong
interactions. Journal articles, books, and other documents are cited for the
following topics: quarks and color, the parton model, Yang-Mills theory,
experimental evidence for color, QCD as a color gauge theory, asymptotic
freedom, QCD for heavy hadrons, QCD on the lattice, the QCD vacuum, pictures of
quark confinement, early and modern applications of perturbative QCD, the
determination of the strong coupling and quark masses, QCD and the hadron
spectrum, hadron decays, the quark-gluon plasma, the strong nuclear
interaction, and QCD's role in nuclear physics.
  The letter {E} after an item indicates elementary level or material of
general interest to persons becoming informed in the field. The letter {I}, for
intermediate level, indicates material of a somewhat more specialized nature,
and the letter {A} indicates rather specialized or advanced material.
