Simulations of standard 1D and 2D quantum walks have been performed within
Quantum Computer Simulator (QCS system) environment and with the use of GPU
supported by CUDA technology. In particular, simulations of quantum walks may
be seen as an appropriate benchmarks for testing calculational power of the
processors used. It was demonstrated by a series of tests that the use of CUDA
based technology radically increases the computational power compared to the
standard CPU based computations.
