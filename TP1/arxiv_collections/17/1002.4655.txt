FLUKA is a multipurpose Monte Carlo code, which can transport particles over
a wide range of energies in user-defined geometries. Here we present a new
FLUKA library, which allows the interaction and propagation of high energy
cosmic rays in the Earth atmosphere and the transport of high energy muons in
underground/underwater environments
