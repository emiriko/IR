In this paper we introduce a diagrammatic equation for the planar sector of
square non hermitian random matrix models strongly reminiscent of Polchinski's
equation in quantum field theory. Our fundamental equation is first obtained by
a graph counting argument and subsequently derived independently by a precise
saddle point analysis of the corresponding random matrix integral. We solve the
equation perturbatively for a generic model and conclude by exhibiting two
duality properties of the perturbative solution.
