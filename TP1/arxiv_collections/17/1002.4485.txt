Protein-protein interactions comprise both transport and reaction steps.
During the transport step, anisotropy of proteins and their complexes is
important both for hydrodynamic diffusion and accessibility of the binding
site. Using a Brownian dynamics approach and extensive computer simulations, we
quantify the effect of anisotropy on the encounter rate of ellipsoidal
particles covered with spherical encounter patches. We show that the encounter
rate $k$ depends on the aspect ratios $\xi$ mainly through steric effects,
while anisotropic diffusion has only a little effect. Calculating analytically
the crossover times from anisotropic to isotropic diffusion in three
dimensions, we find that they are much smaller than typical protein encounter
times, in agreement with our numerical results.
