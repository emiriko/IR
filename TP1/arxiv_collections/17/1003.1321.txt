Previous studies have used numerical methods to optimize the
hyperpolarizability of a one-dimensional quantum system. These studies were
used to suggest properties of one-dimensional organic molecules, such as the
degree of modulation of conjugation, that could potentially be adjusted to
improve the nonlinear-optical response. However, there were no conditions set
on the optimized potential energy function to ensure that the resulting
energies were consistent with what is observed in real molecules. Furthermore,
the system was placed into a one-dimensional box with infinite walls, forcing
the wavefunctions to vanish at the ends of the molecule. In the present work,
the walls are separated by a distance much larger than the molecule's length;
and, the variations of the potential energy function are restricted to levels
that are more typical of a real molecule. In addition to being a more
physically-reasonable model, our present approach better approximates the bound
states and approximates the continuum states - which are usually ignored. We
find that the same universal properties continue to be important for optimizing
the nonlinear-optical response, though the details of the wavefunctions differ
from previous result.
