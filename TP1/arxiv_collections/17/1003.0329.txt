We examine two dimensional mixture of single-component fermions and dipolar
bosons. We calculate the self-enregies of the fermions in the normal state and
the Cooper pair channel by including first order vertex correction to derive a
modified Eliashberg equation. We predict appearance of superfluids with various
non-standard pairing symmetries at experimentally feasible transition
temperatures within the strong-coupling limit of the Eliashberg equation.
Excitations in these superfluids are anyonic and follow non-Abelian statistics.
