The classical integrable structure of Z_4-graded supercoset sigma-models,
arising in the AdS/CFT correspondence, is formulated within the R-matrix
approach. The central object in this construction is the standard R-matrix of
the Z_4-twisted loop algebra. However, in order to correctly describe the Lax
matrix within this formalism, the standard inner product on this twisted loop
algebra requires a further twist induced by the Zhukovsky map, which also plays
a key role in the AdS/CFT correspondence. The non-ultralocality of the
sigma-model can be understood as stemming from this latter twist since it leads
to a non skew-symmetric R-matrix.
