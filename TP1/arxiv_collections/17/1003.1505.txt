We study the impact of geometry on magnetostatically frustrated single-domain
nanomagnet arrays. We examine square and hexagonal lattice arrays, as well as a
brickwork geometry that combines the anisotropy of the square lattice and the
topology of the hexagonal lattice. We find that the more highly frustrated
hexagonal lattice allows for the most thorough minimization of the
magnetostatic energy, and that the pair-wise correlations between moments
differ qualitatively between hexagonal and brickwork lattices, although they
share the same lattice topology. The results indicate that the symmetry of
local interaction is more important than overall lattice topology in the
accommodation of frustrated interactions.
