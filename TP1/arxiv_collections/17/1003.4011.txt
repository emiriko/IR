Efforts to extract information on magnitude and density dependence of the
nuclear symmetry energy are discussed. The utilized data include those on mass
dependence of the excitation energies to the isobaric analog states of ground
states, as well as data on the diffusion of isospin in heavy-ion reactions.
Results following from different observables are compared.
