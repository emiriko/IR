In the 70's Schelling introduced a multi-agent model to describe the
segregation dynamics that may occur with individuals having only weak
preferences for 'similar' neighbors. Recently variants of this model have been
discussed, in particular, with emphasis on the links with statistical physics
models. Whereas these models consider a fixed number of agents moving on a
lattice, here we present a version allowing for exchanges with an external
reservoir of agents. The density of agents is controlled by a parameter which
can be viewed as measuring the attractiveness of the city-lattice. This model
is directly related to the zero-temperature dynamics of the
Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) spin-1 model, with kinetic constraints. With a
varying vacancy density, the dynamics with agents making deterministic
decisions leads to a new variety of "phases" whose main features are the
characteristics of the interfaces between clusters of agents of different
types. The domains of existence of each type of interface are obtained
analytically as well as numerically. These interfaces may completely isolate
the agents leading to another type of segregation as compared to what is
observed in the original Schelling model, and we discuss its possible
socio-economic correlates.
