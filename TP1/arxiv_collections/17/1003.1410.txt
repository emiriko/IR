Unlike static documents, version controlled documents are continuously edited
by one or more authors. Such collaborative revision process makes traditional
modeling and visualization techniques inappropriate. In this paper we propose a
new representation based on local space-time smoothing that captures important
revision patterns. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework using
experiments on synthetic and real-world data.
