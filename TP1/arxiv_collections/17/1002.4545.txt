In the first part of this paper we give an elementary proof of the fact that
if an infinite matrix $A$, which is invertible as a bounded operator on
$\ell^2$, can be uniformly approximated by banded matrices then so can the
inverse of $A$. We give explicit formulas for the banded approximations of
$A^{-1}$ as well as bounds on their accuracy and speed of convergence in terms
of their band-width. In the second part we apply these results to covariance
matrices $\Sigma$ of Gaussian processes and study mixing and beta mixing of
processes in terms of properties of $\Sigma$. Finally, we note some
applications of our results to statistics.
