The recent results of the Pierre Auger Observatory on the possible
correlation of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays events and several nearby discrete
sources could be the starting point of a new era with charged particles
astronomy. In this paper we introduce a simple model to determine the effects
of any local distribution of sources on the expected flux. We consider two
populations of sources: faraway sources uniformly distributed and local point
sources. We study the effects on the expected flux of the local distribution of
sources, referring also to the set of astrophysical objects whose correlation
with the Auger events is experimentally claimed.
