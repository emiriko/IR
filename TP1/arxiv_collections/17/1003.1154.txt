A new strategy to control the flow of surface plasmon polaritons at metallic
surfaces is presented. It is based on the application of the concept of
Transformation Optics to devise the optical parameters of the dielectric medium
placed on top of the metal surface. We describe the general methodology for the
design of Transformation-Optical devices for surface plasmons and analyze, for
proof-of-principle purposes, three representative examples with different
functionalities: a beam shifter, a cylindrical cloak and a ground-plane cloak.
