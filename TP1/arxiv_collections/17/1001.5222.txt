In this article we provide an algebraic characterization of those groups of
$PSL(3,\Bbb{C})$ whose limit set in the Kulkarni sense has, exactly, four lines
in general position. Also we show that, for this class of groups, the
equicontinuity set of the group is the largest open set where the group acts
discontinuously and agrees with the discontinuity set of the group.
