The Fe isotope effect (Fe-IE) on the transition temperature T_c and the
crystal structure was studied in the Fe chalcogenide superconductor FeSe_1-x by
means of magnetization and neutron powder diffraction (NPD). The substitution
of natural Fe (containing \simeq 92% of ^{56}Fe) by its lighter ^{54}Fe isotope
leads to a shift of T_c of 0.22(5)K corresponding to an Fe-IE exponent of
\alpha_Fe=0.81(15). Simultaneously, a small structural change with isotope
substitution is observed by NDP which may contribute to the total Fe isotope
shift of T_c.
