A few supergravity solutions representing configurations of NS5-branes admit
exact conformal field theory (CFT) description. Deformations of these solutions
should be described by exactly marginal operators of the corresponding
theories. We briefly review the essentials of these constructions and present,
as a new case, the operators responsible for turning on angular momentum.
