This paper presents a realization for the reliable and fast startup of
distributed systems written in Erlang. The traditional startup provided by the
Erlang/OTP library is sequential, parallelization usually requires unsafe and
ad-hoc solutions. The proposed method calls only for slight modifications in
the Erlang/OTP stdlib by applying a system dependency graph. It makes the
startup safe, quick, and it is equally easy to use in newly developed and
legacy systems.
