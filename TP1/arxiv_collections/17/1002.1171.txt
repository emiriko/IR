We present sensitive Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) observations of
SiO masers in the inner parsecs of the Galactic center (GC). We detected five
SiO J=2-1, v=1 (86 GHz) masers in the innner 25 arcsec (1 pc) of the GC. All
the detected 86 GHz SiO masers are previously known SiO J=1-0, v=1 (43 GHz)
masers and associated with late-type stars. Eighteen 43 GHz SiO masers were
detected within 50 arcsec (2 pc) of Sagittarius A*. Among them, seven are
detected for the first time, which brings the total number of 43 GHz SiO masers
to 22 in this region.
