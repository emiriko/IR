We consider the new agegraphic model of dark energy with a varying
gravitational constant, $G$, in a non-flat universe. We obtain the equation of
state and the deceleration parameters for both interacting and noninteracting
new agegraphic dark energy. We also present the equation of motion determining
the evolution behavior of the dark energy density with a time variable
gravitational constant. Finally, we generalize our study to the case of viscous
new agegraphic dark energy in the presence of an interaction term between both
dark components.
