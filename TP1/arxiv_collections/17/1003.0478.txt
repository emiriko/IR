We report the first observation of extreme wave events (rogue waves) in
parametrically driven capillary waves. Rogue waves are observed above a certain
threshold in forcing. Above this threshold, frequency spectra broaden and
develop exponential tails. For the first time we present evidence of strong
four-wave coupling in non-linear waves (high tricoherence), which points to
modulation instability as the main mechanism in rogue waves. The generation of
rogue waves is identified as the onset of a distinct tail in the probability
density function of the wave heights. Their probability is higher than expected
from the measured wave background.
