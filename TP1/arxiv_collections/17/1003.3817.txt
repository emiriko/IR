Do phenomenological master equations with memory kernel always describe a
non-Markovian quantum dynamics characterized by reverse flow of information? Is
the integration over the past states of the system an unmistakable signature of
non-Markovianity? We show by a counterexample that this is not always the case.
We consider two commonly used phenomenological integro-differential master
equations describing the dynamics of a spin 1/2 in a thermal bath. By using a
recently introduced measure to quantify non-Markovianity [H.-P. Breuer, E.-M.
Laine, and J. Piilo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 210401 (2009)] we demonstrate that
as far as the equations retain their physical sense, the key feature of
non-Markovian behavior does not appear in the considered memory kernel master
equations. Namely, there is no reverse flow of information from the environment
to the open system. Therefore, the assumption that the integration over a
memory kernel always leads to a non-Markovian dynamics turns out to be
vulnerable to phenomenological approximations. Instead, the considered
phenomenological equations are able to describe time-dependent and
uni-directional information flow from the system to the reservoir associated to
time-dependent Markovian processes.
