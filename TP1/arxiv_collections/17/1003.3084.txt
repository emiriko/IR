Deviations from the average can provide valuable insights about the
organization of natural systems. The present article extends this important
principle to the systematic identification and analysis of singular motifs in
complex networks. Six measurements quantifying different and complementary
features of the connectivity around each node of a network were calculated, and
multivariate statistical methods applied to identify singular nodes. The
potential of the presented concepts and methodology was illustrated with
respect to different types of complex real-world networks, namely the US air
transportation network, the protein-protein interactions of the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the Roget thesaurus networks. The obtained
singular motifs possessed unique functional roles in the networks. Three
classic theoretical network models were also investigated, with the
Barab\'asi-Albert model resulting in singular motifs corresponding to hubs,
confirming the potential of the approach. Interestingly, the number of
different types of singular node motifs as well as the number of their
instances were found to be considerably higher in the real-world networks than
in any of the benchmark networks.
