We consider massive IIA supergravity on the resolved conifold with
$SU(2)_L^2\times U(1)_R$ symmetry and $\N=1$ supersymmetry. A one dimensional
family of such regular solutions was found by Brandhuber and we propose this to
be the mirror to one dimension of the moduli space of IIB solutions on the
deformed conifold found by Butti et al. This family provides a description of
the geometric transition in terms of a smooth family of flux backgrounds. The
remaining dimension of the moduli space of Butti et al contains the baryonic
branch of Klebanov-Strassler and we propose that the mirror of this is either
some stringy resolution of a family of singular solutions found here or must be
entirely non-geometric.
