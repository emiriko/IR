We have studied resistive bistability (memory) effects in junctions based on
metal oxides, with a focus on sample-to-sample reproducibility which is
necessary for the use of such junctions as crosspoint devices of hybrid
CMOS/nanoelectronic circuits. Few-nm-thick layers of NbOx, CuOx and TiOx have
been formed by thermal and plasma oxidation, at various deposition and
oxidation conditions, both with or without rapid thermal post-annealing (RTA).
The resistive bistability effect has been observed for all these materials,
with particularly high endurance (over 1000 switching cycles) obtained for
single-layer TiO2 junctions, and the best reproducibility reached for
multi-layer junctions of the same material. Fabrication optimization has
allowed us to improve the OFF/ON resistance ratio to about 1000, but the
sample-to-sample reproducibility is so far lower than that required for large
scale integration.
