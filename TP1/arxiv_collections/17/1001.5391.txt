In this short note we would like to provide some useful remarks on our
previous work about the piezonuclear decay of Thorium and in general about the
methods and protocols that we used in the experiments on piezonuclear
reactions. The purpose of these remarks is to highlight the critical points of
the experiments and equipment in order to design future experiments that may
obtain positive evidences or that can be as more comparable to previous ones as
possible.
