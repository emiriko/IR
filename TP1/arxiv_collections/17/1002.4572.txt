Bound states of two weakly interactive massive particles are studied. It is
assumed that the WIMPonium is formed due to the gravitational interaction,
since the weak interaction can sometimes be repulsive. The lifetimes of the
spontaneous emission of gravitational radiation and of the WIMPs annihilation
into a pair of gravitons are computed, and are shown to be many orders of
magnitude larger than the age of the universe.
