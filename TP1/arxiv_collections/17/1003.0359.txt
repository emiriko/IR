Organic solar cells have the potential to be low-cost and efficient solar
energy converters, with a promising energy balance. They are made from
carbon-based semiconductors, which exhibit favourable light absorption and
charge generation properties, and can be manufactured by low temperature
processes such as printing from solvent-based inks, which are compatible with
flexible plastic substrates or even paper. In this review, we will present an
overview of the physical function of organic solar cells, their
state-of-the-art performance and limitations, as well as novel concepts to
achieve a better material stability and higher power conversion efficiencies.
We will also briefly review processing and cost in view of the market
potential.
