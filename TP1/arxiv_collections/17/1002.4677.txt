SDSSJ125733.63+542850.5 (hereafter SDSSJ1257+5428) is a compact white dwarf
binary from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that exhibits high-amplitude radial
velocity variations on a period of 4.56 hours. While an initial analysis
suggested the presence of a neutron star or black-hole binary companion, a
follow-up study concluded that the spectrum was better understood as a
combination of two white dwarfs. Here we present optical spectroscopy and
ultraviolet fluxes which directly reveal the presence of the second white dwarf
in the system. SDSSJ1257+5428's spectrum is a composite, dominated by the
narrow-lined spectrum from a cool, low gravity white dwarf (Teff ~6300K, log g
= 5 to 6.6) with broad wings from a hotter, high-mass white dwarf companion
(11,000 to 14,000K; ~ 1Msun). The high-mass white dwarf has unusual line
profiles which lack the narrow central core to Halpha that is usually seen in
white dwarfs. This is consistent with rapid rotation with v sin i = 500 to
1750km/s, although other broadening mechanisms such as magnetic fields,
pulsations or a helium-rich atmosphere could also be contributory factors. The
cool component is a puzzle since no evolutionary model matches its combination
of low gravity and temperature. Within the constraints set by our data,
SDSSJ1257+5428 could have a total mass greater than the Chandrasekhar limit and
thus be a potential Type Ia supernova progenitor. However, SDSSJ1257+5428's
unusually low mass ratio q ~ 0.2 suggests that it is more likely that it will
evolve into an accreting double white dwarf (AM CVn star).
