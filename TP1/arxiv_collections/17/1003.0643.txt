In this paper we establish global existence and uniqueness of the solution to
the three-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson system in presence of point charges in
case of repulsive interaction. The present analysis extends an analogeous
two-dimensional result by Caprino and Marchioro [On the plasma-charge model, to
appear in Kinetic and Related Models (2010)].
