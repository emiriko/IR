A spin (dependent) system treatment of gravity is adopted akin to the
Sen-Ashtekar treatment. Time is reinserted into the space ``fluid'' at the
quantum Level. This time - the Lorentzian one- is shown to be a vorticity of a
``fluid particle'' of the space and the effect is integrated over all the fluid
particles to incorporate time in quantum gravity. This spacetime is viewed as a
fluid of future light cones called the SU(2) dipoles of causality here in the
paper.The future light cone structure is soldered internally to the new
variables derived in this paper to accomodate a background free physics of
quantum strings. The emergence of spacetime is shown to be a first order phase
transition and that of separation of gravity from the unified field to be a
second order phase transition. For the former case the cosmic time is chosen as
the order parameter and for the latter case the angular momentum is chosen as
the order parameter. A quantum blackhole thus nucleates at transition
temperature which is the Planck temperature, $\tau_{pl}$. Then the SU(2)
dipoles enable interpretation of this black hole as a gravity gauge
SL(2,$\mathbb{C}$) dual of the U(1) gauge ferromagnetic phase. The usual QFT
interpretation of this effect is the existence of locally Lorentzian
spacetimes.
