We show the existence of an entangled nonequilibrium state at very high
temperatures when two linearly coupled harmonic oscillators are parametrically
driven and dissipate into two independent heat baths. This result has a twofold
meaning: first, it fundamentally shifts the classical-quantum border to
temperatures as high as our experimental ability allows us, and second, it can
help increase by at least one order of magnitude the temperature at which
current experimental setups are operated.
