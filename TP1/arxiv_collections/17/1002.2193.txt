Although content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is not a new subject, it keeps
attracting more and more attention, as the amount of images grow tremendously
due to internet, inexpensive hardware and automation of image acquisition. One
of the applications of CBIR is fetching images from a database. This paper
presents a new method for automatic image retrieval using moment invariants and
image entropy, our technique could be used to find semi or perfect matches
based on query by example manner, experimental results demonstrate that the
purposed technique is scalable and efficient.
