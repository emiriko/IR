The analysis of diffusive energy spreading in quantized chaotic driven
systems, leads to a universal paradigm for the emergence of a quantum anomaly.
In the classical approximation a driven chaotic system exhibits stochastic-like
diffusion in energy space with a coefficient $D$ that is proportional to the
intensity $\epsilon^2$ of the driving. In the corresponding quantized problem
the coherent transitions are characterized by a generalized Wigner time
$t_{\epsilon}$, and a self-generated (intrinsic) dephasing process leads to
non-linear dependence of $D$ on $\epsilon^2$.
