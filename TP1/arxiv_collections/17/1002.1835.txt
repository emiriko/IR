Higgs boson production by the gluon fusion and its decay into two photons at
the LHC are investigated in the context of the gauge-Higgs unification
scenario. The qualitative behaviors for these processes in the scenario are
quite distinguishable from those of the Standard Model and the universal extra
dimension scenario because of the overall sign difference for the effective
couplings induced by one-loop corrections through Kaluza-Klein modes.
