By comparing experiments that use Andreev Saint-James reflection, Raman
scattering (B2g) and neutron scattering on the (cuprate) high temperature
superconductors, evidence is found, that all of the techniques can measure the
order parameter of these superconductors. The order parameter is the energy
needed to take a superconducting boson out of the condensate. It has the same
temperature and doping dependence as the superconducting transition temperature
Tc. This condensation energy is different from the pairing energy (as measured
by the pseudogap) except for the doping x = 0.27, where the two energies
coincide: this latter situation represents the BCS case, which in the view
presented here is a special case in the BCS-BEC cross-over situation
appropriate for the (cuprate) high temperature superconductors.
