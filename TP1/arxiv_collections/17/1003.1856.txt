We study the universal characteristics of the shape of a polymer chain in an
environment with correlated structural obstacles, applying the
field-theoretical renormalization group approach. Our results qualitatively
indicate an increase of the asymmetry of the polymer shape in crowded
environment comparing with the pure solution case.
