We study by numerical simulation a disordered Bose-Hubbard model in
low-dimensional lattices. We show that a proper characterization of the phase
diagram on finite disordered clusters requires the knowledge of probability
distributions of physical quantities rather than their averages. This holds in
particular for determining the stability region of the Bose-glass phase, the
compressible but not superfluid phase that exists whenever disorder is present.
This result suggests that a similar statistical analysis should be performed
also to interpret experiments on cold gases trapped in disordered lattices,
limited as they are to finite sizes.
