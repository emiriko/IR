We revisit the semiclassical computation of the fluctuation spectrum around
different circular string solutions in AdS_5xS^5 and AdS_4xCP^3, starting from
the Green-Schwarz action. It has been known that the results for these
frequencies obtained from the algebraic curve and from the worldsheet
computations sometimes do not agree. In particular, different methods give
different results for the half-integer shifts in the mode numbers of the
frequencies. We find that these discrepancies can be removed if one carefully
takes into account the transition matrices in the spin bundle over the target
space.
