The evaluation of variation in oscillation time period of a simple pendulum
as its mass varies proves a rich source of discussion in a physics class-room,
overcoming erroneous notions carried forward by students as to what constitutes
a pendulum's length due to picking up only the results of approximations and
ignoring the rigorous definition. The discussion also presents a exercise for
evaluating center of mass of geometrical shapes and system of bodies. In all,
the pedagogical value of the problem is worth both theoretical and experimental
efforts. This article discusses the theoretical considerations.
