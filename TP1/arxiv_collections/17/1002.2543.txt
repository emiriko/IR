This paper aims to give further evidence for the existence of low mass exotic
baryons. Narrow structures in baryonic missing mass or baryonic invariant mass
were observed during the last twelve years. Since their evidence is still under
debate, various data, measured with incident hadrons, by different
collaborations, are reanalyzed to bring evidence on these narrow exotic
baryonic resonances excited in charge-exchange reactions. These structures are
clearly exotic as there is no room for them in the $qqq$ configurations: their
width is smaller than the widths of "classical" baryonic resonances, moreover
some of the masses lie below the pion threshold mass.
