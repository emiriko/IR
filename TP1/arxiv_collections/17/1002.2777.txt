Hard X-ray and extremely low energy bulk-sensitive photoelectron spectroscopy
has been performed in the temperature range of 100-330 K for Fe3O4. In the high
temperature phase just above the Verwey transition, the intensity at the Fermi
level (EF) is still negligible, but it increases gradually with further
increasing the temperature (250 K, 330 K) in consistence with the temperature
dependence of the conductivity. The spectral behaviors near EF with temperature
are well explained by the model, which takes the polaron effect into account.
