We studied the formation and evolution of low-mass stars within halos with
high concentration of dark matter (DM) particles, using a highly sophisticated
expression to calculate the rate at which DM particles are captured inside the
star. For very high DM densities in the host halo (\rho_{\chi}>10^10 GeV cm^-3
for a 1 M_{\odot} star), we found that young stars stop sooner their
gravitational collapse in the pre-Main Sequence phase, reaching states of
equilibrium in which DM annihilation is their only source of energy. The lower
effective temperature of these stars, which depends on the properties of the DM
particles and DM halo, may be used as an alternative method to investigate the
nature of DM.
