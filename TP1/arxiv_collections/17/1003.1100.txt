Detailed similarities between polarization states of light and ballistic
charge carriers in graphene are derived. Based on these, the optical equivalent
of quantum wavefunctions, Dirac equation, and the effect of an electrostatic
potential are found, and the quantum analog of the refractive index of light
and of the optical composition law of reflection coefficients are obtained. The
differences between the behavior of quantum wavefunctions in graphene and
electromagnetic fields, due to the chiral symmetry of ballistic charge carriers
that cannot be mimicked in classical polarization optics, are also evidenced.
