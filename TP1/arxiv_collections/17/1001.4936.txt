We consider a model where electroweak symmetry breaking is driven by
Technicolor dynamics with minimal particle content required for walking
coupling and saturation of global anomalies. Furthermore, the model features
three additional Weyl fermions singlet under Technicolor interactions, which
provide for a one-loop unification of the Standard Model gauge couplings. Among
these extra matter fields exists a possible candidate for weakly interacting
dark matter. We evaluate the relic densities and find that they are sufficient
to explain the cosmological observations and avoid the experimental limits from
earth-based searches. Hence, we establish a non-supersymmetric framework where
hierarchy and naturality problems are solved, coupling constant unification is
achieved and a plausible dark matter candidate exists.
