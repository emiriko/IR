Let $\mathcal{P}$ be an $n$-point subset of Euclidean space and $d\geq 3$ be
an integer. In this paper we study the following question: What is the smallest
(normalized) relative change of the volume of subsets of $\mathcal{P}$ when it
is projected into $\RR^d$. We prove that there exists a linear mapping
$f:\mathcal{P} \mapsto \RR^d$ that relatively preserves the volume of all
subsets of size up to $\lfloor d/2\rfloor$ within at most a factor of
$O(n^{2/d}\sqrt{\log n \log\log n})$.
