A proton activation data library for 682 nuclides from 1-H to 210-Po in the
energy range from 150 MeV up to 1 GeV was developed. To calculate proton
activation data, the MCNPX 2.6.0 and CASCADE/INPE codes were chosen. Different
intranuclear cascade, preequilibrium, and equilibrium nuclear reaction models
and their combinations were used. The optimum calculation models have been
chosen on the basis of statistical correlations for calculated and experimental
proton data taken from the EXFOR library of experimental nuclear data. All the
data are written in ENDF-6 format. The library is called HEPAD-2008
(High-Energy Proton Activation Data). A revision of IEAF-2005 neutron
activation data library has been performed: A set of nuclides for which the
cross-section data can be (and were) updated using more modern and improved
models is specified, and the corresponding calculations have been made in the
present work. The new version of the library is called IEAF-2009. The
HEPAD-2008 and IEAF-2009 are merged to the final HEAD-2009 library.
