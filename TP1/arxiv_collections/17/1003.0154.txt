Atomic layer graphene possesses wavelength-insensitive ultrafast saturable
absorption, which can be exploited as a full-band mode locker. Taking advantage
of the wide band saturable absorption of the graphene, we demonstrate
experimentally that wide range (1570 nm - 1600nm) continuous wavelength tunable
dissipative solitons could be formed in an erbium doped fiber laser mode locked
with few layer graphene.
