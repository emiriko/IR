A wideband analog correlator has been constructed for the Yuan-Tseh Lee Array
for Microwave Background Anisotropy. Lag correlators using analog multipliers
provide large bandwidth and moderate frequency resolution. Broadband IF
distribution, backend signal processing and control are described. Operating
conditions for optimum sensitivity and linearity are discussed. From
observations, a large effective bandwidth of around 10 GHz has been shown to
provide sufficient sensitivity for detecting cosmic microwave background
variations.
