The quark-lepton complementarity (QLC) is very suggestive in understanding
possible relations between quark and lepton mixing matrices. We explore the QLC
relations in all the possible angle-phase parametrizations and point out that
they can approximately hold in five parametrizations. Furthermore, the
vanishing of the smallest mixing angles in the CKM and PMNS matrices can make
sure that the QLC relations exactly hold in those five parametrizations.
Finally, the sensitivity of the QLC relations to radiative corrections is also
discussed.
