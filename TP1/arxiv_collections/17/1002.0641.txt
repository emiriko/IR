We study solutions for boson stars in multiscalar theory. We start with
simple models with N scalar theories. Our purpose is to study the models in
which the mass matrix of scalars and the scalar couplings are given by an
extended method of dimensional deconstruction. The properties of the boson
stars are investigated by the Newtonian approximation with the large coupling
limit.
