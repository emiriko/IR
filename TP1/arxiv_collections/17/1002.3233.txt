With the use of the semiclassical Boltzmann equation we have calculated a
direct current (d.c) in undoped zigzag carbon nanotube (CN) by mixing two
coherent electromagnetic waves with commensurate frequencies i.e and . This
effect is attributed to the nonparabolicity of the electron energy band which
is very strong in carbon nanotubes. We observed that the current is negative
similar to that observed in superlattice. However if the phase shift lies
between and there is an inversion and the current becomes positive. It is
interesting to note that exhibit negative differential conductivity as expected
for d.c through carbon nanotubes. This method can be used to generate terahertz
radiation in carbon nanotubes. It can also be used in determining the
relaxation time of electrons in carbon nanotubes
