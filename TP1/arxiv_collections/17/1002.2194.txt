In this paper, we have to concentrate on implementation of Weighted
Clustering Algorithm with the help of Genetic Algorithm (GA).Here we have
developed new algorithm for the implementation of GA-based approach with the
help of Weighted Clustering Algorithm (WCA) (4). ClusterHead chosen is a
important thing for clustering in adhoc networks. So, we have shown the
optimization technique for the minimization of ClusterHeads(CH) based on some
parameter such as degree difference, Battery power (Pv), degree of mobility,
and sum of the distances of a node in adhoc networks. ClusterHeads selection of
adhoc networks is an important thing for clustering. Here, we have discussed
the performance comparison between deterministic approach and GA based
approach. In this performance comparison, we have seen that GA does not always
give the good result compare to deterministic WCA algorithm. Here we have seen
connectivity (connectivity can be measured by the probability that a node is
reachable to any other node.) is better than the deterministic WCA algorithm
(4).
