We consider the corrections that arise at one loop when integrating out heavy
fields in supersymmetric models. We show that, in type-I see-saw models,
complex A and B terms of the heavy right-handed neutrino give radiative
contributions to the neutron EDM, as well as new dominant contributions to the
electron EDM. Type-II and type-III see-saw also predict a pure gauge correction
that makes complex the masses of the weak gauginos. All the see-saw models can
predict observable EDM for the electron and for the neutron in a peculiar
ratio.
