The tensor rank (also known as generalized Schmidt rank) of multipartite pure
states plays an important role in the study of entanglement classifications and
transformations. We employ powerful tools from the theory of homogeneous
polynomials to investigate the tensor rank of symmetric states such as the
tripartite state $\ket{W_3}=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(\ket{100}+\ket{010}+\ket{001})$
and its $N$-partite generalization $\ket{W_N}$. Previous tensor rank estimates
are dramatically improved and we show that (i) three copies of $\ket{W_3}$ has
rank either 15 or 16, (ii) two copies of $\ket{W_N}$ has rank $3N-2$, and (iii)
$n$ copies of $\ket{W_N}$ has rank O(N). A remarkable consequence of these
results is that certain multipartite transformations, impossible even
probabilistically, can become possible when performed in multiple copy bunches
or when assisted by some catalyzing state. This effect is impossible for
bipartite pure states.
