Thousands of plant and animal species have been observed to have
superhydrophobic surfaces that lead to various novel behaviors [1-5]. These
observations have inspired attempts to create artificial superhydrophobic
surfaces, given such surfaces have multitudinous applications [6-13].
Superhydrophobicity is an enhanced effect of surface roughness and there are
known relationships that correlate surface roughness and superhydrophobicity,
based on the underlying physics. However, while these recognize the level of
roughness they tell us little about the independent effect of its scale. Thus,
they are not capable of explaining why naturally occurring such surfaces
commonly have micron-submicron sizes. Here we report on the discovery of a new
relation, its physical basis and its experimental verification. The results
reveal that scaling-down roughness into the micro-submicron range is a unique
and elegant strategy to not only achieve superhydrophobicity but also to
increase its stability against environmental disturbances. This new relation
takes into account the previously overlooked but key fact that the accumulated
line energy arising from the numerous solid-water-air intersections that can be
distributed in the apparent contact area when air packets are trapped at small
scales on the surface can dramatically increase as the roughness scale shrinks.
This term can in fact become the dominant contributor to the surface energy and
so becomes crucial for accomplishing superhydrophobicity. These findings guide
fabrication of stable super water-repellant surfaces.
