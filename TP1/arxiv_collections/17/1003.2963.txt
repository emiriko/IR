The single inclusive spectrum of charged particles with transverse momenta
pT=3-150 GeV/c measured at midrapidity by the CDF experiment in
proton-antiproton (p-pbar) collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV is compared to
next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD calculations using the most recent
parametrizations of the parton distributions and parton-to-hadron fragmentation
functions. Above pT~20 GeV/c, there is a very sizeable disagreement of the
Tevatron data compared to the NLO predictions and to xT-scaling expectations,
suggesting a problem in the experimental data. We also present the predictions
for the pT-differential charged hadron spectra and the associated theoretical
uncertainties for proton-proton (p-p) collisions at LHC energies
(sqrt(s)=0.9-14 TeV). Two procedures to estimate the charged hadron spectra at
LHC heavy-ion collision energies (sqrt(s)=2.76,5.5 TeV) from p-p measurements
are suggested.
