This paper presents our approach of the radio interface problematic for
Wireless Sensor Network. We introduce the WSN context and constraints
associated. We propose an IR-UWB solution and illustrate why it could be a
viable solution for WSN. A high level modelling and simulation platform for
IR-UWB radio interface is proposed on Matlab. It allows us to determine
according to BER versus Eb/N0 criteria and the WSN constraints what kind of
design is more adequate. Moreover, a co-design co-simulation platform Matlab
VHDL is proposed here. Using this platform we designed IR-UWB transceiver
having reconfigurable capabilities, such as data rate reconfiguration, time
hopping code, spectrum occupation and radio range reconfiguration.
