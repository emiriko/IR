Einstein-aether theory is general relativity coupled to a dynamical, unit
timelike vector. If this vector is restricted in the action to be hypersurface
orthogonal, the theory is identical to the IR limit of the extension of Horava
gravity proposed by Blas, Pujol\`{a}s and Sibiryakov. Hypersurface orthogonal
solutions of Einstein-aether theory are solutions to the IR limit of this
theory, hence numerous results already obtained for Einstein-aether theory
carry over.
