The stable chromomagnetic vacuum for SU(2) Yang-Mills theory found earlier is
shown to give a model for confinement in QCD, using Wilson loop, and a linear
potential (in the leading order) for quark-antiquark interaction. The
coefficient $k$ in this potential is found to be $\sim 0.25 GeV^2$, in
satisfactory agreement with non-relativistic potential model calculations for
charmonium. At finite temperature, the real effective energy density found
earlier is used to obtain estimates of the deconfining temperature agreeing
reasonably with lattice study for SU(2).
