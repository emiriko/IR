We present some of the universal properties in ion-atom interaction derived
from a newly formulated quantum-defect theory for $-1/r^4$ type of long-range
interactions. For bound states, we present the universal bound spectrum, namely
the equivalent of the Rydberg formula, for ion-atom systems. For scattering, we
introduce the concept of universal resonance spectrum to give a systematic
understanding of many resonances present in ion-atom scattering. The theory
further provides a method for an accurate spectroscopic determination of the
atomic polarizability. It also suggests the existence of atom-like molecules,
in which multiple atoms orbit around a heavy ion.
