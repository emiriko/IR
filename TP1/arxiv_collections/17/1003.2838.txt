In this article, we study the ${(1/2)^-}$ and ${(3/2)^-}$ heavy and doubly
heavy baryon states $\Sigma_Q({(1/2)^-})$, $\Xi'_Q({(1/2)^-})$,
$\Omega_Q({(1/2)^-})$, $\Xi_{QQ}({(1/2)^-})$, $\Omega_{QQ}({(1/2)^-})$,
$\Sigma_Q^*({(3/2)^-})$, $\Xi_Q^*({(3/2)^-})$, $\Omega_Q^*({(3/2)^-})$,
$\Xi^*_{QQ}({(3/2)^-})$ and $\Omega^*_{QQ}({(3/2)^-})$ by subtracting the
contributions from the corresponding ${1\over 2}^+$ and ${3\over 2}^+$ heavy
and doubly heavy baryon states with the QCD sum rules in a systematic way, and
make reasonable predictions for their masses.
