Next-to-leading order corrections are an important aspect in the extraction
of the Cabibbo- Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements $|V_{\text{cb}}|$ and
$|V_{\text{ub}}|$ at $B$-factory experiments: virtual and real photons couple
to all charged particles of the decay, alter the resulting decay dynamics and
enhance the total decay rate. We present a phenomenologically motivated model
and a Monte-Carlo implementation to study electromagnetic radiative corrections
to differential and total decay rates for semileptonic $B$-meson decays into
exclusive pseudoscalar and scalar final states and apply it to $B \to D \, l \,
\nu$ and $B \to \pi \, l \, \nu$, and $B \to D_0^* \, l \, \nu$ decays,
respectively. We study such corrections with a phenomenological picture of
point-like mesons (with some structure-dependent corrections), which is valid
in the low-energy region of the photons and whose results we extrapolate over
the complete phase space. The largest quantifiable uncertainty is due to the
approximative matching to the Standard Model. In addition unknown
structure-dependent contributions and model dependencies might have an impact
on our findings.
