Using electron spin resonance (ESR) technique we have obtained data
evidencing the existence of magnetic vortices in high-temperature
superconductors at temperatures above the critical one $T_c$. We have studied
magnetic excitations in \bis single crystals above $T_c$ with the method of
surface spin decoration. The surface layer of diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl was used
as a sensitive probe of magnetic field distortions. The temperature dependence
of the ESR signal parameters has indicated that far above $T_c$ the magnetic
flux of a sample is affected by the superconducting order parameter
fluctuations while close to $T_c$ its changes are due to vortex-type
excitations.
