We propose a dynamic version of the three-dimensional translation gauge
theory of dislocations. In our approach, we use the notions of the dislocation
density and dislocation current tensors as translational field strengths and
the corresponding response quantities (pseudomoment stress, dislocation
momentum flux). We derive a closed system of field equations in a very elegant
quasi-Maxwellian form as equations of motion for dislocations. In this
framework, the dynamical Peach-Koehler force density is derived as well.
Finally, the similarities and the differences between the Maxwell field theory
and the dislocation gauge theory are presented.
