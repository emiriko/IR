Aims. The Large Binocular Cameras (LBC) are two twin wide field cameras (FOV
~ 23'x 25') mounted at the prime foci of the 8.4m Large Binocular Telescope
(LBT). We performed a weak lensing analysis of the z=0.288 cluster Abell 611 on
g-band data obtained by the blue-optimized Large Binocular Camera in order to
estimate the cluster mass.
  Methods. Due to the complexity of the PSF of LBC, we decided to use two
different approaches, KSB and Shapelets, to measure the shape of background
galaxies and to derive the shear signal produced by the cluster. Then we
estimated the cluster mass with both aperture densitometry and parametric model
fits.
  Results. The combination of the large aperture of the telescope and the wide
field of view allowed us to map a region well beyond the expected virial radius
of the cluster and to get a high surface density of background galaxies (23
galaxies/arcmin^2). This made possible to estimate an accurate mass for Abell
611. We find that the mass within 1.5 Mpc is: $(8\pm3)\times 10^{14} M_\odot$
from the aperture mass technique and $(5\pm1)\times 10^{14} M_\odot$ using the
model fitting by a NFW mass density profile, for both Shapelets and KSB
methods. This analysis demonstrates that LBC is a powerful instrument for weak
gravitational lensing studies.
