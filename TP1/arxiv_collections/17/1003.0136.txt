We discuss the laser frequency comb as a near infrared astronomical
wavelength reference, and describe progress towards a near infrared laser
frequency comb at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and at the
University of Colorado where we are operating a laser frequency comb suitable
for use with a high resolution H band astronomical spectrograph.
