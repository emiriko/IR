We investigate the equilibrium of a fluid in contact with a solid boundary
through a density-functional theory. Depending on the conditions, the fluid can
be in one phase, gas or liquid, or two phases, while the wall induces an
external field acting on the fluid particles. We first examine the case of a
liquid film in contact with the wall. We construct bifurcation diagrams for the
film thickness as a function of the chemical potential. At a specific value of
the chemical potential, two equally stable films, a thin one and a thick one,
can coexist. As saturation is approached, the thickness of the thick film tends
to infinity. This allows the construction of a liquid-gas interface that forms
a well defined contact angle with the wall.
