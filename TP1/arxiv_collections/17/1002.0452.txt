By computing the Dirac operator spectrum by means of Numerical Stochastic
Perturbation Theory, we aim at throwing some light on the widely accepted
picture for the mechanism which is behind the Bank-Casher relation. The latter
relates the chiral condensate to an accumulation of eigenvalues in the low end
of the spectrum. This can be in turn ascribed to the usual mechanism of
repulsion among eigenvalues which is typical of quantum interactions. First
results appear to confirm that NSPT can indeed enable us to inspect a huge
reshuffling of eigenvalues due to quantum repulsion.
