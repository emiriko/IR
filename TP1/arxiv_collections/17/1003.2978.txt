We introduce a new probabilistic technique for finding 'almost-periods' of
convolutions of subsets of groups. This gives results similar to the
Bogolyubov-type estimates established by Fourier analysis on abelian groups but
without the need for a nice Fourier transform to exist. We also present
applications, some of which are new even in the abelian setting. These include
a probabilistic proof of Roth's theorem on three-term arithmetic progressions
and a proof of a variant of the Bourgain-Green theorem on the existence of long
arithmetic progressions in sumsets A+B that works with sparser subsets of {1,
..., N} than previously possible. In the non-abelian setting we exhibit
analogues of the Bogolyubov-Freiman-Halberstam-Ruzsa-type results of additive
combinatorics, showing that product sets A B C and A^2 A^{-2} are rather
structured, in the sense that they contain very large iterated product sets.
This is particularly so when the sets in question satisfy small-doubling
conditions or high multiplicative energy conditions. We also present results on
structures in product sets A B. Our results are 'local' in nature, meaning that
it is not necessary for the sets under consideration to be dense in the ambient
group. In particular, our results apply to finite subsets of infinite groups
provided they 'interact nicely' with some other set.
