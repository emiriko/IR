We investigate Anderson localization of light as occurring in ultra-short
excitations. A theory based on time dependent coupled-mode equations predicts
universal features in the spectrum of the transmitted pulse. In particular, the
process of strong localization of light is shown to correspond to the formation
of peaks in both the amplitude and in the group delay of the transmitted pulse.
Parallel ab-initio simulations made with Finite-Difference Time Domain codes
and molecular dynamics confirm theoretical predictions, while showing that
there exist an optimal degree of disorder for the strong localization.
