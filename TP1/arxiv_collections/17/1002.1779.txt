The idea of the meson cloud approach in the chiral quark model has been
extended to include gluon cloud in order to achieve the parton densities in the
nucleon, based on the constitute quark framework. The splitting function of the
quark to the quark-meson and quark-gluon at low $Q^2$ value are used to obtain
parton densities in the constituent quark. The phenomenological constituent
model is employed to extract the parton distributions in the proton at low
$Q^2$ value. Since we have access to the parton densities at low $Q^2$, we are
able to obtain $F_{2}(x,Q^2)$ structure function at low $Q^2$ value. The result
is in good agreement with available experimental data and some theoretical
models. To confirm the validity of our calculations, the fraction of total
momentum of proton which is carried by gluon at high $Q^2$ and also the
Gottfried sum rule are computed. The results are in good agreement with what
are expected.
