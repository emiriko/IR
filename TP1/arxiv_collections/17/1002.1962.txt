Deviations from general relativity, such as could be responsible for the
cosmic acceleration, would influence the growth of large scale structure and
the deflection of light by that structure. We clarify the relations between
several different model independent approaches to deviations from general
relativity appearing in the literature, devising a translation table. We
examine current constraints on such deviations, using weak gravitational
lensing data of the CFHTLS and COSMOS surveys, cosmic microwave background
radiation data of WMAP5, and supernova distance data of Union2. Markov Chain
Monte Carlo likelihood analysis of the parameters over various redshift ranges
yields consistency with general relativity at the 95% confidence level.
