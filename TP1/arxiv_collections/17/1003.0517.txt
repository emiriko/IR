We report on measurements of single electron tunneling through a quantum dot
using a quantum point contact as non-invasive charge detector with fast time
response. We elaborate on the unambiguous identification of individual
tunneling events and determine the distribution of transferred charges, the
so-called full counting statistics. We discuss our data analysis, including the
error estimates of the measurement, and show that the quality of our
experimental results is sufficiently high to extract cumulants of the
distribution up to the 20th order for short times.
