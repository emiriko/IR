We have performed a systematic study of the Bremsstrahlung emission from the
electrons in the plasma of a commercial 14.5 GHz Electron-Cyclotron Resonance
Ion Source. The electronic spectral temperature and the product of ionic and
electronic densities of the plasma are measured by analyzing the Bremsstrahlung
spectra recorded for several rare gases (Ar, Kr, Xe) as a function of the
injected power. Within our uncertainty, we find an average temperature of ? 48
keV above 100W, with a weak dependency on the injected power and gas
composition. Charge state distributions of extracted ion beams have been
determined as well, providing a way to disentangle the ionic density from the
electronic density. Moreover X-ray emission from highly charged argon ions in
the plasma has been observed with a high-resolution mosaic crystal
spectrometer, demonstrating the feasibility for high-precision measurements of
transition energies of highly charged ions, in particular of the magnetic
dipole (M1) transition of He-like of argon ions.
