The purpose of this paper is to describe an analogue of a construction of
Costello in the context of finite-dimensional differential graded Frobenius
algebras which produces closed forms on the decorated moduli space of Riemann
surfaces. We show that this construction extends to a certain natural
compactification of the moduli space which is associated to the modular closure
of the associative operad, due to the absence of ultra-violet divergences in
the finite-dimensional case. We demonstrate that this construction is
equivalent to the "dual construction" of Kontsevich.
