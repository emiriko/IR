It is shown that when an few-cycle, relativistically intense, p-polarized
laser pulse is obliquely incident on overdense plasma, the surface electrons
may form ultra-thin, highly compressed layers, with a width of a few
nanometers. These electron "nanobunches" emit synchrotron radiation coherently.
We calculate the one-dimensional synchrotron spectrum analytically and obtain a
slowly decaying power-law with an exponent of 4/3 or 6/5. This is much flatter
than the 8/3 power of the BGP (Baeva-Gordienko-Pukhov) spectrum, produced by a
relativistically oscillating bulk skin layer. The synchrotron spectrum cut-off
frequency is defined either by the electron relativistic $\gamma$-factor, or by
the thickness of the emitting layer. In the numerically demonstrated, locally
optimal case, the radiation is emitted in the form of a single attosecond
pulse, which contains almost the entire energy of the full optical cycle.
