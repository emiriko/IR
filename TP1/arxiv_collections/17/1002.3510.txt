The spin susceptibility in the uranium ferromagnet superconductors is
calculated.
  There is shown that the absence of superconductivity paramagnetic limitation
for the field directions perpendicular to the direction of the spontaneous
magnetization is explained by the itinerant ferromagnet band splitting rather
than by a rotation of magnetization toward the external field direction. The
qualitative description of the upper critical field temperature dependence is
given.
