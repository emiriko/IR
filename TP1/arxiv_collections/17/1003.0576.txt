We study the coupling of a tetraquark system to an exchanged meson-meson
channel, using a pure gluonic theory based four-quark potential {\em matrix}
model which is known to fit well a large number of data points for lattice
simulations of different geometries of a four-quark system. We find that if
this minimal-area-based potential matrix replaces the earlier used simple
Gaussian form for the gluon field overlap factor $f$ in its off-diagonal terms,
the resulting $T$-matrix and phase shifts develop an angle dependence whose
partial wave analysis reveals $D$ wave and higher angular momentum components
in it. In addition to the obvious implications of this result for the
meson-meson scattering, this new feature indicates the possibility of orbital
excitations influencing properties of meson-meson molecules through a
polarization potential. We have used a formalism of the resonating group
method, treated kinetic energy and overlap matrices on model of the potential
matrix, but decoupled the resulting complicated integral equations through the
Born approximation. In this exploratory study we have used a quadratic
confinement and not included the spin-dependence; we also used the
approximation of equal constituent quark masses.
