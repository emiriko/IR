We consider the evolution of a tight binding wave packet propagating in a
fluctuating periodic potential. If the fluctuations stem from a stationary
Markov process satisfying certain technical criteria, we show that the square
amplitude of the wave packet after diffusive rescaling converges to a
superposition of solutions of a heat equation.
