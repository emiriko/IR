We embed a holographic model of an U(1) charged fluid with Galilean
invariance in string theory and calculate its specific heat capacity and
Prandtl number. Such theories are generated by a R-symmetry twist along a null
direction of a N=1 superconformal theory. We study the hydrodynamic properties
of such systems employing ideas from the fluid-gravity correspondence.
