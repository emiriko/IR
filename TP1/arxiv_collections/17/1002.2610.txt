We report extensive muon spin rotation measurements on the lightly doped
Y1-xCaxBa2Cu3O6+y compound, which allows us to disentangle the effect of
disorder, controlled by random Ca2+ substitution, from that of mere doping. A
3D phase diagram of lightly doped cuprates is accurately drawn, showing that a
thermally activated antiferromagnetic phase competes with superconductivity
around a quantum critical point, hidden underneath a frozen insulating magnetic
state. Disorder suppresses both competing order parameters and unveils the
underlying frozen state. Doping and disorder destroy the activated magnetic
phase along a line of first order phase transitions that ends at the critical
point.
