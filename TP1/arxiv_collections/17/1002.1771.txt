Let $H$ be a Hopf algebra with a modular pair in involution $(\Character,1)$.
Let $A$ be a (module) algebra over $H$ equipped with a non-degenerated
$\Character$-invariant $1$-trace $\tau$. We show that Connes-Moscovici
characteristic map $\varphi_\tau:HC^*_{(\Character,1)}(H)\rightarrow
HC^*_\lambda(A)$ is a morphism of graded Lie algebras. We also have a morphism
$\Phi$ of Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras from the cotorsion product of $H$,
$\text{Cotor}_H^*({\Bbbk},{\Bbbk})$, to the Hochschild cohomology of $A$,
$HH^*(A,A)$. Let $K$ be both a Hopf algebra and a symmetric Frobenius algebra.
Suppose that the square of its antipode is an inner automorphism by a
group-like element. Then this morphism of Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras
$\Phi:\text{Cotor}_{K^\vee}^*(\mathbb{F},\mathbb{F})\cong
\text{Ext}_{K}(\mathbb{F},\mathbb{F}) \hookrightarrow HH^*(K,K)$ is injective.
