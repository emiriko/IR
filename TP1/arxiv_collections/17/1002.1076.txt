Since its launch on October 2002, the INTEGRAL satellite has revolutionized
our knowledge of the hard X-ray sky thanks to its unprecedented imaging
capabilities and source detection positional accuracy above 20 keV.
Nevertheless, many of the newly-detected sources in the INTEGRAL sky surveys
are of unknown nature. However, the combined use of available information at
longer wavelengths (mainly soft X-rays and radio) and of optical spectroscopy
on the putative counterparts of these new hard X-ray objects allows pinpointing
their exact nature. Continuing our long-standing program running since 2004
(and with which we identified more than 100 INTEGRAL objects) here we report
the classification, through optical spectroscopy, of 25 unidentified
high-energy sources mostly belonging to the recently published 4th IBIS survey.
