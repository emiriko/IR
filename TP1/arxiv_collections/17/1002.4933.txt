An analytical method for getting new complex Hadamard matrices by using
mutually unbiased bases and a nonlinear doubling formula is provided. The
method is illustrated with the n=4 case that leads to a rich family of
eight-dimensional Hadamard matrices that depend on five arbitrary parameters
whose modulus is equal to unity.
