The thermal quantum discord (QD) is studied in a two-qubit Heisenberg XXZ
system with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. We compare the thermal QD
with thermal entanglement in this system and find remarkable differences
between them. For instance, we show situations where QD decreases
asymptotically to zero with temperature $T$ while entanglement decreases to
zero at the point of critical temperature, situations where QD decreases with
certain tunable parameters such as $D_z$ and $D_x$ when entanglement increases.
We find that the characteristic of QD is exotic in this system and this
possibly offers a potential solution to enhance entanglement of a system. We
also show that tunable parameter $D_x$ is more efficient than parameter $D_z$
in most regions for controlling the QD.
