Linear polarized soft-x ray absorption (XAS) and inelastic neutron scattering
(INS) experiments have been performed on CeMIn5 with M = Rh, Ir, and Co to
determine the crystal-field scheme and characteristic Kondo temperatures T* for
the hybridization between 4f and conduction electrons. The ground state wave
functions are determined from the polarization dependent soft-XAS data at the
cerium M4,5 edge and the crystal-field splittings from INS. The characteristic
temperature T* has been determined from the line widths of the neutron
scattering data. We find that the quasielastic line widths of the
superconducting compounds CeCoIn5 and CeIrIn5 are comparable with the low
energy crystal-field splitting.
