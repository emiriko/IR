I present a concise review of the Higgs problem which plays a central role in
particle physics today. The Higgs of the minimal Standard Model is so far just
a conjecture that needs to be verified or discarded at the LHC. Probably the
reality is more complicated. I will summarize the motivation for New Physics
that should accompany or even replace the Higgs discovery and a number of its
possible forms that could be revealed by the LHC
