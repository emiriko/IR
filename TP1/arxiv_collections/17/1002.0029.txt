We discuss the phenomenological implications of hybrid natural inflation
models in which the inflaton is a pseudo-Goldstone boson but inflation is
terminated by a second scalar field. A feature of the scheme is that the scale
of breaking of the Goldstone symmetry can be lower than the Planck scale and so
gravitational corrections are under control. We show that, for supersymmetric
models, the scale of inflation can be chosen anywhere between the Lyth upper
bound and a value close to the electroweak breaking scale. Unlike previous
models of low scale inflation the observed density perturbations and spectral
index are readily obtained by the choice of the free parameters.
