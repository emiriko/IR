The Kruskal - Szekeres (KS) completion of the Schwarzschild spacetime is open
to Synge's methodological criticism that the KS procedure generates "good"
coordinates from "bad". This is addressed here in two ways: First I generate
the KS coordinates from Israel coordinates, which are also "good", and then I
generate the KS coordinates directly from a streamlined integration of the
Einstein equations.
