We give an explicit example of the embedding of a near BPS low-energy (U(1) x
USp(2M))/Z_2 gauge theory into a high-energy theory with a simple gauge group
and adjoint matter content. This system possesses degenerate monopoles arising
from the high-energy symmetry breaking as well as non-Abelian vortices due to
the symmetry breaking at low energies. These solitons of different codimensions
are related by the exact homotopy sequences.
