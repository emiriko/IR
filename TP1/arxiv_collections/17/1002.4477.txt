High resolution spectra obtained from the Subaru Telescope High Dispersion
Spectrograph have been used to update the stellar atmospheric parameters and
metallicity of the star HD 209621. We have derived a metallicity of [Fe/H] =
-1.93 for this star, and have found a large enhancement of carbon and of heavy
elements, with respect to iron. Updates on the elemental abundances of four
s-process elements (Y, Ce, Pr, Nd) along with the first estimates of abundances
for a number of other heavy elements (Sr, Zr, Ba, La, Sm, Eu, Er, Pb) are
reported. The stellar atmospheric parameters, the effective temperature, Teff,
and the surface gravity, log g (4500 K, 2.0), are determined from LTE analysis
using model atmospheres. Estimated [Ba/Eu] = +0.35, places the star in the
group of CEMP-(r+s) stars; however, the s-elements abundance pattern seen in HD
209621 is characteristic of CH stars; notably, the 2nd-peak s-process elements
are more enhanced than the first peak s-process elements. HD 209621 is also
found to show a large enhancement of the 3rd-peak s-process element lead (Pb)
with [Pb/Fe] = +1.88. The relative contributions of the two neutron-capture
processes, r- and s- to the observed abundances are examined using a parametric
model based analysis, that hints that the neutron-capture elements in HD 209621
primarily originate in s-process.
