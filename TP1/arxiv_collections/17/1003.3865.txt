Although the gravitational wave kick velocity in the orbital plane of
coalescing black holes has been understood for some time, apparently
conflicting formulae have been proposed for the dominant out-of-plane kick,
each a good fit to different data sets. This is important to resolve because it
is only the out-of-plane kicks that can reach more than 500 km/s and can thus
eject merged remnants from galaxies. Using a different ansatz for the
out-of-plane kick, we show that we can fit almost all existing data to better
than 5 %. This is good enough for any astrophysical calculation, and shows that
the previous apparent conflict was only because the two data sets explored
different aspects of the kick parameter space.
