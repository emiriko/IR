This paper studies business cycle patterns in UK sectoral output. It analyzes
the distinction between white noise processes and their non-white noise
counterparts in the frequency domain and further examines the associated
features and patterns for the process where white noise conditions are
violated. The characteristics of these sectors, arising from their
institutional features that may influence business cycles behavior and
patterns, are discussed. The study then investigates the output of UK GDP
sectors empirically, revealing their similarities and differences in their
business cycle patterns.
