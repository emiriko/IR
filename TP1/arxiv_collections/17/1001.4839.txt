We prove that given a super affine closed subgroup $H$ of a super affine
group $G$ over a field $k$ of charctersitic $\mathrm{ch} k \ne 2$, the dur
$k$-sheaf $G\tilde{\tilde{/}} H$ of right cosets is affine if the affine
$k$-group $\bar{H}$ assocoiated to $H$ is (a) reductive or (b) pro-finite.
Especially when $G$ is algebraic, the result in Case (a) gives rise to a
positive answer to Brundan's question which was recently discussed by Zubkov
\cite{Z}.
