We report the experimental realization of an elliptical Bragg reflector
acting as an interferometer for propagating surface plasmon sSPd waves. We
investigate SP interferometry in this device using a leakage radiation
microscope and we compare our observations with a theoretical model for SP
propagation. Strong SP focalization as a function of laser polarization
orientation is observed and justified.
