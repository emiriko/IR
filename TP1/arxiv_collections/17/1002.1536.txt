It is not so well-known that measurement-free quantum error correction
protocols can be designed to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing. Despite
the potential advantages of using such protocols in terms of the relaxation of
accuracy, speed and addressing requirements on the measurement process, they
have usually been overlooked because they are expected to yield a very bad
threshold as compared to error correction protocols which use measurements.
Here we show that this is not the case. We design fault-tolerant circuits for
the 9 qubit Bacon-Shor code and find a threshold for gates and preparation of
$p_{(p,g) thresh}=3.76 \times 10^{-5}$ (30% of the best known result for the
same code using measurement based error correction) while admitting up to 1/3
error rates for measurements and allocating no constraints on measurement
speed. We further show that demanding gate error rates sufficiently below the
threshold one can improve the preparation threshold to $p_{(p)thresh} = 1/3$.
We also show how these techniques can be adapted to other
Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes.
