The origins of irregular satellites of the giant planets are an important
piece of the giant "puzzle" that is the theory of Solar System formation. It is
well established that they are not "in situ" formation objects, around the
planet, as are believed to be the regular ones. Then, the most plausible
hypothesis to explain their origins is that they formed elsewhere and were
captured by the planet. However, captures under restricted three-body problem
dynamics have temporary feature, which makes necessary the action of an
auxiliary capture mechanism. Nevertheless, there not exist one well established
capture mechanism. In this work, we tried to understand which aspects of a
binary-asteroid capture mechanism could favor the permanent capture of one
member of a binary asteroid. We performed more than eight thousand numerical
simulations of capture trajectories considering the four-body dynamical system
Sun, Jupiter, Binary-asteroid. We restricted the problem to the circular planar
prograde case, and time of integration to 10^4 years. With respect to the
binary features, we noted that 1) tighter binaries are much more susceptible to
produce permanent captures than the large separation-ones. We also found that
2) the permanent capture probability of the minor member of the binary is much
more expressive than the major body permanent capture probability. On the other
hand, among the aspects of capture-disruption process, 4) a pseudo
eastern-quadrature was noted to be a very likely capture angular configuration
at the instant of binary disruptions. In addition, we also found that the 5)
capture probability is higher for binary asteroids which disrupt in an
inferior-conjunction with Jupiter. These results show that the Sun plays a very
important role on the capture dynamic of binary asteroids.
