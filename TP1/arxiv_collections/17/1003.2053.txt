Light transport in superdiffusive media of finite size is studied
theoretically. The intensity Green's function for a slab geometry is found by
discretizing the fractional diffusion equation and employing the eigenfunction
expansion method. Truncated step length distributions and complex boundary
conditions are considered. The profile of a coherent backscattering cone is
calculated in the superdiffusion approximation.
