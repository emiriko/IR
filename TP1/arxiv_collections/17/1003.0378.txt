Here we report from our theoretical studies that in biased bilayer graphene,
one can induce phase transitions from an incompressible state to a compressible
state by tuning the bandgap at a given electron density. Likewise, variation of
the density with a fixed bandgap results in a transition from the FQHE states
at lower Landau levels to compressible states at intermediate Landau levels and
finally to FQHE states at higher Landau levels. This intriguing scenario of
tunable phase transitions in the fractional quantum Hall states is unique to
bilayer graphene and never before existed in conventional semiconductor
systems.
