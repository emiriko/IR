We propose to use a quantized version of coherent two-color photoassociation
to realize a hybrid device for quantum control of light. The dynamical features
of this system are exhibited, including the slowing down or storage of light
and the molecular matter-wave solitons. This may indicate a hybrid
atom-molecule quantum device for storage and retrieve of optical information.
