We review recent progress in our theoretical understanding of strongly
correlated fermion systems in the presence of disorder. Results were obtained
by the application of a powerful nonperturbative approach, the Dynamical
Mean-Field Theory (DMFT), to interacting disordered lattice fermions. In
particular, we demonstrate that DMFT combined with geometric averaging over
disorder can capture Anderson localization and Mott insulating phases on the
level of one-particle correlation functions. Results are presented for the
ground-state phase diagram of the Anderson-Hubbard model at half filling, both
in the paramagnetic phase and in the presence of antiferromagnetic order. We
find a new antiferromagnetic metal which is stabilized by disorder. Possible
realizations of these quantum phases with ultracold fermions in optical
lattices are discussed.
