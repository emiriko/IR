Visual inspection of industrial products is used to determine the control
quality for these products. This paper deals with the problem of visual
inspection of ceramic tiles industry using Wavelet Transform. The third level
the coefficients of two dimensions Haar Discrete Wavelet Transform (HDWT) is
used in this paper to process the images and feature extraction. The proposed
algorithm consists of two main phases. The first phase is to compute the
wavelet transform for an image free of defects which known as reference image,
and the image to be inspected which known as test image. The second phase is
used to decide whether the tested image is defected or not using the Euclidean
distance similarity measure. The experimentation results of the proposed
algorithm give 97% for correct detection of ceramic defects.
