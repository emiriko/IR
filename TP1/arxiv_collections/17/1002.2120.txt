We have achieved the few-electron regime in InAs nanowire double quantum
dots. Spin blockade is observed for the first two half-filled orbitals, where
the transport cycle is interrupted by forbidden transitions between triplet and
singlet states. Partial lifting of spin blockade is explained by spin-orbit and
hyperfine mechanisms that enable triplet to singlet transitions. The
measurements over a wide range of interdot coupling and tunneling rates to the
leads are well reproduced by a simple transport model. This allows us to
separate and quantify the contributions of the spin-orbit and hyperfine
interactions.
