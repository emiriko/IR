We give a version in characteristic $p>0$ of Mumford's theorem characterizing
a smooth complex germ of surface $(X,x)$ by the triviality of the topological
fundamental group of $U=X\setminus \{x\}$.
  This note relies on discussions the authors had during the Christmas break
2009/10 in Ivry. They have been written down by H\'el\`ene in the night when
Eckart died, as a despaired sign of love.
