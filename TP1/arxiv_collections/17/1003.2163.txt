The influence of temperature and transport conditions on the electron spin
relaxation in lightly doped n-type GaAs semiconductors is investigated. A Monte
Carlo approach is used to simulate electron transport, including the evolution
of spin polarization and relaxation, by taking into account intravalley and
intervalley scattering phenomena of the hot electrons in the medium. Spin
relaxation lengths and times are computed through the D'yakonov-Perel process,
which is the more relevant spin relaxation mechanism in the regime of interest
(10 < T < 300 K). The decay of the initial spin polarization of the conduction
electrons is calculated as a function of the distance in the presence of a
static electric field varying in the range 0.1 - 2 kV/cm. We find that the
electron spin depolarization lengths and times have a nonmonotonic dependence
on both the lattice temperature and the electric field amplitude.
