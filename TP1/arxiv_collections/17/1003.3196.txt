Consider the set of vectors over a field having non-zero coefficients only in
a fixed sparse set and multiplication defined by convolution, or the set of
integers having non-zero digits (in some base $b$) in a fixed sparse set. We
show the existence of an optimal (resp. almost-optimal in the latter case)
`magic' multiplier constant that provides a perfect hash function which
transfers the information from the given sparse coefficients into consecutive
digits. Studying the convolution case we also obtain a result of non-degeneracy
for Schur functions as polynomials in the elementary symmetric functions in
positive characteristic.
