Based on the general thought that mechanics cannot be absolutely exact,
supported by pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on the
reversal of time in spin systems, we postulate existence of a probability which
do not follow from the Schroudinger equation, or X-probability. It is shown
that the X-probability allows explain irreversibility of evolution of
macrosystems, and also creates a basis for using probabilistic methods in
statistical mechanics and for deliverance from the mechanical determinism.
