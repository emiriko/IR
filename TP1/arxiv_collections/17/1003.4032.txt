We discuss an interplay between the Fermi-liquid (FL) theory and diagrammatic
perturbative approach to interacting Fermi systems. In the FL theory for
Galilean-invariant systems, mass renormalization $m^*/m$ comes exclusively from
fermions at the Fermi surface. We show that in a diagrammatic perturbation
theory the same result for $m^*/m$ comes from fermions both at and away from
the Fermi surface. The equivalence of the FL and pertubative approaches is
based on a particular relation between self-energy contributions from high- and
low-energy fermions. We argue that care has to be exercised in the
renormalization group approach to a FL in order not to miss the high-energy
contribution to $m^*/m$. As particular examples, we discuss $m^*/m$ and the
quasiparticle residue $Z$ for 2D and 3D systems with both SU(2) and SU(N)
symmetries, and with a short-range interaction. We derive an expression for the
anisotropic part of the Fermi-liquid vertex in the large-$N$ limit of the SU(N)
case.
