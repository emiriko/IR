Color centers in diamond are very promising candidates among the possible
realizations for practical single-photon sources because of their long-time
stable emission at room temperature. The popular nitrogen-vacancy center shows
single-photon emission, but within a large, phonon-broadened spectrum (~100nm),
which strongly limits its applicability for quantum communication. By contrast,
Ni-related centers exhibit narrow emission lines at room temperature. We
present investigations on single color centers consisting of Ni and Si created
by ion implantation into single crystalline IIa diamond. We use systematic
variations of ion doses between 10^8/cm^2 and 10^14/cm^2 and energies between
30keV and 1.8MeV. The Ni-related centers show emission in the near infrared
spectral range (~770nm to 787nm) with a small line-width (~3nm FWHM). A
measurement of the intensity correlation function proves single-photon
emission. Saturation measurements yield a rather high saturation count rate of
77.9 kcounts/s. Polarization dependent measurements indicate the presence of
two orthogonal dipoles.
