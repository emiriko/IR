The addition of an A_4 family symmetry and extended Higgs sector to the
Standard Model can generate the tribimaximal mixing pattern for leptons,
assuming the correct vacuum expectation value alignment of the Higgs scalars.
Deviating this alignment affects the predictions for the neutrino oscillation
and neutrino mass observables. An attempt is made to classify the plethora of
models in the literature, with respect to the chosen A_4 particle assignments.
Of these models, two particularly popular examples have been analyzed for
deviations from tribimaximal mixing by perturbing the vacuum expectation value
alignments. The effect of perturbations on the mixing angle observables is
studied. However, it is only investigation of the mass-related observables (the
effective mass for neutrinoless double beta decay and the sum of masses from
cosmology) that can lead to the exclusion of particular models by constraints
from future data, which indicates the importance of neutrino mass in
disentangling models. The models have also been tested for fine-tuning of the
parameters. Furthermore, a well-known seesaw model is generalized to include
additional scalars, which transform as representations of A_4 not included in
the original model.
