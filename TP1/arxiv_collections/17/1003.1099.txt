A calculational approach in fluid turbulence is presented. Use is made of the
attracting nature of the fluid-dynamic dynamical system. An approach is offered
that effectively propagates the statistics in time. Loss of sensitivity to an
initial probability density functional and generation of stationary statistical
effects is speculated.
