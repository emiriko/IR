We have computed seismic images of magnetic activity on the far surface of
the Sun by using a seismic-holography technique. As in previous works, the
method is based on the comparison of waves going in and out of a particular
point in the Sun but we have computed here the Green's functions from a
spherical polar expansion of the adiabatic wave equations in the Cowling
approximation instead of using the ray-path approximation previously used in
the far-side holography. A comparison between the results obtained using the
ray theory and the spherical polar expansion is shown. We use the
gravito-acoustic wave equation in the local plane-parallel limit in both cases
and for the latter we take the asymptotic approximation for the radial
dependencies of the Green's function. As a result, improved images of the
far-side can be obtained from the polar-expansion approximation, especially
when combining the Green's functions corresponding to two and three skips. We
also show that the phase corrections in the Green's functions due to the
incorrect modeling of the uppermost layers of the Sun can be estimated from the
eigenfrequencies of the normal modes of oscillation.
