It is well understood that the studies of correlations between produced
particles, the effects of coherence and chaoticity, an estimation of particle
emitting source size play an important role in high energy physics [1]. First
of all, we mean the investigation of the space-time extension or even squeezing
of particle sources via the multiparticle quantum-statistics correlation. We
consider the two-photon correlation function that can provide the space-time
information about the Higgs-boson source in thermal environment and estimate
the Higgs-boson mass for the first time.
