We report on the detailed analysis of the high-energy extended emission from
the short Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) 081024B, detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space
Telescope. Historically, this represents the first clear detection of temporal
extended emission from a short GRB. The light curve observed by the Fermi
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor lasts approximately 0.8 seconds whereas the emission in
the Fermi Large Area Telescope lasts for about 3 seconds. Evidence of longer
lasting high-energy emission associated with long bursts has been already
reported by previous experiments. Our observations, together with the earlier
reported study of the bright short GRB 090510, indicate similarities in the
high-energy emission of short and long GRBs and open the path to new
interpretations.
