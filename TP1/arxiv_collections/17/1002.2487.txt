We investigate optimal consumption and investment problems for a
Black-Scholes market under uniform restrictions on Value-at-Risk and Expected
Shortfall. We formulate various utility maximization problems, which can be
solved explicitly. We compare the optimal solutions in form of optimal value,
optimal control and optimal wealth to analogous problems under additional
uniform risk bounds. Our proofs are partly based on solutions to
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, and we prove a corresponding verification
theorem. This work was supported by the European Science Foundation through the
