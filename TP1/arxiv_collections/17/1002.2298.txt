High-spin states in the neutron deficient nucleus $^{107}$In were studied via
the $^{58}$Ni($^{52}$Cr, 3p) reaction. In-beam $\gamma$ rays were measured
using the JUROGAM detector array. A rotational cascade consisting of ten
$\gamma$-ray transitions which decays to the 19/2$^{+}$ level at 2.002 MeV was
observed. The band exhibits the features typical for smooth terminating bands
which also appear in rotational bands of heavier nuclei in the A$\sim$100
region. The results are compared with Total Routhian Surface and Cranked
Nilsson-Strutinsky calculations.
