The LASSO is a widely used statistical methodology for simultaneous
estimation and variable selection. In the last years, many authors analyzed
this technique from a theoretical and applied point of view. We introduce and
study the adaptive LASSO problem for discretely observed ergodic diffusion
processes. We prove oracle properties also deriving the asymptotic distribution
of the LASSO estimator. Our theoretical framework is based on the random field
approach and it applied to more general families of regular statistical
experiments in the sense of Ibragimov-Hasminskii (1981). Furthermore, we
perform a simulation and real data analysis to provide some evidence on the
applicability of this method.
