Simulation of materials at the atomistic level is an important tool in
studying microscopic structure and processes. The atomic interactions necessary
for the simulation are correctly described by Quantum Mechanics. However, the
computational resources required to solve the quantum mechanical equations
limits the use of Quantum Mechanics at most to a few hundreds of atoms and only
to a small fraction of the available configurational space. This thesis
presents the results of my research on the development of a new interatomic
potential generation scheme, which we refer to as Gaussian Approximation
Potentials. In our framework, the quantum mechanical potential energy surface
is interpolated between a set of predetermined values at different points in
atomic configurational space by a non-linear, non-parametric regression method,
the Gaussian Process. To perform the fitting, we represent the atomic
environments by the bispectrum, which is invariant to permutations of the atoms
in the neighbourhood and to global rotations. The result is a general scheme,
that allows one to generate interatomic potentials based on arbitrary quantum
mechanical data. We built a series of Gaussian Approximation Potentials using
data obtained from Density Functional Theory and tested the capabilities of the
method. We showed that our models reproduce the quantum mechanical potential
energy surface remarkably well for the group IV semiconductors, iron and
gallium nitride. Our potentials, while maintaining quantum mechanical accuracy,
are several orders of magnitude faster than Quantum Mechanical methods.
