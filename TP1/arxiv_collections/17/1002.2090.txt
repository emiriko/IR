In earlier work, we had shown that Cannon-Thurston maps exist for Kleinian
punctured surface groups without accidental parabolics. In this note we prove
that pre-images of points are precisely end-points of leaves of the ending
lamination whenever the Cannon-Thurston map is not one-to-one. This extends
earlier work done for closed surface groups.
