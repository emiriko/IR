This is an extended version of the note taken by the first author (W.-G.P.)
on a lecture given by the second author (M.R.) as a first part of the series on
"Hadronic Matter Under Extreme Conditions," the principal theme of the
WCU-Hanyang Program. It covers the attempts to go in a framework anchored on
effective field theory of QCD from zero density to the nuclear matter density
and slightly beyond, with the ultimate goal of arriving at the density relevant
to compact stars, including chiral phase transition and quark matter. The focus
is on the conceptual aspects rather than detailed "fitting" of the data on the
kinds of physics that are being addressed to in radioactive-ion-beam machines
in operation as well as in project (such as `KoRIA' in Korea) and will be
explored at such forthcoming accelerators as FAIR/GSI. The approach presented
here is basically different from the standard ones found in the literature in
that the notion of hidden local symmetry -- which underlies the chiral symmetry
of the strong interactions -- and its generalization to dual gravity
description involving infinite tower of hidden gauge fields are closely relied
on.
