We present two results about the relationship between fundamental groups of
quasiprojective manifolds and linear systems on a projectivization. We prove
the existence of a plane curve with non-abelian fundamental group of the
complement which does not admit a mapping onto an orbifold with non-abelian
fundamental group. We also find an affine manifold whose irreducible components
of its characteristic varieties do not come from the pull-back of the
characteristic varieties of an orbifold.
