We show that in the few-excitation regime the classical and quantum
time-evolution of the inhomogeneous Dicke model for N two-level systems coupled
to a single boson mode agree for N>>1. In the presence of a single excitation
only, the leading term in an 1/N-expansion of the classical equations of motion
reproduces the result of the Schroedinger equation. For a small number of
excitations, the numerical solutions of the classical and quantum problems
become equal for N sufficiently large. By solving the Schroedinger equation
exactly for two excitations and a particular inhomogeneity we obtain
1/N-corrections which lead to a significant difference between the classical
and quantum solutions at a new time scale which we identify as an Ehrenferst
time, given by tau_E=sqrt{N<g^2>}, where sqrt{<g^2>} is an effective coupling
strength between the two-level systems and the boson.
