We examine the prospects for the detection of Higgs mediated lepton flavor
violation at LHC and at a photon collider in the minimal supersymmetric
standard model with large lepton flavor violating mass insertions in the
$\mu-\tau$ sector constraining the parameter space with several experimental
bounds. We find rates probably too small to be observed at future experiments
if models have to accommodate for a neutralino relic density as measured by
WMAP and explain the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ anomaly: better prospects are found if these
two constraints are applied only as upper bounds. The spin-independent
neutralino-nucleon cross section in the studied constrained parameter space is
just below the present CDMS limit while gamma rates from neutralino
annihilation in the halo are strongly suppressed.
