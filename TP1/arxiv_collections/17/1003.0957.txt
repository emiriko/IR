We extrapolate the first moments of the generalized parton distributions
using heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. The calculation is based on the
one loop level with the finite range regularization. The description of the
lattice data is satisfactory and the extrapolated moments at physical pion mass
are consistent with the results obtained with dimensional regularization,
although the extrapolation in the momentum transfer to $t=0$ does show
sensitivity to form factor effects which lie outside the realm of chiral
perturbation theory. We discuss the significance of the results in the light of
modern experiments as well as QCD inspired models.
