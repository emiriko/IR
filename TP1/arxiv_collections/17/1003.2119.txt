The mass matrix for $\eta-\eta^\prime$ is derived in the flavor basis at
${\cal O}(p^4)$ of the chiral Lagrangian using the large $N$ approximation.
Under certain assumptions, the mixing angle $\phi=41.4^\circ$ and the decay
constants ratio $f_K/f_\pi=1.15$ are calculated in agreement with the data. It
appears that the FKS scheme arises as a special limit of the chiral Lagrangian.
Their mass matrix is obtained without the hypothesis on the mixing pattern of
the decay constants.
