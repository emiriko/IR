Time is one of the most difficult aspects to handle in real world
applications such as database systems. Relational database management systems
proposed by Codd offer very little built-in query language support for temporal
data management. The model itself incorporates neither the concept of time nor
any theory of temporal semantics. Many temporal extensions of the relational
model have been proposed and some of them are also implemented. This paper
offers a brief introduction to temporal database research. We propose a
conceptual model for handling time varying attributes in the relational
database model with minimal temporal attributes.
