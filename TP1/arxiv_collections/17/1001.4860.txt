Quantum computing promises to exploit the laws of quantum mechanics for
processing information in ways fundamentally different from today's classical
computers, leading to unprecedented efficiency. One-way quantum computation,
sometimes referred to as the cluster model of quantum computation, is a very
promising approach to fulfil the capabilities of quantum information
processing. The cluster model is realizable through measurements on a highly
entangled cluster state with no need for controlled unitary evolutions. Here we
demonstrate unconditional one-way quantum computation experiments for
continuous variables using a linear cluster state of four entangled optical
modes. We implement an important set of quantum operations, linear
transformations, in the optical phase space through one-way computation. Though
not sufficient, these are necessary for universal quantum computation over
continuous variables, and in our scheme, in principle, any such linear
transformation can be unconditionally and deterministically applied to
arbitrary single-mode quantum states.
