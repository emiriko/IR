We report on the discovery of two galaxy clusters, SPT-CL J2332-5358 and
SPT-CL J2342-5411, in X-rays. These clusters were also independently detected
through their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect by the South Pole Telescope, and
confirmed in the optical band by the Blanco Cosmology Survey. They are thus the
first clusters detected under survey conditions by all major cluster search
approaches. The X-ray detection is made within the frame of the XMM-BCS cluster
survey utilizing a novel XMM-Newton mosaic mode of observations. The present
study makes the first scientific use of this operation mode. We estimate the
X-ray spectroscopic temperature of SPT-CL J2332-5358 (at redshift z=0.32) to T
= 9.3 (+3.3/-1.9) keV, implying a high mass, M_{500} = 8.8 +/- 3.8 \times
10^{14} M_{sun}. For SPT-CL J2342-5411, at z=1.08, the available X-ray data
doesn't allow us to directly estimate the temperature with good confidence.
However, using our measured luminosity and scaling relations we estimate that T
= 4.5 +/- 1.3 keV and M_{500} = 1.9 +/- 0.8 \times 10^{14} M_{sun}. We find a
good agreement between the X-ray masses and those estimated from the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.
