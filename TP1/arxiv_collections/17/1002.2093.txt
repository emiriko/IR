Within the post Newtonian framework the fully reduced Hamiltonian (i.e., with
eliminated spin supplementary condition) for the next-to-leading order
spin-squared dynamics of general compact binaries is presented. The Hamiltonian
is applicable to the spin dynamics of all kinds of binaries with
self-gravitating components like black holes and/or neutron stars taking into
account spin-induced quadrupolar deformation effects in second post-Newtonian
order perturbation theory of Einstein's field equations. The corresponding
equations of motion for spin, position and momentum variables are given in
terms of canonical Poisson brackets. Comparison with a nonreduced potential
calculated within the Effective Field Theory approach is made.
