An updated global analysis within the Standard Model (SM) of all relevant
electroweak precision and Higgs boson search data is presented with special
emphasis on the implications for the Higgs boson mass, M_H. Included are, in
particular, the most recent results on the top quark and W boson masses,
updated and significantly shifted constraints on the strong coupling constant,
alpha_s, from tau decays and other low energy measurements such as from atomic
parity violation and neutrino deep inelastic scattering. The latest results
from searches for Higgs production and decay at the Tevatron are incorporated
together with the older constraints from LEP 2. I find a trimodal probability
distribution for M_H with a fairly narrow preferred 90% CL window, 115 GeV <
M_H < 148 GeV.
