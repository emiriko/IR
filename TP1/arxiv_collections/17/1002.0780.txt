Fractional Brownian motion can be represented as an integral of a
deterministic kernel w.r.t. an ordinary Brownian motion either on infinite or
compact interval. In previous literature fractional L\'evy processes are
defined by integrating the infinite interval kernel w.r.t. a general L\'evy
process. In this article we define fractional L\'evy processes using the
compact interval representation.
  We prove that the fractional L\'evy processes presented via different
integral transformations have the same finite dimensional distributions if and
only if they are fractional Brownian motions. Also, we present relations
between different fractional L\'evy processes and analyze the properties of
such processes. A financial example is introduced as well.
