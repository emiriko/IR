In quantum information systems it is of particular interest to consider the
best way in which to use the non-classical resources consumed by that system.
Quantum communication protocols are integral to quantum information systems and
are amongst the most promising near-term applications of quantum information
science. Here we show that a multiplexed, digital quantum communications system
supported by comb of vacuum squeezing has a greater channel capacity per photon
than a source of broadband squeezing with the same analogue bandwidth. We
report on the time-resolved, simultaneous observation of the first dozen teeth
in a 2.4 GHz comb of vacuum squeezing produced by a sub-threshold OPO, as
required for such a quantum communications channel. We also demonstrate
multiplexed communication on that channel.
