The global phase diagram of the spinless Falicov-Kimball model in d = 3
spatial dimensions is obtained by renormalization-group theory. This global
phase diagram exhibits five distinct phases. Four of these phases are
charge-ordered (CO) phases, in which the system forms two sublattices with
different electron densities. The CO phases occur at and near half filling of
the conduction electrons for the entire range of localized electron densities.
The phase boundaries are second order, except for the intermediate and large
interaction regimes, where a first-order phase boundary occurs in the central
region of the phase diagram, resulting in phase coexistence at and near half
filling of both localized and conduction electrons. These two-phase or
three-phase coexistence regions are between different charge-ordered phases,
between charge-ordered and disordered phases, and between dense and dilute
disordered phases. The second-order phase boundaries terminate on the
first-order phase transitions via critical endpoints and double critical
endpoints. The first-order phase boundary is delimited by critical points. The
cross-sections of the global phase diagram with respect to the chemical
potentials and densities of the localized and conduction electrons, at all
representative interactions strengths, hopping strengths, and temperatures, are
calculated and exhibit ten distinct topologies.
