We present new results on instabilities in rapidly and differentially
rotating neutron stars. We model the stars in full general relativity and
describe the stellar matter adopting a cold realistic equation of state based
on the unified SLy prescription. We provide evidence that rapidly and
differentially rotating stars that are below the expected threshold for the
dynamical bar-mode instability, beta_c = T/|W| ~ 0.25, do nevertheless develop
a shear instability on a dynamical timescale and for a wide range of values of
beta. This class of instability, which has so far been found only for small
values of beta and with very small growth rates, is therefore more generic than
previously found and potentially more effective in producing strong sources of
gravitational waves. Overall, our findings support the phenomenological
predictions made by Watts, Andersson and Jones on the nature of the low-T/|W|.
