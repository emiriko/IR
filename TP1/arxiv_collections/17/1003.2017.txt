Let g be a complex, semisimple Lie algebra, G the corresponding
simply-connected Lie group and H a maximal torus in G. We construct a flat
connection on H with logarithmic singularities on the root hypertori and values
in the Yangian Y(g) of g. By analogy with the rational Casimir connection of g,
we conjecture that the monodromy of this trigonometric connection is described
by the quantum Weyl group operators of the quantum loop algebra U_h(Lg).
