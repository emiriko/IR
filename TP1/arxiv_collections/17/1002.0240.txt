Non-resonant inelastic x ray scattering (NIXS) experiments have been
performed to probe the 5d-5f electronic transitions at the uranium O(4,5)
absorption edges in uranium dioxide. For small values of the scattering vector
q, the spectra are dominated by dipole-allowed transitions encapsulated within
the giant resonance, whereas for higher values of q the multipolar transitions
of rank 3 and 5 give rise to strong and well-defined multiplet structure in the
pre-edge region. The origin of the observed non-dipole multiplet structures is
explained on the basis of many-electron atomic spectral calculations. The
results obtained demonstrate the high potential of NIXS as a bulk-sensitive
technique for the characterization of the electronic properties of actinide
materials.
