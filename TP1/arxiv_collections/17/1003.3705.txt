The electron transport properties of ZnO nano-wires coupled by two aluminium
electrodes were studied by {\it ab initio} method based on non-equilibrium
Green's function approach and density functional theory. A clearly rectifying
current-voltage characteristics was observed. It was found that the contact
interfaces between Al-O and Al-Zn play important roles in the charge transport
at low bias voltage and give very asymmetric I-V characteristics. When the bias
voltage increases, the negative differential resistance occurs at negative bias
voltage. The charge accumulation was calculated and its behavior was found to
be well correlated with the I-V characteristics. We have also calculated the
electrochemical capacitance which exhibits three plateaus at different bias
voltages which may have potential device application.
