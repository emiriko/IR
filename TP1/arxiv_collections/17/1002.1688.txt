Within a minimal model, we present analytical expressions for the eigenstates
and eigenvalues of carriers confined in quantum rings in monolayer and bilayer
graphene. The calculations were performed in the context of the continuum
model, by solving the Dirac equation for a zero width ring geometry, i.e. by
freezing out the carrier radial motion. We include the effect of an external
magnetic field and show the appearance of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations and of a
non-zero gap in the spectrum. Our minimal model gives insight in the energy
spectrum of graphene-based quantum rings and models different aspects of finite
width rings.
