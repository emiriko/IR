We establish a theoretical framework for artificial control of the power-law
singularities in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid states. The exponent governing the
power-law behaviors is found to increase significantly with an increase in the
amplitude of the periodic electric field modulation applied externally to the
system. This field-induced shift in the exponent indicates the tunability of
the transport properties of quasi-one-dimensional electron systems.
