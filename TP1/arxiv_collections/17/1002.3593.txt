Multilevel resistance states in silver-manganite interfaces are studied both
experimentally and through a realistic model that includes as a main ingredient
the oxygen vacancies diffusion under applied electric fields. The switching
threshold and amplitude studied through Hysteresis Switching Loops are found to
depend critically on the initial state. The associated vacancy profiles further
unveil the prominent role of the effective electric field acting at the
interfaces. While experimental results validate main assumptions of the model,
the simulations allow to disentangle the microscopic mechanisms behind the
resistive switching in metal-transition metal oxide interfaces.
