Reversible logic has received great attention in the recent years due to
their ability to reduce the power dissipation which is the main requirement in
low power digital design. It has wide applications advanced computing, low
power CMOS design, Optical information processing, DNA computing, bio
information, quantum computation and nanotechnology. This paper presents an
optimized reversible BCD adder using a new reversible gate. A comparative
result is presented which shows that the proposed design is more optimized in
terms of number of gates, number of garbage outputs and quantum cost than the
existing designs.
