The phenomenon of quantum entanglement is thoroughly investigated, focussing
especially on geometrical aspects and on bipartite systems. After introducing
the formalism and discussing general aspects, some of the most important
separability criteria and entanglement measures are presented. Finally, the
geometry of 2x2- and 3x3-dimensional state spaces is analysed and visualised.
