In an exact conformal theory there is no particle. The excitations have
continuum spectra and are called "unparticles" by Georgi. We consider
supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model with approximate conformal
sectors. The conformal symmetry is softly broken in the infrared which
generates a gap. However, the spectrum can still have a continuum above the gap
if there is no confinement. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence this can be
achieved with a soft wall in the warped extra dimension. When supersymmetry is
broken the superpartners of the Standard Model particles may simply be a
continuum above gap. The collider signals can be quite different from the
standard supersymmetric scenarios and the experimental searches for the
continuum superpartners can be very challenging.
