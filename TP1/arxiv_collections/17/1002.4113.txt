The lightcurve of CoRoT-2 shows substantial rotational modulation and
deformations of the planet's transit profiles caused by starspots. We
consistently model the entire lightcurve, including both rotational modulation
and transits, stretching over approximately 30 stellar rotations and 79
transits. The spot distribution and its evolution on the noneclipsed and
eclipsed surface sections are presented and analyzed, making use of the high
resolution achievable under the transit path.
  We measure the average surface brightness on the eclipsed section to be
(5\pm1) % lower than on the noneclipsed section. Adopting a solar spot
contrast, the spot coverage on the entire surface reaches up to 19 % and a
maximum of almost 40 % on the eclipsed section. Features under the transit
path, i.e. close to the equator, rotate with a period close to 4.55 days.
Significantly higher rotation periods are found for features on the noneclipsed
section indicating a differential rotation of $\Delta \Omega > 0.1$. Spotted
and unspotted regions in both surface sections concentrate on preferred
longitudes separated by roughly 180 deg.
