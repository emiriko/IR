Within the first quantisation of Maxwell's equations, we introduce the
dynamic energy, linear momentum, angular momentum and optical spin of the
electromagnetic fields. We show that these different quantities are conserved
during the propagation of light in vacuum and are additive only for eigenmodes
of the electromagnetic field.
