The SPaCIFY project, which aims at bringing advances in MDE to the satellite
flight software industry, advocates a top-down approach built on a
domain-specific modeling language named Synoptic. In line with previous
approaches to real-time modeling such as Statecharts and Simulink, Synoptic
features hierarchical decomposition of application and control modules in
synchronous block diagrams and state machines. Its semantics is described in
the polychronous model of computation, which is that of the synchronous
language Signal.
