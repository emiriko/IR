Aims: We present a compilation of spectroscopic data from a survey of 144
chromospherically active young stars in the solar neighborhood which may be
used to investigate different aspects of the formation and evolution of the
solar neighborhood in terms of kinematics and stellar formation history. The
data have already been used by us in several studies. With this paper, we make
all these data accessible to the scientific community for future studies on
different topics. Methods: We performed spectroscopic observations with echelle
spectrographs to cover the entirety of the optical spectral range
simultaneously. Standard data reduction was performed with the IRAF ECHELLE
package. We applied the spectral subtraction technique to reveal chromospheric
emission in the stars of the sample. The equivalent width of chromospheric
emission lines was measured in the subtracted spectra and then converted to
fluxes using equivalent width-flux relationships. Radial and rotational
velocities were determined by the cross-correlation technique. Kinematics,
equivalent widths of the lithium line 6707.8 angstroms and spectral types were
also determined. Results: A catalog of spectroscopic data is compiled: radial
and rotational velocities, space motion, equivalent widths of optical
chromospheric activity indicators from Ca II H & K to the calcium infrared
triplet and the lithium line in 6708 angstroms. Fluxes in the chromospheric
emission lines and R'HK are also determined for each observation of star in the
sample. We used these data to investigate the emission levels of our stars. The
study of the Halpha emission line revealed the presence of two different
populations of chromospheric emitters in the sample, clearly separated in the
log F(Halpha)/Fbol - (V-J) diagram.
