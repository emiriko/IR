We derive the approximate pressure profiles, density profiles, and
temperature profiles of an atmosphere, also called barometric formulas. Our
variant of a derivation goes beyond the common standard exercise of a
thermodynamics lecture, where commonly the discussion of the underlying
physical assumptions is missed. We depart from the Navier-Stokes equation and
explicitly point our attention on the physical assumptions disregarded
elsewhere. We show that the usual assumptions can be relaxed leading to
generalized formulas that hold even in the case of horizontal winds. This
fundamental physics has some relevance to the current discussions on the
climate debate.
