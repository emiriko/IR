Business card images are of multiple natures as these often contain graphics,
pictures and texts of various fonts and sizes both in background and
foreground. So, the conventional binarization techniques designed for document
images can not be directly applied on mobile devices. In this paper, we have
presented a fast binarization technique for camera captured business card
images. A card image is split into small blocks. Some of these blocks are
classified as part of the background based on intensity variance. Then the
non-text regions are eliminated and the text ones are skew corrected and
binarized using a simple yet adaptive technique. Experiment shows that the
technique is fast, efficient and applicable for the mobile devices.
