We consider a simple Maier-Saupe statistical model with the inclusion of
disorder degrees of freedom to mimic the phase diagram of a mixture of rod-like
and disc-like molecules. A quenched distribution of shapes leads to the
existence of a stable biaxial nematic phase, in qualitative agreement with
experimental findings for some ternary lyotropic liquid mixtures. An annealed
distribution, however, which is more adequate to liquid mixtures, precludes the
stability of this biaxial phase. We then use a two-temperature formalism, and
assume a separation of relaxation times, to show that a partial degree of
annealing is already sufficient to stabilize a biaxial nematic structure.
