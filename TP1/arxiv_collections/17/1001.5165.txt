This paper updates and improves the study of electron neutrino appearance in
the framework of two far detectors at different oscillation maxima,
specifically, Tokai-To-Kamioka-to-Korea. We used a likelihood based on
reconstructed quantities to distinguish charged current $\nu_e$ interactions
from neutral current background. We studied the efficiency of the likelihood
for a 20% photo-coverage in comparison of a 40% photo-coverage. We used a
detailed neutrino event simulation to estimate the neutral current background.
With these analysis tools we studied the sensitivity of the proposed experiment
to CP violation and mass hierarchy as a function of the off-axis angle.
