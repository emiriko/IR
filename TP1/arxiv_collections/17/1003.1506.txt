We develop coarse-graining schemes for stochastic many-particle microscopic
models with competing short- and long-range interactions on a d-dimensional
lattice. We focus on the coarse-graining of equilibrium Gibbs states and using
cluster expansions we analyze the corresponding renormalization group map. We
quantify the approximation properties of the coarse-grained terms arising from
different types of interactions and present a hierarchy of correction terms. We
derive semi-analytical numerical schemes that are accompanied with a posteriori
error estimates for coarse-grained lattice systems with short and long-range
interactions.
