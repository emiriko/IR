Simulations that couple different classical molecular models in an adaptive
way by changing the number of degrees of freedom on the fly, are available
within reasonably consistent theoretical frameworks. The same does not occur
when it comes to classical-quantum adaptivity. The main reason for this is the
difficulty in describing a continuous transition between the two different kind
of physical principles: probabilistic for the quantum and deterministic for the
classical. Here we report the basic principles of an algorithm that allows for
a continuous and smooth transition by employing the path integral description
of atoms.
