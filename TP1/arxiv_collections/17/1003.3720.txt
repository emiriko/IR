In a region free of currents, magnetostatics can be described by the Laplace
equation of a scalar magnetic potential, and one can apply the same methods
commonly used in electrostatics. Here we show how to calculate the general
vector field inside a real (finite) solenoid, using only the magnitude of the
field along the symmetry axis. Our method does not require integration or
knowledge of the current distribution, and is presented through practical
examples, including a non-uniform finite solenoid used to produce cold atomic
beams via laser cooling. These examples allow educators to discuss the
non-trivial calculation of fields off-axis using concepts familiar to most
students, while offering the opportunity to introduce important advancements of
current modern research.
