"EIT waves" are a wavelike phenomenon propagating in the corona, which were
initially observed in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelength by the EUV
Imaging Telescope (EIT). Their nature is still elusive, with the debate between
fast-mode wave model and non-wave model. In order to distinguish between these
models, we investigate the relation between the EIT wave velocity and the local
magnetic field in the corona. It is found that the two parameters show
significant negative correlation in most of the EIT wave fronts, {\it i.e.},
EIT wave propagates more slowly in the regions of stronger magnetic field. Such
a result poses a big challenge to the fast-mode wave model, which would predict
a strong positive correlation between the two parameters. However, it is
demonstrated that such a result can be explained by the fieldline stretching
model, \emph{i.e.,} that "EIT waves" are apparently-propagating brightenings,
which are generated by successive stretching of closed magnetic field lines
pushed by the erupting flux rope during coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
