The signature at the LHC of many Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios is
events with large missing energy. If the forward outgoing protons are measured,
we show that the production and decay of BSM particles in the central rapidity
interval, with gaps in rapidity either side, offers certain advantages over
inclusive production, to search for signals (a) with missing longitudinal
4-momentum (typical of invisible Higgs production), and (b) for new light
pseudoscalar bosons.
