We obtain exact expressions for the effect of primordial non-Gaussianity on
the matter density perturbation up to second order in a LambdaCDM cosmology,
fully accounting for the general relativistic corrections arising on scales
comparable with the Hubble radius. We present our results both in the Poisson
gauge and in the comoving and synchronous gauge, which are relevant for
comparison to different cosmological observables.
