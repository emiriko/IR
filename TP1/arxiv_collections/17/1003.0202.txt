We show that graphene deposited on a substrate has a non-negligible density
of atomic scale defects. This is evidenced by a previously unnoticed D peak in
the Raman spectra with intensity of about 1% with respect to the G peak. We
evaluated the effect of such impurities on electron transport by mimicking them
with hydrogen adsorbates and measuring the induced changes in both mobility and
Raman intensity. If the intervalley scatterers responsible for the D peak are
monovalent, their concentration is sufficient to account for the limited
mobilities achievable in graphene on a substrate.
