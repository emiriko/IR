Many steganographic techniques were proposed for hiding secret message inside
images, the simplest of them being the LSB data hiding. In this paper, we
suggest a novel data hiding technique in an HTML Web page and also propose some
simple techniques to extend the embedding technique to source codes written in
any programming language (both case insensitive like HTML, Pascal and case
sensitive languages like C, C++, Java). We basically try to exploit the
case-redundancy in case-insensitive language, while we try hiding data with
minimal changes in the source code (almost not raising suspicion). HTML Tags
are case insensitive and hence an alphabet in lowercase and one in uppercase
present inside an HTML tag are interpreted in the same manner by the browser,
i.e., change in case in a web page is imperceptible to the browser. We first
exploit this redundancy and use it to embed secret data inside an web page,
with no changes visible to the user of the web page, so that he can not even
suspect about the data hiding. The embedded data can be recovered by viewing
the source of the HTML page. This technique can easily be extended to embed
secret message inside any piece of source-code where the standard interpreter
of that language is case-insensitive. For case-sensitive programming languages
we do minimal changes in the source code (e.g., add an extra character in the
token identified by the lexical analyzer) without violating the lexical and
syntactic notation for that language) and try to make the change almost
imperceptible.
