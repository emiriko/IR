By adopting a $T$-matrix based method within $G_0G$ approximation for the
pair susceptibility, we studied the effects of pairing fluctuation on the
BCS-BEC crossover in symmetric nuclear matter. The pairing fluctuation induces
a pseudogap in the excitation spectrum of nucleon in both superfluid and normal
phases. The critical temperature of superfluid transition was calculated. It
differs from the BCS result remarkably when density is low. We also computed
the specific heat which shows a nearly ideal BEC type temperature dependence at
low density but a BCS type behavior at high density. This qualitative change of
the temperature dependence of specific heat may serve as a thermodynamic signal
for BCS-BEC crossover.
