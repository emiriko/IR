We note that massless fields within the future and past light cone may be
quantized as independent systems. We show that the vacuum is an entangled state
of these systems, exactly mirroring the known entanglement between the
spacelike separated Rindler wedges. We describe a detector which exhibits a
thermal response to the vacuum when switched on at t=0. The feasibility of
experimentally detecting this effect is discussed.
