A pixel detector with high spatial resolution and temporal information for
ultra-cold neutrons is developed based on a commercial CCD on which a neutron
converter is attached. 10B and 6Li are tested for the neutron converter and 10B
is found to be more suitable based on efficiency and spatial resolution. The
pixel detector has an efficiency of 44.1 +- 1.1% and a spatial resolution of
2.9 +- 0.1 um (1 sigma).
