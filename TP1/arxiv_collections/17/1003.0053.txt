In this paper, we establish existence results for positive solutions to the
Lichnerowicz equation of the following type in closed manifolds -\Delta
u=A(x)u^{-p}-B(x)u^{q},\quad in\quad M, where $p>1, q>0$, and $A(x)>0$,
$B(x)\geq0$ are given smooth functions. Our analysis is based on the global
existence of positive solutions to the following heat equation {ll} u_t-\Delta
u=A(x)u^{-p}-B(x)u^{q},\quad in\quad M\times\mathbb{R}^{+}, u(x,0)=u_0,\quad
in\quad M with the positive smooth initial data $u_0$.
