We probe flows of soft, viscous spheres near the jamming point, which acts as
a critical point for static soft spheres. Starting from energy considerations,
we find nontrivial scaling of velocity fluctuations with strain rate. Combining
this scaling with insights from jamming, we arrive at an analytical model that
predicts four distinct regimes of flow, each characterized by rational-valued
scaling exponents. Both the number of regimes and values of the exponents
depart from prior results. We validate predictions of the model with
simulations.
