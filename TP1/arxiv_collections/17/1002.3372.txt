We present a new software tool to enable astronomers to easily compare
observations of emission line ratios with those determined by photoionization
and shock models, ITERA, the IDL Tool for Emission-line Ratio Analysis. This
tool can plot ratios of emission lines predicted by models and allows for
comparison of observed line ratios against grids of these models selected from
model libraries associated with the tool. We provide details of the libraries
of standard photoionization and shock models available with ITERA, and, in
addition, present three example emission line ratio diagrams covering a range
of wavelengths to demonstrate the capabilities of ITERA. ITERA, and associated
libraries, is available from \url{http://www.brentgroves.net/itera.html}
