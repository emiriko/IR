We summarize the phase diagrams of SU, SO and Sp gauge theories as function
of the number of flavors, colors, and matter representation as well as the ones
of phenomenologically relevant chiral gauge theories such as the
Bars-Yankielowicz and the generalized Georgi-Glashow models. We finally report
on the intriguing possibility of the existence of gauge-duals for
nonsupersymmetric gauge theories and the impact on their conformal window.
