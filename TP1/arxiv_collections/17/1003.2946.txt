We experimentally investigate the non-resonant feeding of photons into the
optical mode of a zero dimensional nanocavity by quantum dot multiexciton
transitions. Power dependent photoluminescence measurements reveal a
super-linear power dependence of the mode emission, indicating that the
emission stems from multiexcitons. By monitoring the temporal evolution of the
photoluminescence spectrum, we observe a clear anticorrelation of the mode and
single exciton emission; the mode emission quenches as the population in the
system reduces towards the single exciton level whilst the intensity of the
mode emission tracks the multi-exciton transitions. Our results lend strong
support to a recently proposed mechanism mediating the strongly non-resonant
feeding of photons into the cavity mode.
