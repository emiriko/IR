Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems have recently emerged as a key
technology in wireless communication systems for increasing both data rates and
system performance. There are many schemes that can be applied to MIMO systems
such as space time block codes, space time trellis codes, and the Vertical Bell
Labs Space-Time Architecture (V-BLAST). This paper proposes a novel signal
detector scheme called MIMO detectors to enhance the performance in MIMO
channels. We study the general MIMO system, the general V-BLAST architecture
with Maximum Likelihood (ML), Zero- Forcing (ZF), Minimum Mean- Square Error
(MMSE), and Ordered Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) detectors and
simulate this structure in Rayleigh fading channel. Also compares the
performances of MIMO system with different modulation techniques in Fading and
AWGN channels. Base on frame error rates and bit error rates, we compare the
performance and the computational complexity of these schemes with other
existence model.Simulations shown that V-BLAST implements a detection
technique, i.e. SIC receiver, based on ZF or MMSE combined with symbol
cancellation and optimal ordering to improve the performance with lower
complexity, although ML receiver appears to have the best SER performance-BLAST
achieves symbol error rates close to the ML scheme while retaining the
lowcomplexity nature of the V-BLAST.
