This conference proceeding presents the first results of the full CMS Tracker
alignment based on several million reconstructed tracks from the cosmic data
taken during the commissioning runs with the detector in its final position and
magnetic field present. The all-silicon design of the CMS Tracker poses new
challenges in aligning a complex system with 15\,148 silicon strip and 1440
silicon pixel modules. For optimal track-parameter resolution, the position and
orientation of its modules need to be determined with a precision of about one
micrometer. The modules, well illuminated by cosmic ray particles, were aligned
using two track-based alignment algorithms in sequence in combination with
survey measurements. The resolution in all five track parameters is controlled
with data-driven validation of the track parameter measurements near the
interaction region, and tested against prediction with detailed detector
simulation. An outlook for the expected tracking performance with the first
proton collisions is given.
