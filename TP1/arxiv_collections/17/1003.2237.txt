We consider quantum dynamics of the order parameter in the discrete pairing
model (Richardson model) in thermodynamic equilibrium. The integrable
Richardson Hamiltonian is represented as a direct sum of Hamiltonians acting in
different Hilbert spaces of single-particle and paired/empty states. This
allows us to factorize the full thermodynamic partition function into a
combination of simple terms associated with real spins on singly-occupied
states and the partition function of the quantum XY-model for Anderson
pseudospins associated with the paired/empty states. Using coherent-state
path-integral, we calculate the effects of superconducting phase fluctuations
exactly. The contribution of superconducting amplitude fluctuations to the
partition function in the broken-symmetry phase is shown to follow from the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations in imaginary time. These equations in turn allow
several interesting mappings, e.g., they are shown to be in a one-to-one
correspondence with the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation in
supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics. However, the most practically useful approach
to calculate functional determinants is found to be via an analytical
continuation of the quantum order parameter to real time, \Delta(\tau -> it),
such that the problem maps onto that of a driven two-level system. The
contribution of a particular dynamic order parameter to the partition function
is shown to correspond to the sum of the Berry phase and dynamic phase
accumulated by the pseudospin. We also examine a family of exact solutions for
two-level-system dynamics on a class of elliptic functions and suggest a
compact expression to estimate the functional determinants on such
trajectories. The possibility of having quantum soliton solutions co-existing
with classical BCS mean-field is discussed.
