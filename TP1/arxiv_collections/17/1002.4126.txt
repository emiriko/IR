We study the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes system on a flat cylinder with the
usual Dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity field u. We formulate the
problem as an infinite system of ODE's for the natural Fourier components of
the vorticity, and the boundary conditions are taken into account by adding a
vorticity production at the boundary. We prove equivalence to the original
Navier-Stokes system and show that the decay of the Fourier modes is
exponential for any positive time in the periodic direction, but it is only
power-like in the other direction.
