In this article, we study the ${3\over 2}^+$ heavy and doubly heavy baryon
states $\Xi^*_{cc}$, $\Omega^*_{cc}$, $\Xi^*_{bb}$, $\Omega^*_{bb}$,
  $\Sigma_c^*$, $\Xi_c^*$, $\Omega_c^*$, $\Sigma_b^*$, $\Xi_b^*$ and
$\Omega_b^*$ by subtracting the contributions from the corresponding ${3\over
2}^-$ heavy and doubly heavy baryon states with the QCD sum rules, and make
reasonable predictions for their masses.
