In this paper we intend to extend some ideas of a recently proposed
Lorentz-invariant Bohmian model, obeying Klein-Gordon equations, but
considering particles with a spin different than zero. First we build a Bohmian
model for a single particle, closely related to the Bohm-Dirac model, but using
Nikolic's ideas on a space-time probability density and the introduction of a
synchronization parameter \sigma for the particle trajectory. We prove that, in
the case of a spinor whose component phases become equal when \plank \to 0, it
is possible to use the usual Bohmian Mechanics procedures to obtain the
classical limit. We extend these ideas for a two-particle system, based on two
non-local but covariant Dirac-like equations.
