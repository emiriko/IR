We have discussed the tensor-network representation of classical statistical
or interacting quantum lattice models, and given a comprehensive introduction
to the numerical methods we recently proposed for studying the tensor-network
states/models in two dimensions. A second renormalization scheme is introduced
to take into account the environment contribution in the calculation of the
partition function of classical tensor network models or the expectation values
of quantum tensor network states. It improves significantly the accuracy of the
coarse grained tensor renormalization group method. In the study of the quantum
tensor-network states, we point out that the renormalization effect of the
environment can be efficiently and accurately described by the bond vector.
This, combined with the imaginary time evolution of the wavefunction, provides
an accurate projection method to determine the tensor-network wavfunction. It
reduces significantly the truncation error and enable a tensor-network state
with a large bond dimension, which is difficult to be accessed by other
methods, to be accurately determined.
