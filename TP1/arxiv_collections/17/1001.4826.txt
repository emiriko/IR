A large deviation principle is derived for stochastic partial differential
equations with slow-fast components. The result shows that the rate function is
exactly that of the averaged equation plus the fluctuating deviation which is a
stochastic partial differential equation with small Gaussian perturbation. This
also confirms the effectiveness of the approximation of the averaged equation
plus the fluctuating deviation to the slow-fast stochastic partial differential
equations.
