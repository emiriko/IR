We present the first astrophysical measurement of the pressure of cold matter
above nuclear saturation density, based on recently determined masses and radii
of three neutron stars. The pressure at higher densities are below the
predictions of equations of state that account only for nucleonic degrees of
freedom, and thus present a challenge to the microscopic theory of neutron star
matter.
