The preparation of pseudo-pure states plays a central role in the
implementation of quantum information processing in high temperature ensemble
systems, such as nuclear magnetic resonance. Here we describe a simple approach
based on controlled-transfer gates which permits pseudo-pure states to be
prepared efficiently using spatial averaging techniques.
