A new calorimeter for measurements of the AC heat capacity and magnetocaloric
effect of small samples in pulsed magnetic fields is discussed for the
exploration of thermal and thermodynamic properties at temperatures down to 2
K. We tested the method up to \mu 0H = 50 Tesla, but it could be extended to
higher fields. For these measurements we used carefully calibrated bare chip
Cernox\textregistered and RuO2 thermometers, and we present a comparison of
their performance. The monotonic temperature and magnetic field dependences of
the magneto resistance of RuO2 allow us to carry on precise thermometry with a
precision as good as \pm 1mK at T = 2 K. To test the performance of our
calorimeter, AC heat capacity and magnetocaloric effect for the spin-dimer
compound Sr3Cr2O8 and the triangular lattice antiferromagnet RbFe(MoO4)2 are
presented.
