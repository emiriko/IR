We provide a structure theorem for all almost complete intersection ideals of
depth three in any Noetherian local ring. In particular, we find that the
minimal generators are the pfaffians of suitable submatrices of an alternating
matrix. From the graded version of the previous result, we characterize the
graded Betti numbers of all 3-codimensional almost complete intersection
schemes of P^r.
