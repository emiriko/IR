It is shown how the exchange interaction, the dipole-dipole interaction, and
the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction between electronic spin-density
fluctuations emerge naturally from a field-theoretic framework that couples
electrons to the fluctuating electromagnetic potential. Semi-quantitative
estimates are given to determine when the dipole-dipole interaction, which is
often neglected, needs to be considered, and various applications are
discussed, with an emphasis on weak ferromagnets and on helimagnets.
