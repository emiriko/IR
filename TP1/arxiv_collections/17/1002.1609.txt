Recent results of a mixed shell model heated asymmetrically by transient
increases in nuclear burning indicate the transient generation of small hot
spots inside the Sun somewhere between 0.1 and 0.2 solar radii. These hot
bubbles are followed by a nonlinear differential equation system with finite
amplitude non-homologous perturbations which is solved in a solar model. Our
results show the possibility of a direct connection between the dynamic
phenomena of the solar core and the atmospheric activity. Namely, an initial
heating about DQ_0 ~ 10^{31}-10^{37} ergs can be enough for a bubble to reach
the outer convective zone. Our calculations show that a hot bubble can arrive
into subphotospheric regions with DQ_final ~ 10^{28} - 10^{34} ergs with a high
speed, up to 10 km s-1, approaching the local sound speed. We point out that
the developing sonic boom transforms the shock front into accelerated particle
beam injected upwards into the top of loop carried out by the hot bubble above
its forefront traveling from the solar interior. As a result, a new perspective
arises to explain flare energetics. We show that the particle beams generated
by energetic deep-origin hot bubbles in the subphotospheric layers have masses,
energies, and chemical compositions in the observed range of solar
chromospheric and coronal flares. It is shown how the emergence of a hot bubble
into subphotospheric regions offers a natural mechanism that can generate both
the eruption leading to the flare and the observed coronal magnetic topology
for reconnection. We show a list of long-standing problems of solar physics
that our model explains. We present some predictions for observations, some of
which are planned to be realized in the near future.
