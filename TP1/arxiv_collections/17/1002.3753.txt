The influence of pure dephasing on the dynamics of the coupling between a
two-level atom and a cavity mode is systematically addressed. We have derived
an effective atom-cavity coupling rate that is shown to be a key parameter in
the physics of the problem, allowing to generalize the known expression for the
Purcell factor to the case of broad emitters, and to define strategies to
optimize the performances of broad emitters-based single photon sources.
Moreover, pure dephasing is shown to be able to restore lasing in presence of
detuning, a further demonstration that decoherence can be seen as a fundamental
resource in solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics, offering appealing
perspectives in the context of advanced nano-photonic devices.
