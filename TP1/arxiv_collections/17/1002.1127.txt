Studied here is the large-time behavior of solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries
equation posed on the right half-line under the effect of a localized damping.
Assuming as in \cite{linares-pazoto} that the damping is active on a set
$(a_0,+\infty)$ with $a_0>0$, we establish the exponential decay of the
solutions in the weighted spaces $L^2((x+1)^mdx)$ for $m\in \N ^*$ and
$L^2(e^{2bx}dx)$ for $b>0$ by a Lyapunov approach. The decay of the spatial
derivatives of the solution is also derived.
