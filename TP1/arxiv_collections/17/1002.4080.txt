We compute the Donaldson-Thomas invariants for two types of Calabi-Yau
3-folds. These invariants are associated to the moduli spaces of rank-2
Gieseker semistable sheaves. None of the sheaves are locally free, and their
double duals are locally free stable sheaves investigated earlier by Donaldson
and Thomas, Li and Qin respectively. We show that these Gieseker moduli spaces
are isomorphic to some Quot-schemes. We prove a formula for Behrend's functions
when torus actions present with positive dimensional fixed point sets, and use
it to obtain the generating series of the relevant Donaldson-Thomas invariants
in terms of the McMahon function. Our results might shed some light on the
wall-crossing phenomena of Donaldson-Thomas invariants.
