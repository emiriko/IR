Nanometer thick cuprates are an appealing platform for devices as well as
exploring the roles of dimensionality, disorder, and free carrier density in
these compounds. To this end we have produced exfoliated crystals of
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 on oxidized silicon substrates. The exfoliated crystals were
characterized via Atomic Force and polarized Raman microscopies. Proper
procedures for production, handling and monitoring of these thin oxides are
described. Subtle differences between the exfoliated and bulk crystals are also
discussed.
