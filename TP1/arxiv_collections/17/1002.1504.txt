We demonstrate a two-element oven and Zeeman slower that produce simultaneous
and overlapped slow beams of rubidium and lithium. The slower uses a
three-stage design with a long, low acceleration middle stage for decelerating
rubidium situated between two short, high acceleration stages for aggressive
deceleration of lithium. This design is appropriate for producing high fluxes
of atoms with a large mass ratio in a simple, robust setup.
