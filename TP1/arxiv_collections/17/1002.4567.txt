Interference between different energy eigenstates in a quantum system results
in an oscillation with a frequency which is proportional to the difference in
energy between the states. Such an oscillation is observable in polarized
positronium when it is placed in a magnetic field. In order to measure the
hyperfine splitting of positronium, we perform the precise measurement of this
oscillation using a high quality superconducting magnet and fast
photon-detectors. A result of $203.324 \pm 0.039\rm{~(stat.)} \pm
0.015\rm{(~sys.)}$~GHz is obtained which is consistent with both theoretical
calculations and previous precise measurements.
