We show that if the derivative of the Riemann zeta function has sufficiently
many zeros close to the critical line, then the zeta function has many closely
spaced zeros. This gives a condition on the zeros of the derivative of the zeta
function which implies a lower bound of the class numbers of imaginary
quadratic fields.
