We report on a self-emerging chimera state in a homogeneous chain of
nonlocally and nonlinearly coupled oscillators. This chimera, i.e. a state with
coexisting regions of complete and partial synchrony, emerges via a
supercritical bifurcation from a homogeneous state and thus does not require
preparation of special initial conditions. We develop a theory of chimera
basing on the equations for the local complex order parameter in the
Ott-Antonsen approximation. Applying a numerical linear stability analysis, we
also describe the instability of the chimera and transition to a phase
turbulence with persistent patches of synchrony.
