A recent paper by V.V. Demjanov in Physics Letters A reported a formula that
relates the magnitude of Michelson interferometer fringe shifts to refractive
index and absolute velocity. We show here that relativistic corrections to the
Sellmeier equation allow an alternative derivation of the formula.
