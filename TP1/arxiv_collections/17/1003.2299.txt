Correlations are studied between the power density of transverse waves having
frequencies between $0.01$ and $1$ normalized to the proton gyrofrequency in
the plasma frame and the ratio of the perpendicular and parallel temperature of
the protons. The wave power spectrum is evaluated from high-resolution 3D
magnetic field vector components, and the ion temperatures are derived from the
velocity distribution functions as measured in fast solar wind during the
Helios-2 primary mission at radial distances from the Sun between 0.3~AU and
0.9~AU. From our statistical analysis, we obtain a striking correlation between
the increases in the proton temperature ratio and enhancements in the wave
power spectrum. Near the Sun the transverse part of the wave power is often
found to be by more than an order of magnitude higher than its longitudinal
counterpart. Also the measured ion temperature anisotropy appears to be limited
by the theoretical threshold value for the ion-cyclotron instability. This
suggests that high-frequency Alfv\'{e}n-cyclotron waves regulate the proton
temperature anisotropy.
