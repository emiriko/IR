Following a model based on the $\rm{SU}(8)$ symmetry that treats heavy
pseudo-scalars and heavy vector mesons on an equal footing, as required by
heavy quark symmetry, we study the interaction of baryons and mesons in coupled
channels within an unitary approach that generates dynamically poles in the
scattering $T$-matrix. We concentrate in the exotic channels with negative
charm quantum number for which there is the experimental claim of one state.
