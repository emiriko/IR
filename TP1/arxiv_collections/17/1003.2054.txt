Contrary to the finite dimensional case, Weyl and Wick quantizations are no
more asymptotically equivalent in the infinite dimensional bosonic second
quantization. Moreover neither the Weyl calculus defined for cylindrical
symbols nor the Wick calculus defined for polynomials are preserved by the
action of a nonlinear flow. Nevertheless taking advantage carefully of the
information brought by these two calculuses in the mean field asymptotics, the
propagation of Wigner measures for general states can be proved, extending to
the infinite dimensional case a standard result of semiclassical analysis.
