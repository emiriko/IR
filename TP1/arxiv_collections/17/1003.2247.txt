In all papers on the BB84 protocol, the transmission probability of each bit
value is usually set to be equal. In this paper, we show that by assigning
different transmission probability to each transmitted qubit within a single
polarization basis, we can generally improve the key generation rate of the
BB84 protocol and achieve a higher key rate.
