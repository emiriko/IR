We show that holographic composite Higgs Models with a discrete A4 symmetry
naturally predict hierarchical charged lepton masses and an approximate
tri-bimaximal lepton mixing with the correct scale of neutrino masses. They
also satisfy current constraints from electroweak precision tests, lepton
flavor violation and lepton mixing in a large region of parameter space. Two
phenomenologically relevant features arise in these models. First, an extra
suppression on the lepton Yukawa couplings makes the tau lepton more composite
than naively expected from its mass. As a consequence new light leptonic
resonances, with masses as low as few hundreds of GeV, large couplings to tau
and a very characteristic collider phenomenology, are quite likely. Second, the
discrete symmetry A4 together with the model structure provide a double-layer
of flavor protection that allows to keep tree-level mediated processes below
present experimental limits. One-loop processes violating lepton flavor, like
mu -> e gamma, may be however observable at future experiments.
