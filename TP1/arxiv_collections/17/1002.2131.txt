The Reynolds number dependence of the dimensionless dissipation rate is
derived directly from the Karman-Howarth equation in terms of the inverse of
the integral scale Reynolds number and a coefficient which depends on the
second- and third-order structure functions. Fitting this form to the results
from a direct numerical simulation indicates that the coefficient is
effectively constant.
