EC 11481-2303 is a peculiar, hot, high-gravity pre-white dwarf. Previous
optical spectroscopy revealed that it is a sdOB star with an effective
temperature (Teff) of 41790 K, a surface gravity log(g)= 5.84, and He/H = 0.014
by number. We present an on-going spectral analysis by means of non-LTE
model-atmosphere techniques based on high-resolution, high-S/N optical
(VLT-UVES) and ultraviolet (FUSE, IUE) observations. We are able to reproduce
the optical and UV observations simultaneously with a chemically homogeneous
NLTE model atmosphere with a significantly higher effective temperature and
lower He abundance (Teff = 55000 K, log (g) = 5.8, and He / H = 0.0025 by
number). While C, N, and O appear less than 0.15 times solar, the iron-group
abundance is strongly enhanced by at least a factor of ten.
