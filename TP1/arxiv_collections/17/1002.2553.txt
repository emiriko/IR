A convergence of the valence quark self-energies in the 1S, 2S, $1P_{1/2}$,
$1P_{3/2}$ orbits induced by pion and gluon field configurations, is shown in
the frame of a relativistic chiral quark model. It is shown that in order to
reach a convergence, one needs to include contribution of the intermediate
quark and anti-quark states with the total momentum up to $j=25/2$. It is
argued that a restriction to the lowest mode when estimating the self-energy is
not good approximation.
