We investigate growing interfaces of topological-defect turbulence in the
electroconvection of nematic liquid crystals. The interfaces exhibit
self-affine roughening characterized by both spatial and temporal scaling laws
of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang theory in 1+1 dimensions. Moreover, we reveal that
the distribution and the two-point correlation of the interface fluctuations
are universal ones governed by the largest eigenvalue of random matrices. This
provides quantitative experimental evidence of the universality prescribing
detailed information of scale-invariant fluctuations.
