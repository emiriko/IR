We present dynamical description of gravitational collapse in view of Misner
and Sharp's formalism. Matter under consideration is a complicated fluid
consistent with plane symmetry which we assume to undergo dissipation in the
form of heat flow, radiation, shear and bulk viscosity. Junction conditions are
studied for a general spacetime in the interior and Vaidya spacetime in the
exterior regions. Dynamical equations are obtained and coupled with causal
transport equations derived in context of M$\ddot{u}$ller Israel Stewart
theory. The role of dissipative quantities over collapse is investigated.
