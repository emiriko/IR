We experimentally demonstrate an optical pumping technique to pump a dilute
rubidium vapor into the mF = 0 ground states. The technique utilizes selection
rules that forbid the excitation of the mF = 0 state by linearly-polarized
light. A substantial increase in the transparency contrast of coherent
population trapping in the clock transition is demonstrated.
