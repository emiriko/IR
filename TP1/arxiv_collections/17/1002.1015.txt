We describe a simple n-dimensional quantum cellular automaton (QCA) capable
of simulating all others, in that the initial configuration and the forward
evolution of any n-dimensional QCA can be encoded within the initial
configuration of the intrinsically universal QCA. Several steps of the
intrinsically universal QCA then correspond to one step of the simulated QCA.
The simulation preserves the topology in the sense that each cell of the
simulated QCA is encoded as a group of adjacent cells in the universal QCA.
