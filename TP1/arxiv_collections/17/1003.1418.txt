We investigate the energetics of reactions involving pairs of alkali metal
dimers. Atom exchange reactions to form homonuclear dimers are energetically
allowed for some but not all of the heteronuclear dimers. We carry out
high-level electronic structure calculations on the potential energy surfaces
of all the heteronuclear alkali metal trimers and show that trimer formation
reactions are always energetically forbidden for low-lying singlet states of
the dimers. The results have important implications for the stability of
quantum gases of alkali metal dimers.
