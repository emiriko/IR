Star clusters are fundamental building blocks of galaxies. Their formation is
related to the density and pressure in progenitor molecular clouds and their
environmental conditions. To understand better the dynamical processes driving
star formation and chemical evolution, we compare ages, metallicities, and
alpha-element abundance ratios of globular clusters in nearby dwarf galaxies of
different luminosities and morphological types, and situated in different
environments. The data are based on our 6m telescope medium-resolution
spectroscopic observations. We find that a mean metallicity of GCs in a galaxy
at a given age is higher for early-type dwarfs, than for late-type dwarf
irregulars and spirals.
