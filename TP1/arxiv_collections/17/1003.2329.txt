This is my attempt to answer Schr\"odinger's question: "What is Life?". In
living cell the local combination of atoms is reproduced with incredible
accuracy. In the case of protein biosynthesis the notion of the physical aspect
of the process can be qualitatively enriched by taking into account the
symmetry of conformational oscillations. This is the key to understand the
selectivity in biochemistry.
