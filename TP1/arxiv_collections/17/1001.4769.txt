We present evidence that transition region red-shifts are naturally produced
in episodically heated models where the average volumetric heating scale height
lies between that of the chromospheric pressure scale height of 200 km and the
coronal scale height of 50 Mm. In order to do so we present results from 3d MHD
models spanning the upper convection zone up to the corona, 15 Mm above the
photosphere. Transition region and coronal heating in these models is due both
the stressing of the magnetic field by photospheric and convection `zone
dynamics, but also in some models by the injection of emerging magnetic flux.
