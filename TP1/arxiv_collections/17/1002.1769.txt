The supersymmetric analog of the reciprocal transformation is introduced.
This is used to establish a transformation between one of the supersymmetric
Harry Dym equations and the supersymmetric modified Korteweg-de Vries equation.
The reciprocal transformation, as a B\"{a}cklund-type transformation between
these two equations, is adopted to construct a recursion operator of the
supersymmetric Harry Dym equation. By proper factorization of the recursion
operator, a bi-Hamiltonian structure is found for the supersymmetric Harry Dym
equation. Furthermore, a supersymmetric Kawamoto equation is proposed and is
associated to the supersymmetric Sawada-Kotera equation. The recursion operator
and odd bi-Hamiltonian structure of the supersymmetric Kawamoto equation are
also constructed.
