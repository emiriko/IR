We discuss possible avenues to study fission dynamics starting from a
time-dependent mean-field approach. Previous attempts to study fission dynamics
using the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory are analyzed. We argue that
different initial conditions may be needed to describe fission dynamics
depending on the specifics of the fission phenomenon and propose various
approaches towards this goal. In particular, we provide preliminary
calculations for studying fission following a heavy-ion reaction using TDHF
with a density contraint. Regarding prompt muon-induced fission, we also
suggest a new approach for combining the time-evolution of the muonic wave
function with a microscopic treatment of fission dynamics via TDHF.
