We study the dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the nearby M81 group in order to
construct their photometric metallicity distributions and to investigate the
potential presence of population gradients. We select all the dwarf spheroidals
with available Hubble Space Telescope / Advanced Camera for Surveys archival
observations, nine in total. We interpolate isochrones so as to assign a
photometric metallicity to each star within a selection box in the
color-magnitude diagram of each dwarf galaxy. We assume that the dwarf
spheroidals contain mainly an old stellar population. In order to search for
metallicity gradients, we examine the spatial distribution of two stellar
populations that we separate according to their metallicities. As a result, we
present the photometric metallicity distribution functions, the cumulative
histograms and smoothed density maps of the metal-poor and metal-rich stars as
well as of the intermediate-age stars. From our photometric data we find that
all the dwarf spheroidals show a wide range in metallicities, with mean values
that are typical for old and metal-poor systems, with the exception of one
dwarf spheroidal, namely IKN. Some of our dwarf spheroidals exhibit
characteristics of transition-type dwarfs. Compared to the Local Group
transition type dwarfs, the M81 group ones appear to have mean metallicity
values slightly more metal-rich at a given luminosity. All the dwarf
spheroidals considered here appear to exhibit either population gradients or
spatial variations in the centroids of their metal-poor and metal-rich
population. In addition, there are luminous AGB stars detected in all of them
with spatial distributions suggesting that they are well mixed with the old
stars.
