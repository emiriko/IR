We use a generalized master equation (GME) to describe the nonequilibrium
magnetotransport of interacting electrons through a broad finite quantum wire
with an embedded ring structure. The finite quantum wire is weakly coupled to
two broad leads acting as reservoirs of electrons. The mutual Coulomb
interaction of the electrons is described using a configuration interaction
method for the many-electron states of the central system. We report some
non-trivial interaction effects both at the level of time-dependent filling of
states and on the time-dependent transport. We find that the Coulomb
interaction in this non-trivial geometry can enhance the correlation of
electronic states in the system and facilitate it's charging in certain
circumstances in the weak coupling limit appropriate for the GME. In addition,
we find oscillations in the current in the leads due to the correlations
oscillations caused by the switched-on lead- system coupling. The oscillations
are influenced and can be enhanced by the external magnetic field and the
Coulomb interaction.
