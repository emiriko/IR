Parallel programming models exist as an abstraction of hardware and memory
architectures. There are several parallel programming models in commonly use;
they are shared memory model, thread model, message passing model, data
parallel model, hybrid model, Flynn's models, embarrassingly parallel
computations model, pipelined computations model. These models are not specific
to a particular type of machine or memory architecture. This paper focuses the
concurrent approach to Flynn's SPMD classification in single processing
environment through java program.
