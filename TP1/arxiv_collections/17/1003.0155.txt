Topological insulators (TI) realize a novel state of quantum matter that are
distinguished by topological invariants of bulk band structure rather than
spontaneously broken symmetries. A number of exotic quantum phenomena have been
predicted to exist in multiply-connected geometries which require an enormous
amount of materials flexibility. We have extended our previous search for TI
materials from binary (Bi2X3 series) to the thermoelectric ternary compounds.
We discover that the distorted LuPtSb is the first ternary compound harboring a
3D topological insulator state. We also show that the half-Heusler LuPtSb-type
series is a natural platform that hosts a range of candidate compounds, alloys
and artificial heterostructures (quantum-wells). We also discovered several
different paradigms of trivial and non-trivial topological ordering in this
class, including a metallic nontrivial topological state in YAuPb. Some of
these materials are grown (results will be reported separately).
