We study non-equilibrium electron transport through a quantum impurity
coupled to metallic leads using the equation of motion technique at finite
temperature T. Assuming that the interactions are taking place solely in the
impurity and focusing in the infinite Hubbard limit, we compute the out of
equilibrium density of states and the differential conductance G_2(T,V) to test
several scaling laws. We find that G_2(T,V)/G_2(T,0) is a universal function of
both eV/T_K and T/T_K, being T_K the Kondo temperature. The effect of an in
plane magnetic field on the splitting of the zero bias anomaly in the
differential conductance is also analyzed. For a Zeeman splitting \Delta, the
computed differential conductance peak splitting depends only on \Delta/T_K,
and for large fields approaches the value of 2\Delta . Besides the traditional
two leads setup, we also consider other configurations that mimics recent
experiments, namely, an impurity embedded in a mesoscopic wire and the presence
of a third weakly coupled lead. In these cases, a double peak structure of the
Kondo resonance is clearly obtained in the differential conductance while the
amplitude of the highest peak is shown to decrease as \ln(eV/T_K). Several
features of these results are in qualitative agreement with recent experimental
observations reported on quantum dots.
