We present the recent high-statistics calculations of the nucleon
electromagnetic form factors with fully dynamical domain wall fermions on the
32^3x64 lattices generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations, with pion
masses at roughly 297 MeV, 355 MeV and 403 MeV. We study the phenomenological
fits to the momentum transfer dependence of the form factors and investigate
chiral extrapolations for the Dirac radius, Pauli radius and the anomalous
magnetic moment using two variants of chiral effective field theories, the
small scale expansion (SSE) and covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory.
