New global attractivity criteria are obtained for the second order difference
equation \[ x_{n+1}=cx_{n}+f(x_{n}-x_{n-1}),\quad n=1, 2, ... \] via a
Lyapunov-like method. Some of these results are sharp and support recent
related conjectures. Also, a necessary and sufficient condition for the
oscillation of this equation is obtained using comparison with a second order
linear difference equation with positive coefficients.
