In this note we characterise all finitely generated groups elementarily
equivalent to a solvable Baumslag-Solitar group BS$(1,n)$. It turns out that a
finitely generated group $G$ is elementarily equivalent to BS$(1,n)$ if and
only if $G$ is isomorphic to BS$(1,n)$.
  Furthermore, we show that two Baumslag-Solitar groups are existentially
(universally) equivalent if and only if they are elementarily equivalent if and
only if they are isomorphic.
