We have used optical spectroscopy to probe the normal state electrodynamic
response of Fe$_{1.06}$Te$_{0.88}$S$_{0.14}$, a member of the 11 family of
iron-based superconductors with T$_c$= 8 K. Measurements have been conducted
over a wide frequency range (50 - 50000 cm$^{-1}$) at selected temperatures
between 10 and 300 K. At low temperatures the material behaves as an
"incoherent metal": a Drude-like peak is absent from the optical conductivity,
and all optical functions reveal that quasiparticles are not well defined down
to the lowest measured temperature. We introduce "generalized spectral weight"
analysis and use it to track temperature induced redistribution of spectral
weight. Our results, combined with previous reports, indicate that the 11
family of iron-based superconductors might be different from other families.
