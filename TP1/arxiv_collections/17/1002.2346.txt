The astrophysical site of the r-process is still uncertain, and a full
exploration of the systematics of this process in terms of its dependence on
nuclear properties from stability to the neutron drip-line within realistic
stellar environments has still to be undertaken. Sufficiently high neutron to
seed ratios can only be obtained either in very neutron-rich low-entropy
environments or moderately neutron-rich high-entropy environments, related to
neutron star mergers (or jets of neutron star matter) and the high-entropy wind
of core-collapse supernova explosions. As chemical evolution models seem to
disfavor neutron star mergers, we focus here on high-entropy environments
characterized by entropy $S$, electron abundance $Y_e$ and expansion velocity
$V_{exp}$. We investigate the termination point of charged-particle reactions,
and we define a maximum entropy $S_{final}$ for a given $V_{exp}$ and $Y_e$,
beyond which the seed production of heavy elements fails due to the very small
matter density. We then investigate whether an r-process subsequent to the
charged-particle freeze-out can in principle be understood on the basis of the
classical approach, which assumes a chemical equilibrium between neutron
captures and photodisintegrations, possibly followed by a $\beta$-flow
equilibrium. In particular, we illustrate how long such a chemical equilibrium
approximation holds, how the freeze-out from such conditions affects the
abundance pattern, and which role the late capture of neutrons originating from
$\beta$-delayed neutron emission can play.
