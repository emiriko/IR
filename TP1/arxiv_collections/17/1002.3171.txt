The GSM network with the greatest worldwide number of users, succumbs to
several security vulnerabilities. The short message service (SMS) is one of its
superior and well-tried services with a global availability in the GSM
networks. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a new secure
application layer protocol, called SSMS, to efficiently embed the desired
security attributes in the SMS messages to be used as a secure bearer in the
m-payment systems. SSMS efficiently embeds the confidentiality, integrity,
authentication, and non-repudiation in the SMS messages. It provides an
elliptic curve-based public key solution that uses public keys for the secret
key establishment of a symmetric encryption. It also provides the attributes of
public verification and forward secrecy. It efficiently makes the SMS messaging
suitable for the m-payment applications where the security is the great
concern.
