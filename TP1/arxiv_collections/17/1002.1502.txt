Systems in which a short-ranged attraction and long-ranged repulsion compete
are intrinsically frustrated, leading their structure and dynamics to be
dominated either by mesoscopic order or by metastable disorder. Here we report
the latter case in a colloidal system with long-ranged electrostatic repulsions
and short-ranged depletion attractions. We find a variety of states exhibiting
slow non-diffusive dynamics: a gel, a glassy state of clusters, and a state
reminiscent of a Wigner glass. Varying the interactions, we find a continuous
crossover between the Wigner and cluster glassy states, and a sharp
discontinuous transition between the Wigner glassy state and gel. This
difference reflects the fact that dynamic arrest is driven by repulsion for the
two glassy states and attraction in the case of the gel.
