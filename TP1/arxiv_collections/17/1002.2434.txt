We report here the first infrared spectrum of the hot-Jupiter XO-1b. The
observations were obtained with NICMOS instrument onboard the Hubble Space
Telescope during a primary eclipse of the XO-1 system. Near
photon-noise-limited spectroscopy between 1.2 and 1.8 micron allows us to
determine the main composition of this hot-Jupiter's planetary atmosphere with
good precision. This is the third hot-Jupiter's atmosphere for which
spectroscopic data are available in the near IR. The spectrum shows the
presence of water vapor (H2O), methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), and
suggests the possible presence of carbon monoxide (CO). We show that the
published IRAC secondary transit emission photometric data are compatible with
the atmospheric composition at the terminator determined from the NICMOS
spectrum, with a range of possible mixing-ratios and thermal profiles;
additional emission spectroscopy data are needed to reduce the degeneracy of
the possible solutions. Finally, we note the similarity between the 1.2-1.8
micron transmission spectra of XO-1b and HD 209458b, suggesting that in
addition to having similar stellar/orbital and planetary parameters the two
systems may also have a similar exoplanetary atmospheric composition.
