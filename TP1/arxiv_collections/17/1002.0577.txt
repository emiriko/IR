This paper presents a work package realized for the G\'eOnto project. A new
method is proposed for an enrichment of a first geographical ontology developed
beforehand. This method relies on text analysis by lexico-syntactic patterns.
  From the retrieve of n-ary relations the method automatically detect those
involved in a spatial and/or temporal relation in a context of a description of
journeys.
