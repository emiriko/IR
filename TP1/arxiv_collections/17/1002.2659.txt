We investigate the dynamics of a space-charge limited, photoinjected,
electron beam in a microscopic vacuum diode. Due to the small nature of the
system it is possible to conduct high-resolution simulations where the number
of simulated particles is equal to the number of electrons within the system.
In a series of simulations of molecular dynamics type, where electrons are
treated as point-charges, we address and analyze space-charge effects in a
$\mu$m-scale vacuum diode. We have been able to reproduce breakup of a single
pulse injected with a current density beyond the Child-Langmuir limit, and we
find that continuous injection of current into the diode gap results in a well
defined train of electron bunches corresponding to THz frequency. A simple
analytical explanation of this behavior is given.
