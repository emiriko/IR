An x-ray free electron laser oscillator (XFELO) has been recently proposed
[K. Kim, Y. Shvyd'ko, and S. Reiche, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 244802 (2008)].
Angular orientation and position in space of Bragg mirrors of the XFELO optical
cavity must be continuously adjusted to compensate instabilities and maximize
the output intensity. An angular stability of about 10 nrad (rms) is required
[K. Kim and Y. Shvyd'ko Phys. Rev. STAB 12, 030703 (2009)]. To approach this
goal, a feedback loop based on a null-detection principle was designed and used
for stabilization of a high energy resolution x-ray monochromator ($\Delta E/E
\simeq 4 \times 10^{-8}$, $E$ = 23.7 keV) and a high heat load monochromator.
Angular stability of about 13 nrad (rms) has been demonstrated for x-ray
optical elements of the monochromators.
