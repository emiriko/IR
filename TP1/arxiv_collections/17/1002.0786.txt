We report the realization of a two--dimensional optical microscope for
surface plasmons polaritons (SPPs) based on parabolic Bragg mirrors. These
mirrors are built from lithographically fabricated gold nanostructures on gold
thin films. We show by direct imaging by leakage radiation microscopy that the
magnification power of the SPP microscope follows basic predictions of
geometrical optics. Spatial resolution down to the value set by the diffraction
limit is demonstrated.
