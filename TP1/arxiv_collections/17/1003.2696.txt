Here we summarize the physical properties of the newly discovered
Fe-chalcogenide superconductors. The Fe-chalcogenide superconductors attract us
as the simplest Fe-based superconductors. Furthermore, Fe chalcogenides show a
huge pressure effect on their superconducting properties. The origin of the
high transition temperature was discussed with both the change in crystal
structure and magnetism. The progress on the thin-film and superconducting-wire
fabrications are also described.
