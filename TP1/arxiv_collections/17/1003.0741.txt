We build five-dimensional spherically symmetric wormholes within the DGP
theory. We calculate the energy localized on the shell, and we find that the
wormholes could be supported by matter not violating the energy conditions. We
also show that solitonic shells characterized by zero pressure and zero energy
can exist; thereafter we make some observations regarding their dynamic on the
phase plane. In addition, we concentrate on the mechanical stability of
wormholes under radial perturbation preserving the original spherical symmetry.
In order to do that, we consider linearized perturbations around static
solutions. We obtain that for certain values of the mass $\mu$ and crossover
scale $r_{c}$ stable wormholes exist with very small values of squared speed
sound. Unlike the case of Einstein's gravity, this type of wormholes fulfills
the energy conditions. Finally, we show that the gravitational field associated
with these wormhole configurations is attractive for $\mu>0$.
