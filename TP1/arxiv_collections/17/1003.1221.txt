It is known how to construct, in a bipartite quantum system, a unique low
rank entangled mixed state with positive partial transpose (a PPT state) from
an unextendible product basis (a UPB), defined as an unextendible set of
orthogonal product vectors. We point out that a state constructed in this way
belongs to a continuous family of entangled PPT states of the same rank, all
related by non-singular product transformations, unitary or non-unitary. The
characteristic property of a state $\rho$ in such a family is that its kernel
$\Ker\rho$ has a generalized UPB, a basis of product vectors, not necessarily
orthogonal, with no product vector in $\Im\rho$, the orthogonal complement of
$\Ker\rho$. The generalized UPB in $\Ker\rho$ has the special property that it
can be transformed to orthogonal form by a product transformation. In the case
of a system of dimension $3\times 3$, we give a complete parametrization of
orthogonal UPBs. This is then a parametrization of families of rank 4 entangled
(and extremal) PPT states, and we present strong numerical evidence that it is
a complete classification of such states. We speculate that the lowest rank
entangled and extremal PPT states also in higher dimensions are related to
generalized, non-orthogonal UPBs in similar ways.
