We address the question of optimality of entangled input states in quantum
Gaussian memory channels. For a class of such channels, that can be traced back
to the memoryless setting, we state a criterion which relate the optimality of
entangled inputs to the symmetry properties of the channels' action. Several
examples of channel models belonging to this class are discussed.
