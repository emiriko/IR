Quantum discord was proposed as a measure of the "quantumness" of
correlations. There are at least three different discord-like quantities, two
of which determine the difference between the efficiencies of a Szilard's
engine under different sets of restrictions. The three discord measures vanish
simulataneosly. We introduce an easy way to test for zero discord, relate it to
the Cerf-Adami conditional entropy and show that there is no relation between
the discord and the local disitnguishability.
