We describe a method for comparing the frequency spectra of oscillating
stars. We focus on solar-like oscillations, in which mode frequencies generally
follow a regular pattern. On the basis that oscillation frequencies of similar
stars scale homologously, we show how to display two stars on a single echelle
diagram. The result can be used to infer the ratio of their mean densities very
precisely, without reference to theoretical models. In addition, data from the
star with the better signal-to-noise ratio can be used to confirm weaker modes
and reject sidelobes in data from the second star. Finally, we show that scaled
echelle diagrams provide a solution to the problem of ridge identification in
F-type stars, such as those observed by the CoRoT space mission.
