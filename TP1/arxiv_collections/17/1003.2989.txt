Maximally supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions has a remarkably
simple S-matrix at the origin of its moduli space at both tree and loop level.
This leads to the question what, if any, of this structure survives at the
complement of this one point. Here this question is studied in detail at one
loop for the branch of the moduli space parameterized by a vacuum expectation
value for one complex scalar. Motivated by the parallel D-brane picture of
spontaneous symmetry breaking a simple relation is demonstrated between the
Lagrangian of broken super Yang-Mills theory and that of its higher dimensional
unbroken cousin. Using this relation it is proven both through an on- as well
as an off-shell method there are no so-called triangle coefficients in the
natural basis of one-loop functions at any finite point of the moduli space for
the theory under study. The off-shell method yields in addition absence of
rational terms in a class of theories on the Coulomb branch which includes the
special case of maximal supersymmetry. The results in this article provide
direct field theory evidence for a recently proposed exact dual conformal
symmetry motivated by the AdS/CFT correspondence.
