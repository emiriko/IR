We investigate hadrons and direct photon production in pp collisions at the
LHC energy within the color-dipole approach. We show that greatest sensitivity
to gluon saturation effects is reached at very forward rapidities in pp
collisions at LHC (\sqrt{s}=14 TeV). The discrepancies among various saturation
models (fitted to HERA data) results can be about a factor of 2-3 at forward
rapidities. We found that the ratio of direct-photon to pion production can be
about 20-10 at forward rapidities \eta=7-8. Therefore, direct photon production
at forward rapidities should provide a rather clean probe as the background
from radiative hadronic decays is significantly suppressed.
