For the SwissFEL project, an advanced high gradient low emittance gun is
under development. Reliable operation with an electric field, preferably above
125 MV/m at a 4 mm gap, in the presence of an UV laser beam, has to be achieved
in a diode configuration in order to minimize the emittance dilution due to
space charge effects. In the first phase, a DC breakdown test stand was used to
test different metals with different preparation methods at voltages up to 100
kV. In addition high gradient stability tests were also carried out over
several days in order to prove reliable spark-free operation with a minimum
dark current. In the second phase, electrodes with selected materials were
installed in the 250 ns FWHM, 500 kV electron gun and tested for high gradient
breakdown and for quantum efficiency using an ultra-violet laser.
