Given a harmonic measure of a hyperbolic lamination on a compact metric
space, a positive harmonic function is defined on the universal cover of a
typical leaves. We discuss some properties of this function. Especially if all
the leaves are hyperbolic, ergodic harmonic measures are divided into two
classes.
