We report the detection of an extended X-ray nebulosity with an elongation
from northeast to southwest in excess of 15$^{\prime\prime}$ in a radial
profile and imaging of the recurrent nova T Pyx using the archival data
obtained with the X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM), European Photon Imaging
Camera (pn instrument). The signal to noise ratio (S/N) in the extended
emission (above the point source and the background) is 5.2 over the 0.3-9.0
keV energy range and 4.9 over the 0.3-1.5 keV energy range. We calculate an
absorbed X-ray flux of 2.3$\times10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ with a
luminosity of 6.0$\times10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ from the remnant nova in the
0.3-10.0 keV band. The source spectrum is not physically consistent with a
blackbody emission model as a single model or a part of a two-component model
fitted to the XMM-Newton data ({$kT{\rm_{BB}}$} $>$ 1 keV). The spectrum is
best described by two MEKAL plasma emission models with temperatures at
0.2$^{+0.7}_{-0.1}$ keV and 1.3$^{+1.0}_{-0.4}$ keV. The neutral hydrogen
column density derived from the fits is significantly more in the hotter X-ray
component than the cooler one which we may be attributed to the elemental
enhancement of nitrogen and oxygen in the cold material within the remnant. The
shock speed calculated from the softer X-ray component of the spectrum is
300-800 km s$^{-1}$ and is consistent with the expansion speeds of the nova
remnant derived from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and ground-based optical
wavelength data. Our results suggest that the detected X-ray emission may be
dominated by shock-heated gas from the nova remnant.
