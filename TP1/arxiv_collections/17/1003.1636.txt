This paper presents interferometric and single-dish CO observations along
with HI data obtained for the oxygen-rich semi-regular variable RS Cnc, in
order to probe its circumstellar environment at different scales. With the
Plateau de Bure Interferometer and the IRAM 30-m telescope, we detect both the
CO(1-0) and the CO(2-1) rotational lines from RS Cnc. The line profiles are
composite, with two components of half-width ~2 km/s and ~8 km/s respectively.
Whereas the narrow velocity component seems to originate from an equatorial
disk in the central part of the CO envelope, the broad component reveals a
bipolar structure, with a north-south velocity gradient. In addition, we obtain
new HI data on the source and around it in a field of almost 1 square degree.
The HI line is centered at v_LSR = 7 km/s in agreement with CO observations. A
new reduction process reveals a complex extended structure in the northwest
direction, of estimated size ~18 arcmin, with a PA (~310 degrees) opposite to
the direction of the stellar proper motion (~140 degrees). We derive an HI mass
of ~3 10^-2 M_sun for this structure. Based on a non-spherical simulation, we
find that this structure is consistent with arising from the interaction of the
star undergoing mass loss at an average rate of ~10^-7 M_sun.yr^-1 over ~2-3
10^5 years with the interstellar medium. This work illustrates the powerful
complementarity of CO and HI observations with regard to a more complete
description of circumstellar environments around AGB stars.
