In this dissertation the notion of deformation quantization of principal
fibre bundles is established and investigated in order to find a geometric
formulation of classical gauge theories on noncommutative space-times. As a
generalization, the notion of deformation quantization of surjective
submersions is also discussed.
  It is shown that deformation quantizations of surjective submersions and
principal fibre bundles always exist and are unique up to equivalence. These
statements concerning complex-valued functions are moreover formulated and
proved for sections of arbitrary vector bundles over the total space, in
particular equivariant vector bundles. The commutants of the deformed right
module structures within the differential operators, playing an inportant role
with regard to the infinitesimal gauge transformations, are computed explicitly
in each case. Depending on the choice of specific covariant derivatives and
connections the commutants are isomorphic to the formal power series of the
respective vertical differential operators which thus inherit a deformation of
the algebra structure. The resulting deformed bimodules are again unique up to
equivalence. With respect to further applications it is finally shown that
every deformation quantization of a principal fibre bundle induces a
deformation quantization of any associated vector bundle.
