It is shown that a temperature window between the Curie temperatures of
martensite and austenite phases around the room temperature can be obtained by
a vacancy-tuning strategy in Mn-poor Mn1-xCoGe alloys (0 <= x <= 0.050). Based
on this, a martensitic transformation from paramagnetic austenite to
ferromagnetic martensite with a large magnetization difference can be realized
in this window. This gives rise to a magnetic-field-induced martensitic
transformation and a large magnetocaloric effect in the Mn1-xCoGe system. The
decrease of the transformation temperature and of the thermal hysteresis of the
transformation, as well as the stable Curie temperatures of martensite and
austenite, are discussed on the basis of the Mn-poor Co-vacancy structure and
the corresponding valence-electron concentration.
