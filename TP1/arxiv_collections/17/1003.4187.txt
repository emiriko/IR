After two decades of repository development, some conclusions may be drawn as
to which type of repository and what kind of service best supports digital
scholarly communication, and thus the production of new knowledge. Four types
of publication repository may be distinguished, namely the subject-based
repository, research repository, national repository system and institutional
repository. Two important shifts in the role of repositories may be noted. With
regard to content, a well-defined and high quality corpus is essential. This
implies that repository services are likely to be most successful when
constructed with the user and reader uppermost in mind. With regard to service,
high value to specific scholarly communities is essential. This implies that
repositories are likely to be most useful to scholars when they offer dedicated
services supporting the production of new knowledge. Along these lines,
challenges and barriers to repository development may be identified in three
key dimensions: a) identification and deposit of content; b) access and use of
services; and c) preservation of content and sustainability of service. An
indicative comparison of challenges and barriers in some major world regions
such as Europe, North America and East Asia plus Australia is offered in
conclusion.
