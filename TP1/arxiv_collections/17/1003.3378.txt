The interplay between the coupling of an interacting quantum dot to a
conduction band and its connection to localized levels has been studied in a
triple quantum dot arrangement. The electronic Dicke effect, resulting from
quasi-resonant states of two side-coupled non-interacting quantum dots, is
found to produce important effects on the Kondo resonance of the interacting
dot. We study in detail the Kondo regime of the system by applying a numerical
renormalization group analysis to a finite-U multi-impurity Anderson
Hamiltonian model. We find an extreme narrowing of the Kondo resonance, as the
single-particle levels of the side dots are tuned towards the Fermi level and
"squeeze" the Kondo resonance, accompanied by a strong drop in the Kondo
temperature, due to the presence of a supertunneling state. Further, we show
that the Kondo temperature vanishes in the limit of the Dicke effect of the
structure. By analyzing the magnetic moment and entropy of the three-dot
cluster versus temperature, we identify a different local singlet that competes
with the Kondo state, resulting in the eventual suppression of the Kondo
temperature and strongly affecting the spin correlations of the structure. We
further show that system asymmetries in couplings, level structure or due to
Coulomb interactions, result in interesting changes in the spectral function
near the Fermi level. These strongly affect the Kondo temperature and the
linear conductance of the system.
