We propose a method to transfer the population and control the state of
two-level and three-level atoms speeding-up Adiabatic Passage techniques while
keeping their robustness versus parameter variations. The method is based on
supplementing the standard laser beam setup of Adiabatic Passage methods with
auxiliary steering laser pulses of orthogonal polarization. This provides a
shortcut to adiabaticity driving the system along the adiabatic path defined by
the standard setup.
