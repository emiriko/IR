Uniform large deviation principles for positive functionals of all equivalent
types of infinite dimensional Brownian motions acting together with a Poisson
random measure are established. The core of our approach is a variational
representation formula which for an infinite sequence of i.i.d real Brownian
motions and a Poisson random measure was shown in [5].
