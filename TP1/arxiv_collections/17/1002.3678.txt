This review summarizes the present status of an ongoing experimental effort
to provide reliable rate coefficients for dielectronic recombination of highly
charged iron ions for the modeling of astrophysical and other plasmas. The
experimental work has been carried out over more than a decade at the heavy-ion
storage-ring TSR of the Max-Planck-Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg,
Germany. The experimental and data reduction procedures are outlined. The role
of previously disregarded processes such as fine-structure core excitations and
trielectronic recombination is highlighted. Plasma rate coefficients for
dielectronic recombination of Fe^q+ ions (q=7-10, 13-22) and Ni^25+ are
presented graphically and in a simple parameterized form allowing for easy use
in plasma modeling codes. It is concluded that storage-ring experiments are
presently the only source for reliable low-temperature dielectronic
recombination rate-coefficients of complex ions.
