Recent studies have thrown up a big enigma. On the one hand they point to
satellite galaxies rotating faster than they should with the usual theory. On
the other hand they also go against explanation of Newtonian gravity with dark
matter. In this brief note it is argued that the varying $G$ cosmology which
explains all the observed General Relativistic effects and the Pioneer anomaly
reconciles the controversial conclusions of the latest observations.
