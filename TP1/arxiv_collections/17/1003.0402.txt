In this paper we determine the velocity, the energy and estimate writhe and
twist helicity contributions of vortex filaments in the shape of torus knots
and unknots (toroidal and poloidal coils) in a perfect fluid. Calculations are
performed by numerical integration of the Biot-Savart law. Vortex complexity is
parametrized by the winding number $w$, given by the ratio of the number of
meridian wraps to that of the longitudinal wraps. We find that for $w<1$ vortex
knots and toroidal coils move faster and carry more energy than a reference
vortex ring of same size and circulation, whereas for $w>1$ knots and poloidal
coils have approximately same speed and energy of the reference vortex ring.
Helicity is dominated by the writhe contribution. Finally, we confirm the
stabilizing effect of the Biot-Savart law for all knots and unknots tested,
that are found to be structurally stable over a distance of several diameters.
Our results also apply to quantized vortices in superfluid $^4$He.
