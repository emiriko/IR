We emphasize that the stabilizing symmetry for dark matter (DM) particles
does not have to be the commonly used parity (Z_2) symmetry. We therefore
examine the potential of the colliders to distinguish models with parity
stabilized DM from models in which the DM is stabilized by other symmetries. We
often take the latter to be a Z_3 symmetry for illustration. We focus on
signatures where a single particle, charged under the DM stabilization symmetry
decays into the DM and Standard Model (SM) particles. Such a Z_3-charged
"mother" particle can decay into one or two DM particles along with the same SM
particles. This can be contrasted with the decay of a Z_2-charged mother
particle, where only one DM particle appears. Thus, if the intermediate
particles in these decay chains are off-shell, then the reconstructed invariant
mass of the SM particles exhibits two kinematic edges for the Z_3 case but only
one for the Z_2 case. For the case of on-shell intermediate particles,
distinguishing the two symmetries requires more than the kinematic edges. In
this case, we note that certain decay chain "topologies" of the mother particle
which are present for the Z_3 case (but absent for the Z_2 case) generate a
"cusp" in the invariant mass distribution of the SM particles. We demonstrate
that this cusp is generally invariant of the various spin configurations. We
further apply these techniques within the context of explicit models.
