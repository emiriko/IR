The Hubbard model is used to study an electronic system. In this paper we
present the new path integral representation for Hubbard model. We have
constructed the new supercoherent state which appears from a set of
eigenfunctions of atomic limit of strongly correlated systems. Exact
calculation of nonlinear representation of a supergroup has been carried. This
group defines the transformation of atomic base. The general formalism we
elaborate for Hubbard model is the one widely used in the gauge field theory of
the nonlinear representation of a superconformal group.
