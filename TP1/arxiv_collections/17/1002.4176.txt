Identical interactions found in the three families of quarks and leptons
suggest the presence of a horizontal symmetry. We discuss how such a symmetry
can be tested by measuring the decay rates of Higgs into fermion pairs, and the
Higgs production cross section. Depending on the details, there is a chance
that the decay widths to the bottom-pair and the tau-pair may be down by more
than a factor of 3 or more compared to the usual values, and the fusion
production cross section of the Higgs also altered. Whatever the outcome, such
a test also serves to constraint horizontal symmetry models.
