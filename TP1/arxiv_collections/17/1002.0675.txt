We prove Chung-type laws of the iterated logarithm for general L\'{e}vy
processes at zero. In particular, we provide tools to translate small deviation
estimates directly into laws of the iterated logarithm. This reveals laws of
the iterated logarithm for L\'{e}vy processes at small times in many concrete
examples. In some cases, exotic norming functions are derived.
