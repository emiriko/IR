The complexity of multimedia applications in terms of intensity of
computation and heterogeneity of treated data led the designers to embark them
on multiprocessor systems on chip. The complexity of these systems on one hand
and the expectations of the consumers on the other hand complicate the
designers job to conceive and supply strong and successful systems in the
shortest deadlines. They have to explore the different solutions of the design
space and estimate their performances in order to deduce the solution that
respects their design constraints. In this context, we propose the modeling of
one of the design space possible solutions: the software to hardware task
migration. This modeling exploits the synchronous dataflow graphs to take into
account the different migration impacts and estimate their performances in
terms of throughput.
