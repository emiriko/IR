Under Space Tower the author understands structures having height from 100 km
to the geosynchronous orbit and supported by surface of Earths. The classical
Space Elevator is not included in space towers. That has three main identifiers
which distingue from Space Tower: Space Elevator has part over Geosynchronous
Orbit (GSO) and all installation supported only the centrifugal force of Earth,
immobile cable connected to surface of Earth, no pressure on the surface. A lot
of new concepts, ideas and innovation in space towers were offered, developed
and researched in last years especially after 2000. For example: optimal solid
space towers, inflatable space towers (include optimal space tower), circle and
centrifugal space towers, kinetic space towers, electrostatic space towers,
electromagnetic space towers, and so on. Given review shortly summarizes there
researches and gives a brief description them, note some their main advantages,
shortcomings, defects and limitations.
