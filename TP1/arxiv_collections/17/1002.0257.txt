The quantum theory of the cold atom scattering by cavity fields in a
two-dimensional geometry is presented. A distinct regime from the usual
Raman-Nath, Bragg and Stern-Gerlach regimes is investigated, considering the
situation where the cavity light field acts as a repulsive and an attractive
two-dimensional potential. General expressions for the scattering lengths (the
two-dimensional analogues to the three-dimensional scattering cross-sections)
of finding the atoms deexcited or not after their interaction with the cavity
are derived. The connection with the classical Rabi limit when the incident
atomic kinetic energy is high compared with the atom-field interaction energy
is made. In the cold atom regime characterized by much lower incident atomic
kinetic energies, the scattering process exhibits very peculiar properties in
connection with quasibound states of the atomic motion induced by the
attractive potential of the cavity light field.
