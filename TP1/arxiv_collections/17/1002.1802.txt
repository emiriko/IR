In addition to the well known common properties such as small world and
community structures, recent empirical investigations suggest a universal
scaling law for the spatial structure of social networks. It is found that the
probability density distribution of an individual to have a friend at distance
$r$ scales as $P(r)\propto r^{-1}$. The basic principle that yields this
spatial scaling property is not yet understood. Here we propose a fundamental
origin for this law based on the concept of entropy. We show that this spatial
scaling law can result from maximization of information entropy, which means
individuals seek to maximize the diversity of their friendships. Such spatial
distribution can benefit individuals significantly in optimally collecting
information in a social network.
