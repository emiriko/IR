Lattice QCD calculations of hadron structure are a valuable complement to
many experimental programs as well as an indispensable tool to understand the
dynamics of QCD. I present a focused review of a few representative topics
chosen to illustrate both the challenges and advances of our community: the
momentum fraction, axial charge and charge radius of the nucleon. I will
discuss the current status of these calculations and speculate on the prospects
for accurate calculations of hadron structure from lattice QCD.
