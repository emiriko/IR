The parametrization of adiabatic paths is optimal when tunneling is
minimized. Hamiltonian evolutions do not have unique optimizers. However,
dephasing Lindblad evolutions do. The optimizers are simply characterized by an
Euler-Lagrange equation and have a constant tunneling rate along the path
irrespective of the gap. Application to quantum search algorithms recovers the
Grover result for appropriate scaling of the dephasing. Dephasing rates that
beat Grover imply hidden resources in Lindblad operators.
