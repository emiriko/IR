The time evolution of a system where a uniform and classical SU(3) color
electric field and quantum fields of quarks are dynamically coupled with each
other is studied focusing on non-perturbative pair creation and its back
reaction. We characterize the color direction of the electric field in a gauge
invariant way, and investigate its dependence. Momentum distributions of
created quarks show plasma oscillation as well as quantum effects such as the
Pauli blocking and interference. Pressure of the system is also calculated, and
we show that pair creation moderates degree of anisotropy of pressure.
Furthermore, enhancement of pair creation and induction of chiral charge under
a color magnetic field which is parallel to the electric field are discussed.
