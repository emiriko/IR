The ac nonlinear dielectric response $\chi_3(\omega,T)$ of glycerol was
measured close to its glass transition temperature $T_g$ to investigate the
prediction that supercooled liquids respond in an increasingly non-linear way
as the dynamics slows down (as spin-glasses do). We find that
$\chi_3(\omega,T)$ indeed displays several non trivial features. It is peaked
as a function of the frequency $\omega$ and obeys scaling as a function of
$\omega \tau(T)$, with $\tau(T)$ the relaxation time of the liquid. The height
of the peak, proportional to the number of dynamically correlated molecules
$N_{corr}(T)$, increases as the system becomes glassy, and $\chi_3$ decays as a
power-law of $\omega$ over several decades beyond the peak. These findings
confirm the collective nature of the glassy dynamics and provide the first
direct estimate of the $T$ dependence of $N_{corr}$.
