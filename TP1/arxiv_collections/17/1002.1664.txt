We present a proof of a Littlewood-Richardson rule for the K-theory of odd
orthogonal Grassmannians OG(n,2n+1), as conjectured in [Thomas-Yong '09].
Specifically, we prove that rectification using the jeu de taquin for
increasing shifted tableaux introduced there, is well-defined and gives rise to
an associative product. Recently, [Buch-Ravikumar '09] proved a Pieri rule for
OG(n,2n+1) that [Feigenbaum-Sergel '09] showed confirms a special case of the
conjecture. Together, these results imply the aforementioned conjecture.
