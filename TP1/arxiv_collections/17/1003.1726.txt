We examine the effective counterion-mediated electrostatic interaction
between two like-charged dielectric cylinders immersed in a continuous
dielectric medium containing neutralizing mobile counterions. We focus on the
effects of image charges induced as a result of the dielectric mismatch between
the cylindrical cores and the surrounding dielectric medium and investigate the
counterion-mediated electrostatic interaction between the cylinders in both
limits of weak and strong electrostatic couplings (corresponding, e.g., to
systems with monovalent and multivalent counterions, respectively). The results
are compared with extensive Monte-Carlo simulations exhibiting good agreement
with the limiting weak and strong coupling results in their respective regime
of validity.
