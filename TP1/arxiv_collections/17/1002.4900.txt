In the absence of an astrophysical standard candle, IceCube can study the
deficit of cosmic rays from the direction of the Moon. The observation of this
"Moon shadow" in the downgoing muon flux is an experimental verification of the
absolute pointing accuracy and the angular resolution of the detector with
respect to energetic muons passing through. The Moon shadow has been observed
in the 40-string configuration of IceCube. This is the first stage of IceCube
in which a Moon shadow analysis has been successful. Method, results, and some
systematic error studies will be discussed.
