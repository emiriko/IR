Non-perturbative renormalization factors of bilinear quark operators are
computed for the Chirally Improved lattice action with two dynamic quarks. The
analysis is based on five different parameter sets with lattice size 12^3 x 24
and four parameter sets with lattice size 16^3 x 32. For the pseudoscalar
renormalization factor the pion pole contribution is subtracted and chiral
extrapolations are performed. Results are given in RIprime- and MSbar-scheme as
well as in RGI-form.
