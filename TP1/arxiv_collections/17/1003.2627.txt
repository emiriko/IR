Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC 3-8 micron and AKARI IRC 2-4 micron photometry
are reported for ten white dwarfs with photospheric heavy elements; nine
relatively cool stars with photospheric calcium, and one hotter star with a
peculiar high carbon abundance. A substantial infrared excess is detected at HE
2221-1630, while modest excess emissions are identified at HE 0106-3253 and HE
0307+0746, implying these latter two stars have relatively narrow (Delta r <
0.1 Rsol) rings of circumstellar dust. A likely 7.9 micron excess is found at
PG 1225-079 and may represent, together with G166-58, a sub-class of dust ring
with a large inner hole. The existence of attenuated disks at white dwarfs
substantiates the connection between their photospheric heavy elements and the
accretion of disrupted minor planets, indicating many polluted white dwarfs may
harbor orbiting dust, even those lacking an obvious infrared excess.
