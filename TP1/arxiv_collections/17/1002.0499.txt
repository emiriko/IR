We present a method of optimizing recently designed protocols for
implementing an arbitrary nonlocal unitary gate acting on a bipartite system.
These protocols use only local operations and classical communication with the
assistance of entanglement, and are deterministic while also being "one-shot",
in that they use only one copy of an entangled resource state. The optimization
is in the sense of minimizing the amount of entanglement used, and it is often
the case that less entanglement is needed than with an alternative protocol
using two-way teleportation.
