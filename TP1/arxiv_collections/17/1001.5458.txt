Electronic structure and lattice dynamics calculations on thallium halides
show that the Born effective charges in these compounds are more than twice
larger than the nominal ionic charges. This is a result of cross-band-gap
hybridization between Tl-p and halogen-p states. The large Born charges cause
giant splitting between longitudinal and transverse optic phonon modes,
bringing the lattice close to ferroelectric instability. Our calculations
indeed show spontaneous lattice polarization upon lattice expansion starting at
2%. It is remarkable that the apparently ionic thallium halides with a simple
cubic CsCl structure and large differences in electronegativity between cations
and anions can be very close to ferroelectricity. This can lead to effective
screening of defects and impurities that would otherwise be strong carrier
traps and may therefore contribute to the relatively good carrier transport
properties in TlBr radiation detectors.
