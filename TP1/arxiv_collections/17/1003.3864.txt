Lowest order and higher order QED calculations have been carried out for the
RHIC high mass e+ e- pairs observed by PHENIX with single ZDC triggers. The
lowest order QED results for the experimental acceptance are about two standard
deviations larger than the PHENIX data. Corresponding higher order QED
calculations are within one standard deviation of the data.
