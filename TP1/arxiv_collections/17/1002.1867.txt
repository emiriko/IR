Molecular motors drive mechanical motions utilizing the free energy liberated
from chemical reactions such as ATP hydrolysis. Although it is essential to
know the efficiency of this free energy transduction, it has been a challenge
due to the system's microscopic scale. Here, we evaluate the single-molecule
energetics of a rotary molecular motor, F1-ATPase, by applying a recently
derived nonequilibrium equality together with an electrorotation method. We
show that the sum of the heat flow through the probe's rotational degree of
freedom and the work against external load is almost equal to the free energy
change per a single ATP hydrolysis under various conditions. This implies that
F1-ATPase works at an efficiency of nearly 100% in a thermally fluctuating
environment.
