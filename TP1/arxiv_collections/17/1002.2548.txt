The properties of single submicron high-temperature superconductor (HTS)
rings are investigated. The Little-Parks effect is observed and is accompanied
by an anomalous behavior of the magnetic dependence of the resistance, which we
ascribe to non-uniform vorticity (superfluid angular momentum) within the ring
arms. This effect is linked to the peculiar HTS-relationship between the values
of the coherence length and the London penetration depth.
