It is shown that the periodic alteration of night and day provides a chaotic
dissipation mechanism for the North Atlantic (NAO) and Southern (SOI) climate
oscillations. The wavelet regression detrended daily NAO index for last 60
years and daily SOI for last 20 years as well as an analytical continuation in
the complex time domain were used for this purpose.
