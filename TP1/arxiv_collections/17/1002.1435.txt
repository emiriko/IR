We establish a connection between the agegraphic models of dark energy and
Chaplygin gas energy density in non-flat universe. We reconstruct the potential
of the agegraphic scalar field as well as the dynamics of the scalar field
according to the evolution of the agegraphic dark energy. We also extend our
study to the interacting agegraphic generalized Chaplygin gas dark energy
model.
