We propose a novel approach based on a Langevin equation for fluctuating
motion of the center of mass of granular media fluidized by energy injection
from a bottom plate. In this framework, the analytical solution of the Langevin
equation is used to derive analytic expressions for several macroscopic
quantities and the power spectrum for the center of mass. In order to test our
theory, we performed event-driven molecular dynamics simulations for one- and
two-dimensional systems. Energy is injected from a vibrating bottom plate in
the one-dimensional case and from a thermal wall at the bottom in the
two-dimensional case. We found that the theoretical predictions are in good
agreement with the results of those simulations under the assumption that the
fluctuation-dissipation relation holds in the case of nearly elastic collisions
between particles. However, as the inelasticity of the interparticle collisions
increases, the power spectrum for the center of mass obtained by the
simulations gradually deviates from the prediction of theoretical curve.
Connection between this deviation and violation of the fluctuation-dissipation
relation is discussed.
