We present an analysis of ~60 000 massive (stellar mass M_star > 10^{11}
M_sun) galaxies out to z = 1 drawn from 55.2 deg2 of the United Kingdom
Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) and the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) II Supernova Survey. This is by far the largest
survey of massive galaxies with robust mass estimates, based on infrared
(K-band) photometry, reaching to the Universe at about half its present age. We
find that the most massive (M_star > 10^{11.5} M_sun) galaxies have experienced
rapid growth in number since z = 1, while the number densities of the less
massive systems show rather mild evolution. Such a hierarchical trend of
evolution is consistent with the predictions of the current semi-analytic
galaxy formation model based on Lambda CDM theory. While the majority of
massive galaxies are red-sequence populations, we find that a considerable
fraction of galaxies are blue star-forming galaxies. The blue fraction is
smaller in more massive systems and decreases toward the local Universe,
leaving the red, most massive galaxies at low redshifts, which would support
the idea of active 'bottom-up' formation of these populations during 0 < z < 1.
