The dynamics of transfer reactions in collisions of two very heavy nuclei
$^{238}$U+$^{238}$U is studied within the dinuclear system (DNS) model.
Collisions of two actinide nuclei form a super heavy composite system during a
very short time, in which a large number of charge and mass transfers may take
place. Such reactions have been investigated experimentally as an alternative
way for the production of heavy and superheavy nuclei. The role of collision
orientation in the production cross sections of heavy nuclides is analyzed
systematically. Calculations show that the cross sections decrease drastically
with increasing the charged numbers of heavy fragments. The transfer mechanism
is favorable to synthesize heavy neutron-rich isotopes, such as nuclei around
the subclosure at N=162 from No (Z=102) to Db (Z=105).
