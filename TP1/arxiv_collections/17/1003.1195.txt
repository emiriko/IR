Assuming that in Au+Au collisions, a baryon free fluid is produced,
transverse momentum spectra of identified particles ($\pi$, $K$, $p$ and
$\phi$), in evolution of ideal and viscous fluid is studied. Hydrodynamic
evolution is governed by a lattice based equation of state (EOS), where the
confinement-deconfinement transition is a cross-over at $T_{co}$=196 MeV. Ideal
or viscous fluid was initialised to reproduce $\phi$ meson multiplicity in 0-5%
Au+Au collisions. Ideal or minimally viscous ($\eta/s$=0.08) fluid evolution
reasonably well explain the transverse momentum spectra of pion's, kaon's, and
$\phi$ meson's in central and mid-central Au+Au collisions. Description to the
data is much poorer in viscous fluid evolution with $\eta/s \geq$0.12. The
model however under estimate proton production by a factor $\sim$ 2.
