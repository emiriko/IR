In nonuniform Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF) superconductors, both
the gauge symmetry and the continuous translational symmetry of the normal
state are spontaneously broken. This leads to additional bosonic excitations,
or Goldstone modes, corresponding to the deformations of the order parameter
amplitude modulation in real space. We derive general expressions for the
energy of the phase and elastic Goldstone modes. As an example, the superfluid
density and the elastic modulus of a one-dimensional LOFF superconductor are
calculated at low temperatures.
