We investigate how the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo energy of solids
depends on single-particle orbitals used in Slater--Jastrow wave functions. We
demonstrate that the dependence can be significant, in particular in the case
of 3d transition-metal compounds, which we adopt as examples. We illustrate how
exchange-correlation functionals with variable exact-exchange component can be
exploited to reduce the fixed-node errors. On the basis of these results we
argue that the fixed-node quantum Monte Carlo provides a variational approach
for optimization of effective hamiltonians with parameters.
