I briefly describe a simple routine for emission-line profiles fitting by
Gaussian curves or Gauss-Hermite series. The PROFIT (line-PROfile FITting)
routine represent a new alternative for use in fits data cubes, as those from
Integral Field Spectroscopy or Fabry-Perot Interferometry, and may be useful to
better study the emission-line flux distributions and gas kinematics in
distinct astrophysical objects, such as the central regions of galaxies and
star forming regions. The PROFIT routine is written in IDL language and is
available at http://www.ufsm.br/rogemar/software.html.
  The PROFIT routine was used to fit the [Fe II]1.257um emission-line profiles
for about 1800 spectra of the inner 350 pc of the Seyfert galaxy Mrk1066
obtained with Gemini NIFS and shows that the line profiles are better
reproduced by Gauss-Hermite series than by the commonly used Gaussian curves.
The two-dimensional map of the h_3 Gauss-Hermite moment shows its highest
absolute values in regions close to the edge of the radio structure. These high
values may be originated in an biconical outflowing gas associated with the
radio jet - previously observed in the optical [O III] emission. The analysis
of this kinematic component indicates that the radio jet leaves the center of
the galaxy with the north-west side slightly oriented towards us and the
south-east side away from us, being partially hidden by the disc of the galaxy.
