Low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) reveals a new mode of graphene growth
on Ru(0001) in which Ru atoms are etched from a step edge and injected under a
growing graphene sheet. Based on density functional calculations, we propose a
model wherein injected Ru atoms form metastable islands under the graphene.
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) reveals that dislocation networks exist
near step edges, consistent with some of the injected atoms being incorporated
into the topmost Ru layer, thereby increasing its density.
