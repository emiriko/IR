The 2D lattice gas model with competing short and long range interactions is
appliedused for calculation of the incoherent charge transport in the classical
strongly-correlated charge segregated polaronic state. We show, by means of
Monte-Carlo simulations, that at high temperature the transport is dominated by
hopping of the dissociated correlated polarons, where with thetheir mobility is
inversely proportional to the temperature. At the temperatures below the
clustering transition temperature the bipolaron transport becomes dominant. The
energy barrier for the bipolaron hopping is determined by the Coulomb effects
and is found to be lower than the barrier for the single-polaron hopping. This
leads to drastically different temperature dependencies of mobilities for
polarons and bipolarons at low temperatures.
