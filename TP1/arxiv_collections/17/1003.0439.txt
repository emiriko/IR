QCD with 2 flavours of massless colour-sextet quarks is studied as a theory
which might exhibit a range of scales over which the running coupling constant
evolves very slowly (walks). We simulate lattice QCD with 2 flavours of sextet
staggered quarks to determine whether walks, or if it has an infrared fixed
point, making it a conformal field theory. Our initial simulations are
performed at finite temperatures $T=1/N_ta$ ($N_t=4$ and $N_t=6$), which allows
us to identify the scales of confinement and chiral-symmetry breaking from the
deconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoring transitions. Unlike QCD with
fundamental quarks, these two transitions appear to be well-separated. The
change in coupling constants at these transitions between the two different
temporal extents $N_t$, is consistent with these being finite temperature
transitions for an asymptotically free theory, which favours walking behaviour.
In the deconfined phase, the Wilson Line shows a 3-state signal. Between the
confinement and chiral transitions, there is an additional transition where the
states with Wilson Lines oriented in the directions of the complex cube roots
of unity disorder into a state with a negative Wilson Line.
