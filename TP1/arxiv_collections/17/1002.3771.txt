We investigate ground and excited state transport through small (d = 70 nm)
graphene quantum dots. The successive spin filling of orbital states is
detected by measuring the ground state energy as a function of a magnetic
field. For a magnetic field in-plane of the quantum dot the Zemann splitting of
spin states is measured. The results are compatible with a g-factor of 2 and we
detect a spin-filling sequence for a series of states which is reasonable given
the strength of exchange interaction effects expected for graphene.
