The purpose of this paper is to investigate the Cahn-Hillard approximation
for entire minimal hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic space. Combining comparison
principles with minimization and blow-up arguments, we prove existence results
for entire local minimizers with prescribed behaviour at infinity. Then, we
study the limit as the length scale tends to zero through a
$\Gamma$-convergence analysis, obtaining existence of entire minimal
hypersurfaces with prescribed boundary at infinity. In particular, we recover
some existence results proved in M. Anderson and U. Lang using geometric
measure theory.
