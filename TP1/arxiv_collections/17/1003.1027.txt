Solutions of the Friedmann-Lemaitre cosmological equations of general
relativity have been found with finite-time singularities that are everywhere
regular, have regular Hubble expansion rate, and obey the strong-energy
conditions but possess pressure and acceleration singularities at finite time
that are not associated with geodesic incompleteness. We show how these
solutions with sudden singularities can be constructed using fractional series
methods and find the limiting form of the equation of state on approach to the
singularity.
