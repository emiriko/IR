A new two-parametric family of mass distribution for spherical stellar
systems is considered. It generalizes families by Kuzmin, Veltmann (1972) and
by An, Evans (2006). Steady velocity dispersions are found for these models by
solving an equation of hydrostatic equilibrium. Axisymmetric generalizations of
the model are discussed.
