Today, the human brain can be studied as a whole. Electroencephalography,
magnetoencephalography, or functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques
provide functional connectivity patterns between different brain areas, and
during different pathological and cognitive neuro-dynamical states. In this
Tutorial we review novel complex networks approaches to unveil how brain
networks can efficiently manage local processing and global integration for the
transfer of information, while being at the same time capable of adapting to
satisfy changing neural demands.
