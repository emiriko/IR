We present a study of transport in graphene devices on polar insulating
substrates by solving the Bolzmann transport equation in the presence of
graphene phonon, surface polar phonon, and Coulomb charged impurity scattering.
The value of the saturated velocity shows very weak dependence on the carrier
density, the nature of the insulating substrate, and the low-field mobility,
varied by the charged impurity concentration. The saturated velocity of 4 - 8 x
10^7 cm/s calculated at room temperature is significantly larger than reported
experimental values. The discrepancy is due to the self-heating effect which
lowers substantially the value of the saturated velocity. We predict that by
reducing the insulator oxide thickness, which limits the thermal conductance,
the saturated currents can be significantly enhanced. We also calculate the
surface polar phonon contribution to the low-field mobility as a function of
carrier density, temperature, and distance from the substrate.
