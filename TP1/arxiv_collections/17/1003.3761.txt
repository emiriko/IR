The quantum decision theory introduced recently is formulated as a quantum
theory of measurement. It describes prospect states represented by complex
vectors of a Hilbert space over a prospect lattice. The prospect operators,
acting in this space, form an involutive bijective algebra. A measure is
defined for quantifying the entanglement produced by the action of prospect
operators. This measure characterizes the level of complexity of prospects
involved in decision making. An explicit expression is found for the maximal
entanglement produced by the operators of multimode prospects.
