In two recent papers (arXiv:1002.1971 [hep-ph] and arXiv:0911.2460 [hep-ph])
Dermisek and Gunion provide new constraints on a light CP-odd Higgs boson in
the framework of the NMSSM (or similar models) based on experimental data from
LEP, CLEO, BaBar and CDF experiments. In this brief comment we argue that
special care is still needed inside a narrow mass window where mixing with
$\eta_b$ resonances below $B\bar{B}$ can occur. We also stress that observables
testing lepton universality and a possible distorsion of the bottomonium mass
spectrum can provide an alternative analysis at (Super) B-factories in the
search of such an elusive light pseudoscalar Higgs-like object.
