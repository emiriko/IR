A one-electron qubit would offer a new option for quantum information
science, including the possibility of extremely long coherence times.
One-quantum cyclotron transitions and spin flips have been observed for a
single electron in a cylindrical Penning trap. However, an electron suspended
in a planar Penning trap is a more promising building block for the array of
coupled qubits needed for quantum information studies. The optimized design
configurations identified here promise to make it possible to realize the
elusive goal of one trapped electron in a planar Penning trap for the first
time - a substantial step toward a one-electron qubit.
