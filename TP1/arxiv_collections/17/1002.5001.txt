The inclusion of source terms in discrete gravity is a long-standing problem.
Providing a consistent coupling of source to the lattice in Regge Calculus (RC)
yields a robust unstructured spacetime mesh applicable to both numerical
relativity and quantum gravity. RC provides a particularly insightful approach
to this problem with its purely geometric representation of spacetime. The
simplicial building blocks of RC enable us to represent all matter and fields
in a coordinate-free manner. We provide an interpretation of RC as a discrete
exterior calculus framework into which non-gravitational fields naturally
couple with the simplicial lattice. Using this approach we obtain a consistent
mapping of the continuum action for non-gravitational fields to the Regge
lattice. In this paper we apply this framework to scalar, vector and tensor
fields. In particular we reconstruct the lattice action for (1) the scalar
field, (2) Maxwell field tensor and (3) Dirac particles. The straightforward
application of our discretization techniques to these three fields demonstrates
a universal implementation of coupling source to the lattice in Regge calculus.
