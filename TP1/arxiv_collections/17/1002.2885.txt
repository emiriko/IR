We summarize recent observations and modeling of the brightest Sgr A* flare
to be observed simultaneously in (near)-infrared and X-rays to date. Trying to
explain the spectral characteristics of this flare through inverse Compton
mechanisms implies physical parameters that are unrealistic for Sgr A*.
Instead, a "cooling break" synchrotron model provides a more feasible
explanation for the X-ray emission. In a magnetic field of about 5-30 Gauss the
X-ray emitting electrons cool very quickly on the typical dynamical timescale
while the NIR-emitting electrons cool more slowly. This produces a spectral
break in the model between NIR and X-ray wavelengths that can explain the
differences in the observed spectral indices.
