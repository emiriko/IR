We describe initial results by the Lattice Strong Dynamics (LSD)
collaboration of a study into the variation of chiral properties of chiral
properties of SU(3) Yang-Mills gauge theory as the number of massless flavors
changes from $N_f = 2$ to $N_f = 6$, with a focus on the use of chiral
perturbation theory.
