Effects of strongly anisotropic turbulent mixing on the critical behavior are
studied by means of the renormalization group. Two models are considered: the
equilibrium model A, which describes purely relaxational dynamics of a
nonconserved scalar order parameter, and the Gribov model, which describes the
nonequilibrium phase transition between the absorbing and fluctuating states in
a reaction-diffusion system. The velocity is modelled by the d-dimensional
generalization of the random shear flow introduced by Avellaneda and Majda
within the context of passive scalar advection. Existence of new nonequilibrium
types of critical regimes (universality classes) is established.
