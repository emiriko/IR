We introduce middle convolution for systems of linear differential equations
with irregular singular points, and we presend a tentative definition of the
index of rigidity for them. Under some assumption, we show a list of terminal
patterns of irreducible systems of linear differential equations by iterated
application of middle convolution when the index is positive or zero.
