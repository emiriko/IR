Consider 1D Vlasov-poisson system with a fixed ion background and periodic
condition on the space variable. First, we show that for general homogeneous
equilibria, within any small neighborhood in the Sobolev space W^{s,p}
(p>1,s<1+(1/p)) of the steady distribution function, there exist nontrivial
travelling wave solutions (BGK waves) with arbitrary minimal period and
traveling speed. This implies that nonlinear Landau damping is not true in
W^{s,p}(s<1+(1/p)) space for any homogeneous equilibria and any spatial period.
Indeed, in W^{s,p} (s<1+(1/p)) neighborhood of any homogeneous state, the long
time dynamics is very rich, including travelling BGK waves, unstable
homogeneous states and their possible invariant manifolds. Second, it is shown
that for homogeneous equilibria satisfying Penrose's linear stability
condition, there exist no nontrivial travelling BGK waves and unstable
homogeneous states in some W^{s,p} (p>1,s>1+(1/p)) neighborhood. Furthermore,
when p=2,we prove that there exist no nontrivial invariant structures in the
H^{s} (s>(3/2)) neighborhood of stable homogeneous states. These results
suggest the long time dynamics in the W^{s,p} (s>1+(1/p)) and particularly, in
the H^{s} (s>(3/2)) neighborhoods of a stable homogeneous state might be
relatively simple. We also demonstrate that linear damping holds for initial
perturbations in very rough spaces, for linearly stable homogeneous state. This
suggests that the contrasting dynamics in W^{s,p} spaces with the critical
power s=1+(1/p) is a trully nonlinear phenomena which can not be traced back to
the linear level.
