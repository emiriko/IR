Saturn is the only known planet to have coorbital satellite systems. In the
present work we studied the process of mass accretion as a possible mechanism
for coorbital satellites formation. The system considered is composed of
Saturn, a proto-satellite and a cloud of planetesimals distributed in the
coorbital region around a triangular Lagrangian point. The adopted relative
mass for the proto-satellite was 10^-6 of Saturn's mass and for each
planetesimal of the cloud three cases of relative mass were considered, 10^-14,
10^-13 and 10^-12 masses of Saturn. In the simulations each cloud of
planetesimal was composed of 10^3, 5 x 10^3 or 10^4 planetesimals. The results
of the simulations show the formation of coorbital satellites with relative
masses of the same order of those found in the saturnian system (10^-13 -
10^-9). Most of them present horseshoe type orbits, but a significant part is
in tadpole orbit around L_4 or L_5. Therefore, the results indicate that this
is a plausible mechanism for the formation of coorbital satellites.
