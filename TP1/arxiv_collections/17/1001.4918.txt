The analytical theory of chirped dissipative soliton solutions of nonlinear
complex Ginzburg-Landau equation is exposed. Obtained approximate solutions are
easily traceable within an extremely broad range of the equation parameters and
allow a clear physical interpretation as a representation of the strongly
chirped pulses in mode-locked both solid-state and fiber oscillators. Scaling
properties of such pulses demonstrate a feasibility of sub-mJ pulse generation
in the continuous-wave mode-locking regime directly from an oscillator
operating at the MHz repetition rate.
