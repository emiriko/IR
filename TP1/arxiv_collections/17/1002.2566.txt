It is shown that loop divergences emerging in the Green functions in quantum
field theory originate from correspondence of the Green functions to {\em
unmeasurable} (and hence unphysical) quantities. This is because no physical
quantity can be measured in a point, but in a region, the size of which is
constrained by the resolution of measuring equipment. The incorporation of the
resolution into the definition of quantum fields $\phi(x)\to\phi^{(A)}(x)$ and
appropriate change of Feynman rules results in finite values of the Green
functions. The Euclidean $\phi^4$-field theory is taken as an example.
