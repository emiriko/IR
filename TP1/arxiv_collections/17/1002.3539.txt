The TASEP (totally asymmetric simple exclusion process) is a basic model for
an one-dimensional interacting particle system with non-reversible dynamics.
Despite the simplicity of the model it shows a very rich and interesting
behaviour. In this paper we study some aspects of the TASEP in discrete time
and compare the results to the recently obtained results for the TASEP in
continuous time. In particular we focus on stationary distributions for
multi-type models, speeds of second-class particles, collision probabilities
and the "speed process". In discrete time, jump attempts may occur at different
sites simultaneously, and the order in which these attempts are processed is
important; we consider various natural update rules.
