We show by first-principles calculations that p-doped graphane is a
conventional superconductor with a critical temperature (Tc) above the boiling
point of liquid nitrogen. The unique strength of the chemical bonds between
carbon atoms and the large density of electronic states at the Fermi energy
arising from the reduced dimensionality synergetically push Tc above 90K, and
give rise to large Kohn anomalies in the optical phonon dispersions. As
evidence of graphane was recently reported, and doping of related materials
such as graphene, diamond and carbon nanostructures is well established,
superconducting graphane may be feasible.
