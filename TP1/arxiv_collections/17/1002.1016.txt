We introduce a new approach to model and analyze \emph{Mobility}. It is fully
based on discrete mathematics and yields a class of mobility models, called the
\emph{Markov Trace} Model. This model can be seen as the discrete version of
the \emph{Random Trip} Model including all variants of the \emph{Random
Way-Point} Model \cite{L06}.
  We derive fundamental properties and \emph{explicit} analytical formulas for
the \emph{stationary distributions} yielded by the Markov Trace Model. Such
results can be exploited to compute formulas and properties for concrete cases
of the Markov Trace Model by just applying counting arguments.
  We apply the above general results to the discrete version of the
\emph{Manhattan Random Way-Point} over a square of bounded size.
  We get formulas for the total stationary distribution and for two important
\emph{conditional} ones: the agent spatial and destination distributions. Our
method makes the analysis of complex mobile systems a feasible task.
  As a further evidence of this important fact, we first model a complex
vehicular-mobile system over a set of crossing streets. Several concrete issues
are implemented such as parking zones, traffic lights, and variable vehicle
speeds. By using a \emph{modular} version of the Markov Trace Model, we get
explicit formulas for the stationary distributions yielded by this
vehicular-mobile model as well.
