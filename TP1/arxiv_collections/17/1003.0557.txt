Janus and Epimetheus are famously known for their distinctive
horseshoe-shaped orbits resulting from a 1:1 orbital resonance. Every four
years these two satellites swap their orbits by a few tens of kilometers as a
result of their close encounter. Recently Tiscareno et al. (2009) have proposed
a model of rotation based on images from the Cassini orbiter. These authors
inferred the amplitude of rotational librational motion in longitude at the
orbital period by fitting a shape model to the recent Cassini ISS images. By a
quasiperiodic approximation of the orbital motion, we describe how the orbital
swap impacts the rotation of the satellites. To that purpose, we have developed
a formalism based on quasi-periodic series with long and short-period
librations. In this framework, the amplitude of the libration at the orbital
period is found proportional to a term accounting for the orbital swap. We
checked the analytical quasi-periodic development by performing a numerical
simulation and find both results in good agreement. To complete this study, the
results regarding the short-period librations are studied with the help of an
adiabatic-like approach.
