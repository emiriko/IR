Asymptotic behavior of solutions to heat equations with spatially singular
inverse-square potentials is studied. By combining a parabolic Almgren type
monotonicity formula with blow-up methods, we evaluate the exact behavior near
the singularity of solutions to linear and subcritical semilinear parabolic
equations with Hardy type potentials. As a remarkable byproduct, a unique
continuation property is obtained.
