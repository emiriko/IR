A simulator of two sailing boats in interaction is being made in order to
provide sportsmen with a reliable analytical tool. We presently describe
different models we used. Stationary hydrodynamics efforts have been specially
evaluated. Experiences plan method has been implemented to exploit the towing
tank tests made in the Fluids Mechanic Laboratory of Ecole Centrale de Nantes.
Here are set out partial results of the model we achieved. At last, a simulator
example illustrates the possibilities provided.
