We study the waiting time distributions of solar flares observed in hard
X-rays with ISEE-3/ICE, HXRBS/SMM, WATCH/GRANAT, BATSE/CGRO, and RHESSI.
Although discordant results and interpretations have been published earlier,
based on relatively small ranges ($< 2$ decades) of waiting times, we find that
all observed distributions, spanning over 6 decades of waiting times ($\Delta t
\approx 10^{-3}- 10^3$ hrs), can be reconciled with a single distribution
function, $N(\Delta t) \propto \lambda_0 (1 + \lambda_0 \Delta t)^{-2}$, which
has a powerlaw slope of $p \approx 2.0$ at large waiting times ($\Delta t
\approx 1-1000$ hrs) and flattens out at short waiting times $\Delta t \lapprox
\Delta t_0 = 1/\lambda_0$. We find a consistent breakpoint at $\Delta t_0 =
1/\lambda_0 = 0.80\pm0.14$ hours from the WATCH, HXRBS, BATSE, and RHESSI data.
The distribution of waiting times is invariant for sampling with different flux
thresholds, while the mean waiting time scales reciprocically with the number
of detected events, $\Delta t_0 \propto 1/n_{det}$. This waiting time
distribution can be modeled with a nonstationary Poisson process with a flare
rate $\lambda=1/\Delta t$ that varies as $f(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{-1}
\exp{-(\lambda/\lambda_0)}$. This flare rate distribution represents a highly
intermittent flaring productivity in short clusters with high flare rates,
separated by quiescent intervals with very low flare rates.
