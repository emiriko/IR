Authors of ref. [1], M.R. Setare and S. Shafei (JCAP 09 (2006) 011), studied
the thermodynamics of a holographic dark energy model in a non-flat universe
enclosed by the apparent horizon $R_A$ and the event horizon measured from the
sphere of the horizon named $L$. In section 3 in ref. [1], Authors showed that
for $R_A$ the generalized second law of thermodynamics is respected, while for
$L$ it is satisfied for the special range of the deceleration parameter. Here
we present that their calculations for $R_A$ should be revised. Also we show
that their conclusion for $L$ is not true and the generalized second law is
hold for the present time independently of the deceleration parameter. Also if
we take into account the contribution of dark matter in the generalized second
law which is absent in ref. [1], then the generalized second law for $L$ is
violated for the present time.
