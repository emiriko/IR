Visibly pushdown transducers form a subclass of pushdown transducers that
(strictly) extends finite state transducers with a stack. Like visibly pushdown
automata, the input symbols determine the stack operations. In this paper, we
prove that functionality is decidable in PSpace for visibly pushdown
transducers. The proof is done via a pumping argument: if a word with two
outputs has a sufficiently large nesting depth, there exists a nested word with
two outputs whose nesting depth is strictly smaller. The proof uses technics of
word combinatorics. As a consequence of decidability of functionality, we also
show that equivalence of functional visibly pushdown transducers is
Exptime-Complete.
