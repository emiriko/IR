We investigate the optical properties of Dibenzoterrylene (DBT) molecules in
a spin-coated crystalline film of anthracence. By performing single molecule
studies, we show that the dipole moments of the DBT molecules are oriented
parallel to the plane of the film. Despite a film thickness of only 20 nm, we
observe an exceptional photostability at room temperature and photon count
rates around one million per second from a single molecule. These properties
together with an emission wavelength around 800 nm make this system attractive
for applications in nanophotonics and quantum optics.
