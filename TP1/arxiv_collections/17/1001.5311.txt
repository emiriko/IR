Adaptive sampling results in dramatic improvements in the recovery of sparse
signals in white Gaussian noise. A sequential adaptive sampling-and-refinement
procedure called Distilled Sensing (DS) is proposed and analyzed. DS is a form
of multi-stage experimental design and testing. Because of the adaptive nature
of the data collection, DS can detect and localize far weaker signals than
possible from non-adaptive measurements. In particular, reliable detection and
localization (support estimation) using non-adaptive samples is possible only
if the signal amplitudes grow logarithmically with the problem dimension. Here
it is shown that using adaptive sampling, reliable detection is possible
provided the amplitude exceeds a constant, and localization is possible when
the amplitude exceeds any arbitrarily slowly growing function of the dimension.
