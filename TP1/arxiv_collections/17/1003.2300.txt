The IceCube observatory is the first cubic kilometre scale instrument in the
field of high-energy neutrino astronomy and cosmic rays. In 2009, following
five successful deployment seasons, IceCube consisted of 59 strings of optical
modules in the South Pole ice, together with 118 air shower detectors in the
IceTop surface array. The range of physics topics includes neutrino signals
from astrophysical sources, dark matter, exotic particle physics, cosmic rays,
and atmospheric neutrinos. The current IceCube status and selected results are
described. Anticipated future developments are also discussed, in particular
the Deep Core low energy subarray which was recently deployed.
