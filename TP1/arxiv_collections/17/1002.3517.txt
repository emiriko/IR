The nuclear and magnetic structure of Fe1+y(Te1-x,Sex) (0 < x < 0.20)
compounds was analyzed between 2 K and 300 K by means of Rietveld refinement of
neutron powder diffraction data. Samples with x < 0.075 undergo a tetragonal to
monoclinic phase transition at low temperature, whose critical temperature
decreases with increasing Se content; this structural transition is strictly
coupled to a long range antiferromagnetic ordering at the Fe site. Both the
transition to a monoclinic phase and the long range antiferromagnetism are
suppressed for 0.10 < x < 0.20. The onset of the structural and of the magnetic
transition remains coincident with the increase of Se substitution. The low
temperature monoclinic crystal structure has been revised. Superconductivity
arises for x > 0.05, therefore a significant region where superconductivity and
long range antiferromagnetism coexist is present in the pseudo-binary FeTe -
FeSe phase diagram.
