In order to study how outflows from protostars influence the physical and
chemical conditions of the parent molecular cloud, we have observed Barnard 1
(B1) main core, which harbors four Class 0 and three Class I sources, in the CO
(J=1-0), CH3OH (J_K=2_K-1_K), and the SiO (J=1-0) lines using the Nobeyama 45 m
telescope. We have identified three CO outflows in this region; one is an
elongated (~ 0.3 pc) bipolar outflow from a Class 0 protostar B1-c in the
submillimeter clump SMM 2, another is a rather compact (~ 0.1 pc) outflow from
a Class I protostar B1 IRS in the clump SMM 6, and the other is an extended
outflow from a Class I protostar in SMM 11. In the western lobe of the SMM 2
outflow, both the SiO and CH3OH lines show broad redshifted wings with the
terminal velocities of 25 km/s and 13 km/s, respectively. It is likely that the
shocks caused by the interaction between the outflow and ambient gas enhance
the abundance of SiO and CH3OH in the gas phase. The total energy input rate by
the outflows (1.1x10^{-3} Lsun) is smaller than the energy loss rate
(8.5x10^{-3} Lsun$) through the turbulence decay in B1 main core, which
suggests that the outflows can not sustain the turbulence in this region. Since
the outflows are energetic enough to compensate the dissipating turbulence
energy in the neighboring, more evolved star forming region NGC 1333, we
suggest that the turbulence energy balance depends on the evolutionary state of
the star formation in molecular clouds.
