We demonstrate, through numerical simulations, the emission of a coherent
continuous matter wave of constant amplitude from a Bose-Einstein Condensate in
a shallow optical dipole trap. The process is achieved by spatial control of
the variations of the scattering length along the trapping axis, including
elastic three body interactions due to dipole interactions. In our approach,
the outcoupling mechanism are atomic interactions and thus, the trap remains
unaltered. We calculate analytically the parameters for the experimental
implementation of this CW atom laser.
