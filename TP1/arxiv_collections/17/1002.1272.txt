We present first results of a partial wave analysis of the diffractive
reaction $\pi- Pb \to \pi- \pi+ \pi- Pb$ based on data from the COMPASS
experiment taken during a pilot run in 2004 using a 190 GeV/c $\pi-$ beam on a
lead target. The analysis was performed in the region of squared four-momentum
transfer $t'$ between 0.1 and 1.0 (GeV/c)^2. The $\pi- \pi+ \pi-$ final state
shows a rich spectrum of well-known resonances. In addition a spin-exotic
$J^{PC} = 1^{-+}$ state with significant intensity was observed at 1.66 GeV/c^2
in the $\rho(770) \pi$ decay channel in natural parity exchange. The resonant
nature of this state is manifest in the mass dependence of its phase difference
to $J^{PC} = 1^{++}$ and $2^{-+}$ waves. The measured resonance parameters are
consistent with the disputed $\pi_1(1600)$. An outlook on the analyses of the
much larger data set taken during 2008 and 2009 is given.
