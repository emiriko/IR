In this paper, the minimum channel gain flow with uncertainty in the demand
vector is examined. The approach is based on a transformation of uncertainty in
the demand vector to uncertainty in the gain vector. OFDM systems are known to
overcome the impairment of the wireless channel by splitting the given system
bandwidth into parallel sub-carriers, on which data-symbols can be transmitted
simultaneously. This enables the possibility of enhancing the system's
performance by deploying adaptive mechanisms, namely power distribution and
dynamic sub-carrier assignments. The performances of maximizing the minimum
throughput have been analyzed by MATLAB codes.
