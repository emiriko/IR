A coupled atom-molecule condensate with an intraspecies Feshbach resonance is
employed to explore matter wave bistability both in the presence and in the
absence of a unidirectional optical ring cavity. In particular, a set of
conditions are derived that allow the threshold for bistability, due both to
two-body s-wave scatterings and to cavity-mediated two-body interactions, to be
determined analytically. The latter bistability is found to support, not only
transitions between a mixed (atom-molecule) state and a pure molecular state as
in the former bistability, but also transitions between two distinct mixed
states.
