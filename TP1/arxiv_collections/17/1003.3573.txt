We present a status report on the study of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) in the era
of rapid follow-up using the world's largest robotic optical telescopes - the
2-m Liverpool and Faulkes telescopes. Within the context of key unsolved issues
in GRB physics, we describe (1) our innovative software that allows real-time
automatic analysis and interpretation of GRB light curves, (2) the novel
instrumentation that allows unique types of observations (in particular, early
time polarisation measurements) and (3) the key science questions and
discoveries to which robotic observations are ideally suited, concluding with a
summary of current understanding of GRB physics provided by combining rapid
optical observations with simultaneous observations at other wavelengths.
