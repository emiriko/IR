Using the 'k-means' cluster analysis algorithm, we carry out an unsupervised
classification of all galaxy spectra in the seventh and final Sloan Digital Sky
Survey data release (SDSS/DR7). Except for the shift to restframe wavelengths,
and the normalization to the g-band flux, no manipulation is applied to the
original spectra. The algorithm guarantees that galaxies with similar spectra
belong to the same class. We find that 99 % of the galaxies can be assigned to
only 17 major classes, with 11 additional minor classes including the remaining
1%. The classification is not unique since many galaxies appear in between
classes, however, our rendering of the algorithm overcomes this weakness with a
tool to identify borderline galaxies. Each class is characterized by a template
spectrum, which is the average of all the spectra of the galaxies in the class.
These low noise template spectra vary smoothly and continuously along a
sequence labeled from 0 to 27, from the reddest class to the bluest class. Our
Automatic Spectroscopic K-means-based (ASK) classification separates galaxies
in colors, with classes characteristic of the red sequence, the blue cloud, as
well as the green valley. When red sequence galaxies and green valley galaxies
present emission lines, they are characteristic of AGN activity. Blue galaxy
classes have emission lines corresponding to star formation regions. We find
the expected correlation between spectroscopic class and Hubble type, but this
relationship exhibits a high intrinsic scatter. Several potential uses of the
ASK classification are identified and sketched, including fast determination of
physical properties by interpolation, classes as templates in redshift
determinations, and target selection in follow-up works (we find classes of
Seyfert galaxies, green valley galaxies, as well as a significant number of
outliers). The ASK classification is publicly accessible through various
websites.
