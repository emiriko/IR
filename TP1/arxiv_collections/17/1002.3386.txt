Using a covariant spectator quark model we estimate valence quark
contributions to the F1*(Q2) and F2*(Q2) transition form factors for the gamma
N -> P11(1440) reaction. The Roper resonance, P11(1440), is assumed to be the
first radial excitation of the nucleon. The present model requires no extra
parameters except for those already fixed by the previous studies for the
nucleon. Our results are consistent with the experimental data in the high Q2
region, and those from lattice QCD. We also estimate the meson cloud
contributions, focusing on the low Q2 region, where they are expected to be
dominant.
