An experimental study of Raman scattering in N-layer graphene as a function
of the top layer doping is reported. At high doping level, achieved by a CHF_3
plasma treatment, we observe a splitting of the $G$ band in the spectra of
bilayer and 4-layer graphene (N even), whereas the splitting is not visible in
case of monolayer and trilayer graphene (N odd). The different behaviors are
related to distinct electron-phonon interactions, which are affected by
symmetry breaking and Fermi level position in different ways in the various
N-layer graphenes. In trilayer graphene, a weakening of the electron-phonon
coupling as a function of the Fermi energy induces a hardening of all
zone-center in-plane optical phonon modes, like in monolayer graphene. On the
other hand, in 4-layer graphene two distinct trends are observed in the G band
as a function of doping, suggesting the presence of two different groups of
electron-phonon interactions, like in bilayer graphene.
