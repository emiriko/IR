Quantum entanglement is the quintessential characteristic of quantum
mechanics and the basis for quantum information processing. When one of two
maximally entangled particles is measured, without measurement the state of
another one is determined simultaneously no matter how far the two particles is
from each other. How can these phenomena take place since no object can move
faster than light speed in a vacuum? The key problem is due to the ignorance of
the interaction between a particle and a quantum vacuum. Just like the case
where a gun suffers recoil from its firing of a bullet, when a particle is
created from the quantum vacuum, the vacuum will be somewhat "broken"
correspondingly, which can be described by a shadow state in the vacuum.
Through their shadows in the vacuum two quantum entangled particles can have a
distance-independent instantaneous interaction with each other. Quantum
teleportation, quantum swap, and wave function collapse are explained in a
similar way. Quantum object can be interpreted as a composite made up of a
particle and the shadowed quantum vacuum which is responsible for the wave
characteristic of the particle wave duality. The quantum vacuum is not only the
origin of all possible kinds of particles, but also the origin and the core of
Eastern mystics.
