We derive the quiver gauge theory on the world-volume of D3-branes transverse
to an L(a,b,c) singularity by computing the endomorphism algebra of a tilting
object first constructed by Van den Bergh. The quiver gauge theory can be
concisely specified by an embedding of a graph into a face-centered cubic
lattice. In this description, planar Seiberg dualities of the gauge theory act
by changing the graph embedding. We use this description of Seiberg duality to
show these quiver gauge theories possess periodic Seiberg dualities whose
existence was expected from the AdS/CFT correspondence.
