It is often argued that hypothetic nonlocal reality responsible for nonlocal
quantum correlations between entangled particles cannot be consistent with
relativity. I review the most frequent arguments of that sort, explain how they
can all be circumvented, and present an explicit Bohmian model of nonlocal
reality (compatible with quantum phenomena) that fully obeys the principle of
relativistic covariance and does not involve a preferred Lorentz frame.
