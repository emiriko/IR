We present the first results from a long (496 ks) Chandra High Energy
Transmission Grating observation of the intermediate polar EX Hydrae. In
addition to the narrow emission lines from the cooling post-shock gas, for the
first time we have detected a broad component in some of the X-ray emission
lines, namely O VIII 18.97, Mg XII 8.42, Si XIV 6.18, and Fe XVII 16.78. The
broad and narrow components have widths of ~ 1600 km s^-1 and ~ 150 km s^-1,
respectively. We propose a scenario where the broad component is formed in the
pre-shock accretion flow, photoionized by radiation from the post-shock flow.
Because the photoionized region has to be close to the radiation source in
order to produce strong photoionized emission lines from ions like O VIII, Fe
XVII, Mg XII, and Si XIV, our photoionization model constrains the height of
the standing shock above the white dwarf surface. Thus, the X-ray spectrum from
EX Hya manifests features of both magnetic and non-magnetic cataclysmic
variables.
