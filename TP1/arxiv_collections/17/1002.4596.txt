We investigate the effect of possible a-priori "imprinting" effects of
general relativity itself on satellite/spaceraft-based tests of it. We deal
with some performed or proposed time-delay ranging experiments in the Sun's
gravitational field. It turns out that the "imprint" of general relativity on
the Astronomical Unit and the solar gravitational constant GM_{\odot}, not
solved for in the so far performed spacecraft-based time-delay tests, induces
an a-priori bias of the order of 10^-6 in typical solar system ranging
experiments aimed to measuring the space curvature PPN parameter gamma. It is
too small by one order of magnitude to be of concern for the performed Cassini
experiment, but it would affect future planned or proposed tests aiming to
reach a 10^-7-10^-9 accuracy in determining gamma.
