The single-particle excitations, which initiate the pseudogap in the cuprate
superconductors at some temperature T^*, relate to specific local spectral
features of resonant pairing, where charge carriers get momentarily trapped on
dynamically deformable molecular Cu-O-Cu clusters. We show how those local
excitations evolve into dispersive branches with a characteristic "S"-like
shape for three-peak structured ingap excitations in the cuprates' pseudogap
phase, when we consider a lattice of such clusters. This feature should be
detectable in "momentum distribution curve" ARPES analysis.
