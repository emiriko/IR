Experiments with low-energy antiprotons are currently performed at the
Antiproton Decelerator of CERN. The main experiments deal with the spectroscopy
of antiprotonic helium, an exotic three-body system, and the formation and
spectroscopy of antihydrogen. A next generation facility FLAIR (Facility for
Low-energy Antiproton Rsearch) is planned at the FAIR facility, generating a
factor 100 higher flux of stopped antiprotons and also offering continuous
antiprotons beam, which will enable nuclear and particle physics type
experiments.
