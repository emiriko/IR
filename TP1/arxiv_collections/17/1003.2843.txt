The quark-hadron phase transition at finite baryon chemical potential is
investigated in the extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in which the
scalar-vector eight-point interaction is included holding the chiral symmetry.
By comparing a pressure of the symmetric nuclear matter with that of the quark
matter, the realized phase at given baryon density is determined. As a result,
the first order quark-hadron phase transition is derived where the
deconfinement transition occurs after the chiral symmetry restoration in this
model.
