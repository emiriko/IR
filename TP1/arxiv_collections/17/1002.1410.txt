The interpretation of quantum mechanics has been a problem since its founding
days. A large contribution to the discussion of possible interpretations of
quantum mechanics is given by the so-called impossibility proofs for hidden
variable models; models that allow a realist interpretation.
  In this thesis some of these proofs are discussed, like von Neumann's
Theorem, the Kochen-Specker Theorem and the Bell-inequalities. Some more recent
developments are also investigated, like Meyer's nullification of the
Kochen-Specker Theorem, the MKC-models and Conway and Kochen's Free Will
Theorem. This last one is taken to suggest that the problems that arise for
certain interpretations of quantum mechanics are not limited to realist
interpretations only, but also affect certain instrumentalist interpretations.
  It is argued that one may arrive at a more satisfying interpretation of
quantum mechanics if one adopts a logic that seems more compatible with the
instrumentalist viewpoint namely, intuitionistic logic. The motivations for
adopting this form of logic rather than classical logic or quantum logic are
linked to some of the philosophical ideas of Bohr. In particular a new
interpretation of Bohr's notion of complementarity is proposed. Finally some
possibilities are explored for linking the intuitionistic interpretation of
quantum mechanics to the mathematical formalism of the theory.
