Transition metal oxides display a great variety of quantum electronic
behaviours where correlations often play an important role. The achievement of
high quality epitaxial interfaces involving such materials gives a unique
opportunity to engineer artificial structures where new electronic orders take
place. One of the most striking result in this area is the recent observation
of a two-dimensional electron gas at the interface between a strongly
correlated Mott insulator LaTiO3 and a band insulator SrTiO3. The mechanism
responsible for such a behaviour is still under debate. In particular, the
influence of the nature of the insulator has to be clarified. Here we show that
despite the expected electronic correlations, LaTiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures
undergo a superconducting transition at a critical temperature Tc=300 mK. We
have found that the superconducting electron gas is confined over a typical
thickness of 12 nm. We discuss the electronic properties of this system and
review the possible scenarios.
