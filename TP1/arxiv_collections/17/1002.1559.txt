A new negative result for nonparametric estimation of binary ergodic
processes is shown. I The problem of estimation of distribution with any degree
of accuracy is studied. Then it is shown that for any countable class of
estimators there is a zero-entropy binary ergodic process that is inconsistent
with the class of estimators. Our result is different from other negative
results for universal forecasting scheme of ergodic processes.
