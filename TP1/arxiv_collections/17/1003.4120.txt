Recent important progress on the knowledge of multifragmentation and phase
transition for hot nuclei, thanks to the high detection quality of the INDRA
array, is reported. It concerns i) the radial collective energies involved in
hot fragmenting nuclei/sources produced in central and semi- peripheral
collisions and their influence on the observed fragment partitions, ii) a
better knowledge of freeze-out properties obtained by means of a simulation
based on all the available experimental information and iii) the quantitative
study of the bimodal behaviour of the heaviest fragment distribution for
fragmenting hot heavy quasi-projectiles which allows the extraction, for the
first time, of an estimate of the latent heat of the phase transition.
