CCD BVRcIc photometric observations of the 2010 outburst of the recurrent
nova U Scorpii are presented. The light-curve has a smooth development
characterized by t2(V)=1.8 and t3(V)=4.1 days, close to the t2(V)=2.2 and
t3(V)=4.3 days of 1999 outburst. The plateau phase in 2010 has been brighter,
lasting shorter and beginning earlier than in the 1999 outburst. Flickering,
with an amplitude twice larger in $I_{\rm C}$ than in $B$ band, was absent on
day +4.8 and +15.7, and present on day +11.8, with a time scale of about half
an hour.
