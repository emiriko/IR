The measurements of the Doppler shifts of the Fraunhofer lines, scattered by
the dust grains in the solar F-corona, provides the insight on the velocity
field of the dust and hence on its origin. We report on such measurements
obtained during the total eclipse of March 29, 2006. We used a Fabry-P\'erot
interferometer with the FOV of 5.9 degrees and the spectral resolution of about
5000 to record Fraunhofer spectral lines scattered by the dust of the F-Corona.
The spectral region was centered on the MgI 5172.69 A line. The measured
line-on-sight velocities with the amplitude in the range from -10 to 10 km/s
show that during our observations the dust grains were on the orbit with a
retrograde motion in a plane nearly perpendicular to the ecliptics. This
indicates their cometary origin. Indeed, at the end of March, 2006, SOHO
recorded several sungrazing comets with the orbital elements close to what was
deduced from our measurements. We conclude that the contribution of comets to
the dust content in the region close to the Sun can be more important albeit
variable in time. We also deduce that the size of the most of the dust grains
during our observations was less than 0.1 microns.
