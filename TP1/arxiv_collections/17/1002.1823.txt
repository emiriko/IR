Recent studies have revealed massive star clusters in a region of the Milky
Way close to the tip of the Long Bar. These clusters are heavily obscured and
are characterised by a population of red supergiants. We analyse a previously
unreported concentration of bright red stars ~16' away from the cluster RSGC1.
We utilised near IR photometry to identify candidate red supergiants and then
K-band spectroscopy of a sample to characterise their properties.
  We find a compact clump of eight red supergiants and five other candidates at
some distance, one of which is spectroscopically confirmed as a red supergiant.
These objects must form an open cluster, which we name Alicante 8. Because of
the high reddening and strong field contamination, the cluster sequence is not
clearly seen in 2MASS or UKIDSS near-IR photometry. From the analysis of the
red supergiants, we infer an extinction $A_{K_{{\rm S}}}=1.9$ and an age close
to 20 Myr. Though this cluster is smaller than the three known previously, its
properties still suggest a mass in excess of 10 000 $M_{\sun}$. Its discovery
corroborates the hypothesis that star formation in this region has happened on
a wide scale between ~10 and ~20 Myr ago.
