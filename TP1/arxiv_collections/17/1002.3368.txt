The first stars in the history of the Universe are likely to form in the
dense central regions of 10^5-10^6 Msolar cold dark matter halos at z=10-50.
The annihilation of dark matter particles in these environments may lead to the
formation of so-called dark stars, which are predicted to be cooler, larger,
more massive and potentially more long-lived than conventional population III
stars. Here, we investigate the prospects of detecting high-redshift dark stars
with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that dark stars at
z>6 are intrinsically too faint to be detected by JWST. However, by exploiting
foreground galaxy clusters as gravitational telescopes, certain varieties of
cool (Teff < 30000 K) dark stars should be within reach at redshifts up to
z=10. If the lifetimes of dark stars are sufficiently long, many such objects
may also congregate inside the first galaxies. We demonstrate that this could
give rise to peculiar features in the integrated spectra of galaxies at high
redshifts, provided that dark stars make up at least 1 percent of the total
stellar mass in such objects.
