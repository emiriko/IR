We establish a series representation of the Hill discriminant based on the
spectral parameter power series (SPPS) recently introduced by V. Kravchenko. We
also show the invariance of the Hill discriminant under a Darboux
transformation and employing the Mathieu case the feasibility of this type of
series for numerical calculations of the eigenspectrum
