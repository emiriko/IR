Automatic construction of ontologies from text is generally based on
retrieving text content. For a much more rich ontology we extend these
approaches by taking into account the document structure and some external
resources (like thesaurus of indexing terms of near domain). In this paper we
describe how these external resources are at first analyzed and then exploited.
This method has been applied on a geographical domain and the benefit has been
evaluated.
