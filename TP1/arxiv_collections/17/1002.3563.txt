Second RPA calculations with a Skyrme force are performed to describe both
high- and low-lying excited states in $^{16}$O. The coupling between 1
particle-1 hole and 2 particle-2 hole as well as that between 2 particle-2 hole
configurations among themselves are fully taken into account and the residual
interaction is never neglected, not resorting therefore to a generally used
approximate scheme where only the first kind of coupling is considered. The
issue of the rearrangement terms in the matrix elements beyond standard RPA is
addressed and discussed. As a general feature of second RPA results, a
several-MeV shift of the strength distribution to lower energies is
systematically found with respect to RPA distributions. A much more important
fragmentation of the strength is also naturally provided by second RPA due to
the huge number of 2 particle-2 hole configurations. A better description of
the excitation energies of the low-lying 0$^+$ and 2$^+$ states is obtained
with second RPA with respect to RPA.
