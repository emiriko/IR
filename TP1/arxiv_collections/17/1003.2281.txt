Web 2.0 applications have attracted a considerable amount of attention
because their open-ended nature allows users to create light-weight semantic
scaffolding to organize and share content. To date, the interplay of the social
and semantic components of social media has been only partially explored. Here
we focus on Flickr and Last.fm, two social media systems in which we can relate
the tagging activity of the users with an explicit representation of their
social network. We show that a substantial level of local lexical and topical
alignment is observable among users who lie close to each other in the social
network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity while removing
local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the actual local alignment
between users from statistical effects due to the assortative mixing of user
activity and centrality in the social network. This analysis suggests that
users with similar topical interests are more likely to be friends, and
therefore semantic similarity measures among users based solely on their
annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test this
hypothesis on the Last.fm data set, confirming that the social network
constructed from semantic similarity captures actual friendship more accurately
than Last.fm's suggestions based on listening patterns.
