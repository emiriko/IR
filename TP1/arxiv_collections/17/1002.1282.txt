Endohedral fullerenes encapsulating a spin-active atom or ion within a carbon
cage offer a route to self-assembled arrays such as spin chains. In the case of
metallofullerenes the charge transfer between the atom and the fullerene cage
has been thought to limit the electron spin phase coherence time (T2) to the
order of a few microseconds. We study electron spin relaxation in several
species of metallofullerene as a function of temperature and solvent
environment, yielding a maximum T2 in deuterated o-terphenyl greater than 200
microseconds for Y, Sc and La@C82. The mechanisms governing relaxation (T1, T2)
arise from metal-cage vibrational modes, spin-orbit coupling and the nuclear
spin environment. The T2 times are over 2 orders of magnitude longer than
previously reported and consequently make metallofullerenes of interest in
areas such as spin-labelling, spintronics and quantum computing.
