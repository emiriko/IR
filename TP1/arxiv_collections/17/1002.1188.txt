Software Visualization encompasses the development and evaluation of methods
for graphically representing different aspects of methods of software,
including its structure, execution and evolution. Creating visualizations helps
the user to better understand complex phenomena. It is also found by the
software engineering community that visualization is essential and important.
In order to visualize the evolution of the models in Model-Driven Software
Evolution, authors have proposed a framework which consists of 7 key areas
(views) and 22 key features for the assessment of Model Driven Software
Evolution process and addresses a number of stakeholder concerns. The framework
is derived by the application of the Goal Question Metric Paradigm. This paper
aims to describe an application of the framework by considering different
visualization tools/CASE tools which are used to visualize the models in
different views and to capture the information of models during their
evolution. Comparison of such tools is also possible by using the framework.
