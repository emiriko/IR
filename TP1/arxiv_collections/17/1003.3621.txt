We study the eigenvector problem in homogeneous superintegrable $N$-state
chiral Potts model (CPM) by the symmetry principal. Using duality symmetry and
(spin-)inversion in CPM, together with Onsager-algebra symmetry and
$sl_2$-loop-algebra symmetry of the superintegrable $\tau^{(2)}$-model, we
construct the complete $k'$-dependent CPM-eigenvectors in the local spin basis
for an arbitrary Onsager sector. In this paper, we present the complete
classification of quantum numbers of superintegrable $\tau^{(2)}$-model.
Accordingly, there are four types of sectors. The relationships among Onsager
sectors under duality and inversion, together with their Bethe roots and
CPM-eigenvectors, are explicitly found. Using algebraic-Bethe-ansatz techniques
and duality of CPM, we construct the Bethe states and the Fabricius-McCoy
currents of the superintegrable $\tau^{(2)}$-model through its equivalent
spin-$\frac{N-1}{2}$-XXZ chain. The $\tau^{(2)}$-eigenvectors in a sector are
derived from the Bethe state and the $sl_2$-product structure determined by the
Fabricius-McCoy current of the sector. From those $\tau^{(2)}$-eigenvectors,
the $k'$-dependence of CPM state vectors in local-spin-basis form is obtained
by the Onsager-algebra symmetry of the superintegrable chiral Potts quantum
chain.
