The diffusion of astrophysical magnetic fields in conducting fluids in the
presence of turbulence depends on whether magnetic fields can change their
topology or reconnect in highly conducting media. Recent progress in
understanding fast magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence is
reassuring that the magnetic field behavior in computer simulations and
turbulent astrophysical environments is similar, as far as the magnetic
reconnection is concerned. This makes it meaningful to perform MHD simulations
of turbulent flows in order to understand the diffusion of magnetic field in
astrophysical environments. These simulations support the concept of
reconnection diffusion, which describes the ability of magnetic fields to get
removed from magnetized clouds and cores in the process of star formation.
