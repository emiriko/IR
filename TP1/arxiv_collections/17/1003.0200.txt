We study how the degree of ordering depends on the strength of the thermal
and quantum fluctuations in frustrated systems by investigating the correlation
function of the order parameter. Concretely, we compare the equilibrium spin
correlation function in a frustrated lattice which exhibits a non-monotonic
temperature dependence (reentrant type dependence) with that in the ground
state as a function of the transverse field that causes the quantum
fluctuation. We find the correlation function in the ground state also shows a
non-monotonic dependence on the strength of the transverse field. We also study
the real-time dynamics of the spin correlation function under a time-dependent
field. After sudden decrease of the temperature, we found non-monotonic changes
of the correlation function reflecting the static temperature dependence, which
indicates that an effective temperature of the system changes gradually. For
the quantum system, we study the dependence of changes of the correlation
function on the sweeping speed of the transverse field. Contrary to the
classical case, the correlation function varies little in a rapid change of the
field, though it shows a non-monotonic change when we sweep the field slowly.
