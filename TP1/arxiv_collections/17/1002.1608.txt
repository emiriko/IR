Usual Woods-Saxon single particle levels with BCS pairing are not able to
reproduce the experimental occupation probabilities of the proton and neutron
levels 1p_{3/2}, 1p_{1/2}, 0f_{5/2}, 0g_{9/2} in the double-beta decay system
76Ge to 76Se. Shifting down the 0g_{9/2} level by hand can explain the data but
it is not satisfactory. Here it is shown that a selfconsistent Hartree-Fock+BCS
approach with experimental deformations for 76Ge and 76Se may decisively
improve the agreement with the recent data on occupation probabilities by
Schiffer et al. and Kay et al. Best agreement with available data on 76Ge and
76Se, as well as on neighbor isotopes, is obtained when the spin-orbit strength
for neutrons is allowed to be larger than that for protons. The two-neutrino
double-beta decay matrix element is also shown to agree with data.
