We present a technique to improve the slow-light performance of a
side-coupled spaced sequence of resonators (SCISSOR) combined with a stimulated
Brillouin scattering (SBS) gain medium in optical fiber. We evaluate device
performance of SCISSOR-only and SCISSOR + SBS systems for different numbers of
cascaded resonators from 1 to 70 using two different data fidelity metrics
including eye-opening and mutual information. A practical system design is
demonstrated by analyzing its performance in terms of fractional delay, power
transmission, and data fidelity. We observe that the results from the two
metrics are in good agreement. Based on system optimization under practical
resource and fidelity constraints, the SCISSOR consisting of 70 cascaded
resonators provides a fractional delay of 8 with 22 dB attenuation at a signal
bit rate of 10 Gbps. The combined optimal SCISSOR (with 70 resonators) + SBS
system provides a improved fractional delay up to 17 with unit power
transmission under the same constraints.
