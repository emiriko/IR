We give an introduction to the structure theory of extended affine Lie
algebras, which provide a common framework for finite-dimensional semisimple,
affine and toroidal Lie algebras. The notes are based on a lecture series given
during the Fields Institute summer school at the University of Ottawa in June
2009.
