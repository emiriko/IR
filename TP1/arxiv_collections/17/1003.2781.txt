In the present paper we show that the Temporal Wave Function approach of the
decay process, which is a multicomponent version of the Time Operator approach
leads to new, non-standard, predictions concerning the statistical properties
of decay time distributions of single kaons and entangled pairs of mesons.
These results suggest crucial experimental tests for the existence of a Time
Operator for the decay process to be realized in High Energy Physics or Quantum
Optics.
