In this paper, a variable-coefficient Gardner equation is considered. By
using the classical symmetry analysis method symmetries for this equation are
obtained. Then, the generalized Jacobi elliptic function expansion method is
used to solve the reduced ODE. Some new exact solutions for the considered PDE
are obtained.
