An abundance analysis has been conducted for a sample of nine post-AGB
candidate stars; eight of them have not been explored before. We find four very
promising objects like HD 105262, HD 53300 and CpD$-62^o5428$ among them. We
find strong evidence of dust-gas separation through selective depletion of
refractive elements in HD 105262. The same effect is also observed in HD 53300,
CpD$-62^o5428$ and HD 114855 although abundance peculiarities are relatively
smaller for the last two stars. We find strong enrichment of nitrogen for HD
725, HD 842, HD 1457, HD 9233 and HD 61227 but no further evidence to support
their post-AGB nature. We have compared the observed [N/C] ratios of these
stars with the predictions of evolutionary models which include the rotation
induced mixing.
