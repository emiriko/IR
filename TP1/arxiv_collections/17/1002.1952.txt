Cosmological discoveries over the past century have completely changed our
picture of our place in the universe. New observations have a realistic chance
of probing nature on heretofore unimaginable scales, and as a result are
changing the nature of fundamental science. Perhaps no other domain of science
has an equal capacity to completely change our perspective of the world in
which we live.
