This paper describes a method for deriving approximate equations for
irrotational water waves. The method is based on a 'relaxed' variational
principle, i.e., on a Lagrangian involving as many variables as possible. This
formulation is particularly suitable for the construction of approximate water
wave models, since it allows more freedom while preserving the variational
structure. The advantages of this relaxed formulation are illustrated with
various examples in shallow and deep waters, as well as arbitrary depths. Using
subordinate constraints (e.g., irrotationality or free surface impermeability)
in various combinations, several model equations are derived, some being
well-known, other being new. The models obtained are studied analytically and
exact travelling wave solutions are constructed when possible.
