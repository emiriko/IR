We explore the behavior of the phonon number distribution in an heterogeneous
linear ion crystal. The presence of ion species with different masses changes
dramatically the transverse energy spectrum, in such a way that two
eigenfrequencies become non-analytic functions of the mass ratio in the form of
a sharp cusp. This non-analyticity induces a quantum phase transition between
condensed and conducting phase of the transverse local phonons. In order to
continuously vary the mass ratio we adiabatically modify a locally applied
laser field, exerting optical dipole forces which reduces the effective mass.
