We study the linear response of the inner crust of neutron stars within the
Random Phase Approximation, employing a Skyrme-type interaction as effective
interaction. We adopt the Wigner-Seitz approximation, and consider a single
unit cell of the Coulomb lattice which constitutes the inner crust, with a
nucleus at its center, surrounded by a sea of free neutrons. With the use of an
appropriate operator, it is possible to analyze in detail the properties of the
vibrations of the surface of the nucleus and their interaction with the modes
of the sea of free neutrons, and to investigate the role of shell effects and
of resonant states.
