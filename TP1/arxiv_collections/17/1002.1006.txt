We present a quantitative study of the role played by different components
characterizing the nucleon-nucleon interaction in the evolution of the nuclear
shell structure. It is based on the spin-tensor decomposition of an effective
two-body shell-model interaction and the subsequent study of effective
single-particle energy variations in a series of isotopes or isotones. The
technique allows to separate unambiguously contributions of the central, vector
and tensor components of the realistic effective interaction. We show that
while the global variation of the single-particle energies is due to the
central component of the effective interaction, the characteristic behavior of
spin-orbit partners, noticed recently, is mainly due to its tensor part. Based
on the analysis of a well-fitted realistic interaction in sdpf-shell model
space, we analyze in detail the role played by the different terms in the
formation and/or disappearance of N=16, N=20 and N=28 shell gaps in
neutron-rich nuclei.
