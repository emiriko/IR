We generalize the pointwise decay estimates for large data solutions of the
defocusing semilinear wave equations which we obtained earlier under
restriction to spherical symmetry. Without the symmetry the conformal
transformation we use provides only a weak decay. This can, however, in the
next step be improved to the optimal decay estimate suggested by the radial
case and small data results. This is the first result of that kind.
