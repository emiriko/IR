Unlimited access to a motorway network can, in overloaded conditions, cause a
loss of capacity. Ramp metering (signals on slip roads to control access to the
motorway) can help avoid this loss of capacity. The design of ramp metering
strategies has several features in common with the design of access control
mechanisms in communication networks.
  Inspired by models and rate control mechanisms developed for Internet
congestion control, we propose a Brownian network model as an approximate model
for a controlled motorway and consider it operating under a proportionally fair
ramp metering policy.We present an analysis of the performance of this model.
