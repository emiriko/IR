The Hamiltonian methods of the theory of solitons are applied to
gravisolitons in the dressing formalism. The Poisson bracket for the
Lie-algebra valued one-form $A(\varsigma, \eta,
\gamma)=\Psi_{,\gamma}\Psi^{-1}$, for gravisolitons in the dressing formalism,
for a specific background solution, is defined and computed, agreeing with
results previously obtained. A transition matrix ${\cal T}=A(\varsigma, \eta,
\gamma) A^{-1}(\eta, \xi, -\gamma)$ for $A$ is defined relating $A$ at ingoing
and outgoing light cones. It is proved that it satisfies equations familiar
from integrable pde's with the role of time played by the null coordinate
$\eta$. This is a new result mathematically, since there has not been a
transition matrix for $A$ in the litterature, while physically it presents the
possibility of obtaining integrals of motion (for appropriate boundary
conditions), from the trace of the derivative with respect to the null
coordinate $\eta$, of ${\cal T}$, in terms of classical relativity connections,
since $A(\gamma = \pm 1)$ can be expressed in a simple way in terms of the
classical Christoffel symbols. This may prove of use upon quantization since
connections are fundamental variables of quantum gravity. The roles of $\eta$
and $\varsigma $ may be reversed to obtain integrals of motion for $\varsigma$,
thus $\varsigma$ playing the role of time. This ties well with the two-time
interpretation and approach already established before.
