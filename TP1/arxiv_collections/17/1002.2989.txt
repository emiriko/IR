Epitaxial oxide interfaces with broken translational symmetry have emerged as
a central paradigm behind the novel behaviors of oxide superlattices. Here, we
use scanning transmission electron microscopy to demonstrate a direct,
quantitative unit-cell-by-unit-cell mapping of lattice parameters and oxygen
octahedral rotations across the BiFeO3-La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 interface to elucidate
how the change of crystal symmetry is accommodated. Combined with low-loss
electron energy loss spectroscopy imaging, we demonstrate a mesoscopic
antiferrodistortive phase transition and elucidate associated changes in
electronic properties in a thin layer directly adjacent to the interface.
