In this article we treat the subject of chaotic environments with few degrees
of freedom in quantum communication by investigating a conservative dynamical
map as a model of a dephasing quantum channel. When the channel's dynamics is
chaotic, we investigate the model's semi-classical limit and show that the
entropy exchange grows at a constant rate which depends on a single parameter
(the interaction strength), analogous to stochastic models of dephasing
channels. We analyze memory effects in the channel and present strong physical
arguments to support that the present model is forgetful in the chaotic regime
while memory effects in general cannot be ignored when channel dynamics is
regular. In order to render the non-chaotic channel forgetful, it becomes
necessary to apply a reset to the channel and this reset can efficiently be
modeled by application of a chaotic map. We may then refer to encoding theorems
(valid in the case of forgetful channels) to present evidence of a transition
from noiseless to noisy channel due to the environment's transition from
regular to chaotic dynamics.
