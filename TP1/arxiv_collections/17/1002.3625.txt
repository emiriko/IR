The brightest Ultra-Luminous X-ray source HLX-1 in the galaxy ESO 243-49
provides strong evidence for the existence of intermediate mass black holes. As
the luminosity and thus the mass estimate depend on the association of HLX-1
with ESO 243-49, it is essential to confirm its affiliation. This requires
follow-up investigations at wavelengths other than X-rays, which in-turn needs
an improved source position. To further reinforce the intermediate mass black
hole identification, it is necessary to determine HLX-1's environment to
establish whether it could potentially form and nourish a black hole at the
luminosities observed. Using the High Resolution Camera onboard Chandra, we
determine a source position of RA=01h10m28.3s and Dec=-46d04'22.3". A
conservative 95% error of 0.3" was found following a boresight correction by
cross-matching the positions of 3 X-ray sources in the field with the 2MASS
catalog. Combining all Swift UV/Optical Telescope uvw2 images, we failed to
detect a UV source at the Chandra position down to a 3sigma limiting magnitude
of 20.25 mag. However, there is evidence that the UV emission is elongated in
the direction of HLX-1. This is supported by archival data from GALEX and
suggests that the far-UV emission is stronger than the near-UV. This could
imply that HLX-1 may be situated near the edge of a star forming region. Using
the latest X-ray observations we deduce the mass accretion rate of a 500 Msun
black hole with the observed luminosity and show that this is compatible with
such an environment.
