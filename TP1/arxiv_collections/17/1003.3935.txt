We present a three-dimensional gravitational Born-Infeld theory which reduces
to the recently found New Massive Gravity (NMG) at the quadratic level in the
small curvature expansion and at the cubic order reproduces the deformation of
NMG obtained from AdS/CFT. Our action provides a remarkable extension of NMG to
all orders in the curvature, and might define a consistent quantum gravity.
