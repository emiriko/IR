Thermal emission from binary grating on SiC wafer supported by
phonon-polaritons is analyzed. The structure is comprised of homogeneous
grating domains, whose orientation is parallel and perpendicular to the x-axis.
The dispersion relation of the emitted light corresponds to translation
symmetry of the structure.
