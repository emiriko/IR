75As-zero-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and nuclear quadrupole
resonance (NQR) measurements are performed on CaFe2As2 under pressure. At P =
4.7 and 10.8 kbar, the temperature dependences of nuclear-spin-lattice
relaxation rate (1/T1) measured in the tetragonal phase show no coherence peak
just below Tc(P) and decrease with decreasing temperature. The
superconductivity is gapless at P = 4.7 kbar but evolves to that with multiple
gaps at P = 10.8 kbar. We find that the superconductivity appears near a
quantum critical point under pressures in the range 4.7 kbar < P < 10.8 kbar.
Both electron correlation and superconductivity disappear in the collapsed
tetragonal phase. A systematic study under pressure indicates that electron
correlations play a vital role in forming Cooper pairs in this compound.
