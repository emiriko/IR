Artificial immune systems have previously been applied to the problem of
intrusion detection. The aim of this research is to develop an intrusion
detection system based on the function of Dendritic Cells (DCs). DCs are
antigen presenting cells and key to activation of the human immune system,
behaviour which has been abstracted to form the Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA).
In algorithmic terms, individual DCs perform multi-sensor data fusion,
asynchronously correlating the the fused data signals with a secondary data
stream. Aggregate output of a population of cells, is analysed and forms the
basis of an anomaly detection system. In this paper the DCA is applied to the
detection of outgoing port scans using TCP SYN packets. Results show that
detection can be achieved with the DCA, yet some false positives can be
encountered when simultaneously scanning and using other network services.
Suggestions are made for using adaptive signals to alleviate this uncovered
problem.
