This paper introduces an evaluation methodologies for the e-learners'
behaviour that will be a feedback to the decision makers in e-learning system.
Learner's profile plays a crucial role in the evaluation process to improve the
e-learning process performance. The work focuses on the clustering of the
e-learners based on their behaviour into specific categories that represent the
learner's profiles. The learners' classes named as regular, workers, casual,
bad, and absent. The work may answer the question of how to return bad students
to be regular ones. The work presented the use of different fuzzy clustering
techniques as fuzzy c-means and kernelized fuzzy c-means to find the learners'
categories and predict their profiles. The paper presents the main phases as
data description, preparation, features selection, and the experiments design
using different fuzzy clustering models. Analysis of the obtained results and
comparison with the real world behavior of those learners proved that there is
a match with percentage of 78%. Fuzzy clustering reflects the learners'
behavior more than crisp clustering. Comparison between FCM and KFCM proved
that the KFCM is much better than FCM in predicting the learners' behaviour.
