The first one-proton self-excited oscillator (SEO) and one-proton feedback
cooling are demonstrated. In a Penning trap with a large magnetic gradient, the
SEO frequency is resolved to the high precision needed to detect a one-proton
spin flip. This is after undamped magnetron motion is sideband-cooled to a 14
mK theoretical limit, and despite random frequency shifts (larger than those
from a spin flip) that take place every time sideband cooling is applied in the
gradient. The observations open a possible path towards a million-fold improved
comparison of the antiproton and proton magnetic moments.
