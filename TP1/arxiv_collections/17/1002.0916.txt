In this paper, we report fast calculation of a computer-generated-hologram
using a new architecture of the HD5000 series GPU (RV870) made by AMD and its
new software development environment, OpenCL. Using a RV870 GPU and OpenCL, we
can calculate 1,920 * 1,024 resolution of a CGH from a 3D object consisting of
1,024 points in 30 milli-seconds. The calculation speed realizes a speed
approximately two times faster than that of a GPU made by NVIDIA.
