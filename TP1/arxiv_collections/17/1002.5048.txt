Context: The Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities generated by the deceleration of a
supernova remnant during the ejecta-dominated phase are known to produce
finger-like structures in the matter distribution which modify the geometry of
the remnant. The morphology of supernova remnants is also expected to be
modified when efficient particle acceleration occurs at their shocks. Aims: The
impact of the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities from the ejecta-dominated to the
Sedov-Taylor phase is investigated over one octant of the supernova remnant. We
also study the effect of efficient particle acceleration at the forward shock
on the growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. Methods: We modified the
Adaptive Mesh Refinement code RAMSES to study with hydrodynamic numerical
simulations the evolution of supernova remnants in the framework of an
expanding reference frame. The adiabatic index of a relativistic gas between
the forward shock and the contact discontinuity mimics the presence of
accelerated particles. Results: The great advantage of the super-comoving
coordinate system adopted here is that it minimizes numerical diffusion at the
contact discontinuity, since it is stationary with respect to the grid. We
propose an accurate expression for the growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor structures
that connects smoothly the early growth to the asymptotic self-similar
behaviour. Conclusions: The development of the Rayleigh-Taylor structures is
affected, although not drastically, if the blast wave is dominated by cosmic
rays. The amount of ejecta that makes it into the shocked interstellar medium
is smaller in the latter case. If acceleration occurs at both shocks the extent
of the Rayleigh-Taylor structures is similar but the reverse shock is strongly
perturbed.
