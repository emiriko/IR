Dr. Hatchwell [2010] has proposed that the BAK1 gene variants were likely due
to sequencing of a processed gene on chromosome 20. However, in response, Dr.
Gottlieb and co-authors [2010] have argued that "some but not all of the
sequence changes present in the BAK1 sequence of our abdominal aorta samples
are also present in the chromosome 20 BAK1 sequence. However, all the AAA and
AA cDNA samples are identical to each other and different from chromosome 20
BAK1 sequence at amino acids 2 and 145". I have been following this discussion
because I have independently reached almost the same conclusion as Dr.
Hatchwell did [Yamagishi, 2009], and, unfortunately, the response from Dr.
Gottlieb and his co-authors seems to me to be unsatisfactory for the reasons
