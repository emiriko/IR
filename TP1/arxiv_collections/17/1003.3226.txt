In the present paper we study the phase diagram of the Heisenberg model on
the honeycomb lattice with antiferromagnetic interactions up to third neighbors
along the line $J_2=J_3$ that include the point $J_2=J_3=J_1/2$, corresponding
to the highly frustrated point where the classical ground state has macroscopic
degeneracy. Using the Linear Spin-Wave, Schwinger boson technique followed by a
mean field decoupling and exact diagonalization for small systems we find an
intermediate phase with a spin gap and short range N\'eel correlations in the
strong quantum limit (S=1/2). All techniques provide consistent results which
allow us to predict the existence of a quantum disordered phase, which may have
been observed in recent high-field ESR measurements in manganites.
