Consider a string of N+1 damped oscillators moving on the line of which the
motion of the first (called the "leader") is independent of the others. Each of
the followers `observes' the relative velocity and position of only its nearest
neighbors. Inasmuch as these are different from 0, this information is then
used to determine its own acceleration. Fix all parameters except the number N
in such a way that the system is asymptotically stable. Now as N tends tends we
consider the following problem. At t=0 the leader gets kicked and starts moving
with unit velocity away from the flock. Due to asymptotic stability the
followers will eventually fall in behind the leader and travel each at its own
predetermined distance from the leader. In this note we conjecture that before
equilibrium ensues, the perturbations to the orbit of the last oscillator grow
exponentially in N except when there is a symmetry in the interactions and the
growth is then linear in N. There are two cases. We prove the conjecture in one
case, and give a strong heuristic argument in the other.
