We examine the quantum phase diagram of the fractional quantum Hall effect
(FQHE) in the lowest two Landau levels in half-filled bilayer structures as a
function of tunneling strength and layer separation, i.e., we revisit the
lowest Landau level filling factor 1/2 bilayer problem and make new predictions
involving bilayers in the half-filled second Landau level (i.e., filling factor
5/2). Using numerical exact diagonalization we investigate the important
question of whether this system supports a FQHE described by the non-Abelian
Moore-Read Pfaffian state in the strong tunneling regime. In the lowest Landau
level, we find that although in principle, increasing (decreasing) tunneling
strength (layer separation) could lead to a transition from the Abelian
two-component Halperin 331 to non-Abelian one-component Moore-Read Pfaffian
state, the FQHE excitation gap is relatively small in the lowest Landau level
Pfaffian regime--we establish that all so far observed FQHE states in
half-filled lowest Landau level bilayers are most likely described by the
Abelian Halperin 331 state. In the second Landau level we make the prediction
that bilayer structures would manifest two distinct branches of incompressible
FQHE corresponding to the Abelian 331 state (at moderate to low tunneling and
large layer separation) and the non-Abelian Moore-Read Pfaffian state (at large
tunneling and small layer separation). The observation of these two FQHE
branches and the possible quantum phase transition between them will be
compelling evidence supporting the existence of the non-Abelian Moore-Read
Pfaffian state in the second Landau level. We discuss our results in the
context of existing experiments and theoretical works.
