Electronic and magnetic properties of VnBzn+1 sandwich clusters are
investigated using density functional theory. Growth model is applied to
investigate the property change of Vanadium-Benzene sandwich clusters. Our
results show that, for n<8, all V ions tend to put their spin in ferromagnetic
state, and that the magnetic moments of VnBzn+1 increase linearly with n.
Finite-size effects induce a nonmonotonous behavior of the VnBzn+1 magnetic
properties. In the case of n=8, the electronic properties of VnBzn+1 has the
same characteristics with the counterpart of Vanadium-Benzene infinite wire,
hence, the critical length of VnBzn+1 is defined eight. Furthermore, our
results demonstrate that Vanadium-Benzene infinite wire is a proper material
for spin polarized transport and has a high stability in the presence of
external electronic and magnetic fields.
