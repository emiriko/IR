The impact of the type of implementation is considered on the IR-UWB channel
capacity. This study is lead for analog and mostly digital implementation. Key
parameters and theirs impacts on the channel capacity are exposed in each case:
data converters for mostly digital implementations and pulse generators
capabilities for analog implementations. These two implementations are compared
from a data rate point of view. Their behaviors regarding an increase of the
operating frequency are also studied
