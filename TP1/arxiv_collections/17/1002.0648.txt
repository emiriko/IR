The mass neutrino oscillation in Kerr-Newman(K-N) space-time is studied in
the plane $\theta=\theta_{0}$, and the general equations of oscillation phases
are given. The effect of the rotation and electric charge on the phase is
presented. Then, we consider three special cases: (1) The neutrinos travel
along the geodesics with the angular momentum $L=aE$ in the equatorial plane.
(2) The neutrinos travel along the geodesics with L=0 in the equatorial plane.
(3) The neutrinos travel along the radial geodesics at the direction
$\theta=0$. At last, we calculate the proper oscillation length in the K-N
space time. The effect of the gravitational field on the oscillation length is
embodied in the gravitational red shift factor. When the neutrino travels out
of the gravitational field, the blue shift of the oscillation length takes
place. We discussed the variation of the oscillation length influenced by the
gravitational field strength, the rotation $a^{2}$ and charge $Q$.
