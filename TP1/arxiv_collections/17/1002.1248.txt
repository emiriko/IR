Longitudinal and transverse parton distributions for pion and nucleon are
calculated from hadron vertexes obtained by a study of form factors within
relativistic quark models. The relevance of the one-gluon-exchange dominance at
short range for the behavior of the form factors at large momentum transfer and
of the parton distributions at the end points is stressed.
