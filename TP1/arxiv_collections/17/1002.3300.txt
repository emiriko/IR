The temporal dynamics of the quantum Zakharov equations (QZEs) in one spatial
dimension, which describes the nonlinear interaction of quantum Langmuir waves
(QLWs) and quantum ion-acoustic waves (QIAWs) is revisited by considering their
solution as a superposition of three interacting wave modes in Fourier space.
Previous results in the literature are modified and rectified. Periodic,
chaotic as well as hyperchaotic behaviors of the Fourier-mode amplitudes are
identified by the analysis of Lyapunov exponent spectra and the power spectrum.
The periodic route to chaos is explained through an one-parameter bifurcation
analysis. The system is shown to be destabilized via a supercritical
Hopf-bifurcation. The adiabatic limits of the fully spatio-temporal and reduced
systems are compared from the viewpoint of integrability properties.
