Integrability conditions for Lie systems are related to reduction or
transformation processes. We here analyse a geometric method to construct
integrability conditions for Riccati equations following these approaches. This
approach provides us with a unified geometrical viewpoint that allows us to
analyse some previous works on the topic and explain new properties. Moreover,
this new approach can be straightforwardly generalised to describe
integrability conditions for any Lie system. Finally, we show the usefulness of
our treatment in order to study the problem of the linearisability of Riccati
equations.
