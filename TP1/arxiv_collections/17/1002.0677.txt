We introduce higher order polynomial deformations of $A_1$ Lie algebra. We
construct their unitary representations and the corresponding single-variable
differential operator realizations. We then use the results to obtain exact
(Bethe ansatz) solutions to a class of 2-mode boson systems, including the
Boson-Einstein Condensate models as special cases. Up to an overall factor, the
eigenfunctions of the 2-mode boson systems are given by polynomials whose roots
are solutions of the associated Bethe ansatz equations. The corresponding
eigenvalues are expressed in terms of these roots. We also establish the
spectral equivalence between the BEC models and certain quasi-exactly solvable
Sch\"ordinger potentials.
