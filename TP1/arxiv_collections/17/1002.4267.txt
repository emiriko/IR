A logical foundation of equilibrium state density functional theory in a
Kohn-Sham type formulation is presented on the basis of Mermin's treatment of
the grand canonical state. it is simpler and more satisfactory compared to the
usual derivation of ground state theory, and free of remaining open points of
the latter. It may in particular be relevant with respect to cases of
spontaneous symmetry breaking like non-collinear magnetism and orbital order.
