The Nash equilibrium point of the transmission probabilities in a slotted
ALOHA system with selfish nodes is analyzed. The system consists of a finite
number of heterogeneous nodes, each trying to minimize its average transmission
probability (or power investment) selfishly while meeting its average
throughput demand over the shared wireless channel to a common base station
(BS). We use a game-theoretic approach to analyze the network under two
reception models: one is called power capture, the other is called signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) capture. It is shown that, in some
situations, Braess-like paradoxes may occur. That is, the performance of the
system may become worse instead of better when channel state information (CSI)
is available at the selfish nodes. In particular, for homogeneous nodes, we
analytically present that Braess-like paradoxes occur in the power capture
model, and in the SINR capture model with the capture ratio larger than one and
the noise to signal ratio sufficiently small.
