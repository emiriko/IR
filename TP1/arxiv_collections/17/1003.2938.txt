We present measurements of the ep->ep pi^0 cross section extracted at two
values of four-momentum transfer Q^2=1.9 GeV^2 and Q^2=2.3 GeV^2 at Jefferson
Lab Hall A. The kinematic range allows to study the evolution of the extracted
hadronic tensor as a function of Q^2 and W. Results will be confronted with
Regge inspired calculations and GPD predictions. An intepretation of our data
within the framework of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering has also been
attempted.
