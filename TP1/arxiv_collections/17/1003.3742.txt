It is shown, by DFT calculations, that the uniform functionalization of upper
layer of graphite by hydrogen or fluorine does not change essentially its
bonding energy with the underlying layers, whereas the functionalization by
phenyl groups decreases the bonding energy by a factor of approximately ten.
This means that the functionalized monolayer in the latter case can be easily
separated by mild sonication. According to our computational results, such
layers can be cleaned up to pure graphene, as well as functionalized further up
to 25% coverage, without essential difficulties. The energy gap within the
interval from 0.5 to 3 eV can be obtained by such one-side funtionalization
using different chemical species.
