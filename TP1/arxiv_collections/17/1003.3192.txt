A simple dynamical model over a discrete classical state space is presented.
In a certain limit, it reduces to one in a class of models subsuming Bell's
field-theoretic version of Bohmian mechanics. But it exhibits the massive
parallelism native to quantum mechanics only as an emergent phenomenon, in
contrast with Bell's and other hidden variable theories. While still non-local
in its dynamics, the model thus restores our ability to regard a system as a
combination of separate, localized parts, at the price of admitting
non-Markovian dynamics.
