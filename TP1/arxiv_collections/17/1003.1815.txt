Automorphisms of the canonical core UHF-subalgebra F_n of the Cuntz algebra
O_n do not necessarily extend to automorphisms of O_n. Simple examples are
discussed within the family of infinite tensor products of (inner)
automorphisms of the matrix algebras M_n. In that case, necessary and
sufficient conditions for the extension property are presented. It is also
addressed the problem of extending to O_n the automorphisms of the diagonal
D_n, which is a regular MASA with Cantor spectrum. In particular, it is shown
the existence of product-type automorphisms of D_n that are not extensible to
(possibly proper) endomorphisms of O_n.
