Our previous identification and spectroscopic confirmation of 431 faint, new
planetary nebulae in the central 25 deg^2 region of the LMC permits us to now
examine the shape of the LMC Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function (PNLF)
through an unprecedented 10 magnitude range. The majority of our newly
discovered and previously known PNe were observed using the 2dF, multi-object
fibre spectroscopy system on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope and the
FLAMES multi-object spectrograph on the 8-m VLT. We present reliable [OIII]5007
and H-beta flux estimates based on calibrations to well established PN fluxes
from previous surveys and spectroscopic standard stars. The bright cutoff (M*)
of the PNLF is found by fitting a truncated exponential curve to the bright end
of the PNLF over a 3.4 magnitude range. This cutoff is used to estimate a new
distance modulus of 18.46 to the LMC, in close agreement with previous PNLF
studies and the best estimates by other indicators. The bright end cutoff is
robust to small samples of bright PNe since significantly increased PN samples
do not change this fiducial. We then fit a truncated exponential curve directly
to the bright end of the function over a 6 magnitude range and test the curve's
ability to indicate the position of M*. Because of the significant increase in
the number of LMC PN, the shape of the PNLF is now examined in greater detail
than has previously been possible. Through cumulative functions, the new LMC
PNLF is compared to those from the SMC and a new deep local Galactic sample
revealing the effects of incompleteness. The new [OIII]5007 LMC PNLF is then
compared to our new H-beta LMC PNLF using calibrated and measured fluxes for
the same objects, revealing the effects of metallicity on the [OIII]5007 line.
