Computing as you know it is about to change, your applications and documents
are going to move from the desktop into the cloud. I'm talking about cloud
computing, where applications and files are hosted on a "cloud" consisting of
thousands of computers and servers, all linked together and accessible via the
Internet. With cloud computing, everything you do is now web based instead of
being desktop based. You can access all your programs and documents from any
computer that's connected to the Internet. How will cloud computing change the
way you work? For one thing, you're no longer tied to a single computer. You
can take your work anywhere because it's always accessible via the web. In
addition, cloud computing facilitates group collaboration, as all group members
can access the same programs and documents from wherever they happen to be
located. Cloud computing might sound far-fetched, but chances are you're
already using some cloud applications. If you're using a web-based email
program, such as Gmail or Hotmail, you're computing in the cloud. If you're
using a web-based application such as Google Calendar or Apple Mobile Me,
you're computing in the cloud. If you're using a file- or photo-sharing site,
such as Flickr or Picasa Web Albums, you're computing in the cloud. It's the
technology of the future, available to use today.
