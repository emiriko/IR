We introduce a method for calculating the probability density function (PDF)
of a turbulent density field in three dimensions using only information
contained in the projected two-dimensional column density field. We test the
method by applying it to numerical simulations of hydrodynamic and
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in molecular clouds. To a good approximation,
the PDF of log(normalised column density) is a compressed, shifted version of
the PDF of log(normalised density). The degree of compression can be determined
observationally from the column density power spectrum, under the assumption of
statistical isotropy of the turbulence.
