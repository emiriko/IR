A graph $G$ is pseudo 2--factor isomorphic if the parity of the number of
cycles in a 2--factor is the same for all 2--factors of $G$. In \cite{ADJLS} we
proved that pseudo 2--factor isomorphic $k$--regular bipartite graphs exist
only for $k \le 3$. In this paper we generalize this result for regular graphs
which are not necessarily bipartite. We also introduce strongly pseudo
2--factor isomorphic graphs and we prove that pseudo and strongly pseudo
2--factor isomorphic 2k--regular graphs and $k$--regular digraphs do not exist
for $k\geq 4$. Moreover, we present constructions of infinite families of
regular graphs in these classes. In particular we show that the family of
Flower snarks is strongly pseudo 2--factor isomorphic but not 2--factor
isomorphic and we conjecture that, together with the Petersen and the
Blanu\v{s}a2 graphs, they are the only cyclically 4--edge--connected snarks for
which each 2--factor contains only cycles of odd length.
