The monochromatic illumination system is constructed to carry out in situ
measurements of the response function of the mosaicked CCD imager used in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The system is outlined and the results of the
measurements, mostly during the first 6 years of the SDSS, are described. We
present the reference response functions for the five colour passbands derived
from these measurements, and discuss column to column variations and variations
in time, and also their effects on photometry. We also discuss the effect
arising from various, slightly different response functions of the associated
detector systems that were used to give SDSS photometry. We show that the
calibration procedures of SDSS remove these variations reasonably well with the
resulting final errors from variant response functions being unlikely to be
larger than 0.01 mag for g, r, i, and z bands over the entire duration of the
survey. The considerable aging effect is uncovered in the u band, the response
function showing a 30% decrease in the throughput in the short wavelength side
during the survey years, which potentially causes a systematic error in
photometry. The aging effect is consistent with variation of the instrumental
sensitivity in u-band, which is calibrated out. The expected colour variation
is consistent with measured colour variation in the catalog of repeated
photometry. The colour variation is delta (u-g) ~ 0.01 for most stars, and at
most delta (u-g) ~ 0.02 mag for those with extreme colours. We verified in the
final catalogue that no systematic variations in excess of 0.01 mag are
detected in the photometry which can be ascribed to aging and/or seasonal
effects except for the secular u-g colour variation for stars with extreme
colours.
