It was found that the most simple analysis in the linear \sigma- model, where
the sigma meson couples in vacuum to two virtual pions, predicted the most
typical values for the \sigma-mass and total decay width as 486+/-7MeV and
340+/-20MeV respectively. It was demonstrate, via statistical analysis, that
the experimental values reported by the Fermilab (E791) Collaboration
represents approximately 56% of the values predicted by the linear \sigma-
model together with the Breit-Wigner formalism. Additional, it was created the
spectral function, in terms of the \sigma-meson regularized self-energy, which
is consistently with the Breit-Wigner distribution and it reproduces reasonably
well the total width and observable mass given by the Fermilab (E791)
Collaboration and Dalitz plot. The results are a strong evidence that the
\sigma- meson can be considered as a two-pion resonance.
