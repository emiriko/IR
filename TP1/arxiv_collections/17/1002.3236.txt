We continue the study of the anti-Hermitian structures of general natural
lift type on the tangent bundles. We get the conditions under which these
structures are in the eight classes obtained by Ganchev and Borisov. We
complete the characterization of the general natural anti-Kahlerian structures
on the tangent bundles with necessary and sufficient conditions, then we
present some results concerning the remaining classes.
