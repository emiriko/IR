The recently discovered FeAs-based superconductors are a new, promising set
of materials for both technological as well as basic research. They offer
transition temperatures as high as 55 K as well as essentially isotropic and
extremely large upper, superconducting critical fields in excess of 40 T at 20
K. In addition they may well provide insight into exotic superconductivity that
extends beyond just FeAs-based superconductivity, perhaps even shedding light
on the still perplexing CuO-based high-Tc materials. Whereas superconductivity
can be induced in the RFeAsO (R = rare earth) and AEFe2As2 (AE = Ba, Sr, Ca))
families by a number of means, transition metal doping of BaFe2As2, e.g.
Ba(Fe1-xTMx)2As2, offers the easiest experimental access to a wide set of
materials. In this review we present an overview and summary of the effect of
TM doping (TM = Co, Ni, Cu, Pd, and Rh) on BaFe2As2. The resulting phase
diagrams reveal the nature of the interaction between the structural, magnetic
and superconducting phase transitions in these compounds and delineate a region
of phase space that allows for the stabilization of superconductivity.
