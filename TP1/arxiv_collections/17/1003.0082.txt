An analysis is made of the manner in which the cosmic ray intensity at Earth
has varied over its existence and its possible relevance to both the origin and
the evolution of life. Much of the analysis relates to the 'high energy' cosmic
rays ($E>10^{14}eV;=0.1PeV$) and their variability due to the changing
proximity of the solar system to supernova remnants which are generally
believed to be responsible for most cosmic rays up to PeV energies. It is
pointed out that, on a statistical basis, there will have been considerable
variations in the likely 100 My between the Earth's biosphere reaching
reasonable stability and the onset of very elementary life. Interestingly,
there is the increasingly strong possibility that PeV cosmic rays are
responsible for the initiation of terrestrial lightning strokes and the
possibility arises of considerable increases in the frequency of lightnings and
thereby the formation of some of the complex molecules which are the 'building
blocks of life'. Attention is also given to the well known generation of the
oxides of nitrogen by lightning strokes which are poisonous to animal life but
helpful to plant growth; here, too, the violent swings of cosmic ray
intensities may have had relevance to evolutionary changes. A particular
variant of the cosmic ray acceleration model, put forward by us, predicts an
increase in lightning rate in the past and this has been sought in Korean
historical records. Finally, the time dependence of the overall cosmic ray
intensity, which manifests itself mainly at sub-10 GeV energies, has been
examined. The relevance of cosmic rays to the 'global electrical circuit'
points to the importance of this concept.
