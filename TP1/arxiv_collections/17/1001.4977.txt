I compute the deconfinement order parameter for the SU(2) lattice gauge
theory, the Polyakov loop, using the fixed scale approach for two different
scales and show how one can obtain a physical, renormalized, order parameter.
The generalization to other gauge theories, including quenched or full QCD, is
straightforward.
