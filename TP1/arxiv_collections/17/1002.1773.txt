This article synthezises the most important results on the kinematics of
cuspidal manipulators i.e. nonredundant manipulators that can change posture
without meeting a singularity. The characteristic surfaces, the uniqueness
domains and the regions of feasible paths in the workspace are defined. Then,
several sufficient geometric conditions for a manipulator to be noncuspidal are
enumerated and a general necessary and sufficient condition for a manipulator
to be cuspidal is provided. An explicit DH-parameter-based condition for an
orthogonal manipulator to be cuspidal is derived. The full classification of 3R
orthogonal manipulators is provided and all types of cuspidal and noncuspidal
orthogonal manipulators are enumerated. Finally, some facts about cuspidal and
noncuspidal 6R manipulators are reported.
