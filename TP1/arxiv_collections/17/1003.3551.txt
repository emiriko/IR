We describe the fundamental difference between the nature of problems in
traditional physics and that of many problems arising today in systems biology
and other complex settings. The difference hinges on the much larger number of
a priori plausible alternative laws for explaining the phenomena at hand in the
latter case. An approach and a mathematical framework for prediction in this
hypothesis-rich regime are introduced.
