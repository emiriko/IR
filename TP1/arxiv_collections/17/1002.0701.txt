The Antares neutrino telescope, operating at 2.5 km depth in the
Mediterranean Sea, 40 km off the Toulon shore, represents the world's largest
operational underwater neutrino telescope, optimized for the detection of
Cerenkov light produced by neutrino-induced muons. The main goal of Antares is
the search of high energy neutrinos from astrophysical point or transient
sources. Antares is taking data in its full 12 lines configuration since May
2008: in this paper we collect the 16 contributions by the ANTARES
collaboration that were submitted to the 31th International Cosmic Ray
Conference ICRC 2009.
  These contributions includes the detector performances, the first preliminary
results on neutrino events and the current physics analysis including the
sensitivity to point like sources, the possibility to detect high energy
neutrinos in coincidence with GRB, the search for dark matter or exotic
particles.
