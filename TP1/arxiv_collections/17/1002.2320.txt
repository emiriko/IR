A new microburst graphical guidance product has been developed that employs
data from the Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) model. Prototypical conditions for
microbursts include a steep temperature lapse rate and decreasing humidity with
decreasing height in the boundary layer. Thus, the graphical guidance product
incorporates boundary layer temperature lapse rate and vertical relative
humidity difference, important factors in initiating and sustaining a
convective downdraft. The new guidance product demonstrated effectiveness in
indicating favorable conditions for downbursts during the 2009 convective
season.
