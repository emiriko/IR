Presently the double pulsar allows for the measurement of six post-Keplerian
parameters. In addition, its double-line nature gives access to the projected
semi-major axes of both orbits. We use this wealth of information to pose some
very general restrictions on a wide class of conservative and semi-conservative
theories of gravity.
