The Parker or field line tangling model of coronal heating is investigated
through long-time high-resolution simulations of the dynamics of a coronal loop
in cartesian geometry within the framework of reduced magnetohydrodynamics
(RMHD). Slow photospheric motions induce a Poynting flux which saturates by
driving an anisotropic turbulent cascade dominated by magnetic energy and
characterized by current sheets elongated along the axial magnetic field.
Increasing the value of the axial magnetic field different regimes of MHD
turbulence develop with a bearing on coronal heating rates. In physical space
magnetic field lines at the scale of convection cells appear only slightly
bended in agreement with observations of large loops of current (E)UV and X-ray
imagers.
