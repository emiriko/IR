We calculated numerically the fractal dimension of the boundaries of the
Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters of the $q$-state Potts model for integer and
non-integer values of $q$ on the square lattice.
  In addition we calculated with high accuracy the fractal dimension of the
boundary points of the same clusters on the square domain. Our calculation
confirms that this curves can be described by SLE$_{\kappa}$.
