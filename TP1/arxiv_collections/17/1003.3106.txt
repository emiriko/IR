We demonstrate experimentally the existence of three-wave resonant
interaction solitary triplets in quadratic media. Stable velocity-locked
bright-dark-bright spatial solitary triplets, determined by the balance between
the energy exchange rates and the velocity mismatch between the interacting
waves, are excited in a KTP crystal.
