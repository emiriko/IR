Phase maps, of the earth's electric field monitored at PYR and ATH monitoring
sites in Greece, were compiled for two distinct oscillating earth's electric
field components long before, during and after the Nafpactos EQs in Greece
(January 18th and 22nd of 2010, Ms = 5.7 / 5.6R). The selected periods of the
earth's oscillating electric field were the T = 1 day and T = 14 days. The
specific components were selected due to the fact that they are highly depended
from the corresponding same period tidal waves (M1, K1, P1). It was found that
the "strange attractor like" electric seismic precursor preceded the main
seismic event for four days for the case of T = 1 day, while a much longer
period of time (11 days) was observed for the case of T = 14 days. It seems
that the shorter the used wavelength is the shorter is the predictive time
window regarding the pending seismic event. The present work replicated earlier
similar results obtained by the same methodology for past large seismic events
in Greece and have already been presented in the same database. The present
methodology seems to be a promising tool in short-term (in time) earthquake
prediction.
