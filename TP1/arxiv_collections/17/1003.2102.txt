We present a numerical study of the reversals and reorientations of the large
scale circulation (LSC) of convective fluid in a cylindrical container of
aspect ratio one. We take Prandtl number to be 0.7 and Rayleigh numbers in the
range from $6\times10^5$ to $3\times10^7$. It is observed that the reversals of
the LSC are induced by its reorientation along the azimuthal direction, which
are quantified using the phases of the first Fourier mode of the vertical
velocity measured near the lateral surface in the mid plane. During a
``complete reversal'', the above phase changes by around $180^0$ leading to
reversals of the vertical velocity at all the probes. On the contrary, the
vertical velocity reverses only at some of the probes during a ``partial
reversal'' with phase change other than $180^0$. Numerically we observe
rotation-led and cessation-led reorientations, in agreement with earlier
experimental results. The ratio of the amplitude of the second Fourier mode and
the first Fourier mode rises sharply during the cessation-led reorientations.
This observation is consistent with the quadrupolar dominant temperature
profile observed during the cessations. We also observe reorientations
involving double cessation.
