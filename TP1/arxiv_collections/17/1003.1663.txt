We report the discovery of the second compact elliptical (cE) galaxy
SDSSJ150634.27+013331.6 in the nearby NGC5846 group by the Virtual Observatory
(VO) workflow . This object (M_B = -15.98 mag, R_e = 0.24 kpc) becomes the
fifth cE where the spatially-resolved kinematics and stellar populations can be
obtained. We used archival HST WFPC2 images to demonstrate that its light
profile has a two-component structure, and integrated photometry from GALEX,
SDSS, UKIDSS, and Spitzer to build the multi-wavelength SED to constraint the
star formation history (SFH). We observed this galaxy with the PMAS IFU
spectrograph at the Calar-Alto 3.5m telescope and obtained two-dimensional maps
of its kinematics and stellar population properties using the full-spectral
fitting technique. Its structural, dynamical and stellar population properties
suggest that it had a massive progenitor heavily tidally stripped by NGC5846.
