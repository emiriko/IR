Infinite statistics in which all representations of the symmetric group can
occur is known as a special case of quon theory. Our previous work has built a
relativistic quantum field theory which allows interactions involving infinite
statistics particles. In this paper, a more detailed analysis of this theory is
available. Topics discussed include cluster decomposition, CPT symmetry and
renormalization.
