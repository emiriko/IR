In this paper, research on AI based modeling technique to optimize
development of new alloys with necessitated improvements in properties and
chemical mixture over existing alloys as per functional requirements of product
is done. The current research work novels AI in lieu of predictions to
establish association between material and product customary. Advanced
computational simulation techniques like CFD, FEA interrogations are made
viable to authenticate product dynamics in context to experimental
investigations. Accordingly, the current research is focused towards binding
relationships between material design and product design domains. The input to
feed forward back propagation prediction network model constitutes of material
design features. Parameters relevant to product design strategies are furnished
as target outputs. The outcomes of ANN shows good sign of correlation between
material and product design domains. The study enriches a new path to
illustrate material factors at the time of new product development.
