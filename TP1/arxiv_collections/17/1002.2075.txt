We extend two results on Chow (semi-)stability to positive characteristics.
One is on the stability of non-singular projective hypersurfaces of degree
greater than 2, and the other is the criterion by Y. Lee in terms of log
canonical thresholds. Some properties of log-canonicity in positive
characteristics are discussed with a couple of examples, in connection with the
proof of the latter one. It is also proven in appendix that the sum of Chow
(semi-)stable cycles are again Chow (semi-)stable.
