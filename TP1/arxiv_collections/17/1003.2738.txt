The magnetotransport in single layer graphene has been experimentally
investigated in magnetic fields up to 18 T as a function of temperature. A
pronounced T-dependence is observed for T < 50 K, which is either metallic, or
insulating, depending on the filling factor nu. The metal-insulator transition
(MIT) occurs at nu_c ~ 0.65 and in the regime of the dissipative transport,
where the longitudinal resistance Rxx > R_K/2. The critical resistivity (Rxx
per square) is rho_xx(nu_c) ~ R_K/2 and is correlated with the appearance of
zero plateau in Hall conductivity sigma_xy(nu) and peaks in sigma_xx(nu). This
leads us to construct a universal low-T (n, B) phase diagram of this quantum
phase transition.
