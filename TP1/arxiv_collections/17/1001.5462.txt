Bimetallic rod-shaped nanomotors swim autonomously in hydrogen peroxide
solutions. Here we present a scaling analysis, computational simulations, and
experimental data that show that the nanomotor locomotion is driven by fluid
slip around the nanomotor surface due to electrical body forces. The body
forces are generated by a coupling of charge density and electric fields
induced by electrochemical reactions occurring on the nanomotor surface. We
describe the dependence of nanomotor motion on the nanomotor surface potential
and reaction-driven flux.
