Geometric phase phenomena in single neutrons have been observed in
polarimeter and interferometer experiments. Interacting with static and time
dependent magnetic fields, the state vectors acquire a geometric phase tied to
the evolution within spin subspace. In a polarimeter experiment the
non-additivity of quantum phases for mixed spin input states is observed. In a
Si perfect-crystal interferometer experiment appearance of geometric phases,
induced by interaction with an oscillating magnetic field, is verified. The
total system is characterized by an entangled state, consisting of neutron and
radiation fields, governed by a Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. In addition, the
influence of the geometric phase on a Bell measurement, expressed by the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, is studied. It is demonstrated
that the effect of geometric phase can be balanced by an appropriate change of
Bell angles.
