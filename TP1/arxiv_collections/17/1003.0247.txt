As well known, an electron will produce radiative reaction force when the
electron emits electromagnetism radiation. The electron radiative effect had
not been considered in Schr\"{o}dinger wave equation. In this paper, we give
the nonlinear quantum wave equations for the radiative electron and some
dissipative systems.
