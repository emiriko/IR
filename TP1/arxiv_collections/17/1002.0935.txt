A choreography describes a transaction in which several principals interact.
Since choreographies frequently describe business processes affecting
substantial assets, we need a security infrastructure in order to implement
them safely. As part of a line of work devoted to generating cryptoprotocols
from choreographies, we focus here on the execution models suited to the two
levels.
  We give a strand-style semantics for choreographies, and propose a special
execution model in which choreography-level messages are faithfully delivered
exactly once. We adapt this model to handle multiparty protocols in which some
participants may be compromised.
  At level of cryptoprotocols, we use the standard Dolev-Yao execution model,
with one alteration. Since many implementations use a "nonce cache" to discard
multiply delivered messages, we provide a semantics for at-most-once delivery.
