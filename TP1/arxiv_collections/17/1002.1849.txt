The atmospheres of evolved red giants are considerably influenced by
pulsations of the stellar interiors and developing stellar winds. The resulting
complex velocity fields severely affect molecular line profiles observable in
NIR spectra. With the help of model calculations the complex line formation
process in AGB atmospheres was explored with the focus on velocity effects.
Furthermore, we aimed for atmospheric models which are able to quantitatively
reproduce line profile variations found in observed spectra of pulsating
late-type giants. Models describing pulsation-enhanced dust-driven winds were
used to compute synthetic spectra under the assumptions of chemical equilibrium
and LTE and by solving the radiative transfer in spherical geometry including
velocity effects. Radial velocities derived from Doppler-shifted synthetic line
profiles provide information on the gas velocities in the line-forming region
of the spectral features. On the basis of dynamic models we investigated in
detail the finding that various molecular features in AGB spectra originate at
different geometrical depths of the very extended atmospheres. We show that the
models are able to quantitatively reproduce the characteristic line profile
variations of lines sampling the deep photosphere. The global velocity fields
of typical LPVs are also realistically reproduced. Possible reasons for
discrepancies concerning other modelling results are outlined. In addition, we
present a model showing variations of CO dv=3 line profiles comparable to
observed spectra of SRVs and discuss that the non-occurence of line doubling in
these objects may be due to a density effect. The results of our line profile
modelling are another indication that the dynamic models studied here are
approaching a realistic representation of the outer layers of AGB stars.
