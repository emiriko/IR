In these lectures I focus on early universe models which can explain the
currently observed structure on large scales. I begin with a survey of
inflationary cosmology, the current paradigm for understanding the origin of
the universe as we observe it today. I will discuss some progress and problems
in inflationary cosmology before moving on to a description of two alternative
scenarios - the Matter Bounce and String Gas Cosmology. All early universe
models connect to observations via the evolution of cosmological perturbations
- a topic which will be discussed in detail in these lectures.
