Random walks describe diffusion processes, where movement at every time step
is restricted to only the neighbouring locations. We construct a quantum random
walk algorithm, based on discretisation of the Dirac evolution operator
inspired by staggered lattice fermions. We use it to investigate the spatial
search problem, i.e. finding a marked vertex on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic
lattice. The restriction on movement hardly matters for $d>2$, and scaling
behaviour close to Grover's optimal algorithm (which has no restriction on
movement) can be achieved. Using numerical simulations, we optimise the
proportionality constants of the scaling behaviour, and demonstrate the
approach to that for Grover's algorithm (equivalent to the mean field theory or
the $d\to\infty$ limit). In particular, the scaling behaviour for $d=3$ is only
about 25% higher than the optimal $d\to\infty$ value.
