Living cells provide a fluctuating, out-of-equilibrium environment in which
genes must coordinate cellular function. DNA looping, which is a common means
of regulating transcription, is very much a stochastic process; the loops arise
from the thermal motion of the DNA and other fluctuations of the cellular
environment. We present single-molecule measurements of DNA loop formation and
breakdown when an artificial fluctuating force, applied to mimic a fluctuating
cellular environment, is imposed on the DNA. We show that loop formation is
greatly enhanced in the presence of noise of only a fraction of $k_B T$, yet
find that hypothetical regulatory schemes that employ mechanical tension in the
DNA--as a sensitive switch to control transcription--can be surprisingly robust
due to a fortuitous cancellation of noise effects.
