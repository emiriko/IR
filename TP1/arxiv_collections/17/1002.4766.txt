This paper presents a review of the methods of the science of networks with
an application to the field of tourism studies. The basic definitions and
computational techniques are described and a case study (Elba, Italy) used to
illustrate the effect of network typology on information diffusion. A static
structural characterization of the network formed by destination stakeholders
is derived from stakeholder interviews and website link analysis. This is
followed by a dynamic analysis of the information diffusion process within the
destination demonstrating that stakeholder cohesion and adaptive capacity have
a positive effect on information diffusion. The outcomes and the implications
of this analysis for improving destination management are discussed.
