This paper contains a presentation of analytical solution of the problem of
calculating the places and moments of intersection of satellite trajectories
with elements of the Earth's magnetosphere (bow shock and magnetopause). The
satellite motion is presented in a Kepler's approximation. Magnetopause and bow
shock are described by second-order surfaces- elliptic paraboloides. These
surfaces are employed as situational conditions for determining the points of
intersection they have (if any) with the satellite trajectory. The situational
condition is herein transformed into the plane of Kepler's orbit, thereafter it
is reduced to a second-order plane curve- quadric (ellipse or parabola). The
solution of this system, containing the equation of this curve and Kepler's
ellipse equation, allows determining the places where orbits intersect with the
magnetopause or the bow shock. The solution of this system is suggested to be
given by reducing the system to a fourth-order equation.
