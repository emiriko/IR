We study dynamics of a ball moving in gravitational field and colliding with
a moving table. The motion of the limiter is assumed as periodic with piecewise
constant velocity - it is assumed that the table moves up with a constant
velocity and then moves down with another constant velocity. The Poincare map,
describing evolution from an impact to the next impact, is derived and
scenarios of transition to chaotic dynamics are investigated analytically.
