Assuming the existence of a preferred aether frame and the anisotropy of the
one-way speed of light in platforms different from the aether frame, we derive
the space and time transformations relative to bodies moving in any direction
of space and not only in the direction of the common x-axis of the co-ordinate
systems under consideration. Taking for granted length contraction and clock
retardation, we show that the experimental space-time transformations result
from measurement distortions due to the fact that the length of the rods and
the frequency of the clocks, used for the measure, do not have a constant value
as a result of their motion through the aether, and because the standard
synchronization procedures are affected by a synchronism discrepancy effect.
When the motion of bodies is aligned along the common x-axis, the
transformations assume the same mathematical form as the conventional
transformations. However, their meaning is quite different because they have
been derived on the basis of very different assumptions, and they arise from
the measurement distortions mentioned above. Therefore they conceal hidden
variables which are the true transformations.
