We consider the question of how to distinguish quantum from classical
transport through nanostructures. To address this issue we have derived two
inequalities for temporal correlations in nonequilibrium transport in
nanostructures weakly coupled to leads. The first inequality concerns local
charge measurements and is of general validity; the second concerns the current
flow through the device and is relevant for double quantum dots. Violation of
either of these inequalities indicates that physics beyond that of a classical
Markovian model is occurring in the nanostructure.
