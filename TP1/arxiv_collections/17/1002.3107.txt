We propose and test a wavelet transform modulus maxima method for the au-
tomated detection and extraction of coronal loops in extreme ultraviolet images
of the solar corona. This method decomposes an image into a number of size
scales and tracks enhanced power along each ridge corresponding to a coronal
loop at each scale. We compare the results across scales and suggest the
optimum set of parameters to maximise completeness while minimising detection
of noise. For a test coronal image, we compare the global statistics (e.g.,
number of loops at each length) to previous automated coronal-loop detection
algorithms.
