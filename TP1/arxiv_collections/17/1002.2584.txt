We examine the magnetic phase diagram of iron pnictides using a five band
model. For the intermediate values of the interaction expected to hold in the
iron pnictides, we find a metallic low moment state characterized by
antiparallel orbital magnetic moments. The anisotropy of the interorbital
hopping amplitudes is the key to understanding this low moment state. This
state accounts for the small magnetization measured in undoped iron pnictides
and leads to the strong exchange anisotropy found in neutron experiments.
Orbital ordering is concomitant with magnetism and produces the large zx
orbital weight seen at Gamma in photoemission experiments.
