In this work we construct a general class of exactly solvable
non-relativistic bi-dimensional quantum systems with position-dependent masses
(PDM). These systems are isospectral to a given system with constant mass. The
case of a charged particle with a PDM interacting with an external magnetic
field is included in the present investigation. We apply the approach in order
to construct the SU(2) coherent states in some examples which are isospectral
to the two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator, and discuss the impact
of the introduction of special non-homogeneous external magnetic fields.
