We study the category of matrix factorizations for an isolated hypersurface
singularity. We compute the canonical bilinear form on the Hochschild homology
of this category. We find explicit expressions for the Chern character and the
boundary-bulk maps and derive an analog of the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula
for the Euler characteristic of the Hom-space between a pair of matrix
factorizations. We also establish G-equivariant versions of these results.
