In this paper, we propose a novel GLWF double layer EM cloak in the broad
frequency band. The GLWF double layer cloak consists of two sphere annular
layers, two type cloak materials are proposed and installed in its each layer,
respectively. The outer layer of the GL cloak has the invisible function in
broad frequency band, while its inner layer has the fully absorption and rapid
delay function. The GLWF double layer cloak overcomes the following
difficulties of the single layer PS cloak. (1) There exists no EM wavefield can
be excited inside the concealment of the PS cloak, the concealment of the PS
cloak is blind. Our GL double layer cloak recovered that the EM wave field can
be excited inside the concealment of the GL double layer cloak. (2) There is
exceeding light speed physical violation in PS cloak, its invisibility only in
very narrow frequency band. Our GLWF double layer cloak corrects the violation.
(3) The reciprocal law is satisfied in our GL double cloak media. However, the
PS cloak damaged the reciprocal law.. The simulations and comparisons of the EM
wave field propagation through the GLWF double cloak, GL double cloak and GL
double layer with PS outer layer are presented to show the advantages of the
GLWF double layer EM cloak The GL double layer cloaks are proposed by our GL EM
modeling and inversion.
  The 3D GL EM modeling simulations for the double layer cloak are presented.
