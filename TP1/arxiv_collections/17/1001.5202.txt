We study the effect of parameters uncertainties on a stochastic diffusion
model, in particular the impact on the pricing of contingent claims, thanks to
Dirichlet Forms methods. We apply recent techniques, developed by Bouleau, to
hedging procedures in order to compute the sensitivities of SDE trajectories
with respect to parameter perturbations. We show that this model can reproduce
a bid-ask spread. We also prove that, if the stochastic differential equation
admits a closed form representation, also the sensitivities have closed form
representations.
  We exhibit the case of log-normal diffusion and we show that this framework
foresees a smiled implied volatility surface coherent with historical data.
