Recently David Albert presented an argument that relativistic quantum
theories are non-narratable. That is, specifying the state on every space-like
hypersurface in a given foliation of space-time is not in general sufficient to
determine the states on other hypersurfaces, so the history of the universe
cannot be told as a narration of states at successive times. We show that the
system Albert examined to arrive at this conclusion violates cluster
decomposition of the S-matrix, a locality requirement satisfied by relativistic
quantum field theories. We formulate the general requirements for a system to
display non-narratability, and argue that a large class of systems satisfying
them violate the cluster decomposition principle.
