We summarize and combine direct measurements of the width of the W boson in
data collected by the Tevatron experiments CDF and D0 at Fermilab. Results from
CDF and D0 RunI (1992-1995) have been combined with the CDF 200 pb^-1 results
from the first period of RunII (2001-2004) and the recent 1 fb^-1 result in the
electron channel from D0 (2002-2006). The results are corrected for any
inconsistencies in parton distribution functions and assumptions about
electroweak parameters used in the different analyses. The resulting Tevatron
average for the width of the W boson is Gamma_W = 2,046 +- 49.
