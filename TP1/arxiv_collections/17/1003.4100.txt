For a quantum system with broken parity symmetry, selection rules can not
hold and cyclic transition structures are generated. With these
loop-transitions we discuss how to achieve inversionless gain of the probe
field by properly setting the control and auxiliary fields. Possible
implementations of our generic proposal with specific physical objects with
broken parities, e.g., superconducting circuits and chiral molecules, are also
discussed.
