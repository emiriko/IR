We study the effect exerted by the electrons on the flexural phonons in
graphene, accounting for the attractive interaction created by the exchange of
electron-hole excitations. Combining the self-consistent computation of the
phonon self-energy with renormalization group methods, we show that graphene
has two different phases corresponding to soft and strong renormalization of
the bending rigidity in the long-wavelength limit. In the first case, the
system may have an intermediate scale in which the phonon dispersion is
softened, but it manages finally to become increasingly rigid over large
distance scales. The strongly renormalized phase is closer however to critical
behavior, with an effective rigidity that becomes pinned in practice at very
small values, implying a very large susceptibility for the development of a
condensate of the flexural phonon field.
