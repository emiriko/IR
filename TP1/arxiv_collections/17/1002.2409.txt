Secure sum computation of private data inputs is an important component of
Secure Multi party Computation (SMC).In this paper we provide a protocol to
compute the sum of individual data inputs with zero probability of data
leakage. In our proposed protocol we break input of each party into number of
segments and change the arrangement of the parties such that in each round of
the computation the neighbors are changed. In this protocol it becomes
impossible for semi honest parties to know the private data of some other
party.
