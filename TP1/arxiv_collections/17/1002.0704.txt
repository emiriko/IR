We investigate the structure and mobility of dislocations in hcp 4He
crystals. In addition to fully characterizing the five elastic constants of
this system, we obtain direct insight into dislocation core structures on the
basal plane, which demonstrates a tendency toward dissociation into partial
dislocations. Moreover, our results suggest that intrinsic lattice resistance
is an essential factor in the mobility of these dislocations. This insight
sheds new light on the possible correlation between dislocation mobility and
the observed macroscopic behavior of crystalline 4He.
