We show that a differential algebraic group can be filtered by a finite
subnormal series of differential algebraic groups such that successive
quotients are almost simple, that is have no normal subgroups of the same type.
We give a uniqueness result, prove several properties of almost simple groups
and, in the ordinary differential case, classify almost simple linear
differential algebraic groups.
