The strong coupling constants between light vector mesons and octet-decuplet
baryons are calculated in framework of the light cone QCD sum rules, taking
into account SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking effects. It is shown that all
strong coupling constants can be represented in terms of a single universal
function. Size of the SU(3) symmetry breaking effects are estimated.
