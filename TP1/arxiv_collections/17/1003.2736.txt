We propose an experimental scheme to realize and detect the quantum anomalous
Hall effect in an anisotropic square optical lattice which can be generated
from available experimental set-ups of double-well lattices with minor
modifications. A periodic gauge potential induced by atom-light interaction is
introduced to give a Peierls phase for the nearest-neighbor site hopping. The
quantized anomalous Hall conductivity is investigated by calculating the Chern
number as well as the chiral gapless edge states of our system. Furthermore, we
show in detail the feasability for its experimental detection through light
Bragg scattering of the edge and bulk states with which one can determine the
topological phase transition from usual insulating phase to quantum anomalous
Hall phase.
