In this work we consider an extraordinary quantum mechanical effect when,
roughly speaking, the nucleus of an atom becomes (linearly) larger than the
whole atom. Precisely, we consider Helium ion (in the ground state of the
electron) moving translationally with the speed much smaller than speed of the
electron rotation. This translation, effectively, changes neither the total
momentum, nor the de Broglie wave length of the electron, nor the linear size
of the atom corresponding to the diameter of the electron orbit. But, this
translation implies a small nucleus momentum and nuclear de Broglie wavelength
almost hundred times larger than the electron de Broglie wavelength. In the
measurement of the nucleus wavelength using a diffraction apparatus with a
characteristic length constant proportional to the proposed nucleus wavelength,
according to standard quantum mechanical formalism, the nucleus behaves
practically certainly as a wave. Then the unique, irreducible linear
characteristic size for such a nucleus is de Broglie wavelength. Such a
measurement effectively influences neither the electron dynamics nor linear
size of the atom. This implies that, in such measurement, the size of the
nucleus is in one dimension larger than the whole atom, i.e. electron orbital.
All this corresponds metaphorically to the famous Leonardo fresco "Last Supper"
where Jesus' words coming from the nucleus, i.e. center of the composition,
cause an expanding "superposition" or dramatic wave-like movement of the
apostles.
