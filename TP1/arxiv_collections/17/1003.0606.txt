We study the intrinsic spin Hall effect (SHE) based on the orbitally
degenerate periodic Anderson model, which is an effective model for heavy
fermion systems. In the very low resistivity regime, the magnitude of the
intrinsic spin Hall conductivity (SHC) is estimated as $2000 \sim 3000 \hbar
e^{-1} \Omega^{-1} cm^{-1}$; It is about 10 times larger than that in Pt. Its
sign is negative (positive) in Ce (Yb) compound systems with $f^1$ ($f^{13}$)
configuration. Interestingly, the obtained expression for the SHC depends only
on the density of conduction electrons, but is independent of the strength of
the c-f mixing potential and the mass-enhancement factor. The origin of the
huge SHE is the spin-dependent Berry phase induced by the complex f-orbital
wavefunction, which we call the "orbital Aharonov-Bohm effect".
