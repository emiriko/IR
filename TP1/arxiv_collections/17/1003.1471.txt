The aim of this article is to analyze the asymptotic properties of the
C-metric, using a general method specified in work of Tafel and coworkers, [1],
[2], [3]. By finding an appropriate conformal factor $\Omega$, it allows the
investigation of the asymptotic properties of a given asymptotically flat
spacetime. The news function and Bondi mass aspect are computed, their general
properties are analyzed, as well as the small mass, small acceleration, small
and large Bondi time limits.
