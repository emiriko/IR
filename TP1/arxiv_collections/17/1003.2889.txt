Mixed integer predictive control deals with optimizing integer and real
control variables over a receding horizon. The mixed integer nature of controls
might be a cause of intractability for instances of larger dimensions. To
tackle this little issue, we propose a decomposition method which turns the
original $n$-dimensional problem into $n$ indipendent scalar problems of lot
sizing form. Each scalar problem is then reformulated as a shortest path one
and solved through linear programming over a receding horizon. This last
reformulation step mirrors a standard procedure in mixed integer programming.
The approximation introduced by the decomposition can be lowered if we operate
in accordance with the predictive control technique: i) optimize controls over
the horizon ii) apply the first control iii) provide measurement updates of
other states and repeat the procedure.
