We revisit the dynamical equivalence between different representations of
vacuum modified gravity models in view of Legendre transformations. The
equivalence is discussed for both bulk and boundary space, by including in our
analysis the relevant Gibbons-Hawking terms. In the f(R) case, the Legendre
transformed action coincides with the usual Einstein frame one. We then
re-express the R+f(G) action, where G is the Gauss-Bonnet term, as a second
order theory with a new set of field variables, four tensor fields and one
scalar and study its dynamics. For completeness, we also calculate the
conformal transformation of the full Jordan frame R+f(G) action. All the
appropriate Gibbons-Hawking terms are calculated explicitly.
