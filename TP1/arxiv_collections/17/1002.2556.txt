We investigate magnetically-induced ferroelectricity in Cu2MnSnS4 by means of
Landau theory of phase transitions and of ab initio density functional theory.
As expected from the Landau approach, ab initio calculations show that a
non-zero ferroelectric polarization P along the y direction is induced by the
peculiar antiferromagnetic configuration of Mn spins occurring in Cu2MnSnS4.
The comparison between P, calculated either via density-functional-theory or
according to Landau approach, clearly shows that ferroelectricity is mainly
driven by Heisenberg-exchange terms and only to a minor extent by relativistic
terms. At variance with previous examples of collinear antiferromagnets with
magnetically-induced ferroelectricity (such as AFM-E HoMnO3), the ionic
displacements occurring upon magnetic ordering are very small, so that the
exchange-striction mechanism (i.e. displacement of ions so as to minimize the
magnetic coupling energy) is not effective here. Rather, the microscopic
mechanism at the basis of polarization has mostly an electronic origin. In this
framework, we propose the small magnetic moment at Cu sites induced by
neighboring Mn magnetic moments to play a relevant role in inducing P. Finally,
we investigate the effect of the anion by comparing Cu2MnSnSe4 and Cu2MnSnS4:
Se-4p states, more delocalized compared to S-3p states, are able to better
mediate the Mn-Mn interaction, in turn leading to a higher ferroelectric
polarization in the Se-based compound.
