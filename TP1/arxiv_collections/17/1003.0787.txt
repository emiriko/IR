The density of states of disordered systems in the Wigner-Dyson classes
approaches some finite non-zero value at the mobility edge, whereas the density
of states in systems of the chiral and Bogolubov-de Gennes classes shows a
divergent or vanishing behavior in the band centre. Such types of behavior were
classified as homogeneous and inhomogeneous fixed point ensembles within a
real-space renormalization group approach. For the latter ensembles the scaling
law $\mu=d\nu-1$ was derived for the power laws of the density of states
$\rho\propto|E|^\mu$ and of the localization length $\xi\propto|E|^{-\nu}$.
This prediction from 1976 is checked against explicit results obtained
meanwhile.
