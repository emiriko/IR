Microwave resonances between discrete macroscopically distinct quantum states
with single photon and multiphoton absorption are observed in a strongly driven
radio frequency superconducting quantum interference device flux qubit. The
amplitude of the resonant peaks and dips are modulated by the power of the
applied microwave irradiation and a population inversion is generated at low
flux bias. These results, which can be addressed with Landau-Zener transition,
are useful to develop an alternative means to initialize and manipulate the
flux qubit, as well as to do a controllable population inversion used in a
micromaser.
