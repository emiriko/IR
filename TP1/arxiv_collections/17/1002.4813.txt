In 1968, Gohberg and Krupnik found a Fredholm criterion for singular integral
operators of the form $aP+bQ$, where $a,b$ are piecewise continuous functions
and $P,Q$ are complementary projections associated to the Cauchy singular
integral operator, acting on Lebesgue spaces over Lyapunov curves. We extend
this result to the case of Nakano spaces (also known as variable Lebesgue
spaces) with certain weights having finite sets of discontinuities on arbitrary
Carleson curves.
