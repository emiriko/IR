The ratio of the symmetry energy coefficient to temperature, $a_sym/T$, in
Fermi energy heavy ion collisions, has been experimentally extracted as a
function of the fragment atomic number using isoscaling parameters and the
variance of the isotope distributions. The extracted values have been compared
to the results of calculations made with an Antisymmetrized Molecular Dynamics
(AMD) model employing a statistical decay code to account for deexcitation of
excited primary fragments. The experimental values are in good agreement with
the values calculated but are significantly different from those characterizing
the yields of the primary AMD fragments.
