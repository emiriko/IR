Using the strong coupling expansion of the compact and non-compact U(1)
lattice gauge theory for monolayer graphene, we show analytically that fermion
bandgap and pseudo Nambu--Goldstone exciton (pi-exciton) are dynamically
generated due to chiral symmetry breaking. The mechanism is similar to the
generation of quark mass and pion excitation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).
We derive a formula for the pi-exciton analogous to the
Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner (GOR) relation in QCD. Experimental confirmation of
the GOR relation on a suspended monolayer graphene would be a clear evidence of
chiral symmetry breaking.
