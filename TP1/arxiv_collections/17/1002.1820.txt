The low-temperature dc mobility of the two-dimensional electron system
localized above the surface of superfluid helium is determined by the slowest
stage of the longitudinal momentum transfer to the bulk liquid, namely, by the
interaction of surface and volume excitations of liquid helium, which rapidly
decreases with temperature. Thus, the temperature dependence of the
low-frequency mobility is \mu_{dc} = 8.4x10^{-11}n_e T^{-20/3} cm^4 K^{20/3}/(V
s), where n_e is the surface electron density. The relation
T^{20/3}E_\perp^{-3} << 2x10^{-7} between the pressing electric field (in
kV/cm) and temperature (in K) and the value \omega < 10^8 T^5 K^{-5}s^{-1} of
the driving-field frequency have been obtained, at which the above effect can
be observed. In particular, E_\perp = 1 kV/cm corresponds to T < 70 mK and
\omega/2\pi < 30 Hz.
