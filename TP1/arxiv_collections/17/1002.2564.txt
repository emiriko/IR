We compute:
  * the cohomology with group ring coefficients of Artin groups (or actually,
of their associated Salvetti complexes), Bestvina-Brady groups, and graph
products of groups,
  * the L^2-Betti numbers of Bestvina-Brady groups and of graph products of
groups,
  * the weighted L^2-Betti numbers of graph products of Coxeter groups.
  In the case of arbitrary graph products there is an additional proviso:
either all factors are infinite or all are finite.(However, for graph products
of Coxeter groups this proviso is unnecessary.)
