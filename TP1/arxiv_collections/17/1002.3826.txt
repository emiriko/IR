Previous studies of the low surface brightness host of the blue compact
galaxy (BCG) Haro 11 have suggested an abnormally red color of V-K=4.2+-0.8 for
the host galaxy. This color is inconsistent with any normal stellar population
over a wide range of stellar metallicities (Z=0.001-0.02). Similar though less
extreme host colors have been measured for other BCGs and may be reconciled
with population synthesis models, provided that the stellar metallicity of the
host is higher than that of the ionized gas in the central starburst. We
present the deepest V and K band observations to date of Haro 11 and derive a
new V-K color for the host galaxy. Our new data suggest a far less extreme
colour of V-K=2.3+-0.2, which is perfectly consistent with the expectations for
an old host galaxy with the same metallicty as that derived from nebular
emission lines in the star-forming center.
