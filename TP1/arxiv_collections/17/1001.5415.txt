We show that the Cauchy Problem for a randomly forced, periodic
multi-dimensional scalar first-order conservation law with additive or
multiplicative noise is well-posed: it admits a unique solution, characterized
by a kinetic formulation of the problem, which is the limit of the solution of
the stochastic parabolic approximation.
