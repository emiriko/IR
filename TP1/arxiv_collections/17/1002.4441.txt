We discuss the production of charmonium in nuclear collisions within the
framework of the statistical hadronization model. We demonstrate that the model
reproduces very well the availble data at RHIC. We provide predictions for the
LHC energy where, dependently on the charm production cross section, a
dramatically different behaviour of charmonium production as a function of
centrality might be expected. We discuss also the case in elementary
collisions, where clearly the statistical model does not reproduce the
measurements.
