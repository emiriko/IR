The infection pathway of virus in cytoplasm of a living cell is studied from
the viewpoint of diffusion theory. The cytoplasm plays a role of a medium for
stochastic motion of the virus contained in the endosome as well as the free
virus. It is experimentally known that the exponent of anomalous diffusion
fluctuates in localized areas of the cytoplasm. Here, generalizing fractional
kinetic theory, such fluctuations are described in terms of the exponent
locally distributed over the cytoplasm, and a theoretical proposition is
presented for its statistical form. The proposed fluctuations may be examined
in an experiment of heterogeneous diffusion in the infection pathway.
