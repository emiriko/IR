CG, SYMMLQ, and MINRES are Krylov subspace methods for solving symmetric
systems of linear equations. When these methods are applied to an incompatible
system (that is, a singular symmetric least-squares problem), CG could break
down and SYMMLQ's solution could explode, while MINRES would give a
least-squares solution but not necessarily the minimum-length (pseudoinverse)
solution. This understanding motivates us to design a MINRES-like algorithm to
compute minimum-length solutions to singular symmetric systems.
  MINRES uses QR factors of the tridiagonal matrix from the Lanczos process
(where R is upper-tridiagonal). MINRES-QLP uses a QLP decomposition (where
rotations on the right reduce R to lower-tridiagonal form). On ill-conditioned
systems (singular or not), MINRES-QLP can give more accurate solutions than
MINRES. We derive preconditioned MINRES-QLP, new stopping rules, and better
estimates of the solution and residual norms, the matrix norm, and the
condition number.
