The best case for thinking that quantum mechanics is nonlocal rests on Bell's
Theorem, and later results of the same kind. However, the correlations
characteristic of EPR-Bell (EPRB) experiments also arise in familiar cases
elsewhere in QM, where the two measurements involved are timelike rather than
spacelike separated; and in which the correlations are usually assumed to have
a local causal explanation, requiring no action-at-a-distance. It is
interesting to ask how this is possible, in the light of Bell's Theorem. We
investigate this question, and present two options. Either (i) the new cases
are nonlocal, too, in which case action-at-a-distance is more widespread in QM
than has previously been appreciated (and does not depend on entanglement, as
usually construed); or (ii) the means of avoiding action-at-a-distance in the
new cases extends in a natural way to EPRB, removing action-at-a-distance in
these cases, too. There is a third option, viz., that the new cases are
strongly disanalogous to EPRB. But this option requires an argument, so far
missing, that the physical world breaks the symmetries which otherwise support
the analogy. In the absence of such an argument, the orthodox combination of
views -- action-at-a-distance in EPRB, but local causality in its timelike
analogue -- is less well established than it is usually assumed to be.
