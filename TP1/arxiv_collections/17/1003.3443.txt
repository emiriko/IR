Non-Markovian effects upon the Brownian movement of a free particle in the
presence as well as in the absence of inertial force are investigated within
the framework of Fokker-Planck equations (Rayleigh and Smoluchowski equations).
More specifically, it is predicted that non-Markovian features can enhance the
values of the mean square displacement and momentum, thereby assuring the
mathematical property of differentiability of the these physically observable
quantities.
