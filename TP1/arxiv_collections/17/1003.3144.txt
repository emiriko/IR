The subject of the thesis is the study of electromagnetic transitions in
charmonium with PANDA. The possible registration of the $h_c$ state in
charmonium, observed recently by the E760 and E835 Fermilab experiments, is
used for demonstration of the physics performance of the PANDA detector. The
measurement of the angular distribution of $\gamma$-rays from radiative
transitions can be used for the verification of its $J^{PC}$ quantum numbers.
The electromagnetic calorimeter of the PANDA detector is the crucial component
for this studies from the point of view of signal registration and background
suppression.
