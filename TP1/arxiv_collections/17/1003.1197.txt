We consider the supernova shock effects, the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein
(MSW) effects, the collective effects, and the Earth matter effects in the
detection of type II supernova neutrinos on the Earth. It is found that the
event number of supernova neutrinos depends on the neutrino mass hierarchy, the
neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, and neutrino masses. Therefore, we propose
possible methods to identify the mass hierarchy and acquire information about
$\theta_{13}$ and neutrino masses by detecting supernova neutrinos. We apply
these methods to some current neutrino experiments.
