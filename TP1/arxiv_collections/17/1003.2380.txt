These notes cover some of the topics associated with direct detection of dark
matter at an introductory level. The general principles of dark matter search
are summarized. The current status of some experiments is described, with an
emphasis on bolometric and noble liquid techniques. Plots and illustrations
associated to these notes may be found on transparencies presented during the
lecture, on the web site of Gif school 2009.
