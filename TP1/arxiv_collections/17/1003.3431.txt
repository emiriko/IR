In earlier work the authors obtained integral formulas for probabilities for
a single particle in the asymmetric simple exclusion process. Here formulas are
obtained for joint probabilities for several particles. In the case of a single
particle the derivation here is simpler than the one in the earlier work for
one of its main results.
