In this paper we present two algorithms for the computation of a diagonal
form of a matrix over non-commutative Euclidean domain over a field with the
help of Gr\"obner bases. This can be viewed as the pre-processing for the
computation of Jacobson normal form and also used for the computation of Smith
normal form in the commutative case. We propose a general framework for
handling, among other, operator algebras with rational coefficients. We employ
special "polynomial" strategy in Ore localizations of non-commutative
$G$-algebras and show its merits. In particular, for a given matrix $M$ we
provide an algorithm to compute $U,V$ and $D$ with fraction-free entries such
that $UMV=D$ holds. The polynomial approach allows one to obtain more precise
information, than the rational one e. g. about singularities of the system.
  Our implementation of polynomial strategy shows very impressive performance,
compared with methods, which directly use fractions. In particular, we
experience quite moderate swell of coefficients and obtain uncomplicated
transformation matrices. This shows that this method is well suitable for
solving nontrivial practical problems. We present an implementation of
algorithms in SINGULAR:PLURAL and compare it with other available systems. We
leave questions on the algorithmic complexity of this algorithm open, but we
stress the practical applicability of the proposed method to a bigger class of
non-commutative algebras.
