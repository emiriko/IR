We present a detailed analysis of the results of our numerical study of the
crystal and electronic structure of the room temperature organometallic
ferrimagnet of general composition V(TCNE)$_{x}$ with $% x\approx 2$. The
results of the LSDA+$U$ study show that the experimentally determined structure
complies with the magnetic measurements and thus can serve as a prototype
structure for the entire family of the M(TCNE)$_{2}$ organometallic magnets.
The results of the numerical study and of the magnetic experiments are
interpreted using model Hamiltonians proposed here. This allowed us to obtain
estimates of the critical temperature in three- and two-dimensional regimes and
to give an explanation of the differences in behavior of probably isostructural
V(TCNE)$_{2}$ and Fe(TCNE)$_{2}$ species.
