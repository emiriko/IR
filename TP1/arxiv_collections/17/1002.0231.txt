We consider the reflection equation of the N=3 Cremmer-Gervais R-matrix. The
reflection equation is shown to be equivalent to 38 equations which do not
depend on the parameter of the R-matrix, q. Solving those 38 equations. the
solution space is found to be the union of two types of spaces, each of which
is parametrized by the algebraic variety $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C}) \times
\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C}) \times \mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C})$ and $ \mathbb{C}
\times \mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C}) \times \mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C})$.
