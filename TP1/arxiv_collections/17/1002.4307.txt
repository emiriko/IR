We study an influence of nonlinear dissipation and external perturbations
onto transition scenarious to chaos in Lorenz-Haken system. It will be show
that varying in external potential parameters values leads to parameters domain
formation of chaos realization. In the modified Lorenz-Haken system transitions
from regular to chaotic dynamics can be of Ruelle-Takens scenario, Feigenbaum
scenario, or through intermittency.
