We analyze the physical properties and infall rates of the circum-galactic
gas around disks obtained in multi-resolved, cosmological, AMR simulations. At
intermediate and low redshifts, disks are embedded into an extended, hot,
tenuous corona that contributes largely in fueling the disk with non-enriched
gas whereas the accretion of enriched gas from tidal streams occurs throughout
episodic events. We derive an infall rate close to the disk of the same value
as the one of the star formation rate in the disk and its temporal evolution as
a function of galacto-centric radius nicely shows that the growth of galactic
disks proceeds according to an inside-out formation scenario.
