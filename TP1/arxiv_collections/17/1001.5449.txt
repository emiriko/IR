The conversion of neutral nitrogen-vacancy centers to negatively charged
nitrogen-vacancy centers is demonstrated for centers created by ion
implantation and annealing in high-purity diamond. Conversion occurs with
surface exposure to an oxygen atmosphere at 465 C. The spectral properties of
the charge-converted centers are investigated. Charge state control of
nitrogen-vacancy centers close to the diamond surface is an important step
toward the integration of these centers into devices for quantum information
and magnetic sensing applications.
