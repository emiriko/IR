We consider the intersecting D4-brane and anti-D4-brane model of holographic
QCD, motivated by the model that has recently been suggested by Van Raamsdonk
and Whyte. We analyze such D4-branes by the use of the action with a
bi-fundamental ``tachyon'' field, so that we find the classical solutions
describing the intersecting D4-branes and the U-shaped D4-branes. We show that
the ``tachyon'' field in the bulk theory provides a current quark mass and a
quark condensate to the dual gauge theory and that the lowest modes of mesons
obtain mass via tachyon condensation. Then evaluating the properties of a pion,
one can reproduce Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation.
