Extra dimensions provide a very useful tool in addressing a number of the
fundamental problems faced by the Standard Model. The following provides a very
basic introduction to this very broad subject area as given at the VIII School
of the Gravitational and Mathematical Physics Division of the Mexican Physical
Society in December 2009. Some prospects for extra dimensional searches at the
7 TeV LHC with $\sim$1 $fb^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity are provided.
