Medium-voltage cross-linked polyethylene (MV-XLPE) cables have an important
role in the electrical power distribution system. For this reason, the study of
XLPE insulation is crucial to improve cable features and lifetime. Although a
relaxational analysis using Thermally Stimulated Depolarization Currents (TSDC)
can yield a lot of information about XLPE properties, sometimes its results are
difficult to interpret. In previous works it was found that the TSDC spectrum
of cables is dominated by a broad heteropolar peak, that appears just before an
homopolar inversion, but the analysis of the cause of the peak was not
conclusive. We have used a combination of TSDC and Isothermal Depolarization
Currents (IDC) techniques to investigate further this issue. In order to
discard spurious effects from the semiconductor interfaces, samples have been
prepared in certain configurations and preliminary measurements have been done.
Then, TSDC experiments have been performed using conventional polarization
between 140C and 40C. Also, IDC measurements have been carried out between 90C
and 110C in 2C steps. The TSDC spectra show the broad peak at 95C. On the other
hand, IDC show a combination of power and exponential charge currents.
Exponential currents are fitted to a Kohlrausch--Williams--Watts (KWW) model.
The parameters obtained present approximately an Arrhenius behavior with
E_a=1.32eV, tau_0=3.29e-16s, with a KWW parameter beta=0.8. The depolarization
current calculated from the obtained parameters turns out to match the dominant
peak of TSDC spectra rather well. From the results and given the partially
molten state of the material, we conclude that the most likely cause of the
exponential IDC and the main TSDC peak is the relaxation of molecular dipoles
from additives incorporated during the manufacturing process.
