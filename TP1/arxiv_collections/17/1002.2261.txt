The model of magnetic braking of solar rotation considered by Charbonneau &
MacGregor (1993) has been modified so that it is able to reproduce for the
first time the rotational evolution of both the fastest and slowest rotators
among solar-type stars in open clusters of different ages, without coming into
conflict with other observational constraints, such as the time evolution of
the atmospheric Li abundance in solar twins and the thinness of the solar
tachocline. This new model assumes that rotation-driven turbulent diffusion,
which is thought to amplify the viscosity and magnetic diffusivity in stellar
radiative zones, is strongly anisotropic with the horizontal components of the
transport coefficients strongly dominating over those in the vertical
direction. Also taken into account is the poloidal field decay that helps to
confine the width of the tachocline at the solar age. The model's properties
are investigated by numerically solving the azimuthal components of the coupled
momentum and magnetic induction equations in two dimensions using a finite
element method
