We consider spaces of plane curves in the setting of algebraic geometry and
of singularity theory. On one hand there are the complete linear systems, on
the other we consider unfolding spaces of bivariate polynomials of
Brieskorn-Pham type. For suitable open subspaces we can define the bifurcation
braid monodromy taking values in the Zariski resp. Artin braid group. In both
cases we give the generators of the image. These results are compared with the
corresponding geometric monodromy. It takes values in the mapping class group
of braided surfaces. Our final result gives a precise statement about the
interdependence of the two monodromy maps. Our study concludes with some
implication with regard to the unfaithfulness of the geometric monodromy and
the - yet unexploited - knotted geometric monodromy, which takes the ambient
space into account.
