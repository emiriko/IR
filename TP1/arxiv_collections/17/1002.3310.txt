We study the arithmetic of abelian varieties over $K=k(t)$ where $k$ is an
arbitrary field. The main result relates Mordell-Weil groups of certain
Jacobians over $K$ to homomorphisms of other Jacobians over $k$. Our methods
also yield completely explicit points on elliptic curves with unbounded rank
over $\Fpbar(t)$ and a new construction of elliptic curves with moderately high
rank over $\C(t)$.
