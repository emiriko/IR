We will simplify earlier proofs of Perelman's collapsing theorem for
3-manifolds given by Shioya-Yamaguchi and Morgan-Tian. Among other things, we
use Perelman's critical point theory (e.g., multiple conic singularity theory
and his fibration theory) for Alexandrov spaces to construct the desired local
Seifert fibration structure on collapsed 3-manifolds. The verification of
Perelman's collapsing theorem is the last step of Perelman's proof of
Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture on the classification of 3-manifolds. Our
proof of Perelman's collapsing theorem is almost self-contained, accessible to
non-experts and advanced graduate students. Perelman's collapsing theorem for
3-manifolds can be viewed as an extension of implicit function theorem
