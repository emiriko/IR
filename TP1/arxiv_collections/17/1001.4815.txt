A consistent description of neutrino oscillations requires either the
quantum-mechanical (QM) wave packet approach or a quantum field theoretic (QFT)
treatment. We compare these two approaches to neutrino oscillations and discuss
the correspondence between them. In particular, we derive expressions for the
QM neutrino wave packets from QFT and relate the free parameters of the QM
framework, in particular the effective momentum uncertainty of the neutrino
state, to the more fundamental parameters of the QFT approach. We include in
our discussion the possibilities that some of the neutrino's interaction
partners are not detected, that the neutrino is produced in the decay of an
unstable parent particle, and that the overlap of the wave packets of the
particles involved in the neutrino production (or detection) process is not
maximal. Finally, we demonstrate how the properly normalized oscillation
probabilities can be obtained in the QFT framework without an ad hoc
normalization procedure employed in the QM approach.
