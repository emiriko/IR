Collaborative intrusion detection networks are often used to gain better
detection accuracy and cost efficiency as compared to a single host-based
intrusion detection system (IDS). Through cooperation, it is possible for a
local IDS to detect new attacks that may be known to other experienced
acquaintances. In this paper, we present a sequential hypothesis testing method
for feedback aggregation for each individual IDS in the net- work. Our
simulation results corroborate our theoretical results and demonstrate the
properties of cost efficiency and accuracy compared to other heuristic methods.
The analytical result on the lower-bound of the average number of acquaintances
for consultation is essential for the design and configuration of IDSs in a
collaborative environment.
