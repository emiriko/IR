We calculate the heat transfer between electrons to acoustic and optical
phonons in monolayer and bilayer graphene (MLG and BLG) within the
quasiequilibrium approximation. For acoustic phonons, we show how the
temperature-power laws of the electron-phonon heat current for BLG differ from
those previously derived for MLG and note that the high-temperature
(neutral-regime) power laws for MLG and BLG are also different, with a weaker
dependence on the electronic temperature in the latter. In the general case we
evaluate the heat current numerically. We suggest that a measurement of the
heat current could be used for an experimental determination of the
electron-acoustic phonon coupling constants, which are not accurately known.
However, in a typical experiment heat dissipation by electrons at very low
temperatures is dominated by diffusion, and we estimate the crossover
temperature at which acoustic-phonon coupling takes over in a sample with Joule
heating. At even higher temperatures optical phonons begin to dominate. We
study some examples of potentially relevant types of optical modes, including
in particular the intrinsic in-plane modes, and additionally the remote surface
phonons of a possible dielectric substrate.
