We provide measurements of the integrated galaxy light at 70, 160, 250, 350
and 500 micron using deep far-infrared and submillimeter data from space
(Spitzer) and balloon platform (BLAST) extragalactic surveys. We use the
technique of stacking at the positions of 24 micron sources, to supplement the
fraction of the integrated galaxy light that is directly resolved through
direct detections. We demonstrate that the integrated galaxy light even through
stacking, falls short by factors of 2-3 in resolving the extragalactic
far-infrared background. We also show that previous estimates of the integrated
galaxy light (IGL) through stacking, have been biased towards high values. This
is primarily due to multiple counting of the far-infrared/submillimeter flux
from 24 micron sources which are clustered within the large point spread
function of a brighter far-infrared source. Using models for the evolution of
the luminosity function at z<1.2 which are constrained by observations at 24
micron and 70 micron, and which are consistent with the results from the
stacking analysis, we find that galaxies at z<1.2, account for ~95-55% of the
extragalactic far-infrared background in the ~70-500 micron range respectively.
This places strong upper limits on the fraction of dust obscured star-formation
at z>1, which are remarkably, below the values derived from the extinction
corrected ultraviolet luminosities of galaxies. We use the results to make
predictions for the nature of galaxies that extragalactic surveys with Herschel
Space Observatory will reveal. Finally, from our constraints on the
far-infrared IGL, we provide evidence for the existence of ice mantle dust,
orbiting the sun at a distance of ~40 AU, which is contributing intensity to
both the near- and far-infrared background. [ABRIDGED]
