In this review we discuss possible systematic errors inherent in classical 1D
LTE abundance analyses of late-type stars for the light elements (here: H, He,
Li, Be and B). The advent of realistic 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres and
the availability of non-LTE line formation codes place the stellar analyses on
a much firmer footing and indeed drastically modify the astrophysical
interpretations in many cases, especially at low metallicities. For the
Teff-sensitive hydrogen lines both stellar granulation and non-LTE are likely
important but the combination of the two has not yet been fully explored. A
fortuitous near-cancellation of significant but opposite 3D and non-LTE effects
leaves the derived 7Li abundances largely unaffected but new atomic collisional
data should be taken into account. We also discuss the impact on 3D non-LTE
line formation on the estimated lithium isotopic abundances in halo stars in
light of recent claims that convective line asymmetries can mimic the presence
of 6Li. While Be only have relatively minor non-LTE abundance corrections, B is
sensitive even if the latest calculations imply smaller non-LTE effects than
previously thought.
