A Borel resummation scheme of subtracting the perturbative contribution from
the average plaquette is proposed using the bilocal expansion of Borel
transform. It is shown that the remnant of the average plaquette, after
subtraction of the perturbative contribution, scales as a dim-4 condensate. A
critical review of the existing procedure of renormalon subtraction is
presented.
