Continuing work initiated in an earlier publication [Sato and Asada, PASJ,
61, L29 (2009)], we consider light curves influenced by the orbital inclination
and eccentricity of a companion in orbit around a transiting extrasolar planet
(in a planet-satellite system or a hypothetical true binary). We show that the
semimajor axis, eccentricity and inclination angle of a `moon' orbit around the
host planet can be determined by transit method alone. For this purpose, we
present a formulation for the parameter determinations in a small-eccentricity
approximation as well as in the exact form. As a result, the semimajor axis is
expressed in terms of observables such as brightness changes, transit durations
and intervals in light curves. We discuss also a narrow region of parameters
that produce a mutual transit by an extrasolar satellite.
