We prove a version of Rothschild-Stein's theorem of lifting and approximation
and some related results in the context of nonsmooth Hormander's vector fields
for which the highest order commutators are only Holder continuous. The theory
explicitly covers the case of one vector field having weight two while the
others have weight one.
