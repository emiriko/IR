We consider quantum enhanced measurements with initially mixed states. We
show very generally that for any linear propagation of the initial state that
depends smoothly on the parameter to be estimated, the sensitivity is bound by
the maximal sensitivity that can be achieved for any of the pure states from
which the initial density matrix is mixed. This provides a very general proof
that purely classical correlations cannot improve the sensitivity of parameter
estimation schemes in quantum enhanced measurement schemes.
