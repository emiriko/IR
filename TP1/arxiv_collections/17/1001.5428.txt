A possible solution to the hierarchy problem is the presence of extra spatial
dimensions beyond the three ones which are known from our everyday experience.
The phenomenological ADD model of large extra-dimensions predicts a missing
transverse energy plus a single-jet signature. This contribution addresses the
sensitivity of the CMS detector at the LHC pp collider to parameters of this
model, focusing on the conditions expected for second half of 2010 running
(sqrt(s) = 10 TeV, O(100) pb-1). It is shown that a significant improvement of
the existing limits can be obtained in such an early stage.
