At the level of heuristic effective dynamics, we investigate the cosmological
inflation with holonomy corrections of loop quantum cosmology (LQC) in the
$k=0$ Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model with a single inflaton field subject to
a simple potential. In the symmetric bouncing scenario of LQC, the condition
for occurrence of the quantum bounce naturally and uniquely fixes the initial
conditions at the bouncing epoch. Around the quantum bounce, the universe
undergoes a short super-inflationary phase, which drives the inflaton field to
its potential hill and thus sets the proper initial conditions for the standard
slow-roll inflation. Between the super-inflation and the standard inflation,
there is a non-inflationary phase, which violates the slow-roll condition. The
violation of slow roll is expected to give some suppression on the low angular
power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background and different orders of
holonomy corrections shall yield different suppressions.
