The electrical conductance, thermal conductance, thermal power and figure of
merit (ZT) of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) embedded into an insulator
matrix connected with metallic electrodes are theoretically investigated in the
Coulomb blockade regime. The multilevel Anderson model is used to simulate the
multiple QDs junction system. The charge and heat currents in the sequential
tunneling process are calculated by the Keldysh Green function technique. In
the linear response regime the ZT values are still very impressive in the small
tunneling rates case, although the effect of electron Coulomb interaction on ZT
is significant. In the nonlinear response regime, we have demonstrated that the
thermal rectification behavior can be observed for the coupled QDs system,
where the very strong asymmetrical coupling between the dots and electrodes,
large energy level separation between dots and strong interdot Coulomb
interactions are required.
