RefereeToolbox is a java package implementing combination operators for
fusing evidences. It is downloadable from:
http://refereefunction.fredericdambreville.com/releases RefereeToolbox is based
on an interpretation of the fusion rules by means of Referee Functions. This
approach implies a dissociation between the definition of the combination and
its actual implementation, which is common to all referee-based combinations.
As a result, RefereeToolbox is designed with the aim to be generic and
evolutive.
