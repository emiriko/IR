A collisionless plasma is modeled by the Vlasov-Poisson system in
one-dimension. A fixed background of positive charge, dependent only upon
velocity, is assumed and the situation in which the mobile negative ions
balance the positive charge as x tends to positive or negative infinity. Thus,
the total positive charge and the total negative charge are infinite. In this
paper, the charge density of the system is shown to be compactly supported.
More importantly, both the electric field and the number density are determined
explicitly for large values of x.
