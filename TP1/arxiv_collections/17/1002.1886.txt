In the paper we obtain some new applications of well--known W. Rudin's
theorem concerning lacunary series to problems of combinatorial number theory.
We generalize a result of M.-C. Chang on L_2 (L)-norm of Fourier coefficients
of a set (here L is a dissociated set), and prove a dual version of the
theorem. Our main instrument is computing of eigenvalues of some operators.
