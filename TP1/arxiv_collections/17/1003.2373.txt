We discuss (arbitrary-dimensional) Lorentzian manifolds and the scalar
polynomial curvature invariants constructed from the Riemann tensor and its
covariant derivatives. Recently, we have shown that in four dimensions a
Lorentzian spacetime metric is either $\mathcal{I}$-non-degenerate, and hence
locally characterized by its scalar polynomial curvature invariants, or is a
degenerate Kundt spacetime. We present a number of results that generalize
these results to higher dimensions and discuss their consequences and potential
physical applications.
