Motivated by recent chemical attempts at assembling halogen-bridged
transition-metal complexes within a nanotube, we model and characterize a
platinum-halide triangular prism in terms of a Peierls-Hubbard Hamiltonian.
Based on a group-theoretical argument, we reveal a variety of valence
arrangements, including heterogeneous or partially metallic charge-density-wave
states. Quantum and thermal phase competitions are numerically demonstrated
with particular emphasis on novel insulator-to-metal and insulator-to-insulator
transitions under doping, the former of which is of the first order, while the
latter of which is of the second order.
