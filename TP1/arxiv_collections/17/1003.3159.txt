Because energetic particles populate both planetary magnetospheres and
interplanetary space in significant quantities, energetic-ion sensors have been
flown since the beginning of the space age. Early sensors were solid-state
detector (SSD) telescopes, with conical fields of view, often swept through a
circle by virtue of the spin motion of the spacecraft (e.g., IMP 7 and 8, ISEE
1 and 2). In the 1980s and 1990s, foil/microchannel plate (MCP) time-of-flight
(TOF) measurements were added to the energy measurement provided by the SSD
(eg, AMPTE/CCE MEPA, Geotail EPIC/ICS, Galileo EPD). The resulting energy and
velocity uniquely identified ion mass. More recently, we have developed a 2-D
fan acceptance angle sensor that includes both energy and TOF. When mounted on
a spinning spacecraft, this 160^\circ x 12^\circ FOV sweeps out nearly 4\pi
steradians in one spin. This sensor, dubbed the "hockey puck" for its shape, is
currently in flight on MESSENGER (EPS) and New Horizons Pluto
(PEPPSI).Increasingly, energetic-ion sensors fly on 3-axis stabilized
spacecraft (e.g., MESSENGER EPS, New Horizons (Pluto) PEPPSI, Cassini MIMI.
While 3-axis stabilization serves imaging science well, it hampers the goal of
obtaining 4\pi-steradian ion measurements. We are developing an energetic-ion
sensor that measures ion energy and composition, and covers 2\pi steradians on
a 3-axis-stabilized spacecraft without an articulation mechanism. Based on its
shape, we refer to this design as the "mushroom". We describe the internally
funded development of the concept and its status at the start of development
funding by NASA under the Planetary Instrument Definition and Development
Program (PIDDP).
