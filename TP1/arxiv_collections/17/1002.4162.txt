A version of the Dynamical Systems Method for solving ill-posed nonlinear
equations with monotone and locally H\"{o}lder continuous operators is studied
in this paper. A discrepancy principle is proposed and justified under natural
and weak assumptions. The only smoothness assumption on $F$ is the local
H\"{o}lder continuity of order $\alpha>1/2$.
