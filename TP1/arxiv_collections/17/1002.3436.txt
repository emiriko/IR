We study the convergence of inner products of free fields over the
homogeneous spaces of the de Sitter group and show that the convergence of
inner products in the of $N$-particle states is defined by the asymptotic
behavior of hypergeometric functions. We calculate the inner product for
two-particle states on the four-dimensional hyperboloid in detail.
