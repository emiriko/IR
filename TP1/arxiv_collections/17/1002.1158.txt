Cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy was utilized to study fractured
perovskie oxide surfaces. It was found for the non-cleavable perovskite oxide,
SrTiO$_{3}$, that atomically flat terraces could be routinely created with a
controlled fracturing procedure. Optical and scanning electron microscopy as
well as a profilometer were used to obtain the information from sub-millimeter
to sub-micrometer scales of the fractured surface topography.
