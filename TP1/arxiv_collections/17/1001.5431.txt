The zero temperature phase diagram of Cooper pairs exposed to disorder and
magnetic field is found to exhibit four distinct phases: a Bose and a Fermi
insulating, a metallic and a superconducting phase, respectively. The results
explain the giant negative magneto-resistance found experimentally in In-O,
TiN, Bi and high-$T_c$ materials.
