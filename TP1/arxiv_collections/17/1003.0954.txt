We analyze the exact ground state of XXZ zigzag spin chain with applied
magnetic field and find the quantum critical surface. Using the theorem of
positive semi-definite matrix, we can prove that the ground states for a
specific region, are fully polarized state and one magnon states. With Bethe
ansatz, we argue that this is the quantum critical surface in all cases. A
first in the literature, we derive the analytical expression of quantum
critical surface for superconducting quantum dots array in the presence of gate
voltage.
