Instability of 6 dimensional Rubakov-Shaposhnikov model is reinvestigated. It
is shown that the model is unstable in scalar perturbations sector with very
particular instability pattern: there are no unstable modes for the first two
lowest angular harmonics, m=0 and m=1, whereas there is a single negative mode
for each higher m.
