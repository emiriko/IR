Different candidates of Quantum Gravity such as String Theory, Doubly Special
Relativity, Loop Quantum Gravity and black hole physics all predict the
existence of a minimum observable length or a maximum observable momentum which
modifies the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This modified version is usually
called the Generalized (Gravitational) Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and changes
all Hamiltonians in quantum mechanics. In this Letter, we use a recently
proposed GUP which is consistent with String Theory, Doubly Special Relativity
and black hole physics and predicts both a minimum measurable length and a
maximum measurable momentum. This form of GUP results in two additional terms
in any quantum mechanical Hamiltonian, proportional to $\alpha p^3$ and
$\alpha^2 p^4$, respectively, where $\alpha \sim 1/M_{Pl}c$ is the GUP
parameter. By considering both terms as perturbations, we study two quantum
mechanical systems in the framework of the proposed GUP: a particle in a box
and a simple harmonic oscillator. We demonstrate that, for the general
polynomial potentials, the corrections to the highly excited eigenenergies are
proportional to their square values. We show that this result is exact for the
case of a particle in a box.
