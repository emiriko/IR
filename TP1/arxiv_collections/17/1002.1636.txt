We give a new insight into the upper bounding of the 3-SAT threshold by the
first moment method. The best criteria developed so far to select the solutions
to be counted discriminate among neighboring solutions on the basis of uniform
information about each individual free variable. What we mean by uniform
information, is information which does not depend on the solution: e.g. the
number of positive/negative occurrences of the considered variable. What is new
in our approach is that we use non uniform information about variables. Thus we
are able to make a more precise tuning, resulting in a slight improvement on
upper bounding the 3-SAT threshold for various models of formulas defined by
their distributions.
