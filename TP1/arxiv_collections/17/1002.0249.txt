The elastic backward proton-deuteron scattering is analyzed including
relativistic effects in the deuteron and the mechanism of this reaction which
includes the graphs corresponding to the emission, rescattering and absorption
of the virtual pion by a deuteron nucleon in addition to the one-nucleon
exchange graph. It allows one to obtain a rather satisfactory description of
all the experimental data on the differential cross section, tensor analyzing
power of the deuteron and transfer polarization in this reaction.
