In order to get an estimate of the homogeneity of the distribution of matter
in a fast hadron or nucleus, we compute the correlations of the saturation
scales Q_s between different points in impact-parameter space, in some specific
saturation models. We find that these correlations are quite strong: The
saturation scale is nearly uniform in domains whose sizes scale like
exp[const*ln^2(1/\alpha_s^2)]/Q_s, which means that the density of gluons
should not fluctuate significantly over regions of that typical size. We expect
these conclusions as well as the explicit analytical expressions we obtain for
the correlations to be true also for full QCD in appropriate limits.
