The probability that an exoplanet transits its host star is high for planets
in close orbits, but drops off rapidly for increasing semimajor axes. This
makes transit surveys for planets with large semimajor axes orbiting bright
stars impractical, since one would need to continuously observe hundreds of
stars that are spread out over the entire sky. One way to make such a survey
tractable is to constrain the inclination of the stellar rotation axes in
advance, and thereby enhance the transit probabilities. We derive transit
probabilities for stars with stellar inclination constraints, considering a
reasonable range of planetary system inclinations. We find that stellar
inclination constraints can improve the transit probability by almost an order
of magnitude for habitable-zone planets. When applied to an ensemble of stars,
such constraints dramatically lower the number of stars that need to be
observed in a targeted transit survey. We also consider multiplanet systems
where only one planet has an identified transit, and derive the transit
probabilities for the second planet assuming a range of mutual planetary
inclinations.
