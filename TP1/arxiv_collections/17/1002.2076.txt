In this paper we study the behavior of solutions of a second order
differential equation. The existence of a zero and its localization allow us to
get some compactness results. In particular we obtain a Myers' type theorem
even in the presence of an amount of negative curvature. The technique we use
also applies to the study of spectral properties of Schroedinger operators on
complete manifolds.
