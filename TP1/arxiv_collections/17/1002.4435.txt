Many hard combinatorial problems can be modeled by a system of polynomial
equations. N. Alon coined the term polynomial method to describe the use of
nonlinear polynomials when solving combinatorial problems. We continue the
exploration of the polynomial method and show how the algorithmic theory of
polynomial ideals can be used to detect k-colorability, unique Hamiltonicity,
and automorphism rigidity of graphs. Our techniques are diverse and involve
Nullstellensatz certificates, linear algebra over finite fields, Groebner
bases, toric algebra, convex programming, and real algebraic geometry.
