We consider the problem of boundary scattering for Y=0 maximal giant graviton
branes. We show that the boundary S-matrix for the fundamental excitations has
a Yangian symmetry. We then exploit this symmetry to determine the boundary
S-matrix for two-particle bound states. We verify that this boundary S-matrix
satisfies the boundary Yang-Baxter equations.
