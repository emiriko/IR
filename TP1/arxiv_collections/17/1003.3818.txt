Photon charge has been of interest as a phenomenological testing ground for
basic assumptions in fundamental physics. There have been several constraints
on the photon charge based on very different considerations. In this paper we
put further limits based on the well known properties of charged black holes
and their subsequent evaporation by Hawking radiation and the assumption of
charge conservation over this long physical process.
