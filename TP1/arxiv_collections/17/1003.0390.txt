The recently constructed Hamiltonians for spinless binary black holes through
third post-Newtonian order and for spinning ones through formal second
post-Newtonian order, where the spins are counted of zero post-Newtonian order,
are transformed into fully canonical center-of-mass and rest-frame variables.
The mixture terms in the Hamiltonians between center-of-mass and rest-frame
variables are in accordance with the relation between the total linear momentum
and the center-of-mass velocity as demanded by global Lorentz invariance. The
various generating functions for the center-of-mass and rest-frame canonical
variables are explicitly given in terms of the single-particle canonical
variables. The no-interaction theorem does not apply because the world-line
condition of Lorentz covariant position variables is not imposed.
