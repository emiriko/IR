We calculate cross section and azimuthal decorrellation of Mueller Navelet
jets at the LHC in the complete next-lo-leading order BFKL framework, i.e.
including next-to-leading corrections to the Green's function as well as
next-to-leading corrections to the Mueller Navelet vertices. The obtained
results for standard observables proposed for studies of Mueller Navelet jets
show that both sources of corrections are of equal, big importance for final
magnitude and final behavior of observables. The astonishing conclusion of our
analysis is that the observables obtained within the complete next-lo-leading
order BFKL framework of the present paper are quite similar to the same
observables obtained within next-to-leading logarithm DGLAP type treatment.
This fact sheds doubts on general belief that the studies of Mueller Navelet
jets at the LHC will lead to clear discrimination between the BFKL and the
DGLAP dynamics.
