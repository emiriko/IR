We present a method to strengthen a very low cost solution for key agreement
with a RFID device.
  Starting from a work which exploits the inherent noise on the communication
link to establish a key by public discussion, we show how to protect this
agreement against active adversaries. For that purpose, we unravel integrity
$(I)$-codes suggested by Cagalj et al.
  No preliminary key distribution is required.
