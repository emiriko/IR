We report the fabrication and measurement of one-electron single and double
quantum dots with fast tunnel rates in a Si/SiGe heterostructure. Achieving
fast tunnel rates in few-electron dots can be challenging, in part due to the
large electron effective mass in Si. Using charge sensing, we identify
signatures of tunnel rates in and out of the dot that are fast or slow compared
to the measurement rate. Such signatures provide a means to calibrate the
absolute electron number and verify single electron occupation. Pulsed gate
voltage measurements are used to validate the approach.
