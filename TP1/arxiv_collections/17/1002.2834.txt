The usage of nuclear emulsion with molybdenum filling for observation of
$\beta\beta$ decay are shown to be possible. Estimates for 1 kg of $^{100}$Mo
with zero background give the sensitivity for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay of
$^{100}$Mo at the level of $\sim 1.5\cdot 10^{24}$ y for 1 year of measurement.
