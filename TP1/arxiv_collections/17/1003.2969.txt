A normal outburst of the Be/X-ray binary system A0535+26 has taken place in
August 2009. It is the fourth in a series of normal outbursts that have occured
around the periastron passage of the source, but is unusual by starting at an
earlier orbital phase and by presenting a peculiar double-peaked light curve. A
first "flare" (lasting about 9 days from MJD 55043 on) reached a flux of 440
mCrab. The flux then decreased to less than 220 mCrab, and increased again
reaching 440 mCrab around the periastron at MJD 55057. Target of Opportunity
observations have been performed with INTEGRAL, RXTE and Suzaku. First results
of these observations are presented, with special emphasis on the cyclotron
lines present in the X-ray spectrum of the source, as well as in the pulse
period and energy dependent pulse profiles of the source.
