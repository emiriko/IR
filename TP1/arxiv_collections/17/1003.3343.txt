We present a fully relativistic and gauge invariant framework for calculating
the cross sections of dilepton production in nucleon-nucleon (NN) collisions
which is based on the meson-exchange approximation for the NN scattering
amplitudes. Predictions of our model are compared with those of other covariant
models that have been used to describe this reaction. We discuss the comparison
of our calculations with the old DLS and the recent HADES data.
