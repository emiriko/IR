We highlight the role of the light elements (Li, Be, B) in the evolution of
massive single and binary stars, which is largely restricted to a diagnostic
value, and foremost so for the element boron. However, we show that the boron
surface abundance in massive early type stars contains key information about
their foregoing evolution which is not obtainable otherwise. In particular, it
allows to constrain internal mixing processes and potential previous mass
transfer event for binary stars (even if the companion has disappeared). It may
also help solving the mystery of the slowly rotating nitrogen-rich massive main
sequence stars.
