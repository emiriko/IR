We observed the Galactic black hole candidate H1743-322 with Suzaku for
approximately 32 ksec, while the source was in a low/hard state during its 2008
outburst. We collected and analyzed the data with the HXD/PIN, HXD/GSO and XIS
cameras spanning the energy range from 0.7-200 keV. Fits to the spectra with
simple models fail to detect narrow Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption lines, with
90% confidence upper limits of 3.5 eV and 2.5 eV on the equivalent width,
respectively. These limits are commensurate with those in the very high state,
but are well below the equivalent widths of lines detected in the high/soft
state, suggesting that disk winds are partially state-dependent. We discuss
these results in the context of previous detections of ionized Fe absorption
lines in H1743-322 and connections to winds and jets in accreting systems.
Additionally, we report the possible detection of disk reflection features,
including an Fe K emission line.
