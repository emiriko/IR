We formulate a kinetic theory for non-centrosymmetric superconductors at low
temperatures in the clean limit. The transport equations are solved quite
generally in spin- and particle-hole (Nambu) space by performing first a
transformation into the band basis and second a Bogoliubov transformation to
the quasiparticle-quasihole phase space. Our result is a
particle-hole-symmetric, gauge-invariant and charge conserving description,
which is valid in the whole quasiclassical regime. We calculate the current
response, the specific heat capacity, and the Raman response function. For the
Raman case, we investigate within this framework the polarization-dependence of
the electronic (pair-breaking) Raman response for the recently discovered
non-centrosymmetric superconductors at zero temperature. Possible applications
include the systems CePt$_3$Si and Li$_2$Pd$_x$Pt$_{3-x}$B, which reflect the
two important classes of the involved spin-orbit coupling. We provide
analytical expressions for the Raman vertices for these two classes and
calculate the polarization-dependence of the electronic spectra. We predict a
two-peak structure and different power laws with respect to the unknown
relative magnitude of the singlet and triplet contributions to the
superconducting order parameter, revealing a large variety of characteristic
fingerprints of the underlying condensate.
