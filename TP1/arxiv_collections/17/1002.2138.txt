A recent approach for constructing an exact 3D reduction of the 4D matrix
elements of the electromagnetic current for an interacting two-fermion system,
is briefly reviewed. The properties of the obtained 3D current, like the
fulfillment of the Ward-Takashi Identity and its Fock decomposition, will be
illustrated in relation with future applications to few-nucleon systems.
