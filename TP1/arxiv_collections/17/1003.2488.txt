We find that transport on scale-free random networks depends strongly on
degree-correlated network topologies whereas transport on
Erd$\ddot{o}$s-R$\acute{e}$nyi networks is insensitive to the degree
correlation. An approach for the tuning of scale-free network transport
efficiency through assortative or dissortative topology is proposed. We
elucidate that the unique transport behavior for scale-free networks results
from the heterogeneous distribution of degrees.
