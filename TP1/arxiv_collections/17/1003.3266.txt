An approach to textures pattern recognition based on inverse resonance
filtration (IRF) is considered. A set of principal resonance harmonics of
textured image signal fluctuations eigen harmonic decomposition (EHD) is used
for the IRF design. It was shown that EHD is invariant to textured image linear
shift. The recognition of texture is made by transfer of its signal into
unstructured signal which simple statistical parameters can be used for texture
pattern recognition. Anomalous variations of this signal point on foreign
objects. Two methods of 2D EHD parameters estimation are considered with the
account of texture signal breaks presence. The first method is based on the
linear symmetry model that is not sensitive to signal phase jumps. The
condition of characteristic polynomial symmetry provides the model stationarity
and periodicity. Second method is based on the eigenvalues problem of matrices
pencil projection into principal vectors space of singular values decomposition
(SVD) of 2D correlation matrix. Two methods of classification of retrieval from
textured image foreign objects are offered.
