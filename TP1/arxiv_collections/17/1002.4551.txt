Berry's phase is investigated for ultracold atoms in a frequency modulated
optical lattice. It is shown that Berry's phase appears due to Bloch
oscillation and the periodic motion of the optical lattice. Particularly,
Berry's phase for ultracold atoms under the gravitational force in an
oscillating tight-binding optical lattice is calculated analytically. It is
found that the Berry's phase depends linearly on the amplitude of the
oscillation of the optical lattice.
