Implementations of two algorithms for the transverse Mercator projection are
described; these achieve accuracies close to machine precision. One is based on
the exact equations of Thompson and Lee and the other uses an extension of
Krueger's series for the projection to higher order. The exact method provides
an accuracy of 9 nm over the entire ellipsoid, while the errors in the series
method are less than 5 nm within 3900 km of the central meridian. In each case,
the meridian convergence and scale are also computed with similar accuracy. The
speed of the series method is competitive with other less accurate algorithms
and the exact method is about 5 times slower.
