It is shown that irreversible classical cellular automata can be performed by
quantum algorithm using additional ancilla registers. The algorithm for
cellular automata states analysis has been proposed. This algorithm is based on
the elements of Grover's algorithm - the inversion of amplitude of searched
states and unitary transform of inversion about the average. The inversion of
searched states amplitudes can be performed by quantum Toffoli gate.
