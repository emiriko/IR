This note describes a parameter-free implementation of Central Force
Optimization for deterministic multidimensional search and optimization. The
user supplies only one input: the objective function to be maximized, nothing
more. The CFO equations of motion are simplified by assigning specific values
to CFO's basic parameters, and this particular algorithmic implementation also
includes hardwired internal parameters so that none is user-specified. The
algorithm's performance is tested against a widely used suite of twenty three
benchmark functions and compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. CFO
performs very well indeed. Includes important update 20 March 2010 addressing
the issue of different probes coalescing into one.
