We report the detection of Voigt spectral line profiles of radio
recombination lines (RRLs) toward Sagittarius B2(N) with the 100-m Green Bank
Telescope (GBT). At radio wavelengths, astronomical spectra are highly
populated with RRLs, which serve as ideal probes of the physical conditions in
molecular cloud complexes. An analysis of the Hn(alpha) lines presented herein
shows that RRLs of higher principal quantum number (n>90) are generally
divergent from their expected Gaussian profiles and, moreover, are well
described by their respective Voigt profiles. This is in agreement with the
theory that spectral lines experience pressure broadening as a result of
electron collisions at lower radio frequencies. Given the inherent technical
difficulties regarding the detection and profiling of true RRL wing spans and
shapes, it is crucial that the observing instrumentation produce flat baselines
as well as high sensitivity, high resolution data. The GBT has demonstrated its
capabilities regarding all of these aspects, and we believe that future
observations of RRL emission via the GBT will be crucial towards advancing our
knowledge of the larger-scale extended structures of ionized gas in the
interstellar medium (ISM).
