We present basics of the gauged superfield approach to constructing
N-superconformal multi-particle Calogero-type systems developed in
arXiv:0812.4276, arXiv:0905.4951 and arXiv:0912.3508. This approach is
illustrated by the multi-particle systems possessing SU(1,1|1) and
D(2,1;\alpha) supersymmetries, as well as by the model of new N=4
superconformal quantum mechanics.
