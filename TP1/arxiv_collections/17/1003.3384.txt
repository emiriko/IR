Scaling limits are analyzed for stochastic continuous opinion dynamics
systems, also known as gossip models. In such models, agents update their
vector-valued opinion to a convex combination (possibly agent- and
opinion-dependent) of their current value and that of another observed agent.
It is shown that, in the limit of large agent population size, the empirical
opinion density concentrates, at an exponential probability rate, around the
solution of a probability-measure-valued ordinary differential equation
describing the system's mean-field dynamics. Properties of the associated
initial value problem are studied. The asymptotic behavior of the solution is
analyzed for bounded-confidence opinion dynamics, and in the presence of an
heterogeneous influential environment.
