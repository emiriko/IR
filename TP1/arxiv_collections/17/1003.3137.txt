Topological insulators (TIs) constitute a new class of materials with unique
properties resulting from the relativistic-like character and topological
protection of their surface states. Theory predicts these to exhibit a rich
variety of physical phenomena such as anomalous magneto-electric coupling and
Majorana excitations. Although TI surface states have been detected in Bi-based
compounds by ARPES and STM techniques, electrical control over their density,
required for most transport experiments, remains a challenge. Existing
materials are heavily doped in the bulk, thus preventing electrical tunability
of the surface states and their integration into topological quantum electronic
devices. Here we show that electronic transport in metallic Bi2Se3 nanoscale
devices can be controlled by tuning the surface density via the electric field
effect. By choosing an appropriate high-k dielectric, we are able to shift the
Fermi energy through the charge neutrality point of the surface states,
resulting in ambipolar transport characteristics reminiscent of those observed
in graphene. Combining magnetotransport, field effect, and geometry dependent
experiments, we provide transport measurements of the surface state mobility,
and identify likely scattering mechanisms by measuring its temperature
dependence.
