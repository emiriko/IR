A measurement is presented of inelastic photo- and electroproduction of J/psi
mesons in ep scattering at HERA. The data were recorded with the H1 detector in
the period from 2004 to 2007. Single and double differential cross sections are
determined and the helicity distributions of the J/psi mesons are analysed. The
results are compared to theoretical predictions in the colour singlet model and
in the framework of non-relativistic QCD. Calculations in the colour singlet
model using a k_T factorisation ansatz are able to give a good description of
the data, while colour singlet model calculations to next-to-leading order in
collinear factorisation underestimate the data.
