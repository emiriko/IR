The kinematics of the decay of a bound proton is governed by the proton
spectral function. We evaluate this quantity in 16O using the information from
nuclear physics experiments. It also includes a correlated part. The
reliability of this evaluation is sufficient to open the possibility of
correlated cuts in the missing mass and momentum variables in order to identify
the decay events from the bound protons with a possible increase of the signal
to noise ratio.
