A short review of the motivations for supersymmetry in astrophysics and
particle physics is given. Despite the amount of theoretical research conducted
in the past decades, no observational evidence for supersymmetry has yet been
found. While a large part of the community is expecting supersymmetry to be
discovered in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), some of the basic arguments in
favor are disputed here. Since it is not excluded that the author's view may be
biased by his research, he proposes a bet on the discovery of supersymmetric
particles: According to the philosopher Immanuel Kant, the bet marks the
difference between persuasion and conviction.
