A transcriptome-wide blood expression dataset of Parkinson's disease (PD)
patients and controls was analyzed under the hypothesis-rich mathematical
framework. The analysis pointed towards differential expression in blood cells
in many of the processes known or predicted to be disrupted in PD. We suggest
that circulating blood cells in PD patients can be in a full-blown
PD-expression state. We put forward the hypothesis that sporadic PD can
originate as a case of hematopoietic stem cell/differentiation process
expression program defect and suggest this research direction deserves further
investigation.
