We demonstrate the application of orbital k-space tomography for the analysis
of the bonding occurring at metal-organic interfaces. Using angle-resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES), we probe the spatial structure of the
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the former lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) of one monolayer
3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic-dianhydride (PTCDA) on Ag(110) and (111)
surfaces and in particular the influence of the hybridization between the
orbitals and the electronic states of the substrate. We are able to quantify
and localize the substrate contribution to the LUMO and thus prove the
metal-molecule hybrid character of this complex state.
