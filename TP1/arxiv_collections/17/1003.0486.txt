RHESSI and Hinode observations of a GOES B-class flare are combined to
investigate the origin of 15 MK plasma. The absence of any detectable hard
X-ray emission coupled with weak blueshifted emission lines (indicating upward
velocities averaging only 14 km/s) suggests that this was a result of direct
heating in the corona, as opposed to nonthermal electron precipitation causing
chromospheric evaporation. These findings are in agreement with a recent
hydrodynamical simulation of microflare plasmas which found that higher
temperatures can be attained when less energy is used to accelerate electrons
out of the thermal distribution. In addition, unusual redshifts in the 2 MK Fe
XV line (indicating downward velocities of 14 km/s) were observed cospatial
with one of the flare ribbons during the event. Downflows of such high
temperature plasma are not predicted by any common flare model.
