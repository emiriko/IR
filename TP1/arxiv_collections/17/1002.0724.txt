We formulate a nonlinear continuum model of a graphene sheet supported by a
flat rigid substrate. The sheet is parallel to the substrate and loaded on a
pair of opposite edges. A typical cross-section of the sheet is modeled as an
elastica. We use elementary techniques from bifurcation theory to investigate
how the buckling of the sheet depends on the boundary conditions, the
composition of the substrate, and the length of the sheet. We also present
numerical results that illustrate snap-buckling of the sheet.
