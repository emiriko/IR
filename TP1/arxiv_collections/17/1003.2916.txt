We study a network of three populations of coupled phase oscillators with
identical frequencies. The populations interact nonlocally, in the sense that
all oscillators are coupled to one another, but more weakly to those in
neighboring populations than to those in their own population. Using this
system as a model system, we discuss for the first time the influence of
network topology on the existence of so called chimera states. In this context,
the network with three populations represents an interesting case because the
populations may either be connected as a triangle, or as a chain, thereby
representing the simplest discrete network of either a ring or a line segment
of oscillator populations. We introduce a special parameter that allows us to
study the effect of breaking the triangular network structure, and to vary the
network symmetry continuously such that it becomes more and more chain-like. By
showing that chimera states only exist for a bounded set of parameter values we
demonstrate that their existence depends strongly on the underlying network
structures. We conclude that chimeras exist on networks with a chain-like
character, which indicates that it might be possible to observe chimeras on a
continuous line segment of oscillators.
