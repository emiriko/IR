A system far from equilibrium is characterized by unconventional many-body
dynamical effects, which can lead to anomalous density fluctuations and mass
transport. Interestingly, these structural and dynamic features often emerge
simultaneously in driven dissipative systems. Here we seek an origin of their
co-existence by numerical simulations of a two-dimensional driven granular gas.
We reveal a causal link between superdiffusive transport and giant density
fluctuations. The kinetic dissipation upon particle collisions depends on the
relative velocity of colliding particles, and is responsible for the
self-generated large-scale persistent directional motion of particles that
underlies the link between structure and transport. This scenario is supported
by a simple scaling argument.
