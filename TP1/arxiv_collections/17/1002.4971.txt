Motivated from recent experiments in kappa-(BEDT-TTF)_2Cu_2(CN)_3, dielectric
and magnetic properties in a dimer-Mott insulator are studied. We derive the
effective Hamiltonian where the number of electron per dimer is taken to be
one. Charge and magnetic structures in finite temperature are obtained by using
the mean-field and Monte-Carlo methods. Magnetic and ferroelectric phases are
exclusive with each other. Dielectric fluctuation is remarkable near a phase
boundary between dimer-Mott phase and ferroelectric phase. Implications of the
present results for kappa-(BEDT-TTF)_2Cu_2(CN)_3 are discussed.
