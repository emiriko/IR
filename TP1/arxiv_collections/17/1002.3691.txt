We investigate the quasiparticle-mass enhancement in the Hubbard model on the
frustrated kagome lattice by using a cluster extension of the dynamical
mean-field theory. By analyzing the cluster density matrix, we find a hierarchy
of energy scale among charge, spin, and chirality degrees of freedom. Large
amount of entropy associated with the chirality is released at a much lower
temperature than other energy scales for spin and charge fluctuations, leading
to a sharp peak in the specific heat and the single-particle spectrum. The
results manifest a generic mechanism of mass enhancement driven by an emergent
composite degree of freedom under geometrical frustration.
