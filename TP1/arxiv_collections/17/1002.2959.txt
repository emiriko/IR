Relationships that exist between the classical, Shannon-type, and
geometric-based approaches to sampling are investigated. Some aspects of coding
and communication through a Gaussian channel are considered. In particular, a
constructive method to determine the quantizing dimension in Zador's theorem is
provided. A geometric version of Shannon's Second Theorem is introduced.
Applications to Pulse Code Modulation and Vector Quantization of Images are
addressed.
