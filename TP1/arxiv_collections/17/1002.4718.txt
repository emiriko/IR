Single top production processes are usually regarded as the ones in which
V_tb can be directly measured at hadron colliders. We show that the analysis of
the single top rapidity distribution in t-channel and tW production can also
set direct limits on V_td. At LHC with 10 fb^-1 at 14 TeV the combined limits
on V_td may be reduced by almost a factor of two when the top rapidity
distribution is used. This also implies that the limits on V_tb can also be
reduced by 15%, since both parameters as well as V_ts must be simultaneously
obtained from a global fit to data. At Tevatron the explotation of this
distribution would require very high statistics.
