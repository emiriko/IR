The model of stochastic acceleration of particles by turbulence has been
successful in explaining many observed features of solar flares. Here we
demonstrate a new method to obtain the accelerated electron spectrum and
important acceleration model parameters from the high resolution hard X-ray
observations provided by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic
Imager (RHESSI). In our model, electrons accelerated at or very near the loop
top produce thin target bremsstrahlung emission there and then escape downward
producing thick target emission at the loop footpoints. Based on the electron
flux spectral images obtained by the regularized inversion of the RHESSI count
visibilities, we derive several important parameters for the acceleration
model. We apply this procedure to the 2003 November 03 solar flare, which shows
a loop top source up to 100--150 keV in hard X-ray with a relatively flat
spectrum in addition to two footpoint sources. The results imply presence of
strong scattering and a high density of turbulence energy with a steep spectrum
in the acceleration region.
