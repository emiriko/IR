We have studied the quasiparticle excitation spectrum of the superconductor
Ba8Si46 by local tunneling spectroscopy. Using high energy resolution achieved
in Superconductor-Superconductor junctions we observed tunneling conductance
spectra of a non-conventional shape revealing two distinct energy gaps, DeltaL
= 1.3meV and DeltaS = 0.9meV. The analysis of tunneling data evidenced that
DeltaL is the principal superconducting gap while DeltaS, smaller and more
dispersive, is induced into an intrinsically non-superconducting band of the
material by the inter-band quasiparticle scattering.
