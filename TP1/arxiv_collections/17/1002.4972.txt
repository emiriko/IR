In this paper, we study the global geometry of complete, constant mean
curvature hypersurfaces embedded in n-manifolds. More precisely, we give
conditions that imply properness of such surfaces and prove the existence of
fixed size one-sided regular neighborhoods for certain constant mean curvature
hypersurfaces in certain n-manifolds.
