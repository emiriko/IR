Wigner and Husimi transforms have long been used for the phase-space
reformulation of Schr\"odinger-type equations, and the study of the
corresponding semiclassical limits. Most of the existing results provide
approximations in appropriate weak topologies. In this work we are concerned
with semiclassical limits in the strong topology, i.e. approximation of Wigner
functions by solutions of the Liouville equation in $L^2$ and Sobolev norms.
The results obtained improve the state of the art, and highlight the role of
potential regularity, especially through the regularity of the Wigner equation.
It must be mentioned that the strong convergence can be shown up to $O(log
\frac{1}\epsilon)$ time-scales, which is well known to be, in general, the
limit of validity of semiclassical asymptotics.
