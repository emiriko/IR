Cryptographic hash functions play a central role in cryptography. Hash
functions were introduced in cryptology to provide message integrity and
authentication. MD5, SHA1 and RIPEMD are among the most commonly used message
digest algorithm. Recently proposed attacks on well known and widely used hash
functions motivate a design of new stronger hash function. In this paper a new
approach is presented that produces 192 bit message digest and uses a modified
message expansion mechanism which generates more bit difference in each working
variable to make the algorithm more secure. This hash function is collision
resistant and assures a good compression and preimage resistance.
