We developed an automated procedure for the identification of transient
brightenings in images from the X-ray telescope on-board Hinode taken with an
Al Poly filter in the equatorial coronal holes, polar coronal holes, and the
quiet Sun with and without transient coronal holes. We found that in comparison
to the quiet Sun, the boundaries of coronal holes are abundant with brightening
events including areas inside the coronal holes where closed magnetic field
structures are present. The visual analysis of these brightenings revealed that
around 70% of them in equatorial, polar and transient coronal holes and their
boundaries show expanding loop structures and/or collimated outflows. In the
quiet Sun only 30% of the brightenings show flows with most of them appearing
to be contained in the solar corona by closed magnetic field lines. This
strongly suggests that magnetic reconnection of co-spatial open and closed
magnetic field lines creates the necessary conditions for plasma outflows to
large distances. The ejected plasma always originates from pre-existing or
newly emerging (at X-ray temperatures) bright points. The present study
confirms our findings that the evolution of loop structures known as coronal
bright points is associated with the small-scale changes of coronal hole
boundaries. The loop structures show an expansion and eruption with the trapped
plasma consequently escaping along the "quasi" open magnetic field lines. These
ejections appear to be triggered by magnetic reconnection, e.g. the so-called
interchange reconnection between the closed magnetic field lines (BPs) and the
open magnetic field lines of the coronal holes. We suggest that these plasma
outflows are possibly one of the sources of the slow solar wind.
