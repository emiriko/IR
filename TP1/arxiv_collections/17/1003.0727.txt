This paper aims to study the $\a$-volume of $\cK$, an arbitrary subset of the
set of $N\times N$ density matrices. The $\a$-volume is a generalization of the
Hilbert-Schmidt volume and the volume induced by partial trace. We obtain
two-side estimates for the $\a$-volume of $\cK$ in terms of its Hilbert-Schmidt
volume. The analogous estimates between the Bures volume and the $\a$-volume
are also established. We employ our results to obtain bounds for the
$\a$-volume of the sets of separable quantum states and of states with positive
partial transpose (PPT). Hence, our asymptotic results provide answers for
questions listed on page 9 in \cite{K. Zyczkowski1998} for large $N$ in the
sense of $\a$-volume.
