We report the first comprehensive investigation of the organic superconductor
(TMTSF)2PF6 in the vicinity of the endpoint of the spin density wave - metal
phase transition where phase coexistence occurs. At low temperature, the
transition of metallic domains towards superconductivity is used to reveal the
various textures. In particular, we demonstrate experimentally the existence of
1D and 2D metallic domains with a cross-over from a filamentary
superconductivity mostly along the c?-axis to a 2D superconductivity in the
b?c-plane perpendicular to the most conducting direction. The formation of
these domain walls may be related to the proposal of a soliton phase in the
vicinity of the critical pressure of the (TMTSF)2PF6 phase diagram.
