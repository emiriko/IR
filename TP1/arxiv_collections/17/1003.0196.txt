For the first time, a systematic analysis of the high energy behavior of
total and diffractive proton-proton cross sections is performed within the
Reggeon Field Theory framework, based on the resummation of all significant
contributions of enhanced Pomeron diagrams to all orders with respect to the
triple-Pomeron coupling. The importance of different classes of enhanced graphs
is investigated and it is demonstrated that absorptive corrections due to
"net"-like enhanced diagrams and due to Pomeron "loops" are both significant
and none of those classes can be neglected at high energies. A comparison with
other approaches based on partial resummations of enhanced diagrams is
performed. In particular, important differences are found concerning the
predicted high energy behavior of total and single high mass diffraction
proton-proton cross sections, with our values of $\sigma_{pp}^{{\rm tot}}$ at
$\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV being some $25\div40$% higher and with the energy rise of
$\sigma_{{\rm HM}}^{{\rm SD}}$ saturating well below the LHC energy. The main
causes for those differences are analyzed and explained.
