We estimate the production cross sections of hypernuclei in projectile like
fragment (PLF) in heavy ion collisions. The discussed scenario for the
formation cross section of hypernucleus is: (a) Lambda particles are produced
in the participant region but have a considerable rapidity spread and (b)
Lambda with rapidity close to that of the PLF and total momentum (in the rest
system of PLF) up to Fermi motion can then be trapped and produce hypernuclei.
The process (a) is considered here within Heavy Ion Jet Interacting Generator
HIJING-BBbar model and the process (b) in the canonical thermodynamic model
(CTM). We estimate the production cross-sections for light hypernuclei for C +
C at 3.7 GeV total nucleon-nucleon center of mass energy and for Ne+Ne and
Ar+Ar collisions at 5.0 GeV. By taking into account explicitly the impact
parameter dependence of the colliding systems, it is found that the cross
section is different from that predicted by the coalescence model and large
discrepancy is obtained for 6_He and 9_Be hypernuclei.
