The controlled and coherent manipulation of individual quantum systems is a
fundamental key for the development of quantum information processing. The
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in diamond is a promising system since its
photoluminescence is perfectly stable at room temperature and its electron spin
can be optically read-out at the individual level. We review here the
experiments currently realized in our laboratory, concerning the use of single
NV color center as single photon source and the coherent magnetic manipulation
of the electron spin associated to a single NV color center. Furthermore, we
demonstrate a nanoscopy experiment based on saturation absorption effect, which
allows to optically pin-point single NV color center at a sub-? resolution.
This opens a possibility to independently address two or multiple
magnetically-coupled single NV color centers, which is a necessary step toward
the realization of a diamond-based quantum computer.
