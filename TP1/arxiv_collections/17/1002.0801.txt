We present a complete derivation of the formula of Smythe [Phys.Rev.72, 1066
(1947)] giving the electromagnetic field diffracted by an aperture created in a
perfectly conducting plane surface. The reasoning, valid for any excitating
field and any hole shape, makes use only of the free scalar Green function for
the Helmoltz equation without any reference to a Green dyadic formalism. We
compare our proof with the one previously given by Jackson and connect our
reasoning to the general Huygens Fresnel theorem.
