We briefly review the hadronization pictures adopted in the LUND String
Fragmentation Model(LSFM), Webber Cluster Fragmentation Model(WCFM) and Quark
Combination Model(QCM), respectively. Predictions of hadron multiplicity,
baryon to meson ratios and baryon-antibaryon flavor correlations, especially
related to heavy hadrons at $Z^0$ factory obtained by LSFM and QCM are
reported.
