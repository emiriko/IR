We present particular and unique solutions of singlet and non-singlet
Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov- Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations in
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) at low-x. We obtain t-evolutions of
deuteron, proton, neutron and difference and ratio of proton and neutron
structure functions at low-x from DGLAP evolution equations. The results of
t-evolutions are compared with HERA and NMC lox-x and low-Q2 data. We also
compare our result of t-evolution of proton structure function with a recent
global parameterization.
