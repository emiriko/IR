We give an explicit subtraction-free formula for the energy function in
tensor products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals for symmetric powers of the
standard representation of U_q'(\hat sl_n). The energy function is shown to be
the tropicalization of a stretched staircase shape loop Schur function. The
latter were introduced by the authors in the study of total positivity in loop
groups.
