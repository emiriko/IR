A measurement of the $\ttbar$ production cross section in $\ppbar$ collisions
at $\sqrt{{\rm s}}$ = 1.96 TeV using events with two leptons, missing
transverse energy, and jets is reported. The data were collected with the CDF
II Detector. The result in a data sample corresponding to an integrated
luminosity 2.8 fb$^{-1}$ is: $\sigma_{\ttbar}$ = 6.27 $\pm$ 0.73(stat) $\pm$
0.63(syst) $\pm$ 0.39(lum) pb. for an assumed top mass of 175 GeV/$c^{2}$.
