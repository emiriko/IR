Resonance states of a two-electron quantum dot are studied using a
variational expansion with both real basis-set functions and complex scaling
methods. The two-electron entanglement (linear entropy) is calculated as a
function of the electron repulsion at both sides of the critical value, where
the ground (bound) state becomes a resonance (unbound) state. The linear
entropy and fidelity and double orthogonality functions are compared as methods
for the determination of the real part of the energy of a resonance. The
complex linear entropy of a resonance state is introduced using complex scaling
formalism.
