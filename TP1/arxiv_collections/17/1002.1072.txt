We have carried out first principles all-electron calculations of the
(001)-projected 2D electron momentum density and the directional Compton
profiles along the [100], [001] and [110] directions in the Fe-based
superconductor LaOFeAs within the framework of the local density approximation.
We identify Fermi surface features in the 2D electron momentum density and the
directional Compton profiles, and discuss issues related to the observation of
these features via Compton scattering experiments.
