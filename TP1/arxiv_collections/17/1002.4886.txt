In these lecture notes we derive a generic holographic string theory
realization of a p-wave superconductor and superfluid. For this purpose we also
review basic D-brane physics, gauge/gravity methods at finite temperature, key
concepts of superconductivity and recent progress in distinct realizations of
holographic superconductors and superfluids. Then we focus on a D3/D7-brane
construction yielding a superconducting or superfluid vector-condensate. The
corresponding gauge theory is 3+1-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory with SU(N) color and SU(2) flavor symmetry. It shows a second order
phase transition to a phase in which a U(1) subgroup of the SU(2) symmetry is
spontaneously broken and typical superconductivity signatures emerge, such as a
conductivity (pseudo-)gap and the Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect. Condensates of
this nature are comparable to those recently found experimentally in p-wave
superconductors such as a ruthenate compound. A string picture of the pairing
mechanism and condensation is given using the exact knowledge of the
corresponding field theory degrees of freedom.
