Previous observations of the middle-aged pulsar Geminga with XMM-Newton and
Chandra have shown an unusual pulsar wind nebula (PWN), with a 20" long central
(axial) tail directed opposite to the pulsar's proper motion and two 2' long,
bent lateral (outer) tails. Here we report on a deeper (78 ks) Chandra
observation and a few additional XMM-Newton observations of the Geminga PWN.
The new Chandra observation has shown that the axial tail, which includes up to
three brighter blobs, extends at least 50" (i.e., 0.06 d_{250} pc) from the
pulsar. It also allowed us to image the patchy outer tails and the emission in
the immediate vicinity of the pulsar with high resolution. The PWN luminosity,
L_{0.3-8 keV} ~ 3\times 10^{29} d_{250}^2 erg/s, is lower than the pulsar's
magnetospheric luminosity by a factor of 10. The spectra of the PWN elements
are rather hard (photon index ~ 1). Comparing the two Chandra images, we found
evidence of PWN variability, including possible motion of the blobs along the
axial tail. The X-ray PWN is the synchrotron radiation from relativistic
particles of the pulsar wind; its morphology is connected with the supersonic
motion of Geminga. We speculate that the outer tails are either (1) a sky
projection of the limb-brightened boundary of a shell formed in the region of
contact discontinuity, where the wind bulk flow is decelerated by shear
instability, or (2) polar outflows from the pulsar bent by the ram pressure
from the ISM. In the former case, the axial tail may be a jet emanating along
the pulsar's spin axis, perhaps aligned with the direction of motion. In the
latter case, the axial tail may be the shocked pulsar wind collimated by the
ram pressure.
