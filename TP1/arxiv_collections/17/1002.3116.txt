In this paper we study the well-known Khasminskii-Type Theorem, i.e. the
existence and uniqueness of solutions of stochastic evolution delay equations,
under local Lipschitz condition, but without linear growth condition. We then
establish one stochastic LaSalle-type theorem for asymptotic stability analysis
of strong solutions. Moreover, several examples are established to illustrate
the power of our theories.
