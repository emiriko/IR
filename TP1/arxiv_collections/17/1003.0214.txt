Radial sonic crystals (RSC) are fluidlike structures infinitely periodic
along the radial direction. They have been recently introduced and are only
possible thanks to the anisotropy of specially designed acoustic metamaterials
[see Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 103} 064301 (2009)]. We present here a comprehensive
analysis of two-dimensional RSC shells, which consist of a cavity defect
centered at the origin of the crystal and a finite thickness crystal shell
surrounded by a fluidlike background. We develop analytic expressions
demonstrating that, like for other type of crystals (photonic or phononic) with
defects, these shells contain Fabry-Perot like resonances and strongly
localized modes. The results are completely general and can be extended to
three dimensional acoustic structures and to their photonic counterparts, the
radial photonic crystals.
