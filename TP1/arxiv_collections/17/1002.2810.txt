If a K3 surface is a fiber of a flat projective morphisms over a connected
noetherian scheme over the complex number field, then any smooth connected
fiber is also a K3 surface. Observing this, Professor Nam-Hoon Lee asked if the
same is true for higher dimensional Calabi-Yau fibers. We shall give an
explicit negative answer to his question as well as a proof of his initial
observation.
