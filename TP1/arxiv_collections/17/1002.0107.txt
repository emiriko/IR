The one-pion exchange current corrections to isoscalar and isovector magnetic
moments of double-closed shell nuclei plus and minus one nucleon with
$A=15,17,39$ and 41 have been studied in the relativistic mean field (RMF)
theory and compared with previous relativistic and non-relativistic results. It
has been found that the one-pion exchange current gives a negligible
contribution to the isoscalar magnetic moments but a significant correction to
the isovector ones. However, the one-pion exchange current doesn't improve the
description of nuclear isovector magnetic moments for the concerned nuclei.
