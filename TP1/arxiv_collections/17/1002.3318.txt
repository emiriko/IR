Let $k$ be a field of characteristic zero and let $K=k(t)$ be the rational
function field over $k$. In this paper we combine a formula of Ulmer for ranks
of certain Jacobians over $K$ with strong upper bounds on endomorphisms of
Jacobians due to Zarhin to give many examples of higher dimensional, absolutely
simple Jacobians over $k(t)$ with bounded rank in towers $k(t^{1/p^r})$. In
many cases we are able to compute the rank at every layer of the tower.
