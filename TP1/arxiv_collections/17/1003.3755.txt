We study the transport properties of a one-dimensional hard-core bosonic
lattice gas coupled to two particle reservoirs at different chemical potentials
which generate a current flow through the system. In particular, the influence
of random fluctuations of the underlying lattice on the stationary-state
properties is investigated. We show analytically that the steady-state density
presents a linear profile. The local steady-state current obeys the Fourier law
$j=-\kappa(\tau)\nabla n $ where $\tau$ is a typical timescale of the lattice
fluctuations and $\nabla n$ the density gradient imposed by the reservoirs.
