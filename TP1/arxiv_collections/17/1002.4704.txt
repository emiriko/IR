Masuda (2008) provided the characterization of real Bott manifolds in terms
of three operations on upper triangular matrices. We provide a combinatorial
characterization of real Bott manifolds up to diffeomorphism in terms of
operations on directed acyclic graphs. Our observation leads to several new
invariants of real Bott manifolds.
