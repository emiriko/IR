We attract attention that interaction of particle in downstream undulator
with its own wavelet emitted in upstream undulator could be as strong as with
the frictional field in undulator itself. This phenomenon could be used for
enhancement of signal from pickup undulators in optical stochastic cooling
methods as well as for increase of damping.
