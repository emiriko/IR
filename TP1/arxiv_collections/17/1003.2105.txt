We use the basic equations that predict the emission of gravitational waves
according to the Einstein gravitation theory to calculate the luminosities and
the amplitudes of the waves generated by binary stars, pulsations of neutron
stars, wobbling of deformed neutron stars, oscillating quadrupoles, rotating
bars and collapsing and bouncing cores of supernovas. This paper was written to
graduate and postgraduate students of Physics.
