This volume contains the papers presented at the 3rd Workshop "From Biology
To Concurrency and back", FBTC 2010, held in Paphos, Cyprus, on March 27, 2010,
as satellite event of the Joint European Conference on Theory and Practice of
Software, ETAPS 2010.
  The Workshop aimed at gathering together researchers with special interest at
the convergence of life and computer science, with particular focus on the
application of techniques and methods from concurrency. The papers contained in
this volume present works on modelling, analysis, and validation of biological
behaviours using concurrency-inspired methods and platforms, and bio-inspired
models and tools for describing distributed interactions.
