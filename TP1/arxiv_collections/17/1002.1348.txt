Using Spitzer IRAC observations from the SAGE-SMC Legacy program and archived
Spitzer IRAC data, we investigate dust production in 47 Tuc, a nearby massive
Galactic globular cluster. A previous study detected infrared excess,
indicative of circumstellar dust, in a large population of stars in 47 Tuc,
spanning the entire Red Giant Branch (RGB). We show that those results suffered
from effects caused by stellar blending and imaging artifacts and that it is
likely that no stars below about 1 mag from the tip of the RGB are producing
dust. The only stars that appear to harbor dust are variable stars, which are
also the coolest and most luminous stars in the cluster.
