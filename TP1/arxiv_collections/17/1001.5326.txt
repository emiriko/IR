This dissertation presents investigations on dynamics of discrete-time
quantum walk and some of its applications. Quantum walks has been exploited as
an useful tool for quantum algorithms in quantum computing. Beyond quantum
computational purposes, it has been used to explain and control the dynamics in
various physical systems. In order to use the quantum walk to its fullest
potential, it is important to know and optimize the properties purely due to
quantum dynamics and in presence of noise. Various studies of its dynamics in
the absence and presence of noise have been reported. We propose new approaches
to optimize the dynamics, discuss symmetries and effect of noise on the quantum
walk. Making use of its properties, we propose the use of quantum walk as an
efficient new tool for various applications in physical systems and quantum
information processing. In the first and second part of this dissertation, we
discuss evolution process of the quantum walks, propose and demonstrate the
optimization of discrete-time quantum walk using quantum coin operation from
SU(2) group and discuss some of its properties. We investigate symmetry
operations and environmental effects on dynamics of the walk on a line and an
n-cycle highlighting the interplay between noise and topology. Using the
properties and behavior of quantum walk discussed in part two, in part three we
propose the application of quantum walk to realize quantum phase transition in
optical lattice, that is to efficiently control and redistribute ultracold
atoms in optical lattice. We also discuss the implementation scheme. Another
application we consider is creation of spatial entanglement using quantum walk
on a quantum many body system.
