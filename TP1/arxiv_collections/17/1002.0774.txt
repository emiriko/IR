We propose a general non-perturbative scheme that quantitatively maps the
low-energy sector of spin-1/2 frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets to
effective Generalized Quantum Dimer Models. We develop the formal lattice
independent frame and establish some important results on (i) the locality of
the generated Hamiltonians (ii) how full resummations can be performed in this
renormalization scheme. The method is then applied to the much debated kagome
antiferromagnet for which a fully resummed effective Hamiltonian - shown to
capture the essential properties and provide deep insights on the microscopic
model [D. Poilblanc, M. Mambrini and D. Schwandt, arXiv:0912.0724] - is
derived.
