The subject of this paper is modification of cooperative spontaneous emission
by a nonuniform medium, with nonuniform distributions of electromagnetic field.
A brief analyzis is presented and it is postulated, that if spontaneous
emission from an atom is strongly suppressed, cooperative emission with another
atom may be a preferred emission channel and counteract the suppression.
