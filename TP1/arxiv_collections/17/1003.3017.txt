A systematic investigation of the relationship between different redshift
estimation schemes for more than 91000 quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) Data Release 6 (DR6) is presented. The publicly available SDSS quasar
redshifts are shown to possess systematic biases of Dz/(1+z)>=0.002 (600km/s)
over both small (dz~0.1) and large (dz~1) redshift intervals. Empirical
relationships between redshifts based on i) CaII H & K host galaxy absorption,
ii) quasar [OII] 3728, iii) [OIII] 4960,5008 emission, and iv)
cross-correlation (with a master quasar template) that includes, at increasing
quasar redshift, the prominent MgII 2799, CIII] 1908 and CIV 1549 emission
lines, are established as a function of quasar redshift and luminosity. New
redshifts in the resulting catalogue possess systematic biases a factor of ~20
lower compared to the SDSS redshift values; systematic effects are reduced to
the level of Dz/(1+z)<10^-4 (30km/s) per unit redshift, or <2.5x10^-5 per unit
absolute magnitude. Redshift errors, including components due both to internal
reproducibility and the intrinsic quasar-to-quasar variation among the
population, are available for all quasars in the catalogue. The improved
redshifts and their associated errors have wide applicability in areas such as
quasar absorption outflows, quasar clustering, quasar-galaxy clustering and
proximity-effect determinations.
