The proton-proton and proton-eta' invariant mass distributions have been
determined for the pp -> ppeta' reaction at an excess energy of Q = 16.4 MeV.
The measurement was carried out using the COSY-11 detector setup and the proton
beam of the cooler synchrotron COSY. The shapes of the determined invariant
mass distributions are similar to those of the pp -> ppeta reaction and reveal
an enhancement for large relative proton-proton momenta. This result, together
with the fact that the proton-eta interaction is much stronger that the
proton-eta' interaction, excludes the hypothesis that the observed enhancement
is caused by the interaction between the proton and the meson.
