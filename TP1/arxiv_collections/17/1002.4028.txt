We review the features of the pomeron in the S-matrix theory and in quantum
field theory. We extend those general properties to the pomeron of closed
bosonic string theory in a Minkowskian background. We compute the couplings of
the pomeron to the lowest mass levels of closed bosonic string states in flat
space. We recognize the deviation from the linearity of the Regge trajectories
in a five dimensional anti De Sitter background.
