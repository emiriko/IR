We perform a suite of high-resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics
simulations to investigate the orbital decay and mass evolution of massive
black hole (MBH) pairs down to scales of ~30 pc during minor mergers of disk
galaxies. Our simulation set includes star formation and accretion onto the
MBHs, as well as feedback from both processes. We consider 1:10 merger events
starting at z~3, with MBH masses in the sensitivity window of the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna, and we follow the coupling between the merger
dynamics and the evolution of the MBH mass ratio until the satellite galaxy is
tidally disrupted. While the more massive MBH accretes in most cases as if the
galaxy were in isolation, the satellite MBH may undergo distinct episodes of
enhanced accretion, owing to strong tidal torques acting on its host galaxy and
to orbital circularization inside the disk of the primary galaxy. As a
consequence, the initial 1:10 mass ratio of the MBHs changes by the time the
satellite is disrupted. Depending on the initial fraction of cold gas in the
galactic disks and the geometry of the encounter, the mass ratios of the MBH
pairs at the time of satellite disruption can stay unchanged or become as large
as 1:2. Remarkably, the efficiency of MBH orbital decay correlates with the
final mass ratio of the pair itself: MBH pairs that increase significantly
their mass ratio are also expected to inspiral more promptly down to
nuclear-scale separations. These findings indicate that the mass ratios of MBH
pairs in galactic nuclei do not necessarily trace the mass ratios of their
merging host galaxies, but are determined by the complex interplay between gas
accretion and merger dynamics.
