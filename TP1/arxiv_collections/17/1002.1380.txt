We present new VLBI observations at 5 GHz of a complete sample of Brightest
Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) in nearby Abell Clusters (distance class <3). Combined
with data from the literature, this provides parsec-scale information for 34
BCGs. Our analysis of their parsec scale radio emission and cluster X-ray
properties shows a possible dichotomy between BCGs in cool core clusters and
those in non cool core clusters. Among resolved sources, those in cool core
clusters tend to have two-sided parsec-scale jets, while those in less relaxed
clusters have predominantly one-sided parsec-scale jets. We suggest that this
difference could be the result of interplay between the jets and the
surrounding medium. The one-sided structure in non cool core clusters could be
due to Doppler boosting effects in relativistic, intrinsically symmetric jets;
two-sided morphology in cool core clusters is likely related to the presence of
heavy and mildly relativistic jets slowed down on the parsec-scale. Evidence of
recurrent activity are also found in BCGs in cool core clusters.
