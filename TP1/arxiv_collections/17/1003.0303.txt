We discuss a possible mechanism of the spin-transfer induced oscillations of
a vortex in the free layer of spin-valve nanostructures, in which the polarizer
layer has a planar magnetization. We demonstrate that if such planar polarizer
is essentially non-uniform, steady gyrotropic vortex motion with large
amplitude can be excited. The best excitation efficiency is obtained for a
circular magnetization distribution in the polarizer. In this configuration,
the conditions for the onset of the oscillations depend on the vortex chirality
but not on the direction of its core.
