We consider fermion correlators in non-abelian holographic superconductors.
The spectral function of the fermions exhibits several interesting features
such as support in displaced Dirac cones and an asymmetric distribution of
normal modes. These features are compared to similar ones observed in angle
resolved photoemission experiments on high T_c superconductors. Along the way
we elucidate some properties of p-wave superconductors in AdS_4 and discuss the
construction of SO(4) superconductors.
