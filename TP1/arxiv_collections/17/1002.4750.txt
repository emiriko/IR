A simple self-referenced non destructive method is proposed for measuring the
cutoff wavelength of microstructured optical fibers (MOFs). It is based on the
analysis of the time dependent optical power transmitted through a bow-tie slit
rotating in the far-field pattern of the fiber under test. As a first
demonstration, the cutoff wavelength of a 2m MOF sample is measured with a
precision of 10nm, in good agreement with theoretical predictions.
