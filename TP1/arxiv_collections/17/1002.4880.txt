A theory of position of massive bodies is proposed that results in an
observable quantum behavior of geometry at the Planck scale, $t_P$. Departures
from classical world lines in flat spacetime are described by Planckian
noncommuting operators for position in different directions, as defined by
interactions with null waves. The resulting evolution of position wavefunctions
in two dimensions displays a new kind of directionally-coherent quantum noise
of transverse position. The amplitude of the effect in physical units is
predicted with no parameters, by equating the number of degrees of freedom of
position wavefunctions on a 2D spacelike surface with the entropy density of a
black hole event horizon of the same area. In a region of size $L$, the effect
resembles spatially and directionally coherent random transverse shear
deformations on timescale $\approx L/c$ with typical amplitude $\approx
\sqrt{ct_PL}$. This quantum-geometrical "holographic noise" in position is not
describable as fluctuations of a quantized metric, or as any kind of
fluctuation, dispersion or propagation effect in quantum fields. In a Michelson
interferometer the effect appears as noise that resembles a random Planckian
walk of the beamsplitter for durations up to the light crossing time. Signal
spectra and correlation functions in interferometers are derived, and predicted
to be comparable with the sensitivities of current and planned experiments. It
is proposed that nearly co-located Michelson interferometers of laboratory
scale, cross-correlated at high frequency, can test the Planckian noise
prediction with current technology.
