This article presents the first computation of the complete bispectrum of the
cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies arising from the evolution
of all cosmic fluids up to second order, including neutrinos. Gravitational
couplings, electron density fluctuations and the second order Boltzmann
equation are fully taken into account. Comparison to limiting cases that
appeared previously in the literature are provided. These are regimes for which
analytical insights can be given. The final results are expressed in terms of
equivalent fNL for different configurations. It is found that for moments up to
lmax=2000, the signal generated by non-linear effects is equivalent to fNL~5
for both local-type and equilateral-type primordial non-Gaussianity.
