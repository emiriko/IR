Since the breakthroughs in 2005 which have led to long term stable solutions
of the binary black hole problem in numerical relativity, much progress has
been made. I present here a short summary of the state of the field, including
the capabilities of numerical relativity codes, recent physical results
obtained from simulations, and improvements to the methods used to evolve and
analyse binary black hole spacetimes.
