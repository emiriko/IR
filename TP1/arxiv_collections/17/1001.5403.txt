Charged and neutral B decays into two charged pions and a charged or a
neutral kaon are analyzed within the QCD factorization scheme where final state
interactions before and after hadronization are included. The K*(892) and
K*(1430) resonance effects are taken into account using the presently known
pion-Kaon strange vector and scalar form factors. The weak decay amplitudes,
which are calculated at leading power in Lambda_QCD/m_b and at the
next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant, include the hard
scattering and annihilation contributions. The end point divergences of these
weak final state interactions are controlled by two complex parameters
determined through a fit to the available effective mass and helicity angle
distribution, CP asymmetry and K*(892) branching ratio data. The predicted
K*(1430) branching ratios and the calculated direct CP violation asymmetries
are compared to the Belle and BABAR Collaboration data.
