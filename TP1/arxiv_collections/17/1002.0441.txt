We address the problem of spin-resolved scattering through spin-orbit
nanostructures in graphene, i.e., regions of inhomogeneous spin-orbit coupling
on the nanometer scale. We discuss the phenomenon of spin-double refraction and
its consequences on the spin polarization. Specifically, we study the
transmission properties of a single and a double interface between a normal
region and a region with finite spin-orbit coupling, and analyze the
polarization properties of these systems. Moreover, for the case of a single
interface, we determine the spectrum of edge states localized at the boundary
between the two regions and study their properties.
