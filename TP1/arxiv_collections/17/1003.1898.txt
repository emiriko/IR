Basic uniform pseudo-random number generators are implemented on ATI Graphics
Processing Units (GPU). The performance results of the realized generators
(multiplicative linear congruential (GGL), XOR-shift (XOR128), RANECU, RANMAR,
RANLUX and Mersenne Twister (MT19937)) on CPU and GPU are discussed. The
obtained speed-up factor is hundreds of times in comparison with CPU. RANLUX
generator is found to be the most appropriate for using on GPU in Monte Carlo
simulations. The brief review of the pseudo-random number generators used in
modern software packages for Monte Carlo simulations in high-energy physics is
present.
