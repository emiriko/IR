Magnetic and phonon excitations in the antiferromagnet CoO with an unquenched
orbital angular momentum are studied by neutron scattering. Results of energy
scans in several Brillouin zones in the (HHL) plane for energy transfers up to
16 THz are presented. The measurements were performed in the antiferromagnetic
ordered state at 6 K (well below TN~290 K) as well as in the paramagnetic state
at 450 K. Several magnetic excitation modes are identified from the dependence
of their intensity on wavevector and temperature. Within a Hund's rule model
the excitations correspond to fluctuations of coupled orbital and spin degrees
of freedom whose bandwidth is controlled by interionic superexchange. The
different <111> ordering domains give rise to several magnetic peaks at each
wavevector transfer.
