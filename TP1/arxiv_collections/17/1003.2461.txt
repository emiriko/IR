In this paper we derive a probabilistic representation of the deterministic
3-dimensional Navier--Stokes equations in the presence of spatial boundaries.
The formulation in the absence of spatial boundaries was done by the authors in
[Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 61 (2008) 330--345]. While the formulation in the
presence of boundaries is similar in spirit, the proof is somewhat different.
One aspect highlighted by the formulation in the presence of boundaries is the
nonlocal, implicit influence of the boundary vorticity on the interior fluid
velocity.
