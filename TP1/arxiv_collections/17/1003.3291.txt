In these pedagogical lectures, we present the techniques of the AdS/CFT
correspondence which can be applied to the study of real time dynamics of a
strongly coupled plasma system. These methods are based on solving
gravitational Einstein's equations on the string/gravity side of the AdS/CFT
correspondence. We illustrate these techniques with applications to the
boost-invariant expansion of a plasma system. We emphasize the common
underlying AdS/CFT description both in the large proper time regime where
hydrodynamic dynamics dominates, and in the small proper time regime where the
dynamics is far from equilibrium. These AdS/CFT methods provide a fascinating
arena interrelating General Relativity phenomenae with strongly coupled gauge
theory physics.
