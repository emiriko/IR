The Hubbard model has been employed successfully to understand many aspects
of correlation driven physical properties, in particular, the magnetic order in
itenerant electron systems. In some systems such as Heusler alloys, manganites
etc., it is known that, in addition to magnetic order, distortion induced by
Jahn-Teller(J-T) effect also exists. In this paper, based on two-fold
degenerate Hubbard model, the influence of magnetic order on J-T distortion is
investigated. The electron correlation is treated using a spectral density
approach and J-T interaction is added to the model. We find that magnetic order
and structural distortion coexist at low temperature $T$ for a certain range of
electron correlation strength $U$, J-T coupling strength $G$ and band
occupation $n$. At T=0, for a given $n$ and $U$, magnetic order is present but
distortion appears only for a $G$ larger than a critical value. We also studied
the temperature dependence of lattice strain and magnetization choosing a $G$
close to the critical value.
