The analysis of correlations between fluctuations of alpha- and beta-decay
rates for different radio-active elements is carried out. These fluctuations
exceed significantly errors of measurements in many cases. They have the
periodical character and reveal definite spatial directions. We suggest that
the observed fluctuations are caused by the unique physical reason connected
with the global anisotropy of physical space and by the new force.
