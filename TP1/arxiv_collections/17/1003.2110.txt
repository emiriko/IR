We combine stroboscopic laser excitation with stochastic photoactivation and
super-resolution fluorescence imaging. This makes it possible to record
hundreds of diffusion trajectories of small protein molecules in single
bacterial cells with millisecond time resolution and sub-diffraction limited
spatial precision. We conclude that the small protein mEos2 exhibits normal
diffusion in the bacterial cytoplasm with a diffusion coefficient of 13.1 -+
1.2 \mu m^2 s^(-1). This investigation lays the groundwork for studying
single-molecule binding and dissociation events for a wide range of
intracellular processes.
