The decay of the Langmuir waves in dense plasmas is not accurately predicted
by the prevalent Landau damping theory. A dielectric function theory is
introduced, predicting much higher damping than the Landau damping theory. This
strong damping is in better agreement with the experimentally observed data in
metals. It is shown that the strong plasmon decay leads to the existence of a
parameter regime where the backward Raman scattering is unstable while the
forward Raman scattering is stable. This regime may be used to create intense
x-ray pulses, by means of the the backward Raman compression. The optimal pulse
duration and intensity is estimated.
