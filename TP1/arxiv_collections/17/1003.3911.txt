GRB afterglows are among the best examples of astrophysical sources requiring
a true multiwavelength observational approach. Radiation processes and main
physical ingredients can only be disentangled with knowledge of their spectral
and temporal properties through the largest possible band, i.e. from the X-ray
down to radio. We now briefly review some of the most relevant observational
findings recently obtained through optical observations.
