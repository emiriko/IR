With entropic interpretation of gravity proposed by Verlinde, we obtain the
Friedmann equation of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe for the deformed
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. It is shown that, when the parameter of
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity $\omega\rightarrow \infty$, the modified Friedmann
equation will go back to the one in Einstein gravity. This results may imply
that the entropic interpretation of gravity is effective for the deformed
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity.
