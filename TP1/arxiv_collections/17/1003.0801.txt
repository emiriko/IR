Recent experiments with ultra-cold atoms have demonstrated the possibility of
realizing experimentally fermionic superfluids with imbalanced spin
populations. We discuss how these developments have shed a new light on a half-
century old open problem in condensed matter physics, and raised new
interrogations of their own.
