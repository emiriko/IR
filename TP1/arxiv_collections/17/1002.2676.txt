The Hilbert space in PT-symmetric quantum mechanics is formulated as a linear
vector space with a dynamic inner product. The most general PT-symmetric matrix
Hamiltonians are constructed for 2*2 and 3*3 cases. In the former case, the
PT-symmetric Hamiltonian represents the most general matrix Hamiltonian with a
real spectrum. In both cases, Hermitian matrices are shown to be special cases
of PT-symmetric matrices. This finding confirms and strengthens the early
belief that the PT-symmetric quantum mechanics is a generalization of the
conventional Hermitian quantum mechanics.
