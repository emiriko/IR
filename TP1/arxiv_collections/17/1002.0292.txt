The VBFNLO program package is a collection of Monte Carlo programs for the
calculation of NLO QCD corrections to vector boson fusion cross sections,
double and triple vector boson production, or the production of two electroweak
bosons in association with an additional jet. An overview is given of the
processes and features implemented in VBFNLO. WWgamma and Wgamma jet production
are discussed as examples.
