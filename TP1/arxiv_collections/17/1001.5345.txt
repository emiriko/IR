There has been much success in describing the limiting spatial fluctuations
of growth models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. A proper
rescaling of time should introduce a non-trivial temporal dimension to these
limiting fluctuations. In one-dimension, the KPZ class has the dynamical
scaling exponent $z=3/2$, that means one should find a universal space-time
limiting process under the scaling of time as $t\,T$, space like $t^{2/3} X$
and fluctuations like $t^{1/3}$ as $t\to\infty$.
  In this paper we provide evidence for this belief. We prove that under
certain hypotheses, growth models display temporal slow decorrelation. That is
to say that in the scalings above, the limiting spatial process for times $t\,
T$ and $t\, T+t^{\nu}$ are identical, for any $\nu<1$. The hypotheses are known
to be satisfied for certain last passage percolation models, the polynuclear
growth model, and the totally / partially asymmetric simple exclusion process.
Using slow decorrelation we may extend known fluctuation limit results to
space-time regions where correlation functions are unknown.
  The approach we develop requires the minimal expected hypotheses for slow
decorrelation to hold and provides a simple and intuitive proof which applied
to a wide variety of models.
