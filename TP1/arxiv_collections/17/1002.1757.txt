We theoretically investigate the non-equilibrium current through a quantum
dot coupled to one- dimensional electron leads, utilizing a controlled
frequency-dependent renormalization group (RG) approach. We compute the
non-equilibrium conductance for large bias voltages and address the interplay
between decoherence, Kondo entanglement and Luttinger physics. The combined
effect of large bias voltage and strong interactions in the leads, known to
stabilize two-channel Kondo physics, leads to non-trivial modifications of the
conductance. For weak interactions, we build an analogy to a dot coupled to
helical edge states of two-dimensional topological insulators.
