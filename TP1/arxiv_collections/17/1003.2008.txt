We derive compact analytical expressions for the coupled spin-charge
susceptibility of a clean helical metal at the surface of a three dimensional
topological insulator (TI). These expressions lead to unconventional
non-collinear RKKY interactions between two impurity magnetic moments placed on
the surface of a TI, and predict the generation of electric currents by
time-dependent magnetic moments. We determine the influence of gate and bias
voltages on the interlayer exchange coupling between two single-domain
ferromagnetic monolayers deposited on top of a TI.
