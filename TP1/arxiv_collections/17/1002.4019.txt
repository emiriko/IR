In query learning, the goal is to identify an unknown object while minimizing
the number of "yes" or "no" questions (queries) posed about that object. A
well-studied algorithm for query learning is known as generalized binary search
(GBS). We show that GBS is a greedy algorithm to optimize the expected number
of queries needed to identify the unknown object. We also generalize GBS in two
ways. First, we consider the case where the cost of querying grows
exponentially in the number of queries and the goal is to minimize the expected
exponential cost. Then, we consider the case where the objects are partitioned
into groups, and the objective is to identify only the group to which the
object belongs. We derive algorithms to address these issues in a common,
information-theoretic framework. In particular, we present an exact formula for
the objective function in each case involving Shannon or Renyi entropy, and
develop a greedy algorithm for minimizing it. Our algorithms are demonstrated
on two applications of query learning, active learning and emergency response.
