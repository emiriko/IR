Context : AKARI is the first Japanese astronomical satellite dedicated to
infrar ed astronomy. One of the main purposes of AKARI is the all-sky survey
performed with six infrared bands between 9 and 200um during the period from
2006 May 6 to
  2007 August 28. In this paper, we present the mid-infrared part (9um and 18um
b ands) of the survey carried out with one of the on-board instruments, the
Infrar ed Camera (IRC). Aims : We present unprecedented observational results
of the 9 and 18um AKARI al l-sky survey and detail the operation and data
processing leading to the point s ource detection and measurements. Methods :
The raw data are processed to produce small images for every scan and point
sources candidates, above the 5-sigma noise level per single scan, are der
ived. The celestial coordinates and fluxes of the events are determined
statisti cally and the reliability of their detections is secured through
multiple detect ions of the same source within milli-seconds, hours, and months
from each other. Results : The sky coverage is more than 90% for both bands. A
total of 877,091 s ources (851,189 for 9um, 195,893 for 18um) are confirmed and
included in the cur rent release of the point source catalogue. The detection
limit for point source s is 50mJy and 90mJy for the 9um and 18um bands,
respectively. The position accu racy is estimated to be better than 2".
Uncertainties in the in-flight absolute flux calibration are estimated to be 3%
for the 9um band and 4% for the 18um ban d. The coordinates and fluxes of
detected sources in this survey are also compar ed with those of the IRAS
survey and found to be statistically consistent.
