Private queries allow a user Alice to learn an element of a database held by
a provider Bob without revealing which element she was interested in, while
limiting her information about the other elements. We propose to implement
private queries based on a quantum key distribution protocol, with changes only
in the classical post-processing of the key. This approach makes our scheme
both easy to implement and loss-tolerant. While unconditionally secure private
queries are known to be impossible, we argue that an interesting degree of
security can be achieved, relying on fundamental physical principles instead of
unverifiable security assumptions in order to protect both user and database.
We think that there is scope for such practical private queries to become
another remarkable application of quantum information in the footsteps of
quantum key distribution.
