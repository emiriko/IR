We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of spatio-temporal
propagation effects in terahertz (THz) generation in gases using two-color
ionizing laser pulses. The observed strong broadening of the THz spectra with
increasing gas pressure reveals the prominent role of spatio-temporal reshaping
and of a plasma-induced blue-shift of the pump pulses in the generation
process. Results obtained from (3+1)-dimensional simulations are in good
agreement with experimental findings and clarify the mechanisms responsible for
THz emission.
