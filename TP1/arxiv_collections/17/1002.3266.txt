The possible role of precision flavour physics, and particularly of B
physics, in the next decade is briefly discussed. Few 2--3$\sigma$ deviations
from the Standard Model found in present $B$ data are reviewed as potential
forerunners of new physics signals to be looked for in next-generation
experiments. The perspectives for theoretical calculations, in particular those
based on lattice QCD, to match the expected progress in experimental precision
are also discussed.
