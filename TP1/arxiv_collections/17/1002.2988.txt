QCD with two flavours of massless colour-sextet quarks is considered as a
model for conformal/walking Technicolor. If this theory possess an infrared
fixed point, as indicated by 2-loop perturbation theory, it is a
conformal(unparticle) field theory. If, on the other hand, a chiral condensate
forms on the weak-coupling side of this would-be fixed point, the theory
remains confining. The only difference between such a theory and regular QCD is
that there is a range of momentum scales over which the coupling constant runs
very slowly (walks). In this first analysis, we simulate the lattice version of
QCD with two flavours of staggered quarks at finite temperatures on lattices of
temporal extent $N_t=4$ and 6. The deconfinement and chiral-symmetry
restoration couplings give us a measure of the scales associated with
confinement and chiral-symmetry breaking. We find that, in contrast to what is
seen with fundamental quarks, these transition couplings are very different.
$\beta=6/g^2$ for each of these transitions increases significantly from
$N_t=4$ and $N_t=6$ as expected for the finite temperature transitions of an
asymptotically-free theory. This suggests a walking rather than a conformal
behaviour, in contrast to what is observed with Wilson quarks. In contrast to
what is found for fundamental quarks, the deconfined phase exhibits states in
which the Polyakov loop is oriented in the directions of all three cube roots
of unity. At very weak coupling the states with complex Polyakov loops undergo
a transition to a state with a real, negative Polyakov loop.
