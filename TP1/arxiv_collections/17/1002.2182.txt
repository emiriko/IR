Microcalcifications in mammogram have been mainly targeted as a reliable
earliest sign of breast cancer and their early detection is vital to improve
its prognosis. Since their size is very small and may be easily overlooked by
the examining radiologist, computer-based detection output can assist the
radiologist to improve the diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we have proposed
an algorithm for detecting microcalcification in mammogram. The proposed
microcalcification detection algorithm involves mammogram quality enhancement
using multirresolution analysis based on the dyadic wavelet transform and
microcalcification detection by fuzzy shell clustering. It may be possible to
detect nodular components such as microcalcification accurately by introducing
shape information. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for
microcalcification detection is confirmed by experimental results.
