Let G=SL(E) be the special linear algebraic group on E where E is a finite
dimensional vector space over a field K of characteristic zero. In this paper
we study the canonical filtration of the dual G-module of global sections of a
G-linearized invertible sheaf L on the grassmannian G/P where P in G is the
parabolic subgroup stabilizing a subspace W in E. We classify the canonical
filtration as P-module and as a consequence we recover known formulas on the
P-module structure of the jet bundle J(L) on projective space. We study the
incidence complex for the invertible sheaf O(d) on the projective line and
prove it gives a resolution of the incidence scheme I(O(d)) of O(d). The aim of
this study is to apply it to the study of resolutions of ideal sheaves of
discriminants of invertible sheaves on grassmannians and flag varieties. We
also give an elementary proof of the Cauchy formula. Hence the paper introduce
the canonical filtration of an arbitrary irreducible SL(E)-module and initiates
a study of the canonical filtration as P-module where P in SL(E) is a parabolic
subgroup.
