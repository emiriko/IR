Dirac's method of classical analogy is employed to incorporate quantum
degrees of freedom into modern nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The proposed
formulation of dissipative quantum mechanics builds entirely upon the geometric
structures implied by commutators and canonical correlations. A lucid
formulation of a nonlinear quantum master equation follows from the
thermodynamic structure. Complex classical environments with internal structure
can be handled readily.
