We determine the helicity amplitudes A_1/2 and radiative decay widths in the
transition Lambda(1670) to gamma Y (Y=Lambda or Sigma^0). The Lambda(1670) is
treated as a dynamically generated resonance in meson-baryon chiral dynamics.
We obtain the radiative decay widths of the Lambda(1670) to gamma Lambda as 3
\pm 2 keV and to gamma Sigma^0 as 120 \pm 50 keV. Also, the Q^2 dependence of
the helicity amplitudes A_1/2 is calculated. We find that the K Xi component in
the Lambda(1670) structure, mainly responsible for the dynamical generation of
this resonance, is also responsible for the significant suppression of the
decay ratio Gamma_{gamma Lambda}/Gamma_{gamma Sigma^0}. A measurement of the
ratio would, thus, provide direct access to the nature of the Lambda(1670). To
compare the result for the Lambda(1670), we calculate the helicity amplitudes
A_1/2 for the two states of the Lambda(1405). Also, the analytic continuation
of Feynman parameterized integrals of more complicated loop amplitudes to the
complex plane is developed which allows for an internally consistent evaluation
of A_1/2.
