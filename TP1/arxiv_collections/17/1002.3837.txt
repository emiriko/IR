We present stochastic, finite-population formulations of the Crow-Kimura and
Eigen models of quasispecies theory, for fitness functions that depend in an
arbitrary way on the number of mutations from the wild type. We include back
mutations in our description. We show that the fluctuation of the population
numbers about the average values are exceedingly large in these physical models
of evolution. We further show that horizontal gene transfer reduces by orders
of magnitude the fluctuations in the population numbers and reduces the
accumulation of deleterious mutations in the finite population due to Muller's
ratchet. Indeed the population sizes needed to converge to the infinite
population limit are often larger than those found in nature for smooth fitness
functions in the absence of horizontal gene transfer. These analytical results
are derived for the steady-state by means of a field-theoretic representation.
Numerical results are presented that indicate horizontal gene transfer speeds
up the dynamics of evolution as well.
