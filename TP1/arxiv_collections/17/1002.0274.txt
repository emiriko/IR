This is a set of four lectures presented at the Theoretical Advanced Study
Institute (TASI-09) in June 2009. The goal of the lectures is to introduce
students to some of the basic ideas and tools required for theoretical analysis
of collider data. Several examples of Standard Model processes at
electron-positron and hadron colliders are considered to illustrate these
ideas. In addition, a general strategy for formulating searches for physics
beyond the Standard Model is outlined. The lectures conclude with a brief
survey of recent, ongoing and future searches for the Higgs boson and
supersymmetric particles.
