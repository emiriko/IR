The vicinity of the unidentified EGRET source 3EG J1420-6038 has undergone
extensive study in the search for counterparts, revealing the energetic young
pulsar PSR J1420-6048 and its surrounding wind nebula as a likely candidate for
at least part of the emission from this bright and extended gamma-ray source.
We report on new Suzaku observations of PSR J1420-6048, along with analysis of
archival XMM Newton data. The low background of Suzaku permits mapping of the
extended X-ray nebula, indicating a tail stretching ~8' north of the pulsar.
The X-ray data, along with archival radio and VHE data, hint at a pulsar
birthsite to the North, and yield insights into its evolution and the
properties of the ambient medium. We further explore such properties by
modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the extended nebula.
