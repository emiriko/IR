This article is a report of 25 years of Cosmic Microwave Background
activities at INPE. Starting from balloon flights to measure the dipole
anisotropy caused by the Earth's motion inside the CMB radiation field, whose
radiometer was a prototype of the DMR radiometer on board COBE satellite,
member of the group cross the 90s working both on CMB anisotropy and foreground
measurements. In the 2000s, there was a shift to polarization measurements and
to data analysis, mostly focusing on map cleaning, non-gaussianity studies and
foreground characterization.
