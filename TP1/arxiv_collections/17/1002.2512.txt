Fractional generalizations of the Poisson process and branching Furry process
are considered. The link between characteristics of the processes, fractional
differential equations and Levy stable densities are discussed and used for
construction of the Monte Carlo algorithm for simulation of random waiting
times in fractional processes. Numerical calculations are performed and limit
distributions of the normalized variable Z=N/<N> are found for both processes.
