This paper addresses the radio interface problematic for MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc
NETwork) applications. Here we propose to study the radio reconfigurability in
order to provide a unique physical layer which is able to deal with all MANET
applications. For implementing this reconfigurable physical layer, we propose
to use Impulse Radio Ultra WideBand (IRUWB). This paper presents also our two
level design approach for obtaining our reconfigurable IR-UWB receiver on FPGA
(Field Programmable Gate Array).
