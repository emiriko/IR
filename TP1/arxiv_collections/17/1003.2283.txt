The behavior of various thermodynamic functions in the dependence of degree
of energy band occupation and temperature in the one-band tight binding
approximation for the crystal was studied. The Fermi energy, density of states,
degeneracy temperature, chemical potential, partition function, thermodynamic
po-tential, energy, free energy, entropy, heat capacity, spin magnetization and
initial susceptibility were calculated. The limited energetic spectrum leads to
the peculiarities in the behavior of these quantities in comparison with free
electron gas.
