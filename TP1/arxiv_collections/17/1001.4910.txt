We discuss high-angular resolution observations of ammonia toward four
candidate high-mass starless cores (HMSCs). The cores were identified by the
Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST) during its 2005
survey of the Vulpecula region where 60 compact sources were detected
simultaneously at 250, 350, and 500 micron. Four of these cores, with no
IRAS-PSC or MSX counterparts, were observed with the NRAO Very Large Array
(VLA) in the NH3(1,1) and (2,2) spectral lines. Our observations indicate that
the four cores are cold (Tk <~ 14K) and show a filamentary and/or clumpy
structure. They also show a significant velocity substructure within ~1km/s.
The four BLAST cores appear to be colder and more quiescent than other
previously observed HMSC candidates, suggesting an earlier stage of evolution.
