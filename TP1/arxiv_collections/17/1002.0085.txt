Entanglement, as studied in quantum information science, and non-local
quantum correlations, as studied in condensed matter physics, are fundamentally
akin to each other. However, their relationship is often hard to quantify due
to the lack of a general approach to study both on the same footing. In
particular, while entanglement and non-local correlations are properties of
states, both arise from symmetries of global operators that commute with the
system Hamiltonian. Here, we introduce a framework for completely classifying
the local and non-local properties of all such global operators, given the
Hamiltonian and a bi-partitioning of the system. This framework is limited to
descriptions based on stabilizer quantum codes, but may be generalized. We
illustrate the use of this framework to study entanglement and non-local
correlations by analyzing global symmetries in topological order, distribution
of entanglement and entanglement entropy.
