A PCP is a proof system for NP in which the proof can be checked by a
probabilistic verifier. The verifier is only allowed to read a very small
portion of the proof, and in return is allowed to err with some bounded
probability. The probability that the verifier accepts a false proof is called
the soundness error, and is an important parameter of a PCP system that one
seeks to minimize. Constructing PCPs with sub-constant soundness error and, at
the same time, a minimal number of queries into the proof (namely two) is
especially important due to applications for inapproximability.
  In this work we construct such PCP verifiers, i.e., PCPs that make only two
queries and have sub-constant soundness error. Our construction can be viewed
as a combinatorial alternative to the "manifold vs. point" construction, which
is the only construction in the literature for this parameter range. The
"manifold vs. point" PCP is based on a low degree test, while our construction
is based on a direct product test. We also extend our construction to yield a
decodable PCP (dPCP) with the same parameters. By plugging in this dPCP into
the scheme of Dinur and Harsha (FOCS 2009) one gets an alternative construction
of the result of Moshkovitz and Raz (FOCS 2008), namely: a construction of
two-query PCPs with small soundness error and small alphabet size.
  Our construction of a PCP is based on extending the derandomized direct
product test of Impagliazzo, Kabanets and Wigderson (STOC 09) to a derandomized
parallel repetition theorem. More accurately, our PCP construction is obtained
in two steps. We first prove a derandomized parallel repetition theorem for
specially structured PCPs. Then, we show that any PCP can be transformed into
one that has the required structure, by embedding it on a de-Bruijn graph.
