We give a universal recipe for constructing nonlinear entanglement witnesses
able to detect non-classical correlations in arbitrary systems of
distinguishable and/or identical particles for an arbitrary number of
constituents. The constructed witnesses are expressed in terms of expectation
values of observables. As such they are, at least in principle, measurable in
experiments
