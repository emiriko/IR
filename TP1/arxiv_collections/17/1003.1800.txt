We observed an enhanced atom-dimer relaxation due to the existence of Efimov
states in a three-component mixture of 6Li atoms. We measured the
magnetic-field dependence of the atom-dimer loss coefficient in the mixture of
atoms in state |1> and dimers formed in states |2> and |3>, and found two peaks
corresponding to the degeneracy points of the |23> dimer energy level and
energy levels of Efimov trimers. We found that the locations of these peaks
disagree with universal theory predictions, in a way that cannot be explained
by non-universal two-body properties. We constructed theoretical models that
characterize the non-universal three-body physics of three-component 6Li atoms
in the low energy domain.
