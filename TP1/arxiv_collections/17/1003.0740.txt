We provide nonlinear realization of supergravity with an arbitrary number of
supersymmetries by means of coset construction. The number of gravitino degrees
of freedom counts the number of supersymmetries, which will be possibly probed
in future experiments. We also consider goldstino embedding in the construction
to discuss the relation to nonlinear realization with rigid supersymmetries.
