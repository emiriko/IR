We present early results of the application of a method which uses multicolor
photometry and spectroscopy for \ell discrimination. This method has been
successfully applied to the pulsating hot subdwarf Balloon 090100001. Here we
apply the method to QQ Vir (PG1325+101). This star was observed
spectroscopically and photometrically in 2008. Details on spectroscopy can be
found in Telting et al. (2010) while photometry and preliminary results on \ell
discrimination are provided here. The main aim of this work was to compare the
value of the \ell parameter derived for the main mode in QQ Vir to previously
published values derived by using different methods.
