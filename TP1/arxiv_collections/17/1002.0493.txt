We present the discovery of the orbital period of Swift J1626.6-5156. Since
its discovery in 2005, the source has been monitored with Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer, especially during the early stage of the outburst and into the X-ray
modulating episode. Using a data span of $\sim$700 days, we obtain the orbital
period of the system as 132.9 days. We find that the orbit is close to a
circular shape with an eccentricity 0.08, that is one of the smallest among
Be/X-ray binary systems. Moreover, we find that the timescale of the X-ray
modulations varied, which led to earlier suggestions of orbital periods at
about a third and half of the orbital period of Swift J1626.6-5156.
