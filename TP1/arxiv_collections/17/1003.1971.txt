Preliminary results of a photon detector combining a Micromegas like
multiplier coated with a UV-sensitive CsI photocathode are described. The
multiplier is made in a CMOS compatible InGrid technology, which allows to
post-process it directly on the surface of an imaging IC. This method is aimed
at building light-sensitive imaging detectors where all elements are
monolithically integrated. We show that the CsI photocathode deposited in the
InGrid mesh does not alter the device performance. Maximum gains of ~6000 were
reached in a single-grid element operated in Ar/CH4, with a 2% Ion Back Flow
fraction returning to the photocathode.
