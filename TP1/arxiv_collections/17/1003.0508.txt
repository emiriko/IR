Equations for the wave-averaged three-dimensional momentum equations have
been published in this journal. It appears that these equations are not
consistent with the known depth-integrated momentum balance, especially over a
sloping bottom. These equations should thus be considered with caution as they
can produce erroneous flows, in particular outside of the surf zone. It is
suggested that the inconsistency in the equations may arise from the different
averaging operators applied to the different terms of the momentum equation. It
is concluded that other forms of the momentum equations, expressed in terms of
the quasi-Eulerian velocity, are better suited for three dimensional modelling
of wave-current interactions.
