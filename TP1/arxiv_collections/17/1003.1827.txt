Digital image plays a vital role in the early detection of cancers, such as
prostate cancer, breast cancer, lungs cancer, cervical cancer. Ultrasound
imaging method is also suitable for early detection of the abnormality of
fetus. The accurate detection of region of interest in ultrasound image is
crucial. Since the result of reflection, refraction and deflection of
ultrasound waves from different types of tissues with different acoustic
impedance. Usually, the contrast in ultrasound image is very low and weak edges
make the image difficult to identify the fetus region in the ultrasound image.
So the analysis of ultrasound image is more challenging one. We try to develop
a new algorithmic approach to solve the problem of non clarity and find
disorder of it. Generally there is no common enhancement approach for noise
reduction. This paper proposes different filtering techniques based on
statistical methods for the removal of various noise. The quality of the
enhanced images is measured by the statistical quantity measures:
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE).
