We describe the dissociation of a diatomic Feshbach molecule due to a
time-varying external magnetic field in a realistic trap and guide setting. An
analytic expression for the asymptotic state of the two ultracold atoms is
derived, which can serve as a basis for the analysis of dissociation protocols
to generate motionally entangled states. For instance, the gradual dissociation
by sequences of magnetic field pulses may delocalize the atoms into
macroscopically distinct wave packets, whose motional entanglement can be
addressed interferometrically. The established relation between the applied
magnetic field pulse and the generated dissociation state reveals that
square-shaped magnetic field pulses minimize the momentum spread of the atoms.
This is required to control the detrimental influence of dispersion in a
recently proposed experiment to perform a Bell test in the motion of the two
atoms [C. Gneiting and K. Hornberger, Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 260503 (2008)].
