Successful implementation of California's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)
mandating 33 percent renewable energy generation by 2020 requires inclusion of
a robust strategy to mitigate increased risk of energy deficits (blackouts) due
to short time-scale (sub 1 hour) intermittencies in renewable energy sources.
Of these RPS sources, wind energy has the fastest growth rate--over 25%
year-over-year. If these growth trends continue, wind energy could make up 15
percent of California's energy portfolio by 2016 (wRPS15). However, the
hour-to-hour variations in wind energy (speed) will create large hourly energy
deficits that require installation of other, more predictable, compensation
generation capacity and infrastructure. Compensating for the energy deficits of
wRPS15 could potentially cost tens of billions in additional dollar-expenditure
for fossil and / or nuclear generation capacity. There is a real possibility
that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions will
miss the California Assembly Bill 32 (CA AB 32) target by a wide margin once
the wRPS15 compensation system is in place. This work presents a set of
analytics tools that show the impact of short-term intermittencies to help
policy makers understand and plan for wRPS15 integration. What are the right
policy choices for RPS that include wind energy?
