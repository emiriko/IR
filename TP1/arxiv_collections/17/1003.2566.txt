We match the density of energy eigenstates of a local field theory with that
of a random Hamiltonian order by order in a Taylor expansion. In our previous
work we assumed Lorentz symmetry of the field theory, which entered through the
dispersion relation. Here we extend that work to consider a generalized
dispersion relation and show that the Lorentz symmetric case is preferred, in
that the Lorentz symmetric dispersion relation gives a better approximation to
a random Hamiltonian than the other local dispersion relations we considered.
