In this paper, a novel data hiding technique is proposed, as an improvement
over the Fibonacci LSB data-hiding technique proposed by Battisti et al,based
on decomposition of a number (pixel-value) in sum of natural numbers. This
particular representation again generates a different set of (virtual)
bit-planes altogether, suitable for embedding purposes. We get more bit-planes
than that we get using Prime technique.These bit-planes not only allow one to
embed secret message in higher bit-planes but also do it without much
distortion, with a much better stego-image quality, and in a reliable and
secured manner, guaranteeing efficient retrieval of secret message. A
comparative performance study between the classical Least Significant Bit(LSB)
method, the Fibonacci LSB data-hiding technique and the proposed schemes
indicate that image quality of the stego-image hidden by the technique using
the natural decomposition method improves drastically against that using Prime
and Fibonacci decomposition technique. Experimental results also illustrate
that, the stego-image is visually indistinguishable from the original
cover-image. Also we show the optimality of our technique.
