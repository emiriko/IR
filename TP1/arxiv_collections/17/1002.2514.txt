We study the quantum channel version of Shannon's zero-error capacity
problem. Motivated by recent progress on this question, we propose to consider
a certain operator space as the quantum generalisation of the adjacency matrix,
in terms of which the plain, quantum and entanglement-assisted capacity can be
formulated, and for which we show some new basic properties.
  Most importantly, we define a quantum version of Lovasz' famous theta
function, as the norm-completion (or stabilisation) of a "naive" generalisation
of theta. We go on to show that this function upper bounds the number of
entanglement-assisted zero-error messages, that it is given by a semidefinite
programme, whose dual we write down explicitly, and that it is multiplicative
with respect to the natural (strong) graph product.
  We explore various other properties of the new quantity, which reduces to
Lovasz' original theta in the classical case, give several applications, and
propose to study the operator spaces associated to channels as "non-commutative
graphs", using the language of Hilbert modules.
