A novel audio binaural stimulus that generates rotational perceptions of
sound movement in brain at a particular predetermined frequency is referred as
gyrosonics. The influence of gyrosonics on autonomic nervous system of healthy
subjects has been examined by analyzing heart rate variability (HRV) in time-
and frequency- domain. The M-lagged Poincare plot shows that the parameters
SD1, SD2 and ratio SD12 (SD1/SD2) increases with lagged number M, and
M-dependence is well described by Pade' approximant $\chi \frac{1+\beta
M}{1+\gamma M}$ where values of $\chi$, $\beta$ and $ \gamma$ depend on
parameters SD1,SD2 and SD12. The values of these parameters for different M are
augmented after gyrosonic stimulation. The slope and magnitude of curvature of
SD1 and SD12 vs M plot increase considerably due to stimulation. The DFA
analysis exhibits decrease in value of exponent $\alpha$ due to stimulation.
This stimulation results slower Heart rate, higher values of the standard
deviation SD and the root-mean squared successive differences (RMSSD) in
RR-interval. The spectral power of both low (LF) - and high (HF) - frequency go
up due to the stimulation. The results suggest an improvement of the
sympatho-vagal balance due to this novel audio stimulus.
