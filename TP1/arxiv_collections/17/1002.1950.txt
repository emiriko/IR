As physical and information security boundaries have become increasingly
blurry many organizations are experiencing challenges with how to effectively

Security Risk Management (AESRM) offer some excellent suggestions for
integrating a converged security program. This paper reports on how
organizations have traditionally managed asset protection, why that is changing
and how to establish convergence to optimize security value to the business
within an enterprise.
