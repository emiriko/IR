Supmech, which is noncommutative Hamiltonian mechanics \linebreak (NHM)
(developed in paper I) with two extra ingredients : positive observable valued
measures (PObVMs) [which serve to connect state-induced expectation values and
classical probabilities] and the `CC condition' [which stipulates that the sets
of observables and pure states be mutually separating] is proposed as a
universal mechanics potentially covering all physical phenomena. It facilitates
development of an autonomous formalism for quantum mechanics. Quantum systems,
defined algebraically as supmech Hamiltonian systems with non-supercommutative
system algebras, are shown to inevitably have Hilbert space based realizations
(so as to accommodate rigged Hilbert space based Dirac bra-ket formalism),
generally admitting commutative superselection rules. Traditional features of
quantum mechanics of finite particle systems appear naturally. A treatment of
localizability much simpler and more general than the traditional one is given.
Treating massive particles as localizable elementary quantum systems, the
Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger wave functions with traditional Born interpretation appear
as natural objects for the description of their pure states and the
Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger equation for them is obtained without ever using a
classical Hamiltonian or Lagrangian. A provisional set of axioms for the
supmech program is given.
