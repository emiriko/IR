Machine Consciousness is the study of consciousness in a biological,
philosophical, mathematical and physical perspective and designing a model that
can fit into a programmable system architecture. Prime objective of the study
is to make the system architecture behave consciously like a biological model
does. Present work has developed a feasible definition of consciousness, that
characterizes consciousness with four parameters i.e., parasitic, symbiotic,
self referral and reproduction. Present work has also developed a biologically
inspired consciousness architecture that has following layers: quantum layer,
cellular layer, organ layer and behavioral layer and traced the characteristics
of consciousness at each layer. Finally, the work has estimated physical and
algorithmic architecture to devise a system that can behave consciously.
