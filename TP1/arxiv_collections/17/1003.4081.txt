In recent years, the use of non-analytical methods of computing such as fuzzy
logic, evolutionary computation, and neural networks has demonstrated the
utility and potential of these paradigms for intelligent control of mobile
robot navigation. In this paper, a theoretical model of a fuzzy based
controller for an autonomous mobile robot is developed. The paper begins with
the mathematical model of the robot that involves the kinematic model. Then,
the fuzzy logic controller is developed and discussed in detail. The proposed
method is successfully tested in simulations, and it compares the effectiveness
of three different set of membership of functions. It is shown that fuzzy logic
controller with input membership of three provides better performance compared
with five and seven membership functions.
