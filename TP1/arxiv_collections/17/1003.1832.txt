The modification of the Electroweak Model with 3-dimensional spherical
geometry in the matter fields space is suggested. The Lagrangian of this model
is given by the sum of the {\it free} (without any potential term) matter
fields Lagrangian and the standard gauge fields Lagrangian. The vector boson
masses are generated by transformation of this Lagrangian from Cartesian
coordinates to a coordinates on the sphere $S_3$. The limiting case of the
bosonic part of the modified model, which corresponds to the contracted gauge
group $SU(2;j)\times U(1)$ is discussed. Within framework of the limit model
Z-boson and electromagnetic fields can be regarded as an external ones with
respect to W-bosons fields in the sence that W-boson fields do not effect on
these external fields. The masses of all particles of the Electroweak Model
remain the same, but field interactions in contracted model are more simple as
compared with the standard Electroweak Model.
