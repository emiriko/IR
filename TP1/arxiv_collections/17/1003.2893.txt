The investigation of the mechanical loss of different silicon flexures in a
temperature region from 5 to 300 K is presented. The flexures have been
prepared by different fabrication techniques. A lowest mechanical loss of
$3\times10^{-8}$ was observed for a 130 $\mu$m thick flexure at around 10 K.
While the mechanical loss follows the thermoelastic predictions down to 50 K a
difference can be observed at lower temperatures for different surface
treatments. This surface loss will be limiting for all applications using
silicon based oscillators at low temperatures. The extraction of a surface loss
parameter using different results from our measurements and other references is
presented. We focused on structures that are relevant for gravitational wave
detectors. The surface loss parameter $\alpha_s$ = 0.5 pm was obtained. This
reveals that the surface loss of silicon is significantly lower than the
surface loss of fused silica.
