The negative parity bands in $^{220}$Th are analyzed within the dinuclear
system model which was previously used for describing the alternating-parity
bands in deformed actinides. The model is based on the assumption that cluster
type shapes are produced by the motion of nuclear system in the mass-asymmetry
coordinate. To describe the reflection-asymmetric collective modes
characterized by nonzero values of $K$, the intrinsic excitations of clusters
are taken into account. The angular momentum dependence of the parity splitting
and the staggering behavior of the $B(E1)/B(E2)$ ratios as functions of angular
momentum are explained.
