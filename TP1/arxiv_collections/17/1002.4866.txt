The addition of Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) has led to a dramatic increase in our ability to study the z>6 Universe.
The increase in the near-infrared (NIR) sensitivity of WFC3 over previous
instruments has enabled us to reach apparent magnitudes approaching 29 (AB).
This allows us to probe the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) continuum, redshifted
into the NIR at $z>6$. Taking advantage of the large optical depths at this
redshift, resulting in the Lyman-alpha break, we use a combination of WFC3
imaging and pre-existing Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) imaging to search
for z approx 7 over 4 fields. Our analysis reveals 29 new z approx 7 star
forming galaxy candidates in addition to 16 pre-existing candidates already
discovered in these fields. The improved statistics from our doubling of the
robust sample of z-drop candidates confirms the previously observed evolution
of the bright end of the luminosity function.
