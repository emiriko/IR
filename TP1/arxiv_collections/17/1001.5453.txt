Using the convex-roof extended negativity and the negativity of assistance as
quantifications of bipartite entanglement, we consider the possible
remotely-distributed entanglement. For two pure states $\ket{\phi}_{AB}$ and
$\ket{\psi}_{CD}$ on bipartite systems $AB$ and $CD$, we first show that the
possible amount of entanglement remotely distributed on the system $AC$ by
joint measurement on the system $BD$ is not less than the product of two
amounts of entanglement for the states $\ket{\phi}_{AB}$ and $\ket{\psi}_{CD}$
in two-qubit and two-qutrit systems. We also provide some sufficient
conditions, for which the result can be generalized into higher-dimensional
quantum systems.
