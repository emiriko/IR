We present calculations of the interplane charge dynamics in the normal state
of cuprate superconductors within the valence-bond dynamical mean-field theory.
We show that by varying the hole doping, the c-axis optical conductivity and
resistivity dramatically change character, going from metallic-like at large
doping to insulating-like at low-doping. We establish a clear connection
between the behavior of the c-axis optical and transport properties and the
destruction of coherent quasiparticles as the pseudogap opens in the antinodal
region of the Brillouin zone at low doping. We show that our results are in
good agreement with spectroscopic and optical experiments.
