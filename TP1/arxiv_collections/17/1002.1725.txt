We comment on the paper published by W.B. Gao, Q.Q. Liu, L.X. Yang, Y.Yu,
F.Y. Li, C.Q. Jin and S. Uchida in Phys. Rev. B 80, 094523 (2009) and give
alternate explanations for the enhanced superconductivity. The enhanced onset
Tc of 98K observed upon substituting Ba for Sr is attributed to optimal oxygen
ordering rather than to the increase in volume. Comparison with La2CuO(4+x)
samples suggest that the effect of disorder is overestimated.
