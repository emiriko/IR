We study the asymptotic properties of four-simplex amplitudes for various
four-dimensional spin foam models. We investigate the semi-classical limit of
the Ooguri, Euclidean and Lorentzian EPRL models using coherent states for the
boundary data. For some classes of geometrical boundary data, the asymptotic
formulae are given, in all three cases, by simple functions of the Regge action
for the four-simplex geometry.
