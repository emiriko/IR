Intrinsic transverse parton momenta pT play an important role in the
understanding of azimuthal/spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic
scattering (SIDIS) and the Drell-Yan process (DY). We review and update what is
presently known about pT from these processes. In particular, we address the
question to which extent data support the popular Gauss model for the
pT-distributions. We find that the Gauss model works very well, and observe
that the intrinsic transverse momenta in SIDIS and DY are compatible, which is
a support for the factorization approach. As a byproduct we recover a simple
but practical way of taking into account the energy dependence of
pT-distributions.
