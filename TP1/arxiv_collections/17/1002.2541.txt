Due to a first order phase transition, a compact star may have a
discontinuous distribution of baryon as well as electric charge densities, as
e.g. at the surface of a strange quark star. The induced separation of positive
and negative charges may lead to generation of supercritical electric fields in
the vicinity of such a discontinuity. We study this effect within a
relativistic Thomas-Fermi approximation and demonstrate that the strength of
the electric field depends strongly on the degree of sharpness of the surface.
The influence of strong electric fields on the stability of compact stars is
discussed. It is demonstrated that stable configurations appear only when the
counter-pressure of degenerate fermions is taken into consideration.
