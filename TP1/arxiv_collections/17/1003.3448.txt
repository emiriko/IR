Local Group dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies are the faintest
extragalactic stellar systems known. We examine recent data for these objects
in the plane of the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR). While some dwarf
spheroidals adhere to the BTFR, others deviate substantially. We examine the
residuals from the BTFR and find that they are not random. The residuals
correlate with luminosity, size, metallicity, ellipticity, and susceptibility
of the dwarfs to tidal disruption in the sense that fainter, more elliptical,
and tidally more susceptible dwarfs deviate farther from the BTFR. These
correlations disfavor stochastic processes and suggest a role for tidal
effects. We identify a test to distinguish between the {\Lambda}CDM and MOND
based on the orbits of the dwarf satellites of the Milky Way and how stars are
lost from them.
