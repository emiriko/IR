High cadence, multiwavelength, optical observations of a solar active region
are presented, obtained with the Swedish Solar Telescope. Two magnetic bright
points are seen to separate in opposite directions at a constant velocity of
2.8km/s. After a separation distance of approximately 4400km is reached,
multiple Ellerman bombs are observed in both H-alpha and Ca-K images. As a
result of the Ellerman bombs, periodic velocity perturbations in the vicinity
of the magnetic neutral line, derived from simultaneous MDI data, are generated
with amplitude +/- 6km/s and wavelength 1000km. The velocity oscillations are
followed by an impulsive brightening visible in H-alpha and Ca-K, with a peak
intensity enhancement of 63%. We interpret these velocity perturbations as the
magnetic field deformation necessary to trigger forced reconnection. A time
delay of approximately 3min between the H-alpha wing and Ca-K observations
indicate that the observed magnetic reconnection occurs at a height of 200km
above the solar surface. These observations are consistent with theoretical
predictions and provide the first observational evidence of microflare activity
driven by forced magnetic reconnection.
