We propose a blind interference alignment scheme for the vector broadcast
channel where the transmitter is equipped with M antennas and there are K
receivers, each equipped with a reconfigurable antenna capable of switching
among M preset modes. Without any knowledge of the channel coefficient values
at the transmitters and with only mild assumptions on the channel coherence
structure we show that MK/M+K-1 degrees of freedom are achievable. The key to
the blind interference alignment scheme is the ability of the receivers to
switch between reconfigurable antenna modes to create short term channel
fluctuation patterns that are exploited by the transmitter. The achievable
scheme does not require cooperation between transmit antennas and is therefore
applicable to the MxK X network as well. Only finite symbol extensions are
used, and no channel knowledge at the receivers is required to null the
interference.
