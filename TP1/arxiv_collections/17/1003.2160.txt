Based on a new version of the Hipparcos catalog and currently available
radial velocity data, we have searched for stars that either have encountered
or will encounter the solar neighborhood within less than 3 pc in the time
interval from -2 Myr to +2 Myr. Nine new candidates within 30 pc of the Sun
have been found. To construct the stellar orbits relative to the solar orbit,
we have used the epicyclic approximation. We show that, given the errors in the
observational data, the probability that the well-known star HIP 89 825 (GL
710) encountering with the Sun most closely falls into the Oort cloud is 0.86
in the time interval 1.45-+0.06 Myr. This star also has a nonzero probability,
0.0001, of falling into the region d<1000 AU, where its influence on Kuiper
Belt objects becomes possible.
