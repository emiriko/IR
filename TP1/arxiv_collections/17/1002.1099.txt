In this work, we discuss multiplayer pervasive games that rely on the use of
ad hoc mobile sensor networks. The unique feature in such games is that players
interact with each other and their surrounding environment by using movement
and presence as a means of performing game-related actions, utilizing sensor
devices. We discuss the fundamental issues and challenges related to these type
of games and the scenarios associated with them. We also present and evaluate
an example of such a game, called the "Hot Potato", developed using the Sun
SPOT hardware platform. We provide a set of experimental results, so as to both
evaluate our implementation and also to identify issues that arise in pervasive
games which utilize sensor network nodes, which show that there is great
potential in this type of games.
