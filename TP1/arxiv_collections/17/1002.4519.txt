We have established detailed magnetoelectric phase diagrams of
(Eu$_{0.595}$Y$_{0.405}$)$_{1-x}$Tb$_x$MnO$_3$ ($0 \le x \le 1$) and
(Eu,Y)$_{1-x}$Gd$_x$MnO$_3$ ($0 \le x \le 0.69$), whose average ionic radii of
$R$-site ($R$: rare earth) cations are equal to that of Tb$^{3+}$, in order to
reveal the effect of rare earth 4$f$ magnetic moments on the magnetoelectric
properties. In spite of the same $R$-site ionic radii, the magnetoelectric
properties of the two systems are remarkably different from each other. A small
amount of Tb substitution on $R$ sites ($x \sim 0.2$) totally destroys
ferroelectric polarization along the a axis ($P_a$), and an increase in Tb
concentration stabilizes the $P_c$ phase. On the other hand, Gd substitution
($x \sim 0.2$) extinguishes the $P_c$ phase, and slightly suppresses the $P_a$
phase. These results demonstrate that the magnetoelectric properties of
$R$MnO$_3$ strongly depend on the characteristics of the rare earth 4$f$
moments.
