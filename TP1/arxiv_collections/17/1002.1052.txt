We have used four telescopes at different longitudes to obtain
near-continuous lightcurve coverage of the star HD 80606 as it was transited by
its \sim 4-MJup planet. The observations were performed during the predicted
transit windows around the 25th of October 2008 and the 14th of February 2009.
Our data set is unique in that it simultaneously constrains the duration of the
transit and the planet's period. Our Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis of the
light curves, combined with constraints from radial-velocity data, yields
system parameters consistent with previously reported values. We find a
planet-to-star radius ratio marginally smaller than previously reported,
corresponding to a planet radius of Rp = 0.921 \pm 0.036RJup .
