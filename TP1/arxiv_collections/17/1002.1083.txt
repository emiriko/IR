We study the internal dynamical structure of the early-type lens galaxy SDSS
J0728+3835 at z = 0.206. The analysis is based on two-dimensional kinematic
maps extending out to 1.7 effective radii obtained from Keck spectroscopy, on
lensing geometry and on stellar mass estimates obtained from multiband Hubble
Space Telescope imaging. The data are modelled under the assumptions of axial
symmetry supported by a two-integral distribution function (DF), by applying
the combined gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics code CAULDRON, and
yielding high-quality constraints for an early-type galaxy at cosmological
redshifts. Modelling the total density profile as a power-law of the form
rho_tot ~ 1/r^{gamma}, we find that it is nearly isothermal (logarithmic slope
gamma = 2.08^{+0.04}_{-0.02}), and quite flattened (axial ratio q =
0.60^{+0.08}_{-0.03}). The galaxy is mildly anisotropic (delta = 0.08 +/- 0.02)
and shows a fair amount of rotational support, in particular towards the outer
regions. We determine a dark matter fraction lower limit of 28 per cent within
the effective radius. The stellar contribution to the total mass distribution
is close to maximal for a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF), whereas for a
Salpeter IMF the stellar mass exceeds the total mass within the galaxy inner
regions. We find that the combination of a NFW dark matter halo with the
maximally rescaled luminous profile provides a remarkably good fit to the total
mass distribution over a broad radial range. Our results confirm and expand the
findings of the SLACS survey for early-type galaxies of comparable velocity
dispersion (sigma_SDSS = 214 +/- 11 km/s). The internal structure of J0728 is
consistent with that of local early-type galaxies of comparable velocity
dispersion as measured by the SAURON project, suggesting lack of evolution in
the past two billion years.
