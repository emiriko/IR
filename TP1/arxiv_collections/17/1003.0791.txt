We generalize Killing equations to a test particle system which is subjected
to external force. We relax the conservation condition by virtue of
reparametrization invariance of a particle orbit. As a result, we obtain
generalized Killing equations which have hierarchical structure on the top of
which a conformal Killing equation exists.
