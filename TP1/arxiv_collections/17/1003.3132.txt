Photoelectron energy spectra resulting by the interaction of hydrogen with
two short pulses having carrier frequencies, respectively, in the range of the
infrared and XUV regions have been calculated. The effects of the pulse
duration and timing of the X-ray pulse on the photoelectron energy spectra are
discussed. Analysis of the spectra obtained for very long pulses show that
certain features may be explained in terms of quantum interferences in the time
domain. It is found that, depending on the duration of the X-ray pulse, ripples
in the energy spectra separated by the infrared photon energy may appear.
Moreover, the temporal shape of the low frequency radiation field may be
inferred by the breadth of the photoelectron energy spectra.
