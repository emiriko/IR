The effects of multi-layered clouds in the atmospheres of Earth-like planets
orbiting different types of stars are studied. The radiative effects of cloud
particles are directly correlated with their wavelength-dependent optical
properties. Therefore the incident stellar spectra may play an important role
for the climatic effect of clouds. We discuss the influence of clouds with mean
properties measured in the Earth's atmosphere on the surface temperatures and
Bond albedos of Earth-like planets orbiting different types of main sequence
dwarf stars.
