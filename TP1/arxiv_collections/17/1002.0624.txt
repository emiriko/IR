We analyze the measurement crosstalk between two flux-biased phase qubits
coupled by a resonant coplanar waveguide cavity. After the first qubit is
measured, the superconducting phase can undergo damped oscillations resulting
in an a.c. voltage that produces a frequency chirped noise signal whose
frequency crosses that of the cavity. We show experimentally that the coplanar
waveguide cavity acts as a bandpass filter that can significantly reduce the
crosstalk signal seen by the second qubit when its frequency is far from the
cavity's resonant frequency. We present a simple classical description of the
qubit behavior that agrees well with the experimental data. These results
suggest that measurement crosstalk between superconducting phase qubits can be
reduced by use of linear or possibly nonlinear resonant cavities as coupling
elements.
