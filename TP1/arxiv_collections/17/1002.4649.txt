Given b>0, integers n, m=bn and a probability measure Q on {0, 1,..., m},
consider the random intersection graph on the vertex set [n]={1, ..., n}, where
i and j are declared adjacent whenever S(i) and S(j) intersect. Here S(1), ...,
S(n) denote iid random subsets of [m] such that P(|S(i)|=k)=Q(k). For sparse
random intersection graphs we establish a first order asymptotic for the order
of the largest connected component N=n(1-Q(0))g+o(n) in probability. Here g is
an average of nonextinction probabilities of a related multi-type Poisson
branching process.
