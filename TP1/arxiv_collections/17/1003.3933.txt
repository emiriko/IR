Two-dimensional electrostatic turbulence in magnetized weakly-collisional
plasmas exhibits a cascade of entropy in phase space [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103,
015003 (2009)]. At scales smaller than the gyroradius, this cascade is
characterized by the dimensionless ratio D of the collision time to the eddy
turnover time measured at the scale of the thermal Larmor radius. When D >> 1,
a broad spectrum of fluctuations at sub-Larmor scales is found in both position
and velocity space. The distribution function develops structure as a function
of v_{perp}, the velocity coordinate perpendicular to the local magnetic field.
The cascade shows a local-scale nonlinear interaction in both position and
velocity spaces, and Kolmogorov's scaling theory can be extended into phase
space.
