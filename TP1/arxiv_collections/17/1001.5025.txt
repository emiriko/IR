{Abridged}. An analysis of the calcium and hydrogen abundances, Galactic
positions and kinematics of 146 DZ stars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
demonstrates that interaction with the interstellar medium cannot account for
their externally polluted atmospheres. The calcium-to-hydrogen ratios for the
37 DZA stars are dominated by super-solar values, as are the lower limits for
the remaining 109 DZ stars. All together their metal-contaminated convective
envelopes contain 10^{20+-2} g of calcium, commensurate with the masses of
calcium inferred for large asteroids. It is probable that these stars are
contaminated by circumstellar matter; the rocky remains of terrestrial
planetary systems. In this picture, two predictions emerge: 1) at least 3.5% of
all main sequence A- and F-type stars build terrestrial planets; and 2) the DZA
stars are externally polluted by both metals and hydrogen, and hence constrain
the frequency and mass of water-rich, extrasolar planetesimals.
