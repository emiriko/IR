Several small-bandgap semiconductors are now known to have protected metallic
surface states as a consequence of the topology of the bulk electron
wavefunctions. The known "topological insulators" with this behavior include
the important thermoelectric materials Bi_2Te_3 and Bi_2Se_3, whose surfaces
are observed in photoemission experiments to have an unusual electronic
structure with a single Dirac cone. We study in-plane (i.e., horizontal)
transport in thin films made of these materials. The surface states from top
and bottom surfaces hybridize, and conventional diffusive transport predicts
that the tunable hybridization-induced band gap leads to increased
thermoelectric performance at low temperatures. Beyond simple diffusive
transport, the conductivity shows a crossover from the spin-orbit induced
anti-localization at a single surface to ordinary localization.
