This chapter provides a overview of Bayesian inference, mostly emphasising
that it is a universal method for summarising uncertainty and making estimates
and predictions using probability statements conditional on observed data and
an assumed model (Gelman 2008). The Bayesian perspective is thus applicable to
all aspects of statistical inference, while being open to the incorporation of
information items resulting from earlier experiments and from expert opinions.
We provide here the basic elements of Bayesian analysis when considered for
standard models, refering to Marin and Robert (2007) and to Robert (2007) for
book-length entries.1 In the following, we refrain from embarking upon
philosophical discussions about the nature of knowledge (see, e.g., Robert
2007, Chapter 10), opting instead for a mathematically sound presentation of an
eminently practical statistical methodology. We indeed believe that the most
convincing arguments for adopting a Bayesian version of data analyses are in
the versatility of this tool and in the large range of existing applications,
rather than in those polemical arguments.
