We have analyzed the spectral density of fluctuations of the energy flux
through a mesoscopic constriction between two equilibrium reservoirs. It is
shown that at finite frequencies, the fluctuating energy flux is not related to
the thermal conductance of the constriction by the standard
fluctuation-dissipation theorem, but contains additional noise. The main
physical consequence of this extra noise is that the fluctuations do not vanish
at zero temperature together with the vanishing thermal conductance.
