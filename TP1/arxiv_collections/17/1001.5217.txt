With the advent of galaxy surveys which provide large samples of galaxies or
galaxy clusters over a volume comparable to the horizon size (SDSS-III, HETDEX,
Euclid, JDEM, LSST, Pan-STARRS, CIP etc.) or mass-selected large cluster
samples over a large fraction of the extra-galactic sky (Planck, SPT, ACT,
CMBPol, B-Pol), it is timely to investigate what constraints these surveys can
impose on primordial non-Gaussianity. I illustrate here three different
approaches: higher-order correlations of the three dimensional galaxy
distribution, abundance of rare objects (extrema of the density distribution),
and the large-scale clustering of halos (peaks of the density distribution).
Each of these avenues has its own advantages, but, more importantly, these
approaches are highly complementary under many respects.
