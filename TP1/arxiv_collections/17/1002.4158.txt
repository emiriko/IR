A major goal in optomechanics is to observe and control quantum behavior in a
system consisting of a mechanical resonator coupled to an optical cavity. Work
towards this goal has focused on increasing the strength of the coupling
between the mechanical and optical degrees of freedom; however, the form of
this coupling is crucial in determining which phenomena can be observed in such
a system. Here we demonstrate that avoided crossings in the spectrum of an
optical cavity containing a flexible dielectric membrane allow us to realize
several different forms of the optomechanical coupling. These include cavity
detunings that are (to lowest order) linear, quadratic, or quartic in the
membrane's displacement, and a cavity finesse that is linear in (or independent
of) the membrane's displacement. All these couplings are realized in a single
device with extremely low optical loss and can be tuned over a wide range in
situ; in particular, we find that the quadratic coupling can be increased three
orders of magnitude beyond previous devices. As a result of these advances, the
device presented here should be capable of demonstrating the quantization of
the membrane's mechanical energy.
