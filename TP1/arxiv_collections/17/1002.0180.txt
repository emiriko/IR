A nonperturbative quantization procedure based on a nonassociative
decomposition of quantum field operators on nonassociative constituents is
considered. It is shown that such approach gives rise to quantum corrections by
calculations of expectation values of nonlinear functions of field operators.
The corrections can in principle be measured as a radius of a force,
characteristic length of nonlocal objects, the failure of connection
compatibility with metric, and so on. The system of gravity interacting with
Maxwell electromagnetism is considered. It is shown that quantum corrections
from gravitoelectric coupling of a certain form leads to vanishing
singularities of a point charge, including infinite self-energy.
