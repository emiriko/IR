Using a recently introduced framework, we derive criteria for quantum
k-separability, which are very easily computed. In the case k = 2, our criteria
are equally strong to the best methods known so far, while in all other cases
there are currently no comparable criteria known. We also show how the criteria
can be implemented experimentally.
