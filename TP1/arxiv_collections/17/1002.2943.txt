It was recently realized that three-flavor effects could peculiarly modify
the development of spectral splits induced by collective oscillations, for
supernova neutrinos emitted during the cooling phase of a protoneutron star. We
systematically explore this case, explaining how the impact of these
three-flavor effects depends on the ordering of the neutrino masses. In
inverted mass hierarchy, the solar mass splitting gives rise to instabilities
in regions of the (anti)neutrino energy spectra that were otherwise stable
under the leading two-flavor evolution governed by the atmospheric mass
splitting and by the 1-3 mixing angle. As a consequence, the high-energy
spectral splits found in the electron (anti)neutrino spectra disappear, and are
transferred to other flavors. Imperfect adiabaticity leads to smearing of
spectral swap features. In normal mass hierarchy, the three-flavor and the
two-flavor instabilities act in the same region of the neutrino energy
spectrum, leading to only minor departures from the two-flavor treatment.
