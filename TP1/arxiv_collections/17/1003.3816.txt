We investigate the efficiency of cooling the vibrations of a nano-mechanical
resonator, constituted by a partially suspended Carbon-nanotube and operating
as double-quantum dot. The motion is brought to lower temperatures by tailoring
the energy exchange via electromechanical coupling with single electrons,
constantly flowing through the nanotube when a constant potential difference is
applied at its extremes in the Coulomb-blockade regime. Ground-state cooling is
possible at sufficiently high quality factors, provided that the dephasing rate
of electron transport within the double dot does not exceed the resonator
frequency. For large values of the dephasing rates cooling can still be
achieved by appropriately setting the tunable parameters.
