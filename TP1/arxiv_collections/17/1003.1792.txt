We describe the usage of the Multi-agent system in the data preprocessing
stage of an on-going project, called e-Wedding. The aim of this project is to
utilize MAS and various approaches, like Web services, Ontology, and Data
mining techniques, in e-Business that want to improve responsiveness and
efficiency of systems so as to extract customer behavior model on Wedding
Businesses. However, in this paper, we propose and implement the
multi-agent-system, based on JADE, to only cope data preprocessing stage
specified on handle with missing value techniques. JADE is quite easy to learn
and use. Moreover, it supports many agent approaches such as agent
communication, protocol, behavior and ontology. This framework has been
experimented and evaluated in the realization of a simple, but realistic. The
results, though still preliminary, are quite.
