We show that if an operator T is bounded on weighted Lebesgue space L^2(w)
and obeys a linear bound with respect to the A_2 constant of the weight, then
its commutator [b,T] with a function b in BMO will obey a quadratic bound with
respect to the A_2 constant of the weight. We also prove that the kth-order
commutator T^k_b=[b,T^{k-1}_b] will obey a bound that is a power (k+1) of the
A_2 constant of the weight. Sharp extrapolation provides corresponding L^p(w)
estimates. The results are sharp in terms of the growth of the operator norm
with respect to the A_p constant of the weight for all 1<p<\infty, all k, and
all dimensions, as examples involving the Riesz transforms, power functions and
power weights show.
