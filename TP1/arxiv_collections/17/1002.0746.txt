We present a quantitative experimental analysis of a surface plasmon
polariton (SPP) interferometer relying on elliptical Bragg mirrors. By using a
leakage radiation microscope we observe oscillation fringes with unit
visibility at the two interferometer exits. We study the properties of the SPP
beam splitter and determine experimentally both the norm and phase of the SPP
reflection and transmission coefficients.
