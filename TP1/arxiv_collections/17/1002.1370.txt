A simple model of a spherically symmetric, pulsating star is calculated. The
application to the Sun gives a 166-min radial pulsation. The theory of
gravitation in flat space-time implies for a spherically symmetric,
nonstationary star small time-dependent exterior gravitational effects. The
perturbed equations of motion of a test body moving around the non-stationary
star are given. The test body moves away from the center during the epoch of
collapsing star and moves towards the center during the epoch of expanding star
but the converse is also possible under some conditions. The application to the
Sun-Earth system is too small to be measured. This effect may be measurable for
very compact, non-stationary objects circulated of a nearby test body.
