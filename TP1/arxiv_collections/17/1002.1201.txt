Online communities are the gatherings of like-minded people, brought together
in cyberspace by shared interests. The shared interest has hidden social
capital aspects and can be of bridging or bonding type. Creating such
communities is not a big challenge but sustaining member's participation is.
This study examines the formation and maintenance of social capital in social
network sites. In addition to assessing bonding and bridging social capital, we
explore a dimension of social capital that assesses one's ability to stay
connected with members of a previously inhabited community, which we call
maintained social capital. Such dimension is enacted here in terms of
Hypothesis.
