Highly-ionized fast accretion-disk winds have been suggested as an
explanation for a variety of observed absorption and emission features in the
X-ray spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei. Simple estimates have suggested that
these flows may be massive enough to carry away a significant fraction of the
accretion energy and could be involved in creating the link between
supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. However, testing these
hypotheses, and quantifying the outflow signatures, requires high-quality
theoretical spectra for comparison with observations. Here we describe
extensions of our Monte Carlo radiative transfer code that allow us to generate
realistic theoretical spectra for a much wider variety of disk wind models than
possible in our previous work. In particular, we have expanded the range of
atomic physics simulated by the code so that L- and M-shell ions can now be
included. We have also substantially improved our treatment of both ionization
and radiative heating such that we are now able to compute spectra for outflows
containing far more diverse plasma conditions. We present example calculations
that illustrate the variety of spectral features predicted by parametrized
outflow models and demonstrate their applicability to the interpretation of
data by comparison with observations of the bright quasar PG1211+143. We find
that the major features in the observed 2 - 10 keV spectrum of this object can
be well-reproduced by our spectra, confirming that it likely hosts a massive
outflow.
