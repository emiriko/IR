We perform two flavor QCD simulations with an imaginary chemical potential
and measure derivatives of the pressure up to 4th order as a function of the
imaginary chemical potential and the temperature $T \in [0.83 T_c, 2 T_c]$. For
temperatures $T \geq T_c$, these derivatives are fitted by a Taylor series in
$\mu/T$ about $\mu=0$. A fit limited to 4th order describes the data poorly at
all temperatures, showing that we are sensitive to 6th order contributions.
Similarly, a 6th order fit fails for temperatures $T_c \leq T \leq 1.05 T_c$,
showing the need for 8th order terms. Thus, our method may offer a
computational advantage over the direct measurement of Taylor coefficients at
$\mu=0$. At temperatures $T \leq T_c$, we fit our data with a hadron resonance
gas ansatz. The fit starts to fail at $T \gtrsim 0.95 T_c$. Using our fits, we
also reconstruct the equation of state as a function of real quark and isospin
chemical potentials.
