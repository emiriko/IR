The early evolution of Earth's atmosphere and the origin of life took place
at a time when physical conditions at the Earth where radically different from
its present state. The radiative input from the Sun was much enhanced in the
high-energy spectral domain, and in order to model early planetary atmospheres
in detail, a knowledge of the solar radiative input is needed. We present an
investigation of the atmospheric parameters, state of evolution and high-energy
fluxes of the nearby star kap^1 Cet, previously thought to have properties
resembling those of the early Sun. Atmospheric parameters were derived from the
excitation/ionization equilibrium of Fe I and Fe II, profile fitting of Halpha
and the spectral energy distribution. The UV irradiance was derived from FUSE
and HST data, and the absolute chromospheric flux from the Halpha line core.
From careful spectral analysis and the comparison of different methods we
propose for kap^1 Cet the following atmospheric parameters: Teff = 5665+/-30 K
(Halpha profile and energy distribution), log g = 4.49+/-0.05 dex (evolutionary
and spectroscopic) and [Fe/H] = +0.10+/-0.05 dex (Fe II lines). The UV
radiative properties of kap^1 Cet indicate that its flux is some 35% lower than
the current Sun's between 210 and 300 nm, it matches the Sun's at 170 nm and
increases to at least 2-7 times higher than the Sun's between 110 and 140 nm.
The use of several indicators ascribes an age to kap^1 Cet in the interval
~0.4-0.8 Gyr and the analysis of the theoretical HR diagram suggests a mass
~1.04 Msun. This star is thus a very close analog of the Sun when life arose on
Earth and Mars is thought to have lost its surface bodies of liquid water.
Photochemical models indicate that the enhanced UV emission leads to a
significant increase in photodissociation rates compared with those commonly
assumed of the early Earth. Our results show that reliable calculations of the
chemical composition of early planetary atmospheres need to account for the
stronger solar photodissociating UV irradiation.
