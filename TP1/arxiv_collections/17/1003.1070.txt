We develop a previously proposed gauge-invariant method to integrate out
infinite towers of vector and axialvector mesons arising as Kaluza-Klein (KK)
modes in a class of holographic models of QCD (HQCD). We demonstrate that HQCD
can be reduced to the chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) with the hidden local
symmetry (HLS) (so-called HLS-ChPT) having only the lowest KK mode identified
as the HLS gauge boson, and the Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The ${\cal O} (p^4)$
terms in the HLS-ChPT are completely determined by integrating out infinite
towers of vector/axialvector mesons in HQCD: Effects of higher KK modes are
fully included in the coefficients. As an example, we apply our method to the
Sakai-Sugimoto model.
