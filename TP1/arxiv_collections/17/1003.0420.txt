Low-amplitude Doppler-shift oscillations have been observed in coronal
emission lines in a number of active regions with the EUV Imaging Spectrometer
(EIS) on the Hinode satellite. Both standing and propagating waves have been
detected and many periods have been observed, but a clear picture of all the
wave modes that might be associated with active regions has not yet emerged. In
this study, we examine additional observations obtained with EIS in plage near
an active region on 2007 August 22--23. We find Doppler-shift oscillations with
amplitudes between 1 and 2 km/s in emission lines ranging from Fe XI 188.23
Angstroms, which is formed at log T = 6.07 to Fe XV 284.16 Angstroms, which is
formed at log T = 6.32. Typical periods are near 10 minutes. We also observe
intensity and density oscillations for some of the detected Doppler-shift
oscillations. In the better-observed cases, the oscillations are consistent
with upwardly propagating slow magnetoacoustic waves. Simultaneous observations
of the Ca II H line with the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope Broadband Filter
Imager show some evidence for 10-minute oscillations as well.
