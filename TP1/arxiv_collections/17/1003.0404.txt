As one of the newest members in Artificial Immune Systems (AIS), the
Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) has been applied to a range of problems. These
applications mainly belong to the field of anomaly detection. However,
real-time detection, a new challenge to anomaly detection, requires improvement
on the real-time capability of the DCA. To assess such capability, formal
methods in the research of rea-time systems can be employed. The findings of
the assessment can provide guideline for the future development of the
algorithm. Therefore, in this paper we use an interval logic based method,
named the Duration Calculus (DC), to specify a simplified single-cell model of
the DCA. Based on the DC specifications with further induction, we find that
each individual cell in the DCA can perform its function as a detector in
real-time. Since the DCA can be seen as many such cells operating in parallel,
it is potentially capable of performing real-time detection. However, the
analysis process of the standard DCA constricts its real-time capability. As a
result, we conclude that the analysis process of the standard DCA should be
replaced by a real-time analysis component, which can perform periodic analysis
for the purpose of real-time detection.
