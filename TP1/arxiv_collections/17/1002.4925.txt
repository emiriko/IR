The motion of a collisionless plasma is described by the Vlasov-Poisson
system, or in the presence of large velocities, the relativistic Vlasov-Poisson
system. Both systems are considered in one space and one momentum dimension,
with two species of oppositely charged particles. A new identity is derived for
both systems and is used to study the behavior of solutions for large times.
