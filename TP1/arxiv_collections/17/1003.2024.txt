The effect of high pressure (0 - 8 GPa) on the magnetic structure of
polycrystalline samples of La0.5Ca0.5-xSrxMnO3 (0.1 -< x -< 0.4) manganites at
5 K is investigated using neutron diffraction technique. Application of
pressure is found to modify the previously reported magnetic structure,
observed under ambient conditions, in these compounds [I. Dhiman et al., Phys.
Rev. B 77, 094440 (2008)]. In x = 0.1 composition, at 4.6(2) GPa and beyond,
A-type antiferromagnetic structure is found to coexist with CE-type
antiferromagnetic phase, observed at ambient pressure, with TN ~ 150 K. For x =
0.3 sample, as a function of pressure the CE-type phase is fully suppressed at
2.3(1) GPa and A-type antiferromagnetic phase is favored. Further Sr doping at
x = 0.4, the A-type antiferromagnetic phase is observed at ambient pressure and
for T < TN (~ 250K). This phase is retained in the studied pressure range.
However, the magnetic moment progressively reduces with increasing pressure,
indicating the suppression of A-type antiferromagnetic phase. The present study
brings out the fragile nature of the CE-type antiferromagnetic state in half
doped manganites as a function of pressure and disorder \sigma 2. We observe
that pressure required for destabilizing the CE-type antiferromagnetic state is
reduced with increasing disorder \sigma 2. External pressure and changing
A-site ionic radii have analogous effect on the magnetic structure.
