We introduce a higher dimensional quasiregular map analogous to the
trigonometric functions and we use the dynamics of this map to define, for d>1,
a partition of d-dimensional Euclidean space into curves tending to infinity
such that two curves may intersect only in their endpoints and such that the
union of the curves without their endpoints has Hausdorff dimension one.
