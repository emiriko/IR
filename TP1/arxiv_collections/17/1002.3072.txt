This paper briefly highlights the features of the software tool [RadPat4W],
named after Radiation Patterns for Windows but also compatible with the [Wine]
environment of Linux. The tool is a stand-alone part of a freeware suite that
is based on an alternative exposition of fundamental Antenna Theory and is
under active development for many years now. Nevertheless, [RadPat4W] source
code has been now released as FLOSS Free Libre Open Source Software and thus it
may be freely used, copied, modified or redistributed, individually or
cooperatively, by the interested user to suit her/his personal needs for
reliable antenna applications from the simplest to the more complex.
