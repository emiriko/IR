The indirect detection of particle dark matter (DM) is based on the search
for anomalous components in cosmic rays (CRs) due to the annihilation of DM
pairs in the galactic halo, on the top of the standard astrophysical
production. These additional exotic components are potentially detectable at
Earth as spectral distortions for the various cosmic radiations: $\chi + \chi
\to q \bar{q}, W^+ W^-, ... \to \bar{p}, \bar{D}, e^+ \gamma and \nu's $.
Detection of the DM annihilation products has motivated the spectacular
development of several new experimental techniques. They range from detectors
on ballons or in space for the study of antimatter and gamma-rays, to large
area cosmic-ray and gamma-ray detecors on the ground to neutrino telescopes
underground for the study of the neutrino component. In the following, we will
discuss in detail the antimatter component of DM indirect searches, namely
antiprotons, antideuterons, and positrons.
