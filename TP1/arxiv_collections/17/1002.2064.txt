The existence of a recurrent spinor field on a pseudo-Riemannian spin
manifold $(M,g)$ is closely related to the existence of a parallel
1-dimensional complex subbundle of the spinor bundle of $(M,g)$. We
characterize the following simply connected pseudo-Riemannian manifolds
admitting such subbundles in terms of their holonomy algebras: Riemannian
manifolds; Lorentzian manifolds; pseudo-Riemannian manifolds with irreducible
holonomy algebras; pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of neutral signature admitting
two complementary parallel isotropic distributions.
