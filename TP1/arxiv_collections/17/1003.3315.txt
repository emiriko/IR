We study the transition induced by tunneling from the two-component 332
Halperin's state to the one-component Jain's state at the filling factor
\nu=2/5. In exact diagonalizations of small systems two possibilities for the
transition are found: (a) avoided level crossing, and (b) level crossing i.e.
first-order transition in the case of Coulomb interaction and short range
interaction, respectively. An effective bosonic model with p-wave pairing for
the transition is proposed. The relevance of the Gaffnian state for the
transition is discussed as well as possible consequences of our model on the
effective description of the Jain state.
