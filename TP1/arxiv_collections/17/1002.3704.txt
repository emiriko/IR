We investigate the thermodynamic properties of a dilute Bose gas in a
correlated random potential using exact path integral Monte Carlo methods. The
study is carried out in continuous space and disorder is produced in the
simulations by a 3D speckle pattern with tunable intensity and correlation
length. We calculate the shift of the superfluid transition temperature due to
disorder and we highlight the role of quantum localization by comparing the
critical chemical potential with the classical percolation threshold. The
equation of state of the gas is determined in the regime of strong disorder,
where superfluidity is suppressed and the normal phase exists down to very low
temperatures. We find a $T^2$ dependence of the energy in agreement with the
expected behavior in the Bose glass phase. We also discuss the major role
played by the disorder correlation length and we make contact with a
Hartree-Fock mean-field approach that holds valid if the correlation length is
very large. The density profiles are analyzed as a function of temperature and
interaction strength. Effects of localization and the depletion of the order
parameter are emphasized in the comparison between local condensate and total
density. At very low temperature we find that the energy and the particle
distribution of the gas are very well described by the T=0 Gross-Pitaevskii
theory even in the regime of very strong disorder.
