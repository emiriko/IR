The genome is software because it a set of verbal instructions for a
programmable computer, the ribosome. The theory of evolution now reads:
evolution is the software developer responsible for the existence of the
genome. We claim that this setting, whose official name is genetic programming,
is necessary and sufficient to discuss all important questions about evolution.
A great effort has been made to pass from wording to science, i.e., from naive
theories to robust models to predictions to testing for falsification.
