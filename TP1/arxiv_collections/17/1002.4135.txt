We study positive random variables whose moments can be expressed by products
and quotients of Gamma functions; this includes many standard distributions.
General results are given on existence, series expansion and asymptotics of
density functions. It is shown that the integral of the supremum process of
Brownian motion has moments of this type, as well as a related random variable
occuring in the study of hashing with linear displacement, and the general
results are applied to these variables.
