We examine the archetype of an interference experiment for Auger electrons:
two electron wave packets are launched by inner-shell ionizing a krypton atom
using two attosecond light pulses with a variable time delay. This setting is
an attosecond realization of the Ramsey method of separated oscillatory fields.
Interference of the two ejected Auger-electron wave packets is predicted,
indicating that the coherence between the two pulses is passed to the Auger
electrons. For the detection of the interference pattern an accurate
coincidence measurement of photo- and Auger electrons is necessary. The method
allows one to control inner-shell electron dynamics on an attosecond timescale
and represents a sensitive indicator for decoherence.
