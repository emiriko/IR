BiFeO$_3$ thin films can be epitaxially stabilized in a nearly-tetragonal
phase under a high biaxial compressive strain. Here we investigate the
polarized Raman spectra of constrained BiFeO$_3$ films with tetragonal-like
(BFO-T), rhombohedral-like (BFO-R) and multiphase (BFO-T+R) structure. Based on
analysis of the number and symmetry of the Raman lines, we provide strong
experimental evidence that the nearly-tetragonal films are monoclinic ($Cc$
symmetry) and not tetragonal $(P4mm)$. Through the Raman mapping technique we
show localized coexistence of BFO-T and BFO-R phases with the relative fraction
dependent on the film thickness.
