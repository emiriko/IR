We discuss the effect of pairing on two-neutron space correlations in
deformed nuclei. The spatial correlations are described by the pairing tensor
in coordinate space calculated in the HFB approach. The calculations are done
using the D1S Gogny force. We show that the pairing tensor has a rather small
extension in the relative coordinate, a feature observed earlier in spherical
nuclei. It is pointed out that in deformed nuclei the coherence length
corresponding to the pairing tensor has a pattern similar to what we have found
previously in spherical nuclei, i.e., it is maximal in the interior of the
nucleus and then it is decreasing rather fast in the surface region where it
reaches a minimal value of about 2 fm. This minimal value of the coherence
length in the surface is essentially determined by the finite size properties
of single-particle states in the vicinity of the chemical potential and has
little to do with enhanced pairing correlations in the nuclear surface. It is
shown that in nuclei the coherence length is not a good indicator of the
intensity of pairing correlations. This feature is contrasted with the
situation in infinite matter.
