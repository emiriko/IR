We investigate the observables available in the angular distribution of B to
K* mu+ mu- to identify those suitable for measurements in the first few years
of LHC data taking. As experimental uncertainties will dominate, we focus on
observables that are simple to measure, while maximizing the potential for
discovery. There are three observables that may be extracted by counting signal
events as a function of one or two decay angles and correspond to large
features of the full angular distribution in the Standard Model: Afb, Fl, and
S5. Two of these are well known in the experimental community; however, we show
that measuring S5 adds complementary sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard
model. Like Afb, it features a zero-crossing point with reduced hadronic
uncertainties at leading order and in the large recoil limit. We explore the
experimental sensitivity to this point at LHCb and show that it may be measured
with high precision due to the steepness of the S5 distribution. Current
experimental model independent constraints on parameter space are presented and
predictions made for the values of the Afb and S5 zero-crossing points. The
relative impact of LHCb measurements of Afb, Fl, and S5, with 2 fb^(-1) of
integrated luminosity, is assessed. These issues are explored with a new model
of the decay that can be used with standard simulation tools such as EVTGEN.
