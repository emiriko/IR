Coherent Lambda-Sigma coupling effect in Lambda_He^7 is analyzed within
three-body framework of two coupled channels, Lambda-t-t and Sigma-tau-t, where
tau represents trinucleon which is either H^3 or He^3. The hyperon-trinucleon
(Y tau) and trinucleon-trinucleon (tau tau) interactions are derived by folding
G-matrices of YN and NN interactions with trinucleon density distributions. It
is found that the binding energy of Lambda_He^7 is 4.04 MeV below the
Lambda+t+t threshold without Lambda-Sigma coupling and the binding energy is
increased to 4.46 MeV when the coupling effect is included. This state is 7.85
MeV above the He^6+Lambda threshold and it may have a chance to be observed as
a Feshbach resonance in Li^7 (e,e'K^+)Lambda_He^7 experiment done at Jefferson
Lab.
