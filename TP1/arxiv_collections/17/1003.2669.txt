We achieve tunneling spin injection from Co into single layer graphene (SLG)
using TiO2 seeded MgO barriers. A non-local magnetoresistance ({\Delta}RNL) of
130 {\Omega} is observed at room temperature, which is the largest value
observed in any material. Investigating {\Delta}RNL vs. SLG conductivity from
the transparent to the tunneling contact regimes demonstrates the contrasting
behaviors predicted by the drift-diffusion theory of spin transport.
Furthermore, tunnel barriers reduce the contact-induced spin relaxation and are
therefore important for future investigations of spin relaxation in graphene.
