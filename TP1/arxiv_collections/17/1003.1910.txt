In this paper, a study on the end-to-end performance of dual-hop wireless
communication systems equipped with fixed-gain relays and operating over
Generalized-Gamma (GG) fading channels is presented. A novel closed form
expression for the moments of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is
derived. The average bit error probability for coherent and non-coherent
modulation schemes as well as the end-to-end outage probability of the
considered system are also studied. Extensive numerically evaluated and
computer simulations results are presented that verify the accuracy of the
proposed mathematical analysis.
