Rotation of the nucleus and rotation of the electronic cloud of the atom/ion
were considered. It was shown that these rotations are not practically
possible. Rotation of the cloud of delocalized electrons and ionic core of a
fullerene molecule and these of the ring of a nanotube were discussed. It was
shown that the rotation of the cloud of delocalized electrons of a fullerene
molecule is possible and it goes in a quantum way when temperature is
essentially lower than 40 K. Rotation of the ion core of a fullerene molecule
is possible in a classical way only. The same should be said about rotations in
the ring of a nanotube.
