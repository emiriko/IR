Let G be a connected reductive linear algebraic group. The aim of this note
is to settle a question of J-P. Serre concerning the behaviour of his notion of
G-complete reducibility under separable field extensions. Part of our proof
relies on the recently established Tits Centre Conjecture for the spherical
building of the reductive group G.
