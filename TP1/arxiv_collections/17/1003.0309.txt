Antiferromagnetic (AFM) (or spin-density wave) quantum critical fluctuation
enhanced just below H_c2(0) have been often observed in d-wave superconductors
with a strong Pauli paramagnetic depairing (PD) including CeCoIn_5. It is shown
here that such a tendency of field-induced AFM ordering is a consequence of
strong PD and should appear particularly in superconductors with a gap node
along the AFM modulation. Two phenomena seen in CeCoIn_5, the anomalous vortex
lattice form factor and the AFM order in the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov
state, are explained based on this peculiar PD effect.
