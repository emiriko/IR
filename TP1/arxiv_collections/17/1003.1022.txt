We introduce a new category of non-archimedean analytic spaces over a
complete discretely valued field. These spaces, which we call uniformly rigid,
may be viewed as classical rigid-analytic spaces together with an additional
uniform structure: On the level of points, a uniformly rigid space coincides
with its underlying rigid space, while its G-topology is coarser and its sheaf
of holomorphic functions is smaller. A uniformly rigid structure is, locally,
induced by an integral formal model of formally finite type. In fact,
Berthelot's generic fiber functor factors naturally through the category of
uniformly rigid spaces. The uniformly rigid generic fiber of a quasi-compact
formal scheme of formally finite type is quasi-compact, and its global
functions are bounded. We construct our new category by starting out from
semi-affinoid algebras and nested rational coverings; we prove a uniformly
rigid acyclicity theorem, and we study coherent modules.
  We then define formal N\'eron models for uniformly rigid spaces to be smooth
formal schemes of formally finite type satisfying the universal N\'eron
property. We establish the existence of formal N\'eron models for certain
classes of uniformly rigid groups, and we discuss applications to Chai's
program concerning the computation of the base change conductor for abelian
varieties with potentially multiplicative reduction.
