The goal of this paper is to understand the conditional law of a stochastic
process once it has been observed over an interval. To make this precise, we
introduce the notion of a continuous disintegration: a regular conditional
probability measure which varies continuously in the conditioned parameter. The
conditioning is infinite-dimensional in character, which leads us to consider
the general case of probability measures in Banach spaces. Our main result is
that for a certain quantity $M$ based on the covariance structure, the
finiteness of M is a necessary and sufficient condition for a Gaussian measure
to have a continuous disintegration. The condition is quite reasonable: for the
familiar case of stationary processes, M = 1.
