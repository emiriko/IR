The parametrization theorem is derived in a flat nD pseudo-complex affine
space. The pseudo-complex hyperbolic space accomodates n-number of
uncompactified time-like extra dimensions with sugnature (s,r), where s and r
are the numbers of minus and plus signs associated with the diagonalized metric
matrix. The main result of the theorem suggests a uniform parametrization for
both time-like and space-like dimensions. The uniformization requirement
preserves complex-hyperbolic inner product associated with the space. As
application, the elements of the space is shown to be invariant under linear
transformation.
