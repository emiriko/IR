It is known that there is a one-to-one correspondence between equivalence
classes of primitive indefinite binary quadratic forms and primitive hyperbolic
conjugacy classes of the modular group. Due to such a correspondence, Sarnak
obtained the asymptotic formula for the class number sum in order of the
fundamental unit by using the prime geodesic theorem for the modular group. In
the present paper, we propose asymptotic formulas of the class number sums over
discriminants in arithmetic progressions. Since there are relations between the
arithmetic properties of the discriminants and the conjugacy classes in the
finite groups given by the modular group and its congruence subgroups, we can
get the desired asymptotic formulas by arranging the Tchebotarev-type prime
geodesic theorem. While such asymptotic formulas were already given by Raulf,
the approaches are quite different, the expressions of the leading terms of our
asymptotic formulas are simpler and the estimates of the reminder terms are
sharper.
