Personal identification and authentication is very crucial in the current
scenario. Biometrics plays an important role in this area. Biometric based
authentication has proved superior compared to traditional password based
authentication. Anyhow biometrics is permanent feature of a person and cannot
be reissued when compromised as passwords. To over come this problem, instead
of storing the original biometric templates transformed templates can be
stored. Whenever the transformation function is changed new
revocable/cancelable templates are generated. Soft biometrics is ancillary
information that can be combined with primary biometrics to identify a person
in a better way. Iris has certain advantage compared to other biometric traits
like fingerprint. Iris is an internal part that is less prone to damage.
Moreover is very difficult for an attacker to capture an iris. The key
advantage of iris biometrics is its stability or template longevity. Biometric
systems are vulnerable to a variety of attacks. This work generates cancelable
iris templates by applying user and soft biometric based password
transformations and further secures the templates by biometric cryptographic
construct fuzzy vault.
