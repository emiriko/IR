Thermodynamic framework of finite strain viscoelasticity with second order
weak nonlocality in the deformation gradient is investigated. The application
of Liu procedure leads to a class of third grade elastic materials where the
second gradient of the stress appears in the elastic constitutive relation.
Finally the dispersion relation of longitudinal plane waves is calculated in
isotropic materials.
