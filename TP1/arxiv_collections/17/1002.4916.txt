We study the phenomenology of the charged Higgs boson in the "flipped" two
Higgs doublet model, in which one doublet gives mass to up-type quarks and
charged leptons and the other gives mass to down-type quarks. We present the
charged Higgs branching ratios and summarize the indirect constraints. We
extrapolate existing LEP searches for H+H- and Tevatron searches for t tbar
with t --> H+ b into the flipped model and extract constraints on MH+ and the
parameter tan(beta). We finish by reviewing existing LHC charged Higgs searches
and suggest that the LHC reach in this model could be extended for charged
Higgs masses below the tb threshold by considering t tbar with t --> H+ b and
H+ --> q qbar, as has been used in Tevatron searches.
