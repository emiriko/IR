In earlier work we introduced the graph bracket polynomial of graphs with
marked vertices, motivated by the fact that the Kauffman bracket of a link
diagram D is determined by a looped, marked version of the interlacement graph
associated to a directed Euler system of the universe graph of D. Here we
extend the graph bracket to graphs whose vertices may carry different kinds of
marks, and we show how multiply marked graphs encode interlacement with respect
to arbitrary (undirected) Euler systems. The extended machinery brings together
the earlier version and the graph-links of D. P. Ilyutko and V. O. Manturov [J.
Knot Theory Ramifications 18 (2009), 791-823]. The greater flexibility of the
extended bracket also allows for a recursive description much simpler than that
of the earlier version.
