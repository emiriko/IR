We extend density-matrix expansions in nuclei to higher orders in derivatives
of densities and test their convergence properties. The expansions allow for
converting the interaction energies characteristic to finite- and short-range
nuclear effective forces into quasi-local density functionals. We also propose
a new type of expansion that has excellent convergence properties when
benchmarked against the binding energies obtained for the Gogny interaction.
