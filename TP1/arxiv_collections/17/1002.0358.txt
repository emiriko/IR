In this work we present a novel 3D Monte Carlo photon transport program for
simulation of multiple refractive scattering based on the refractive properties
of X-rays in highly scattering media, like lung tissue. Multiple scattering
reduces not only the quality of the image, but contains also information on the
internal structure of the object. This information can be exploited utilizing
image modalities such as Diffraction Enhanced Imaging (DEI). To study the
effect of multiple scattering a Monte Carlo program was developed that
simulates multiple refractive scattering of X-ray photons on monodisperse PMMA
(poly-methyl-methacrylate) microspheres representing alveoli in lung tissue.
Eventually, the results of the Monte Carlo program were compared to the
measurements taken at the SYRMEP beamline at Elettra (Trieste, Italy) on
special phantoms showing a good agreement between both data.
