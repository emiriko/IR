The final result of this article gives the order of the extension
$$\xymatrix{1\ar[r] & P/[P,P] \ar^{j}[r] & B/[P,P] \ar^-{p}[r] & W \ar[r] &
1}$$ as an element of the cohomology group $H^2(W,P/[P,P])$ (where $B$ and $P$
stands for the braid group and the pure braid group associated to the complex
reflection group $W$). To obtain this result, we describe the abelianization of
the stabilizer $N_H$ of a hyperplane $H$. Contrary to the case of Coxeter
groups, $N_H$ is not in general a reflection subgroup of the complex reflection
group $W$. So the first step is to refine Stanley-Springer's theorem on the
abelianization of a reflection group. The second step is to describe the
abelianization of various types of big subgroups of the braid group $B$ of $W$.
More precisely, we just need a group homomorphism from the inverse image of
$N_H$ by $p$ with values in $\QQ$ (where $p : B \ra W$ is the canonical
morphism) but a slight enhancement gives a complete description of the
abelianization of $p^{-1}(W')$ where $W'$ is a reflection subgroup of $W$ or
the stabilizer of a hyperplane. We also suggest a lifting construction for
every element of the centralizer of a reflection in $W$.
