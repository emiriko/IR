Realization of post-CMOS graphene electronics requires production of
semiconducting graphene, which has been a labor-intensive process. We present
tailoring of silicon carbide crystals via conventional photolithography and
microelectronics processing to enable templated graphene growth on
4H-SiC{1-10n} (n = 8) crystal facets rather than the customary {0001} planes.
This allows self-organized growth of graphene nanoribbons with dimensions
defined by those of the facet. Preferential growth is confirmed by Raman
spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
measurements, and electrical characterization of prototypic graphene devices is
presented. Fabrication of > 10,000 top-gated graphene transistors on a 0.24 cm2
SiC chip demonstrates scalability of this process and represents the highest
density of graphene devices reported to date.
