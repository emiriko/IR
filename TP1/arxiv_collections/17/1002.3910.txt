The paper is concerned with directed versions of Posa's theorem and Chvatal's
theorem on Hamilton cycles in graphs.
  We show that for each a>0, every digraph G of sufficiently large order n
whose outdegree and indegree sequences d_1^+ \leq ... \leq d_n^+ and d_1^- \leq
>... \leq d_n^- satisfy d_i^+, d_i^- \geq min{i + a n, n/2} is Hamiltonian. In
fact, we can weaken these assumptions to
  (i) d_i^+ \geq min{i + a n, n/2} or d^-_{n - i - a n} \geq n-i; (ii) d_i^-
\geq min{i + a n, n/2} or d^+_{n - i - a n} \geq n-i; and still deduce that G
is Hamiltonian. This provides an approximate version of a conjecture of
Nash-Williams from 1975 and improves a previous result of K\"uhn, Osthus and
Treglown.
