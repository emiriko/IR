Indium phosphide (InP) nanostructures have been synthesized by means of
colloidal chemistry. Under appropriate conditions needle-shaped nanostructures
composed of an In head and an InP tail with lengths up to several micrometers
could be generated in a one-pot synthesis. The growth is interpreted in terms
of simultaneous decomposition of the In precursor and in situ generation of In
and InP nanostructures. Owing to their specific design such In/InP nanoneedles
suit the use as ready-made Schottky transistors. Their transfer and output
characteristics are presented.
