According to general relativity, the frequency of electromagnetic radiation
is altered by the expansion of the universe. This effect--commonly referred to
as the cosmological redshift--is of utmost importance for observations in
cosmology. Here we show that this redshift can be reproduced on a much smaller
scale using an optical analogue inside a dielectric metamaterial with
time-dependent material parameters. To this aim, we apply the framework of
transformation optics to the Robertson-Walker metric. We demonstrate
theoretically how perfect redshifting or blueshifting of an electromagnetic
wave can be achieved without the creation of sidebands with a device of finite
length.
