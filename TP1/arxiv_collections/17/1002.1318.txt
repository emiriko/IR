Intense laser ionization expands Einstein's photoelectric effect rules giving
a wealth of phenomena widely studied over the last decades. In all cases, so
far, photons were assumed to carry one unit of angular momentum. However it is
now clear that photons can possess extra angular momentum, the orbital angular
momentum (OAM), related to their spatial profile. We show a complete
description of photoionization by OAM photons, including new selection rules
involving more than one unit of angular momentum. We explore theoretically the
interaction of a single electron atom located at the center of an intense
ultraviolet beam bearing OAM, envisaging new scenarios for quantum optics.
