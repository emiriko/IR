We study the arithmetic of Enriques surfaces whose universal covers are
singular K3 surfaces. If a singular K3 surface X has discriminant d, then it
has a model over the ring class field d. Our main theorem is that the same
holds true for any Enriques quotient of X. It is based on a study on
Neron-Severi groups of singular K3 surfaces. We also comment on Galois actions
on divisors of Enriques surfaces.
