We show that each entanglement witness detecting given bipartite entangled
state provides an estimation of its concurrence. We illustrate our result with
several well known examples of entanglement witnesses and compare the
corresponding estimation of concurrence with other estimations provided by the
trace norm of partial transposition and realignment.
