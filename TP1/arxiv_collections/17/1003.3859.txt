Up to now, the effects of having heterogeneous networks of contacts have been
studied mostly for diseases which are not persistent in time, i.e., for
diseases where the infectious period can be considered very small compared to
the lifetime of an individual. Moreover, all these previous results have been
obtained for closed populations, where the number of individuals does not
change during the whole duration of the epidemics. Here, we go one step further
and analyze, both analytically and numerically, a radically different kind of
diseases: those that are persistent and can last for an individual's lifetime.
To be more specific, we particularize to the case of Tuberculosis' (TB)
infection dynamics, where the infection remains latent for a period of time
before showing up and spreading to other individuals. We introduce an
epidemiological model for TB-like persistent infections taking into account the
heterogeneity inherent to the population structure. This sort of dynamics
introduces new analytical and numerical challenges that we are able to sort
out. Our results show that also for persistent diseases the epidemic threshold
depends on the ratio of the first two moments of the degree distribution so
that it goes to zero in a class of scale-free networks when the system
approaches the thermodynamic limit.
