The "Universality Theorem" for gravity shows that f(R) theories (in their
metric-affine formulation) in vacuum are dynamically equivalent to vacuum
Einstein equations with suitable cosmological constants. This holds true for a
generic (i.e. except sporadic degenerate cases) analytic function f(R) and
standard gravity without cosmological constant is reproduced if f is the
identity function (i.e. f(R)=R). The theorem is here extended introducing in
dimension 4 a 1-parameter family of invariants R' inspired by the
Barbero-Immirzi formulation of GR (which in the Euclidean sector includes also
selfdual formulation). It will be proven that f(R') theories so defined are
dynamically equivalent to the corresponding metric-affine f(R) theory. In
particular for the function f(R)=R the standard equivalence between GR and
Holst Lagrangian is obtained.
