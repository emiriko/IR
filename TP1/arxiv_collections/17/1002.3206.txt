The glass transition GT is usually thought of as a structural arrest that
occurs during the cooling of a liquid, or sometimes a plastic crystal, trapping
a metastable state of the system before it can recrystallize to stabler forms1.
This phenomenon occurs in liquids of all classes, most recently in bulk
metallic glassformers2. Much theoretical interest has been generated by the
dynamical heterogeneity observed in cooling of fragile liquids3, 4, and many
have suggested that the slow-down is caused by a related increasing correlation
length 5-9. Here we report both kinetics and thermodynamics of arrest in a
system that disorders while in its ground state, exhibits a large !Cp on arrest
(!Cp = Cp,mobile - Cp,arrested), yet clearly is characterized by a correlation
length that is decreasing as GT is approached from above. We show that GT
kinetics in our system, the disordering superlattice Fe50Co50, satisfy the
kinetic criterion for ideally 'strong' glassformers10, and since !Cp behavior
through Tg also correlates10, we propose that very strong liquidsand very
fragile liquids exist on opposite flanks of an order-disorder transition - one
that is already known for model systems.
