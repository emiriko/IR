Suppose F=W(k)[1/p] where W(k) is the ring of Witt vectors with coefficients
in algebraically closed field k of characteristic p>2. We construct integral
theory of p-adic semi-stable representations of the absolute Galois group of F
with Hodge-Tate weights from [0,p). This modification of Breuil's theory
results in the following application in the spirit of Shafarevich's Conjecture.
If Y is a projective algebraic variety over the field of rational numbers with
good reduction modulo all primes different from 3 and semi-stable reduction
modulo 3 then for the Hodge numbers of the complexification Y_C of Y, it holds
h^2(Y_C)=h^{1,1}(Y_C).
