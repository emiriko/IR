We propose an alternative factorization for the simple harmonic oscillator
hamiltonian which includes Mielnik's isospectral factorization as a particular
case. This factorization is realized in two non-mutually adjoint operators
whose inverse product, in the simplest case, lead to a new Sturm-Liouville
eigenvalue equation which includes Schrodinger's equation for the oscillator
and Hermite's equation as particular cases for limiting values of the
factorization's parameter, and whose eigenfunctions allow us to define new
generalized Hermite functions.
