Various aspects of the construction, operation and calibration of the
recently completed deep-sea ANTARES neutrino telescope are described. Some
first results obtained with a partial five line configuration are presented,
including depth dependence of the atmospheric muon rate, the search for
point-like cosmic neutrino sources and the search for dark matter annihilation
in the Sun.
