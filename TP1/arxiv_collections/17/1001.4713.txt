In this talk we describe a procedure for isolating the infrared singularities
present in gluonic scattering amplitudes at next-to-next-to-leading order. We
use the antenna subtraction framework which has been successfully applied to
the calculation of NNLO corrections to the 3-jet cross section and related
event shape distributions in electron-positron annihilation. Here we consider
processes with coloured particles in the initial state, and in particular
two-jet production at hadron colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
We construct a subtraction term that describes the single and double unresolved
contributions from gluonic processes using antenna functions with initial state
partons and show numerically that the subtraction term correctly approximates
the matrix elements in the various single and double unresolved configurations.
