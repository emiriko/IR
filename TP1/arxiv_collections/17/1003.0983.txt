Hawking effect from a dynamical Kerr black hole is investigated using the
improved Damour-Ruffini method with a new tortoise coordinate transformation.
Hawking temperature of the black hole can be obtained point by point at the
event horizon. It is found that Hawking temperatures of different points on the
surface are different. Moreover, the temperature does not turn to zero while
the dynamical black hole turns to an extreme one.
