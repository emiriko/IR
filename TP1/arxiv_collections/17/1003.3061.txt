A "microscopic" justification of the "symmetric damping" model of a quantum
oscillator with time-dependent frequency and time-dependent damping is given.
This model is used to predict results of experiments on simulating the
dynamical Casimir effect in a cavity with a photo-excited semiconductor mirror.
It is shown that the most general bilinear time-dependent coupling of a
selected oscillator (field mode) to a bath of harmonic oscillators results in
two equal friction coefficients for the both quadratures, provided all the
coupling coefficients are proportional to a single arbitrary function of time
whose duration is much shorter than the periods of all oscillators. The choice
of coupling in the rotating wave approximation form leads to the "mimimum
noise" model of the quantum damped oscillator, introduced earlier in a pure
phenomenological way.
