Intensive research has been done on optical character recognition ocr and a
large number of articles have been published on this topic during the last few
decades. Many commercial OCR systems are now available in the market, but most
of these systems work for Roman, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic characters. There
are no sufficient number of works on Indian language character recognition
especially Kannada script among 12 major scripts in India. This paper presents
a review of existing work on printed Kannada script and their results. The
characteristics of Kannada script and Kannada Character Recognition System kcr
are discussed in detail. Finally fusion at the classifier level is proposed to
increase the recognition accuracy.
