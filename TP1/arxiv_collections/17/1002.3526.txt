We have analyzed data of the DISTO experiment on the exclusive pp -> p Lambda
K+ reaction at 2.85 GeV to search for a strongly bound compact K-pp (= X) state
to be formed in the pp -> K+ + X reaction. The observed spectra of the K+
missing-mass and the p Lambda invariant-mass with high transverse momenta of p
and K+ revealed a broad distinct peak with a mass M_X = 2265 +- 2 (stat) +- 5
(syst) MeV/c2 and a width Gamma_X = 118 +- 8 (stat) +- 10 (syst) MeV.
