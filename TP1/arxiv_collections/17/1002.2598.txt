For any complex simple Lie algebra, we generalize primary fileds in the
Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten conformal field theory with respect to the case of
irregular singularities and we construct integral representations of
hypergeometric functions of confluent type, as expectation values of products
of generalized primary fields. In the case of sl(2), these integral
representations coincide with solutions to confluent KZ equations. Computing
the operator product expansion of the energy-momentum tensor and the
generalized primary field, new differential operators appear in the result. In
the case of sl(2), these differential operators are the same as those of the
confluent KZ equations.
