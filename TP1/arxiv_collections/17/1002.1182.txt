We propose a many-body formalism for Cooper pairs which has similarities to
the one we recently developed for composite boson excitons (coboson in short).
Its Shiva diagram representation evidences that $N$ Cooper pairs differ from
$N$ single pairs through electron exchange only: no direct coupling exists due
to the very peculiar form of the BCS potential. As a first application, we here
use this formalism to derive Richardson's equations for the exact eigenstates
of $N$ Cooper pairs. This gives hints on why the $N(N-1)$ dependence of the
$N$-pair ground state energy we recently obtained by solving Richardson's
equations analytically in the low density limit, stays valid up to the dense
regime, no higher order dependence exists even under large overlap, a
surprising result hard to accept at first. We also briefly question the BCS
wave function ansatz compared to Richardson's exact form, in the light of our
understanding of coboson many-body effects.
