We obtain formulae giving global dimensions for fusion categories defined by
Lie groups G at level k and for the associated module-categories obtained via
conformal embeddings. The results can be expressed in terms of Lie quantum
superfactorials of type G. The later are related, for the type Ar, to the
quantum Barnes function.
