A selection of the latest and most frequently used PDFs is incorporated in
PYTHIA8, including the MC-adapted PDFs from the MSTW and CTEQ collaborations.
This thesis examines the differences in PDFs as well as the effect they have on
results of simulations. The results are also compared to data collected by the
CDF experiment.
