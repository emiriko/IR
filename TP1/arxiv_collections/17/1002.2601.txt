The present paper is an extension of a recent work (Bhattacharya et al. 2010)
to the Einstein-Strauss vacuole model with a cosmological constant, where we
work out the light deflection by considering perturbations up to order M^3 and
confirm the light bending obtained previously in their vacuole model by Ishak
et al. (2008). We also obtain another local coupling term
-((5{\pi}M^2{\Lambda})/8) related to {\Lambda}, in addition to the one obtained
by Sereno (2008, 2009). We argue that the vacuole method for light deflection
is exclusively suited to cases where the cosmological constant {\Lambda}
disappears from the path equation. However, the original Rindler-Ishak method
(2007) still applies even if a certain parameter {\gamma} of Weyl gravity does
not disappear. Here, using an alternative prescription, we obtain the known
term -(({\gamma}R)/2), as well as another new local term ((3{\pi}{\gamma}M)/2)
between M and {\gamma}. Physical implications are compared, where we argue that
the repulsive term -(({\gamma}R)/2) can be masked by the Schwarzschild term
((2M)/R) in the halo regime supporting attractive property of the dark matter.
