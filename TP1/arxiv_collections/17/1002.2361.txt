We study the phenomenological consequences of a four site Higgsless model
based on the SU(2)_L x SU(2)_1 x SU(2)_2 x U(1)_Y gauge symmetry, which
predicts two neutral and four charged extra gauge bosons, Z_{1,2} and W_{1,2}.
The model represents an extension of the minimal three site version (or BESS
model), largely investigated in the literature, which includes three heavy
vector bosons. We compute the properties of the new particles, and derive
indirect and direct limits on their masses and couplings from LEP and Tevatron
data and from the perturbative unitarity requirements. In contrast to other
Higgsless models characterized by fermiophobic extra gauge bosons, here
sizeable fermion-boson couplings are allowed by the electroweak precision data.
The prospects of detecting the new predicted particles in the favoured
Drell-Yan channel at the LHC are thus investigated. The outcome is that all six
extra gauge bosons could be discovered in the early stage of the LHC
low-luminosity run.
