In this work we present a scalar field theory invariant under space-time
anisotropic transformations with a dynamic exponet $z$. It is shown that this
theory possess symmetries similar to Horava gravity and that in the limit $z=0$
the equations of motion of the non-relativistic MOND theory are obtained. This
result allow us to conjecture the existence of a Horava type gravity that in
the limit $z=0$ is consistent with MOND.
