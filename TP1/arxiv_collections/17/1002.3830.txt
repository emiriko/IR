We confirm the existence of two compact elliptical (cE) galaxies in the
central region of the Antlia cluster through MAGELLAN-MIKE and GEMINI-GMOS
spectra. Only about a dozen galaxies of this rare type are known today up to a
distance of 100 Mpc. With this finding, Antlia becomes the nearest galaxy
cluster harbouring more than one cE galaxy among its galaxy population. One of
these galaxies shows evidence of interaction with one of the giant ellipticals
that dominate the central region of the cluster.
