In this paper, a new mathematical method of electrical circuits calculus is
proposed based on the theory of the complex linear operators in matrix form.
The newly proposed method generalizes the theory of complex representation of
electrical quantities in sinusoidal periodic regime to the non-sinusoidal
periodic regime.
