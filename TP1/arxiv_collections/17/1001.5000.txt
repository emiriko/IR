We study the Hom-type generalization of infinitesimal bialgebras, called
infinitesimal Hom-bialgebras. In particular, we consider infinitesimal
Hom-bialgebras arising from quivers, the sub-classes of coboundary and
quasi-triangular infinitesimal Hom-bialgebras, the associative Hom-Yang-Baxter
equation, and homological perturbation of the comultiplications in
infinitesimal Hom-bialgebras. The relationships between infinitesimal
Hom-bialgebras, Hom-Lie bialgebras, and the classical Hom-Yang-Baxter equation
are also studied.
