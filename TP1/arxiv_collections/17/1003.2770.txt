The topcolor scenario predicts the existences of some new scalars. In this
paper, we consider the contributions of these new particles to the observables,
which are related to the top quark pair ($t\bar{t}$) production at the LHC. It
is found that these new particles can generate significant corrections to the
$t\bar{t}$ production cross section and the $t\bar{t}$ spin correlations.
