Digital processing of speech signal and voice recognition algorithm is very
important for fast and accurate automatic voice recognition technology. The
voice is a signal of infinite information. A direct analysis and synthesizing
the complex voice signal is due to too much information contained in the
signal. Therefore the digital signal processes such as Feature Extraction and
Feature Matching are introduced to represent the voice signal. Several methods
such as Liner Predictive Predictive Coding (LPC), Hidden Markov Model (HMM),
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and etc are evaluated with a view to identify a
straight forward and effective method for voice signal. The extraction and
matching process is implemented right after the Pre Processing or filtering
signal is performed. The non-parametric method for modelling the human auditory
perception system, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are utilize as
extraction techniques. The non linear sequence alignment known as Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW) introduced by Sakoe Chiba has been used as features matching
techniques. Since it's obvious that the voice signal tends to have different
temporal rate, the alignment is important to produce the better
performance.This paper present the viability of MFCC to extract features and
DTW to compare the test patterns.
