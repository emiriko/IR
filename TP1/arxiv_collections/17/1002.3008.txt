Requirement Analysis is an important phase in software development which
deals with understanding the customers requirements. It includes the collection
of information from the customer, which is regarding the customers requirements
and what he expects from the software which is to be developed. By doing so,
you can have a better understanding of what the customer actually needs and
hence can deliver the output as per the customers requirements. Studies are
being carried out to bring about improvements in the process of requirement
analysis so that errors in software development could be minimized and hence
improved and reliable products could be delivered.
