We discuss the most elementary properties of the hyperbolic trigonometry and
show how they can be exploited to get a simple, albeit interesting, geometrical
interpretation of the special relativity. It yields indeed a straightforword
understanding of the Lorentz transformation and of the relativistic kinematics
as well. The geometrical framework adopted in the article is useful to disclose
a wealth of alternative trigonometries not taught in undergraduate and graduate
courses. Their introduction could provide an interesting and useful conceptual
tool for students and teachers.
