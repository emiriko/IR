We consider a Lemaitre - Tolman - Bondi type space-time in Einstein gravity
with the Gauss-Bonnet combination of quadratic curvature terms, and present
exact solution in closed form. It turns out that the presence of the coupling
constant of the Gauss-Bonnet terms alpha > 0 completely changes the causal
structure of the singularities from the analogous general relativistic case.
The gravitational collapse of inhomogeneous dust in the five-dimensional
Gauss-Bonnet extended Einstein equations leads to formation of a massive, but
weak, timelike singularity which is forbidden in general relativity.
Interestingly, this is a counterexample to three conjecture viz. cosmic
censorship conjecture, hoop conjecture and Seifert's conjecture.
