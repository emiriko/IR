Various two-dimensional O(N) models coupled to Euclidean quantum gravity,
whose intrinsic dimension is four, are shown to belong to universality classes
of nongravitating statistical models in a lower number of dimensions. It is
speculated that the matching critical behaviors in the gravitating and
dimensionally reduced models may be manifestations of the holographic
principle.
