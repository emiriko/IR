We discuss the implications of assuming a four-zero Yukawa texture for the
charged Higgs decay $H^+ \to W^+ \gamma$ at one-loop level, within the context
of the general 2-Higgs Doublet Model of Type III. We begin by presenting a
detailed analysis of the charged Higgs boson couplings with heavy quarks and
the resulting effects on its decays. In particular, we present the possible
enhancement of the decay $H^+ \to W^+ \gamma$, whose branching ratio could be
of the order $\sim 10^{-1}$, for charged Higgs mass of the order 180 GeV. These
parameters can still avoid the $B \to X_s \gamma$ constraint and the
perturbativity bound. The production of charged Higgs bosons is also sensitive
to the modifications of its couplings, and we evaluate the events rates at the
LHC, including the `direct' $c\bar{b}\to H^++c. c.$ and `indirect' $q\bar q, gg
\to \bar t b H^++c. c.$ production channels. We get an event rate of order 60
(120) for `direct' (`indirect') production reaction, and including decay $H^+
\to W^+ \gamma $ in the final state, with an integrated luminosity of $10^5$
$pb^{-1}$.
