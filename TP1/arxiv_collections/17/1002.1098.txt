We have compared the parsec-scale jet linear polarization properties of the
Fermi LAT-detected and non-detected sources in the complete
flux-density-limited (MOJAVE-1) sample of highly beamed AGN. Of the 123 MOJAVE
sources, 30 were detected by the LAT during its first three months of
operation. We find that during the era since the launch of Fermi, the
unresolved core components of the LAT-detected jets have significantly higher
median fractional polarization at 15 GHz. This complements our previous
findings that these LAT sources have higher apparent jet speeds, brightness
temperatures and Doppler factors, and are preferentially found in higher
activity states.
