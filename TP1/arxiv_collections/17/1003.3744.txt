The FU Orionis candidate V733 Cep was discovered by Roger Persson in 2004.
The star is located in the dark cloud L1216 close to the Cepheus OB3
association. Because only a small number of FU Orionis stars have been detected
to date, photometric and spectral studies of V733 Cep are of great interest.
The studies of the photometrical variability of PMS stars are very important to
the understanding of stellar evolution. The main purpose of our study is to
construct a long-time light curve of V733 Cep. On the basis of BVRI monitoring
we also study the photometric behavior of the star. We gather data from CCD
photometry and archival photographic plates. The photometric BVRI data
(Johnson-Cousins system) that we present were collected from June 2008 to
October 2009. To facilitate transformation from instrumental measurements to
the standard system, fifteen comparison stars in the field of V733 Cep were
calibrated in BVRI bands. To construct a historical light curve of V733 Cep, a
search for archival photographic observations in the Wide-Field Plate Database
was performed. As a result, 192 photographic plates containing the field of
V733 Cep were found. Some plates were analyzed at our request to estimate the
magnitude of V733 Cep.
