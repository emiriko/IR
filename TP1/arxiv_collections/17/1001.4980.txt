In some clusters of galaxies, a diffuse non-thermal emission is present, not
obviously associated with any individual galaxy. These sources have been
identified as relics, mini-halos, and halos according to their properties and
position with respect to the cluster center. Moreover in a few cases have been
reported the existence of a diffuse radio emission not identified with a
cluster, but with a large scale filamentary region. The aim of this work is to
observe and discuss the diffuse radio emission present in the complex merging
structure of galaxies ZwCl 2341.1+0000. We have obtained VLA observations at
1.4 GHz to derive a deep radio image of the diffuse emission. Low resolution
VLA images show a diffuse radio emission associated to the complex merging
region with a largest size = 2.2 Mpc. In addition to the previously reported
peripheral radio emission, classified as a double relic, diffuse emission is
detected along the optical filament of galaxies. The giant radio source
discussed here shows that magnetic fields and relativistic particles are
present also in filamentary structures. Possible alternate scenarios are: a
giant radio halo in between two symmetric relics, or the merging of two
clusters both hosting a central radio halo.
