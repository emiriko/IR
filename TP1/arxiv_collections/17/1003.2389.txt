We present a detailed description of two-band quasi-2D metals with s-wave
superconducting (SC) and antiferromagnetic spin-density wave (SDW)
correlations. We present a general approach and use it to investigate the
influence of the difference between the shapes and the areas of the two Fermi
surfaces on the phase diagram. In particular, we determine the conditions for
the co-existence of SC and SDW orders at different temperatures and dopings. We
argue that a conventional s-wave SC order co-exists with SDW order only at very
low $T$ and in a very tiny range of parameters. An extended s-wave
superconductivity, for which SC gap changes sign between the two bands,
co-exists with antiferromagnetic SDW over a much wider range of parameters and
temperatures, but even for this SC order the regions of SDW and SC can still be
separated by a first order transition. We show that the co-existence range
becomes larger if SDW order is incommensurate. We apply our results to
iron-based pnictide materials, in some of which co-existence of SDW and SC
orders has been detected.
