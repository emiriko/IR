We consider quantum transport of spinless fermions in a 1D lattice embedding
an interacting region (two sites with inter-site repulsion U and inter-site
hopping td, coupled to leads by hopping terms tc). Using the numerical
renormalization group for the particle-hole symmetric case, we study the
quantum conductance g as a function of the inter-site hopping td. The
interacting region, which is perfectly reflecting when td -> 0 or td ->
infinity, becomes perfectly transmitting if td takes an intermediate value
\tau(U,tc) which defines the characteristic energy of this interacting model.
When td < tc sqrt(U), g is given by a universal function of the dimensionless
ratio X=td/\tau. This universality characterizes the non-interacting regime
where \tau=tc^2, the perturbative regime (U < tc^2) where \tau can be obtained
using Hartree-Fock theory, and the non-perturbative regime (U > tc^2) where
\tau is twice the characteristic temperature TK of an orbital Kondo effect
induced by the inversion symmetry. When td < \tau, the expression
g(X)=4/(X+1/X)^2 valid without interaction describes also the conductance in
the presence of the interaction. To obtain those results, we map this spinless
model onto an Anderson model with spins, where the quantum impurity is at the
end point of a semi-infinite 1D lead and where td plays the role of a magnetic
field h. This allows us to describe g(td) using exact results obtained for the
magnetization m(h) of the Anderson model at zero temperature. We expect this
universal scaling to be valid also in models with 2D leads, and observable
using 2D semi-conductor heterostructures and an interacting region made of two
identical quantum dots with strong capacitive inter-dot coupling and connected
via a tunable quantum point contact.
