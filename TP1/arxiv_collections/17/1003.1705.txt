We have used observations of the galaxy IC 10 at the 6-m telescope of the
Special Astrophysical Observatory with the SCORPIO focal reducer in the
Fabry-Perot interferometer mode and with the MPFS spectrograph to study the
structure and kinematics of ionized gas in the central region of current
intense star formation. Archive VLA 21-cm observations are used to analyze the
structure and kinematics of neutral gas in this region. High-velocity wings of
the H-alpha and [SII] emission lines were revealed in the inner cavity of the
nebula HL 111 and in other parts of the complex of violent star formation. We
have discovered local expanding neutral-gas shells around the nebulae HL 111
and HL 106.
