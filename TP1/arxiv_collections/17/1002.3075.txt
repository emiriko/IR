We examine whether metrological resolution beyond coherent states is a
nonclassical effect. We show that this is true for linear detection schemes but
false for nonlinear schemes, and propose a very simple experimental setup to
test it. We find a nonclassicality criterion derived from quantum Fisher
information.
