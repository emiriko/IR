We investigate the impact of Allee effect and dispersal on the long-term
evolution of a population in a patchy environment, focusing on whether a
population already established in one patch either successfully invades an
adjacent empty patch or undergoes a global in-all-patch extinction. Our study
is based on the combination of analytical and numerical results for both a
deterministic two-patch model and its stochastic analog. The deterministic
model has either two or four attractors. In the presence of weak dispersal, the
analysis of the deterministic model shows that a high-density and a low-density
populations can coexist at equilibrium in nearby patches, whereas the analysis
of the stochastic model indicates that this equilibrium is metastable, thus
leading after a large random time to either an in-all-patch expansion or an
in-all-patch extinction. Up to some critical dispersal, increasing the
intensity of the interactions leads to an increase of both the basin of
attraction of the in-all-patch extinction and the basin of attraction of the
in-all-patch expansion. Above this threshold, while increasing the intensity of
the dispersal, both deterministic and stochastic models predict a
synchronization of the patches resulting in either a global expansion or a
global extinction: for the deterministic model, two of the four attractors
present when the dispersal is weak are lost, while the stochastic model no
longer exhibits a metastable behavior. In the presence of strong dispersal, the
limiting behavior is entirely determined by the value of the Allee threshold as
the global population size in the deterministic and the stochastic two-patch
models evolves as dictated by the single-patch counterparts ...
