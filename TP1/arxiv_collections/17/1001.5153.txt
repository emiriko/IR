The "stellar" solution to the cosmological lithium problem proposes that
surface depletion of lithium in low-mass, metal-poor stars can reconcile the
lower abundances found for Galactic halo stars with the primordial prediction.
Globular clusters are ideal environments for studies of the surface evolution
of lithium, with large number statistics possible to obtain for main sequence
stars as well as giants. We discuss the Li abundances measured for >450 stars
in the globular cluster NGC6397, focusing on the evidence for lithium depletion
and especially highlighting how the inferred abundances and interpretations are
affected by early cluster self-enrichment and systematic uncertainties in the
effective temperature determination.
