The characteristic functions of multivariate Feller processes with generator
of affine type, and with smooth symbol functions have an explicit
representation in terms of power series with rational number coefficients and
with monmoms consisting of powers of the the symbol functions and formal
derivatives of the symbol functions. The power series repesentations are
convergent globally in time and on bounded domains of arbitrary size.
Generalized symbol functions can be derived leading to power series expansions
which are convergent on arbitrary domains in special cases. The rational number
coefficients can be efficiently computed by an integer recursion. As a
numerical consequence characteristic functions of multivariate affine processes
can be efficiently computed from the symbol function avoiding computation of
the generalized Riccati equations (an observation first made recently in a more
general context).
