The main purpose of this article is to alert spectroscopists, particularly
those involved in surveys, to the fact that rapidly pulsating sources induce
periodic structures in spectra. This would allow the detection of new classes
of objects sending bursts of pulses separated by constant time intervals that
are too short to be detected with conventional techniques. The outstanding
advantage of the technique is that there is no need for specialized instruments
or surveys. One only must incorporate signal-searching algorithms into existing
data analyzing software and use it with standard spectroscopic surveys,
including existing ones. It is a small effort with a potentially huge pay-off
because finding rapidly pulsating objects would be of enormous interest. Even a
lack of detection could be used to eliminate exotic theoretical models.
