We experimentally investigate the mix-dimensional scattering occurring when
the collisional partners live in different dimensions. We employ a binary
mixture of ultracold atoms and exploit a species-selective 1D optical lattice
to confine only one atomic species in 2D. By applying an external magnetic
field in proximity of a Feshbach resonance, we adjust the free-space scattering
length to observe a series of resonances in mixed dimensions. By monitoring
3-body inelastic losses, we measure the magnetic field values corresponding to
the mix-dimensional scattering resonances and find a good agreement with the
theoretical predictions based on simple energy considerations.
