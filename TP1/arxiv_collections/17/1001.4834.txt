The development of ferromagnetism in Mn-doped Bi2Te3 is characterized through
measurements on a series of single crystals with different Mn content. Scanning
tunneling microscopy analysis shows that the Mn substitutes on the Bi sites,
forming compounds of the type Bi2-xMnxTe3, and that the Mn substitutions are
randomly distributed, not clustered. Mn doping first gives rise to local
magnetic moments with Curie-like behavior, but by the compositions
Bi1.96Mn0.04Te3 and Bi1.91Mn0.09Te3 a second order ferromagnetic transition is
observed, with Tc ~ 9-12 K. The easy axis of magnetization in the ferromagnetic
phase is perpendicular to the Bi2Te3 basal plane. Thermoelectric power and Hall
effect measurements show that the Mn-doped Bi2Te3 crystals are p-type. Angle
resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements show that the topological
surface states that are present in pristine Bi2Te3 are also present in
ferromagnetic Mn-doped Bi2-xMnxTe3, and that the dispersion relations of the
surface states are changed in a subtle fashion.
