Although 'Halcyon' means serene environment which pervasive computing aims
at, we have tried to present a different interpretation of this word. Through

The paper gives a general overview of the state of pervasive computing today,
proposes the 'HALCYON Model' and outlines the 'social' challenges faced by
system designers.
