Gaussian copulas are widely used in the industry to correlate two random
variables when there is no prior knowledge about the co-dependence between
them. The perturbed Gaussian copula approach allows introducing the skew
information of both random variables into the co-dependence structure. The
analytical expression of this copula is derived through an asymptotic expansion
under the assumption of a common fast mean reverting stochastic volatility
factor. This paper applies this new perturbed copula to the valuation of
derivative products; in particular FX quanto options to a third currency. A
calibration procedure to fit the skew of both underlying securities is
presented. The action of the perturbed copula is interpreted compared to the
Gaussian copula. A real worked example is carried out comparing both copulas
and a local volatility model with constant correlation for varying maturities,
correlations and skew configurations.
