We derive the Maxwell's equations on the $\kappa$-deformed spacetime, valid
up to first order in the deformation parameter, using the Feynman's approach.
We show that the electric-magnetic duality is a symmetry of these equations. It
is also shown that the laws of electrodynamics are {\it different} for
particles of equal charges, but with different masses. We show that the
Poincare angular momentum, required to maintain the usual Lorentz algebra
structure, do not get any $\kappa$-dependent corrections.
