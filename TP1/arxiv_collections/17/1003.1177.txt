Based on the quantum trajectory approach, we extend the Born-Oppenheimer (BO)
approximation from closed quantum system to open quantum system, where the open
quantum system is described by a master equation in Lindblad form. The BO
approximation is defined and the validity condition is derived. We find that
the dissipation in fast variables benefits the BO approximation that is
different from the dissipation in slow variables. A detailed comparison between
this extension and our previous approximation (that is based on the effective
Hamiltonian approach, see X. L. Huang and X. X. Yi, Phys. Rev. A 80, 032108
(2009)) is presented. Several new features and advantages are analyzed, which
show that the two approximations are complementary to each other. Two examples
are taken to illustrate our method.
