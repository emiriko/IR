Multiply quantized vortices in the BCS-to-BEC evolution of p-wave resonant
Fermi gases are investigated theoretically. The vortex structure and the
low-energy quasiparticle states are discussed, based on the self-consistent
calculations of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes and gap equations. We reveal the
direct relation between the macroscopic structure of vortices, such as particle
densities, and the low-lying quasiparticle state. In addition, the net angular
momentum for multiply quantized vortices with a vorticity $\kappa$ is found to
be expressed by a simple equation, which reflects the chirality of the Cooper
pairing. Hence, the observation of the particle density depletion and the
measurement of the angular momentum will provide the information on the
core-bound state and $p$-wave superfluidity. Moreover, the details on the zero
energy Majorana state are discussed in the vicinity of the BCS-to-BEC
evolution. It is demonstrated numerically that the zero energy Majorana state
appears in the weak coupling BCS limit only when the vortex winding number is
odd. There exist the $\kappa$ branches of the core bound states for a vortex
state with vorticity $\kappa$, whereas only one of them can be the zero energy.
This zero energy state vanishes at the BCS-BEC topological phase transition,
because of interference between the core-bound and edge-bound states.
