We study the reaction e+e- --> e+e- eta_c, eta_c --> K_S K+- pi-+ and obtain
eta_c mass and width values 2982.2+-0.4+-1.6 MeV/c^2 and 31.7+-1.2+-0.8 MeV,
respectively. We find Gamma(eta_c --> gamma gamma)B(eta_c --> K anti-K
pi)=0.374+-0.009+-0.031 keV, and measure the gamma gamma* --> eta_c transition
form factor in the momentum transfer range from 2 to 50 GeV^2. The analysis is
based on 469 fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected at PEP-II with the BABAR
detector at e+e- center-of-mass energies near 10.6 GeV.
