Effect of geometrical frustration in strongly-correlated metallic region is
studied for the Hubbard model on the kagome lattice at half filling by a
cluster extension of the dynamical mean-field theory combined with a
continuous-time auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. We find that the
electron correlation enhances the spin chirality in both vector and scalar
channels. The chirality grows as decreasing temperature and exhibits a peak at
a low temperature, indicating a new energy scale under strong correlation. The
peak temperature is considerably lower than that for the local spin moment,
namely, the characteristic temperatures for the chirality and the local moment
are well separated. This is a signature of separation between spin and chiral
degrees of freedom in the correlated metallic regime under geometrical
frustration.
