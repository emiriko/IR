We investigate the surface Rashba effect for a surface of reduced in-plane
symmetry. Formulating a k.p perturbation theory, we show that the Rashba
splitting is anisotropic, in agreement with symmetry-based considerations. We
show that the anisotropic Rashba splitting is due to the admixture of bulk
states of different symmetry to the surface state, and it cannot be explained
within the standard theoretical picture supposing just a normal-to-surface
variation of the crystal potential. Performing relativistic ab initio
calculations we find a remarkably large Rashba anisotropy for an
unreconstructed Au(110) surface that is in the experimentally accessible range.
