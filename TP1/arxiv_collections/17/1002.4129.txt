With the quantum diffusion approach the unexpected behavior of fusion cross
section, angular momentum, and astrophysical S-factor at sub-barrier energies
has been revealed. Out of the region of short-range nuclear interaction and
action of friction at turning point the decrease rate of the cross section
under the barrier becomes smaller. The calculated results for the reactions
with spherical nuclei are in a good agreement with the existing experimental
data.
