We review new results on strong and electroweak interactions, flavour
physics, cosmic rays and cosmology, which were presented at this conference,
focussing on physics beyond the Standard Models. Special emphasis is given to
the Higgs sector of the Standard Model of Particle Physics and recent results
on high-energy cosmic rays and their implications for dark matter.
