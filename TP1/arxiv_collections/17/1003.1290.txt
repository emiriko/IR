We describe a system for the compensation of time-dependent stray magnetic
fields using a dual channel scalar magnetometer based on non-linear Faraday
rotation in synchronously optically pumped Cs vapour. We detail the active
control strategy, with an emphasis on the electronic circuitry, based on a
simple phase-locked-loop integrated circuit. The performance and limits of the
system developed are tested and discussed. The system was applied to
significantly improve the detection of free induction decay signals from
protons of remotely magnetized water precessing in an ultra-low magnetic field.
