Applying adiabatic, cyclic two parameter modulations we investigate quantum
heat transfer across an anharmonic molecular junction contacted with two heat
baths. We demonstrate that the pumped heat typically exhibits a Berry phase
effect in providing an additional geometric contribution to heat flux.
Remarkably, a robust fractional quantized geometric phonon response is
identified as well. The presence of this geometric phase contribution in turn
causes a breakdown of the fluctuation theorem of the Gallavotti-Cohen type for
quantum heat transfer. This can be restored only if (i) the geometric phase
contribution vanishes and if (ii) the cyclic protocol preserves the detailed
balance symmetry.
