Recent analyses show evidence for a thermal emission component that
accompanies the non-thermal emission during the prompt phase of GRBs. First, we
show the evidence for the existence of this component; Second, we show that
this component is naturally explained by considering emission from the
photosphere, taking into account high latitude emission from optically thick
relativistically expanding plasma. We show that the thermal flux is expected to
decay at late times as F_BB ~ t^{-2}, and the observed temperature as T ~
t^{-\alpha}, with \alpha ~ 1/2 - 2/3. These theoretical predictions are in very
good agreement with the observations. Finally, we discuss three implications of
this interpretation: (a) The relation between thermal emission and high energy,
non-thermal spectra observed by Fermi. (b) We show how thermal emission can be
used to directly measure the Lorentz factor of the flow and the initial radius
of the jet. (c) We show how the lack of detection of the thermal component can
be used to constrain the composition of GRB jets.
