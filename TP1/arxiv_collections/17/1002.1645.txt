Fragment partitions of fragmenting hot nuclei produced in central and
semiperipheral collisions have been compared in the excitation energy region
4-10 MeV per nucleon where radial collective expansion takes place. It is shown
that, for a given total excitation energy per nucleon, the amount of radial
collective energy fixes the mean fragment multiplicity. It is also shown that,
at a given total excitation energy per nucleon, the different properties of
fragment partitions are completely determined by the reduced fragment
multiplicity (fragment multiplicity normalized to the source size). Freeze-out
volumes seem to play a role in the scalings observed.
