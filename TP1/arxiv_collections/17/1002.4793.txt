Eutectic samples of Sr2RuO4-Ru possess many micrometer-sized Ru-metal
inclusions. Based on a Ginzburg-Landau formulation we analyze the interplay of
the chiral p-wave state of Sr2RuO4 (Tc = 1.5 K) and the s-wave state of Ru
metal (Tc,Ru = 0.5 K) for an inclusion of cylindrical geometry. As a
consequence of the mismatch of the order parameter phase, the occurrence of a
spontaneous flux distribution appears for T < Tc,Ru which evolves into a
"Josephson vortex" on the Sr2RuO4-Ru interface. At a sufficiently low
temperature a depinning transition can occur whereby the vortex moves to the
center of the cylinder.
