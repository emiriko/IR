A leading-order, leading-color parton-level event generator is developed for
use on a multi-threaded GPU. Speed-up factors between 150 and 300 are obtained
compared to an unoptimized CPU-based implementation of the event generator. In
this first paper we study the feasibility of a GPU-based event generator with
an emphasis on the constraints imposed by the hardware. Some studies of Monte
Carlo convergence and accuracy are presented for PP -> 2,...,10 jet observables
using of the order of 1e11 events.
