The class of $(d-1)$-dimensional Buchsbaum* simplicial complexes is studied.
It is shown that the rank-selected subcomplexes of a (completely) balanced
Buchsbaum* simplicial complex are also Buchsbaum*. Using this result, lower
bounds on the $h$-numbers of balanced Buchsbaum* simplicial complexes are
established. In addition, sharp lower bounds on the $h$-numbers of flag
$m$-Buchsbaum* simplicial complexes are derived, and the case of equality is
treated.
