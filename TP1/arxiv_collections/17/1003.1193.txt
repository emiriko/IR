A diversity of resonance configurations may be formed under different
migration of two giant planets. And the researchers show that the HD 128311 and
HD 73526 planetary systems are involved in a 2:1 mean motion resonance but not
in apsidal corotation, because one of the resonance argument circulates over
the dynamical evolution. In this paper, we investigate potential mechanisms to
form the 2:1 librating-circulating resonance configuration.
  In the late stage of planetary formation, scattering or colliding among
planetesimals and planetary embryos can frequently occur. Hence, in our model,
we consider a planetary configuration of two giants together with few
terrestrial planets. We find that both colliding or scattering events at very
early stage of dynamical evolution can influence the configurations trapped
into resonance. A planet-planet scattering of a moderate terrestrial planet, or
multiple scattering of smaller planets in a crowded planetary system can change
the resonant configuration. In addition, collision or merging can alter the
masses and location of the giant planets, which also play an important role in
shaping the resonant configuration during the dynamical evolution. In this
sense, the librating-circulating resonance configuration is more likely to form
by a hybrid mechanism of scattering and collision.
