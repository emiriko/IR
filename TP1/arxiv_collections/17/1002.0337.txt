We show how the description of a shear-free ray congruence in Minkowski space
as an evolving family of semi-conformal mappings can naturally be formulated on
a finite graph. For this, we introduce the notion of holomorphic function on a
graph. On a regular coloured graph of degree three, we recover the space-time
picture. In the spirit of twistor theory, where a light ray is the more
fundamental object from which space-time points should be derived, the line
graph, whose points are the edges of the original graph, should be considered
as the basic object. The Penrose twistor correspondence is discussed in this
context.
