We follow for the first time the evolution of the spin and orbital angular
momentum of a thin Ni film during ultrafast demagnetization, by means of x-ray
magnetic circular dichroism. Both components decrease with a 130 +/- 40 fs time
constant upon excitation with a femtosecond laser pulse. Additional x-ray
absorption measurements reveal an increase in the spin-orbit interaction by 6
+/- 2 % during this process. This is the experimental demonstration quantifying
the importance of spin-orbit mediated processes during the demagnetization.
