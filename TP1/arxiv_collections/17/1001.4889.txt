Labor productivity in Turkey, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, and New
Zealand has been analyzed and modeled. These counties extend the previously
analyzed set of the US, UK, Japan, France, Italy, and Canada. Modelling is
based on the link between the rate of labor participation and real GDP per
capita. New results validate the link and allow predicting a drop in
productivity by 2010 in almost all studied countries.
