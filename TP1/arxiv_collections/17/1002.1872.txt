We consider the possibility of non-sequential generation(s) of Standard Model
-like matter as a consequence of cancellation of global and gauge anomalies due
to a new strongly interacting sector responsible for the electroweak symmetry
breaking. We consider concrete models for the strong dynamics and outline
several scenarios for the next generation. For these we provide analysis of the
precision constraints as well as a discussion on collider signatures and
implications for cosmology.
