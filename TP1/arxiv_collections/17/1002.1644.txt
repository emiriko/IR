In this paper, transformation optics is presented together with a
generalization of invisibility cloaking: instead of an empty region of space,
an inhomogeneous structure is transformed via Pendry's map in order to give, to
any object hidden in the central hole of the cloak, a completely arbitrary
appearance. Other illusion devices based on superlenses considered from the
point of view of transformation optics are also discussed.
