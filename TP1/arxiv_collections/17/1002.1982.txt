In this paper, we investigate the structure of the Gardiner-Masur boundary of
Teichmuller space. Indeed, we will give a geometric description of boundary
comparing to the Duchin-Leininger-Rafi compactification of the space of
singular flat structures. We will obtain the coincidence between the
Gardiner-Masur boundary and the Thurston boundary at the projective classes of
uniquely ergodic measured foliations. We also study the action of the mapping
class group on the Gardiner-Masur boundary and characterize the elements by
fixed points. This paper has been withdrawn by the author. This paper will be
