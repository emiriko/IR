We report muon spin spectroscopy data (muSR) obtained under hydrostatic
pressure on a large single crystal of the itinerant helimagnet MnSi, and
recorded down to 0.235 K and up to 15.1 kbar. Up to the critical pressure p_c =
14.9 (2) kbar, where the magnetic order is suppressed, the muSR data
unambiguously demonstrate that the ground state of the system is magnetic with
no indication of any phase separation.
