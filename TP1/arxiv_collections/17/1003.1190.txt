In the last decade, the photospheric solar metallicity as determined from
spectroscopy experienced a remarkable downward revision. Part of this effect
can be attributed to an improvement of atomic data and the inclusion of NLTE
computations, but also the use of hydrodynamical model atmospheres seemed to
play a role. This "decrease" with time of the metallicity of the solar
photosphere increased the disagreement with the results from helioseismology.
With a CO5BOLD 3D model of the solar atmosphere, the CIFIST team at the Paris
Observatory re-determined the photospheric solar abundances of several
elements, among them C, N, and O. The spectroscopic abundances are obtained by
fitting the equivalent width and/or the profile of observed spectral lines with
synthetic spectra computed from the 3D model atmosphere. We conclude that the
effects of granular fluctuations depend on the characteristics of the
individual lines, but are found to be relevant only in a few particular cases.
3D effects are not reponsible for the systematic lowering of the solar
abundances in recent years. The solar metallicity resulting from this analysis
is Z=0.0153, Z/X=0.0209.
