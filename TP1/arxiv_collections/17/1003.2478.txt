A detailed study of the exchange bias effect and the interfacial electronic
structure in Ni/Co3O4(011) is reported. Large exchange anisotropies are
observed at low temperatures, and the exchange bias effect persists to
temperatures well above the Neel temperature of bulk Co3O4, of about 40 K: to
~80 K for Ni films deposited on well ordered oxide surfaces, and ~150 K for Ni
films deposited on rougher Co3O4 surfaces. Photoelectron spectroscopy
measurements as a function of Ni thickness show that Co reduction and Ni
oxidation occur over an extended interfacial region. We conclude that the
exchange bias observed in Ni/Co3O4, and in similar ferromagnetic metallic/Co3O4
systems, is not intrinsic to Co3O4 but rather due to the formation of CoO at
the interface.
