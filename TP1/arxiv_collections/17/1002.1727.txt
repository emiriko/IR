Motivated by the work of Uehara et al. [1], an improved method to recover DC
coefficients from AC coefficients of DCT-transformed images is investigated in
this work, which finds applications in cryptanalysis of selective multimedia
encryption. The proposed under/over-flow rate minimization (FRM) method employs
an optimization process to get a statistically more accurate estimation of
unknown DC coefficients, thus achieving a better recovery performance. It was
shown by experimental results based on 200 test images that the proposed DC
recovery method significantly improves the quality of most recovered images in
terms of the PSNR values and several state-of-the-art objective image quality
assessment (IQA) metrics such as SSIM and MS-SSIM.
