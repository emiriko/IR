The structure of Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si and S nuclei near the neutron drip-line
region is investigated in the frame-work of relativistic meannfield (RMF) and
non-relativistic Skyrme Hartree-Fock formalisms. The drip-line of these nuclei
are pointed out. We analysed the large deformation structures and many of these
neutron rich nuclei are quite deformed. New magic number are seen for these
deformed nuclei.
