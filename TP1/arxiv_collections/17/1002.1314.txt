In this paper, we study nanoparticles with constituent atoms ranging from
dozens to hundreds of them. These types of particles display structural and
magnetic properties that strongly depend on the number of constituents N. The
metal clusters are important due their interesting properties when compared to
bulk materials; hence they have potential technological applications.
Specifically, we study the Au nanoclusters through classical molecular dynamics
simulations; we analyze the total and potential energy as a function of time.
Likewise, we study the geometrical structures of Au Nanocluster corresponding
to the lowest energy states at 0 K. We consider the method of microcanonical
ensemble, and we carry out computer simulations by operating the XMD software
package and the atomistic configuration viewer AtomEye.
