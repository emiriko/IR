We investigate the dynamics of colloids at a fluid interface driven by
attractive capillary interactions. At submillimeter length scales, the
capillary attraction is formally analogous to two-dimensional gravity. In
particular it is a non-integrable interaction and it can be actually relevant
for collective phenomena in spite of its weakness at the level of the pair
potential. We introduce a mean-field model for the dynamical evolution of the
particle number density at the interface. For generic values of the physical
parameters the homogeneous distribution is found to be unstable against
large-scale clustering driven by the capillary attraction. We also show that
for the instability to be observable, the appropriate values for the relevant
parameters (colloid radius, surface charge, external electric field, etc.) are
experimentally well accessible. Our analysis contributes to current studies of
the structure and dynamics of systems governed by long-ranged interactions and
points towards their experimental realizations via colloidal suspensions.
