A model of strongly interacting and correlated hadrons is developed. The
interaction used contains a long range attraction and short range repulsive
hard core. Using this interaction and various limiting situations of it, a
study of the effect of bound states and Feshbach resonances is given. The
limiting situations are a pure square well interaction, a delta-shell potential
and a pure hard core potential. The limit of a pure hard core potential are
compared with results for a spinless Bose and Fermi gas. The limit of many
partial waves for a pure hard core interaction is also considered and result in
expressions involving the hard core volume. This feature arises from a scaling
relation similar to that for hard sphere scattering with diffractive
corrections. The role of underlying isospin symmetries associated with the
strong interaction of protons and neutrons in this two component model is
investigated. Properties are studied with varying proton fraction. An analytic
expression for the Beth Uhlenbeck continuum integral is developed which closely
approximates exact results based on the potential model considered. An analysis
of features associated with a unitary limit is given. In the unitary limit of
very large scattering length, the ratio of effective range to thermal
wavelength appears as a limiting scale. Thermodynamic quantities such as the
entropy and compressibility are also developed. The effective range corrections
to the entropy vary as the cube of this ratio for low temperatures and are
therefore considerably reduced compared to the corrections to the interaction
energy which varies linearly with this ratio. Effective range corrections to
the compressibility are also linear in the ratio.
