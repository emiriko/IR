We investigate the Q-ball formation in the thermal logarithmic potential by
means of the lattice simulation, and reconfirm qualitatively the relation
between Q-ball charge and the amplitude of the Affleck-Dine field at the onset
of its oscillation. We find time dependence of some properties of the Q ball,
such as its size and the field value at its center. Since the thermal
logarithmic potential decreases as the temperature falls down, the
gravity-mediation potential will affect the properties of the Q ball. Even in
the case when the gravity-mediation potential alone does not allow Q-ball
solution, we find the transformation from the thick-wall type of the Q ball to
the thin-wall type, contrary to the naive expectation that the Q balls will be
destroyed immediately when the gravity-mediation potential becomes dominant at
the center of the Q ball.
