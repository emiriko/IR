The probability of a quantum particle being detected in a given solid angle
is determined by the $S$-matrix. The explanation of this fact in time dependent
scattering theory is often linked to the quantum flux, since the quantum flux
integrated against a (detector-) surface and over a time interval can be viewed
as the probability that the particle crosses this surface within the given time
interval. Regarding many particle scattering, however, this argument is no
longer valid, as each particle arrives at the detector at its own random time.
While various treatments of this problem can be envisaged, here we present a
straightforward Bohmian analysis of many particle potential scattering from
which the $S$-matrix probability emerges in the limit of large distances.
