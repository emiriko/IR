We experimentally demonstrated that the quantum correlations of amplitude and
phase quadratures between signal and idler beams produced from a non-degenerate
optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) can be significantly improved by using a
mode cleaner in the pump field and reducing the phase fluctuations in phase
locking systems. Based on the two technical improvements the quantum
entanglement measured with a two-mode homodyne detector is enhanced from ~ 4 dB
to ~ 6 dB below the quantum noise limit using the same NOPA and nonlinear
crystal.
