The generalized sine-Gordon (sG) equation was derived as an integrable
generalization of the sG equation. In this paper, we develop a direct method
for solving the generalized sG equation without recourse to the inverse
scattering method. In particular, we construct multisoliton solutions in the
form of parametric representation. We obtain a variety of solutions which
include kinks, loop solitons and breathers. The properties of these olutions
are investigated in detail. We find a novel type of solitons with a peculiar
structure that the smaller soliton travels faster than the larger soliton. We
also show that the short pulse equation describing the propagation of
ultra-short pulses is reduced from the generalized sG equation in an
appropriate scaling limit. Subsequently, the reduction to the sG equation is
briefly discussed.
