We utilize the combination of two standard trapping techniques, a magnetic
trap and an optical trap in a Raman setup, to propose a versatile and tunable
trap for cold atoms. The created potential provides several advantages over
conventional trapping potentials. One can easily convert the type of the trap,
e.g., from a single well to a double well trap. Atoms in different internal
states can be trapped in different trap types, thereby enabling the realization
of experiments with multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates. Moreover, one
can achieve variations of the trapping potential on small length scales without
the need of microstructures. We present the potential surfaces for different
setups, demonstrate their tunability, give a semi-analytical expression for the
potential, and propose experiments which can be realized within such a trap.
