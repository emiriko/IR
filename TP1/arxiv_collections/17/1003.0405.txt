Recent observational work by Israelian et al. has shown that sun-like planet
host stars in the temperature range 5700K < Teff < 5850K have lithium
abundances that are significantly lower than those observed for "single" field
stars. In this letter we use stellar evolutionary models to show that
differences in stellar mass and age are not responsible for the observed
correlation. This result, along with the finding of Israelian et al., strongly
suggest that the observed lithium difference is likely linked to some process
related to the formation and evolution of planetary systems.
