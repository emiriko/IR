Energy transfer from photoexcited zero-dimensional systems to metallic
systems plays a prominent role in modern day materials science. A situation of
particular interest concerns the interaction between a photoexcited dipole and
an atomically thin metal. The recent discovery of graphene layers permits
investigation of this phenomenon. Here we report a study of fluorescence from
individual CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals in contact with single- and few-layer graphene
sheets. The rate of energy transfer is determined from the strong quenching of
the nanocrystal fluorescence. For single-layer graphene, we find a rate of ~
4ns-1, in agreement with a model based on the dipole approximation and a
tight-binding description of graphene. This rate increases significantly with
the number of graphene layers, before approaching the bulk limit. Our study
quantifies energy transfer to and fluorescence quenching by graphene, critical
properties for novel applications in photovoltaic devices and as a molecular
ruler.
