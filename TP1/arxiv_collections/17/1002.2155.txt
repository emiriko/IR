The Kolmogorov stochasticity parameter is shown to act as a tool to detect
point sources in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation temperature
maps. Kolmogorov CMB map constructed for the WMAP's 7-year datasets reveals
tiny structures which in part coincide with point radio and Fermi/LAT gamma-ray
sources. In the first application of this method, we identified several sources
not present in the then available 0FGL Fermi catalog. Subsequently they were
confirmed in the more recent and more complete 1FGL catalog, thus strengthening
the evidence for the power of this methodology.
