This paper is devoted to the theoretical analysis of a problem derived from
interaction between two Iplanet products: Web Proxy Server and the Directory
Server. In particular, a probabilistic and stochastic-approximation model is
proposed to minimize the occurrence of LDAP connection failures in Iplanet Web
Proxy 3.6 Server. The proposed model serves not only to provide a
parameterization of the aforementioned phenomena, but also to provide
meaningful insights illustrating and supporting these theoretical results. In
addition, we shall also address practical considerations when estimating the
parameters of the proposed model from experimental data. Finally, we shall
provide some interesting results from real-world data collected from our
customers.
