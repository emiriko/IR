Excited states are extracted from lattice correlation functions using a
non-uniform prior on the model parameters. Models for both a single exponential
and a sum of exponentials are considered, as well as an alternate model for the
orthogonalization of the correlation functions. Results from an analysis of
torelon and glueball operators indicate the Bayesian methodology compares well
with the usual interpretation of effective mass tables produced by a
variational procedure. Applications of the methodology are discussed.
