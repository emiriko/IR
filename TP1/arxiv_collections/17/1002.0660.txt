We consider a continuous map $f :M\to N$ between two manifolds and try to
estimate its multiplicity from below, i.e. find a $q$-tuple of pairwise
distinct points $x_1,..., x_q\in M$ such that $f(x_1) = f(x_2) = ... = f(x_q)$.
  We show that there are certain characteristic classes of vector bundle
$f^*TN-TM$ that guarantee a bound on the multiplicity of $f$. In particular, we
prove some non-trivial bound on the multiplicity for a continuous map of a real
projective space of certain dimension into a Euclidean space.
