We construct a model Hamiltonian for S = 2 spin chain, where a variable
parameter $\alpha$ is introduced. The edge spin is S = 1 for $\alpha = 0$, and
S = 3/2 for $\alpha = 1$. Due to the topological distinction of the edge
states, these two phases must be separated by one or several topological
quantum phase transitions. We investigate the nature of the quantum phase
transition by DMRG calculation, and propose a phase diagram for this model.
