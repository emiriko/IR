Current approaches to the engineering of space software such as satellite
control systems are based around the development of feedback controllers using
packages such as MatLab's Simulink toolbox. These provide powerful tools for
engineering real time systems that adapt to changes in the environment but are
limited when the controller itself needs to be adapted.
  We are investigating ways in which ideas from temporal logics and agent
programming can be integrated with the use of such control systems to provide a
more powerful layer of autonomous decision making. This paper will discuss our
initial approaches to the engineering of such systems.
