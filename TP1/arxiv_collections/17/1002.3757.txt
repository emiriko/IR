We consider a Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET) formed by n agents that move at
speed V according to the Manhattan Random-Way Point model over a square region
of side length L. The resulting stationary (agent) spatial probability
distribution is far to be uniform: the average density over the "central zone"
is asymptotically higher than that over the "suburb". Agents exchange data iff
they are at distance at most R within each other.
  We study the flooding time of this MANET: the number of time steps required
to broadcast a message from one source agent to all agents of the network in
the stationary phase. We prove the first asymptotical upper bound on the
flooding time. This bound holds with high probability, it is a decreasing
function of R and V, and it is tight for a wide and relevant range of the
network parameters (i.e. L, R and V).
  A consequence of our result is that flooding over the sparse and
highly-disconnected suburb can be as fast as flooding over the dense and
connected central zone. Rather surprisingly, this property holds even when R is
exponentially below the connectivity threshold of the MANET and the speed V is
very low.
