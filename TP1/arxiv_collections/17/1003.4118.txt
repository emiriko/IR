The utility-based pricing of defaultable bonds in the case of stochastic
intensity models of default risk is discussed. The Hamilton-Jacobi- Bellman
(HJB) equations for the value functions is derived. A finite difference method
is used to solve this problem. The yield-spreads for both buyer and seller are
extracted. The behaviour of the spread curve given the default intensity is
analyzed. Finally the impacts of the risk aversion and the correlation
coefficient are discussed.
