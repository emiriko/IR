Jets have been used to verify the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD),
measure the structure of the proton and to search for the physics beyond the
Standard Model. In this article, we review the current status of jet physics at
the Tevatron, a sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV p-pbar collider at the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory. We report on recent measurements of the inclusive jet
production cross section and the results of searches for physics beyond the
Standard Model using jets. Dijet production measurements are also reported.
