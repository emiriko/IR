We search for the flavor-changing neutral current decays D0\to mu+mu- and
D0\to e+e-, and for the lepton-flavor violating decays D0\to e\pm mu\mp using
660 fb^-1 of data collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB
asymmetric-energy e+e- collider. We find no evidence for any of these decays.
We obtain significantly improved upper limits on the branching fractions:
B(D0\to mu+mu-)<1.4x10-7, B(D0\to e+e-)<7.9x10-8, and B(D0\to e+mu-)+B(D0\to
mu+e-)<2.6x10-7 at 90% confidence level.
