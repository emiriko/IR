Virtual memory of computers is usually implemented by demand paging. For some
page replacement algorithms the number of page faults may increase as the
number of page frames increases. Belady, Nelson and Shedler constructed
reference strings for which page replacement algorithm FIFO produces near twice
more page faults in a larger memory than in a smaller one. They formulated the
conjecture that 2 is a general bound. We prove that this ratio can be
arbitrarily large.
