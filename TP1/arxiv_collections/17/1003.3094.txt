E-learning with using multimedia and graphical interfaces is now fashionable
in some virtual learning environments. Especially, in open colleges,
universities and E-learning databases, using these interfaces can improve
quality of educating by increasing attraction of educational subjects. In this
paper, we introduce this technology and its aspects by defining some Graphical
User Interfaces (GUI). Improving some indexes in E-learning environments can be
measured by using GUI. Adding some plug-ins in E-learning softwares and
environments like relative sound, electronic noting paper and virtual
classrooms can be created by E-learning GUI (ELGUI) as explain in this paper.
