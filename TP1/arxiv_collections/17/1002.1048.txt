The forward-backward asymmetry measurement in top-pair production at the
Tevatron is about $2\sigma$ from the Standard Model prediction. We propose an
asymmetric left-right model, which includes a $W'$ boson with a right-handed
coupling of down to top quark, and a $Z'$ boson with diagonal couplings to the
up, top, and down quarks with $M_{W'}\approx175$ GeV and $M_{Z'}\approx 900$
GeV. The model accounts for the asymmetry while remaining consistent with the
top-pair total cross-section and invariant mass distribution.
