Hyperfine structure parameters are calculated for the 2p2(3P)3s 4P_J,
2p2(3P)3p 4Po_J and 2p2(3P)3p 4Do_J levels, using the ab initio
multiconfiguration Hartree-Fock method. The theoretical hyperfine coupling
constants are in complete disagreement with the experimental values of
Jennerich et al. (EPJD 40(2006), 81) deduced from the analysis of the
near-infrared Doppler-free saturated absorption spectra.
