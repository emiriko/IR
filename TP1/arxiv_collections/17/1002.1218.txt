A quantum network which consists of several components should ideally work on
a single physical platform. Neutral alkali atoms have the potential to be very
well suited for this purpose due to their electronic structure which involves
long lived nuclear spins and very sensitive highly excited Rydberg states. In
this paper we describe a fabrication method based on quartz glass to structure
arbitrary shapes of microscopic vapor cells. We show that the usual
spectroscopic properties known from macroscopic vapor cells are almost
unaffected by the strong confinement.
