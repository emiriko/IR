This paper is devoted to Radial Orbit Instability in the context of
self-gravitating dynamical systems. We present this instability in the new
frame of Dissipation-Induced Instability theory. This allows us to obtain a
rather simple proof based on energetics arguments and to clarify the associated
physical mechanism.
