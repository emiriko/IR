The star formation and the subsequent metallic enrichment of spiral galaxies,
occurring at the early phases of their evolution, produce emission lines whose
contribution may change the colors of these objects. We have computed this
contribution with consistent chemo-spectro-photometrical theoretical models in
order to calculate the variations in the colors evolution.
