We investigate the coherence properties of pairs of counter-propagating
atomic clouds, produced in superradiant Rayleigh scattering off atomic
condensates. It is shown that these clouds exhibit long-range spatial coherence
and strong nonclassical density cross-correlations, which make this scheme a
promising candidate for the production of highly directional nonclassically
correlated atomic pulses.
