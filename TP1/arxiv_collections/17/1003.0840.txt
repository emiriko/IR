We review the cosmology induced by finite temperature and quantum effects on
non-supersymmetric string models. We show the evolution is attracted to
radiation-like solutions after the Hagedorn era and before the electroweak
phase transition. This mechanism generates a hierarchy between the Planck mass
and the supersymmetry breaking scale. A dynamical change of space-time
dimension can take place.
