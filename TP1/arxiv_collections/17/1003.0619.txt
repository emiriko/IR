Results are presented for the electron current in gold chiral nanotubes
(AuNTs). Starting from the band structure of (4,3) and (5,3) AuNTs, we find
that the magnitude of the chiral currents are greater than those found in
carbon nanotubes. We also calculate the associated magnetic flux inside the
tubes and find this to be higher than the case of carbon nanotubes. Although
(4,3) and (5,3) AuNTs carry transverse momenta of similar magnitudes, the
low-bias magnetic flux carried by the former is far greater than that carried
by the latter. This arises because the low-bias longitudinal current carried by
a (4,3) AuNT is significantly smaller than that of a (5,3) AuNT.
