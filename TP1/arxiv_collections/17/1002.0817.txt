It is known that fluctuations in the electrostatic potential allow for
metallic conduction (nonzero conductivity in the limit of an infinite system)
if the carriers form a single species of massless two-dimensional Dirac
fermions. A nonzero uniform mass $\bar{M}$ opens up an excitation gap,
localizing all states at the Dirac point of charge neutrality. Here we
investigate numerically whether fluctuations $\delta M \gg \bar{M} \neq 0$ in
the mass can have a similar effect as potential fluctuations, allowing for
metallic conduction at the Dirac point. Our negative conclusion confirms
earlier expectations, but does not support the recently predicted metallic
phase in a random-gap model of graphene.
