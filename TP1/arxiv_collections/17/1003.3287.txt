The statistical entropy of the FRW universe described by time-dependent
metric is newly calculated using the brick wall method based on the general
uncertainty principle with the minimal length. We can determine the minimal
length with the Plank scale to obtain the entropy proportional to the area of
the cosmological apparent horizon.
