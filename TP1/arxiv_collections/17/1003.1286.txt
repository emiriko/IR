The role of electronic Coulomb correlations in iron-based superconductors is
an important open question. We provide theoretical evidence for strong
correlation effects in the FeSe compound, based on dynamical mean field
calculations. A lower Hubbard band is found in the spectral properties.
Moreover, together with significant orbital-dependent mass enhancements, we
find that the normal state is a bad metal over an extended temperature range,
implying a non-Fermi liquid. Predictions for angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy are made.
