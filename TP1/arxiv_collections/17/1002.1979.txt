Granular materials will segregate by particle size when subjected to shear,
as occurs, for example, in avalanches. The evolution of a bidisperse mixture of
particles can be modeled by a nonlinear first order partial differential
equation, provided the shear (or velocity) is a known function of position.
While avalanche-driven shear is approximately uniform in depth, boundary-driven
shear typically creates a shear band with a nonlinear velocity profile. In this
paper, we measure a velocity profile from experimental data and solve initial
value problems that mimic the segregation observed in the experiment, thereby
verifying the value of the continuum model. To simplify the analysis, we
consider only one-dimensional configurations, in which a layer of small
particles is placed above a layer of large particles within an annular shear
cell and is sheared for arbitrarily long times. We fit the measured velocity
profile to both an exponential function of depth and a piecewise linear
function which separates the shear band from the rest of the material. Each
solution of the initial value problem is non-standard, involving curved
characteristics in the exponential case, and a material interface with a jump
in characteristic speed in the piecewise linear case.
