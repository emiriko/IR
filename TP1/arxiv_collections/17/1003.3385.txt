We consider integrable open chain models formulated in terms of generators of
affine Hecke algebras. The hierarchy of commutative elements (which are analogs
of the commutative transfer-matrices) are constructed by using the fusion
procedure. These elements satisfy a set of functional relations which
generalize functional relations among a family of transfer-matrices in solvable
spin chain models of U_q(gl(n|m)) type.
