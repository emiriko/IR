We investigate the trion formation and the effective trionic properties in
the attractive Hubbard model with three fermionic colors using exact
diagonalization. The crossover to the trionic regime with colorless compound
fermions upon increasing strength of the onsite attraction parameter U features
smoothly evolving ground state properties and exhibits clear similarities to
the BCS/BEC-crossover for two colors. In the excitation spectrum, there is a
clear gap opening between a band of well-defined trions and excitations of
broken-up trions at U_c ~ 1.8t. This picture remains the same away from the
SU(3)-symmetric point. The spatial pairing correlations for colored Cooper
pairs are compatible with a power-law at small attractions and change to an
exponential decay above the trionic crossover. Furthermore, we show that the
effective trionic liquid for U > U_c can be well modeled with spinless 'heavy'
fermions interacting with a strong nearest neighbor repulsion.
