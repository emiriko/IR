This is the manual and user guide for the Rivet system for the validation and
tuning of Monte Carlo event generators for high energy physics. As well as the
core Rivet library, this manual describes the usage of the rivet program and
the AGILe generator interface library. The depth and level of description is
chosen for users of the system, starting with the basics of using validation
code written by others, and then covering sufficient details to write new Rivet
analyses and calculational components.
