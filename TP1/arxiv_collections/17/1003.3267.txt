Adding a fourth generation to the Standard Model and assuming it to be valid
up to some cutoff \Lambda, we show that electroweak symmetry is broken by
radiative corrections due to the fourth generation. The effects of the fourth
generation are isolated using a Lagrangian with a genuine scalar without
self-interactions at the classical level. For masses of the fourth generation
consistent with electroweak precision data (including the B \rightarrow K \pi\
CP asymmetries) we obtain a Higgs mass of the order of a few hundreds GeV and a
cutoff \Lambda\ around 1-2 TeV. We study the reliability of the perturbative
treatment used to obtain these results taking into account the running of the
Yukawa couplings of the fourth quark generation with the aid of the
Renormalization Group (RG) equations, finding similar allowed values for the
Higgs mass but a slightly lower cut-off due to the breaking of the perturbative
regime. Such low cut-off means that the effects of new physics needed to
describe electroweak interactions at energy above \Lambda\ should be measurable
at the LHC. We use the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model
with four generations as an explicit example of models realizing the dynamical
electroweak symmetry breaking by radiative corrections and containing new
physics. Here, the cutoff is replaced by the masses of the squarks and
electroweak symmetry breaking by radiative corrections requires the squark
masses to be of the order of 1 TeV.
