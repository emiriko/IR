Transformation optics has recently attracted extensive interest, since it
provides a novel design methodology for manipulating light at will. Although
transformation optics in principle embraces all forms of electromagnetic
phenomena on all length scales, so far, much less efforts have been devoted to
near-field optical waves, such as surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Due to the
tight confinement and strong field enhancement, SPPs are widely used for
various purposes at the subwavelength scale. Taking advantage of transformation
optics, here we demonstrate that the confinement as well as propagation of SPPs
can be managed in a prescribed manner by careful control of the dielectric
material properties adjacent to a metal. Since the metal properties are
completely unaltered, it provides a straightforward way for practical
realizations. We show that our approach can assist to tightly bound SPPs over a
broad wavelength band at uneven and curved surfaces, where SPPs would normally
suffer significant scattering losses. In addition, a plasmonic waveguide bend
and a plasmonic Luneburg lens with practical designs are proposed. It is
expected that merging the unprecedented design flexibility based on
transformation optics with the unique optical properties of surface modes will
lead to a host of fascinating near-field optical phenomena and devices.
