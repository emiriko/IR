In this contribution, a generalized protocol of quantum teleportation is
suggested to investigate the possibility of remotely transfer unknown
multiparities entangled coherent state. A theoretical technique is introduced
to generate maximum entangled coherent states which are used as quantum
channels. We show that the mean photon number plays a central role on the
fidelity of the transferred information. The noise parameter can be considered
as a control parameter only for small values of the mean photon number.
