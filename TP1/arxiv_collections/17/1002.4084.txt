A pseudo-primitive word with respect to an antimorphic involution \theta is a
word which cannot be written as a catenation of occurrences of a strictly
shorter word t and \theta(t). Properties of pseudo-primitive words are
investigated in this paper. These properties link pseudo-primitive words with
essential notions in combinatorics on words such as primitive words,
(pseudo)-palindromes, and (pseudo)-commutativity. Their applications include an
improved solution to the extended Lyndon-Sch\"utzenberger equation u_1 u_2 ...
u_l = v_1 ... v_n w_1 ... w_m, where u_1, ..., u_l \in {u, \theta(u)}, v_1,
..., v_n \in {v, \theta(v)}, and w_1, ..., w_m \in {w, \theata(w)} for some
words u, v, w, integers l, n, m \ge 2, and an antimorphic involution \theta. We
prove that for l \ge 4, n,m \ge 3, this equation implies that u, v, w can be
expressed in terms of a common word t and its image \theta(t). Moreover,
several cases of this equation where l = 3 are examined.
