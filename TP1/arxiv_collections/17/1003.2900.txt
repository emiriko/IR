We found that a true ternary fission with formation of a heavy third fragment
(a new type of radioactivity) is quite possible for superheavy nuclei due to
the strong shell effects leading to a three-body clusterization with the two
doubly magic tin-like cores. The simplest way to discover this phenomenon in
the decay of excited superheavy nuclei is a detection of two tin-like clusters
with appropriate kinematics in low-energy collisions of medium mass nuclei with
actinide targets. The three-body quasi-fission process could be even more
pronounced for giant nuclear systems formed in collisions of heavy actinide
nuclei. In this case a three-body clusterization might be proved experimentally
by detection of two coincident lead-like fragments in low-energy U+U
collisions.
