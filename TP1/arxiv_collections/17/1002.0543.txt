Because of their narrow width, tau decays can be well separated from their
production process. Only spin degrees of freedom connect these two parts of the
physics process of interest for high energy collision experiments. In the
following, we present a Monte Carlo algorithm which is based on that property.
The interface supplements events generated by other programs, with tau decays.
Effects of spin, genuine weak corrections or of new physics may be taken into
account at the time when a tau decay is generated and written into an event
record.
