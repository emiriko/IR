We present emission line strengths, abundances, and element ratios (X/O for
Ne, S, Cl, and Ar) for a sample of 38 Galactic disk planetary nebulae (PNe)
consisting primarily of Peimbert classification Type I. Spectrophotometry for
these PNe incorporates an extended optical/near-IR range of 3600-9600 angstroms
including the [S III] lines at 9069 and 9532. We have utilized Emission Line
Spectrum Analyzer, a five-level atom abundance routine, to determine T_e, N_e,
ionization correction factors, and total element abundances. With a compilation
of data from >120 Milky Way PNe, we present results from our most recent
analysis of abundance patterns in Galactic disk PNe. We have examined the alpha
elements against H II regions and blue compact galaxies (H2BCG) to discern
signatures of depletion or enhancement in PNe progenitor stars, particularly
the destruction or production of O and Ne. We present evidence that many PNe
have higher Ne/O and lower Ar/Ne ratios compared to H2BCGs within the range of
8.5-9.0 for 12 + log(O/H). This suggests that Ne is being synthesized in the
low- and intermediate-mass progenitors. Sulfur abundances in PNe continue to
show great scatter and are systematically lower than those found in H2BCG at a
given metallicity. Although we find that PNe do show some distinction in alpha
elements when compared to H2BCG, within the Peimbert classification types
studied, PNe do not show significant differences in alpha elements amongst
themselves, at least to an extent that would distinguish in situ
nucleosynthesis from the observed dispersion in abundance ratios.
