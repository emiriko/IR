An upgraded asymmetric e+e- flavor factory, SuperKEKB, is planned at KEK. It
will deliver a luminosity of 8 x 10^35 cm^-2 s^-1, allowing precision
measurements in the flavor sector which can probe new physics well beyond the
scales accessible to direct observation. The increased luminosity also requires
upgrades of the Belle detector. Of critical importance here is a new silicon
pixel vertex tracker, which will significantly improve the decay vertex
resolution. This new detector will consist of two detector layers close to the
interaction point, using DEPFET pixel sensors with 50 um thick silicon in the
active area.
