In this work, we calculate the branching ratios (BRs) and the polarization
fractions of sixty two charmless two-body $B_c$ meson decays into final states
involving one vector and one axial-vector meson ($VA$) or two axial-vector
mesons($AA$) within the framework of perturbative QCD (pQCD) approach
systematically, where $A$ is either a $^3P_1$ or $^1P_1$ axial-vector meson.
All considered decay channels can only occur through the annihilation
topologies in the standard model. Based on the perturbative calculations and
phenomenological analysis, we find the following results: (i) the CP-averaged
BRs of the considered sixty two $B_c$ decays are in the range of $10^{-5}$ to
$10^{-9}$; (ii) since the behavior for $^1P_1$ meson is much different from
that of $^3P_1$ meson, the BRs of $B_c \to A(^1P_1) (V, A(^1P_1))$ decays are
generally larger than that of $B_c \to A(^3P_1) (V, A(^3P_1))$ decays in the
pQCD approach; (iii) many considered decays modes, such as $B_c\to a_1(1260)^+
\omega$, $b_1(1235) \rho$, etc, have sizable BRs within the reach of the LHCb
experiments; (iv) the longitudinal polarization fractions of most considered
decays are large and play the dominant role; (v) the pQCD predictions for
several decays involving mixtures of $^3P_1$ and/or $^1P_1$ mesons are highly
sensitive to the values of the mixing angles, which will be tested by the
ongoing LHC and forthcoming Super-B experiments; (vi) the CP-violating
asymmetries of these considered $B_c$ decays are absent in the standard model
because only one type tree operator is involved.
