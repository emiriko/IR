We present compelling evidence supporting the conjecture that the origin of
the roton in Bose-condensed systems arises from strong correlations between the
constituent particles. By studying the two dimensional bosonic dipole systems a
paradigm, we find that classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide a
faithful representation of the dispersion relation for a low- temperature
quantum system. The MD simulations allow one to examine the effect of coupling
strength on the formation of the roton minimum and to demonstrate that it is
always generated at a sufficiently high enough coupling. Moreover, the
classical images of the roton-roton, roton-maxon, etc. states also appear in
the MD simulation spectra as a consequence of the strong coupling.
