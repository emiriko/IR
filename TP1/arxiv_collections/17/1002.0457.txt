This work is point of the preparation to the analysis of the PLANCK satellite
data. The PLANCK satellite is an ESA mission which has been launched the 14th
of may 2009 and is dedicaced to the measurement of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) in temperature and polarization. The presence of diffuse
Galactic polarized emissions disturb the measurement of the CMB anisotropies,
in particular in polarization. Therefore a precise knowledge of these emissions
is needed to obtain the level of accuracy required for PLANCK. In this context,
we have developed and implemented a coherent 3D model of the two mains
polarized Galactic emissions : synchrotron and thermal dust. We have compared
these models to preexisting data: the 23 GHz band of the WMAP data, the 353 GHz
Archeops data and the 408 MHz all-sky continuum survey. We extrapolate these
models to the frequencies where the CMB dominates and we are able to estimate
the contribution of polarized foreground emissions to the polarized CMB
emission measured with PLANCK.
