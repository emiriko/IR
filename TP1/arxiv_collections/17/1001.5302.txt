Mazur proved that any element xi of order three in the Shafarevich-Tate group
of an elliptic curve E over a number field k can be made visible in an abelian
surface A in the sense that xi lies in the kernel of the natural homomorphism
between the cohomology groups H^1(k,E) -> H^1(k,A). However, the abelian
surface in Mazur's construction is almost never a jacobian of a genus 2 curve.
In this paper we show that any element of order three in the Shafarevich-Tate
group of an elliptic curve over a number field can be visualized in the
jacobians of a genus 2 curve. Moreover, we describe how to get explicit models
of the genus 2 curves involved.
