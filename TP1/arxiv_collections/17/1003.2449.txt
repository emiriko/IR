Using density functional calculations we explore the properties of
as-yet-unsynthesized $3d - 5d$ ordered double perovskites ($A_2BB'$O$_6$) with
highly polarizable Bi$^{3+}$ ions on the $A$ site. We find that the
Bi$_2$NiReO$_6$ and Bi$_2$MnReO$_6$ compounds are insulating and exhibit a
robust net magnetization that persists above room temperature. When the
in-plane lattice vectors of the pseudocubic unit cell are constrained to be
orthogonal (for example, by coherent heteroepitaxy), the ground states are
ferroelectric with large polarization and a very large uniaxial
magnetocrystalline anisotropy with easy axis along the ferroelectric
polarization direction. Our results suggest a route to multiferroism and
electrically controlled magnetization orientation at room temperature.
