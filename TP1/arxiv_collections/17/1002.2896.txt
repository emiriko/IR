Non-leptonic charm decays provide insights into both electro-weak and strong
dynamics. This includes the study of long-distance hadronic effects, the
approximate symmetries of strong interactions, and precision tests of the
Standard Model. In these proceedings we summarise recent results in
non-leptonic branching fraction measurements of D mesons, including
measurements of relative and absolute branching fractions in inclusive and
exclusive modes, radiative decays, and measurements of direct CP violation.
