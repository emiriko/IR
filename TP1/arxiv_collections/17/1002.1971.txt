Recent BaBar limits on $\br(\Upsilon(3S)\to \gam a\to \gam \tau^+\tau^-)$ and
$\br(\Upsilon(3S)\to \gam a\to \gam \mu^+\mu^-)$ provide increased constraints
on the $a b\anti b$ coupling of a CP-odd Higgs boson, $a$, with
$m_a<M_{\Upsilon(3S)}$. We extract these limits from the BaBar data and compare
to the limits previously obtained using other data sets, especially the
CLEO-III $\br(\Upsilon(1S)\to \gam\to\tau^+\tau^-)$ limits. Comparisons are
made to predictions in the context of "ideal"-Higgs NMSSM scenarios, in which
the lightest CP-even Higgs boson, $h_1$, can have mass below $105\gev$ (as
preferred by precision electroweak data) and yet can escape old LEP limits by
virtue of decays to a pair of the lightest CP-odd Higgs bosons, $h_1\to
a_1a_1$, with $m_{a_1}<2m_B$. Most such scenarios with $m_{a_1}<2m_\tau$ are
eliminated, but the bulk of the $m_{a_1}>7.5\gev$ scenarios, which are
theoretically the most favored, survive. We also outline the impact of the new
ALEPH LEP results in the $\epem\to Z+4\tau$ channel. For $\tan\beta\geq 3$,
only NMSSM ideal Higgs scenarios with $m_{h_1}\gsim 98\gev$ and $m_{a_1}$ close
to $2m_B $ satisfy the ALEPH limits. For $\tan\beta\lsim 2$, the ALEPH limits
are easily satisfied for the most theoretically preferred NMSSM scenarios,
which are those with $m_{a_1}$ close to $2m_B$ and $m_{h_1}\sim
90\gev-100\gev$.
