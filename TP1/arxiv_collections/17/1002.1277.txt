In this paper we revisit the "eccentric disc instability", an instability
which occurs in coherently eccentric discs of stars orbiting massive black
holes (MBHs) embedded in stellar clusters, which results in stars achieving
either very high or low eccentricities. The preference for stars to attain
higher or lower eccentricities depends significantly on the density
distribution of the surrounding stellar cluster. Here we discuss its mechanism
and the implications for the Galactic Centre, home to at least one circum-MBH
stellar disc.
