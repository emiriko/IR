We investigate how dynamical decoupling methods may be used to manipulate the
time evolution of quantum many-body systems. These methods consist of sequences
of external control operations designed to induce a desired dynamics. The
systems considered for the analysis are one-dimensional spin-1/2 models, which,
according to the parameters of the Hamiltonian, may be in the integrable or
non-integrable limits, and in the gapped or gapless phases. We show that an
appropriate control sequence may lead a chaotic chain to evolve as an
integrable chain and a system in the gapless phase to behave as a system in the
gapped phase. A key ingredient for the control schemes developed here is the
possibility to use, in the same sequence, different time intervals between
control operations.
