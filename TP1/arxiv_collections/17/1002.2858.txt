PageRank is a Web page ranking technique that has been a fundamental
ingredient in the development and success of the Google search engine. The
method is still one of the many signals that Google uses to determine which
pages are most important. The main idea behind PageRank is to determine the
importance of a Web page in terms of the importance assigned to the pages
hyperlinking to it. In fact, this thesis is not new, and has been previously
successfully exploited in different contexts. We review the PageRank method and
link it to some renowned previous techniques that we have found in the fields
of Web information retrieval, bibliometrics, sociometry, and econometrics.
