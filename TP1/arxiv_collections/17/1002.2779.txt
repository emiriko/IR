In this paper, we construct various examples of holomorphic laminations, with
leaves of dimension 1, and we also study some of their dynamical properties. In
particular we study existence and uniqueness of positive closed currents. We
construct minimal laminations with infinitely many mutually singular closed
currents and no non-closed harmonic current. We also consider embeddings to
projective space.
