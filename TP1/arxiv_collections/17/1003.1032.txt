We report on the experimental observation of reduced light energy transport
and disorder-induced localization close to a boundary of a truncated
one-dimensional (1D) disordered photonic lattice. Our observations uncover that
near the boundary a higher level of disorder is required to obtain similar
localization than in the bulk.
