The space-time scales of the hadronization process in the framework of string
model are investigated. It is shown that the average formation lengths of
pseudoscalar mesons, produced in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS)
of leptons on different targets, depend from their electrical charges. In
particular the average formation lengths of positively charged hadrons are
larger than of negatively charged ones. This statement is fulfiled for all
using scaling functions, for $z$ (the fraction of the virtual photon energy
transferred to the detected hadron) larger than 0.15, for all nuclear targets
and any value of the Bjorken scaling variable $x_{Bj}$. In all cases, the main
mechanism is direct production of pseudoscalar mesons. Including in
consideration additional mechanism of production in result of decay of
resonances, leads to decrease of average formation lengths. It is shown that
the average formation lengths of positively (negatively) charged mesons are
slowly rising (decreasing) functions of $x_{Bj}$. The obtained results can be
important, in particular, for the understanding of the hadronization process in
nuclear environment.
