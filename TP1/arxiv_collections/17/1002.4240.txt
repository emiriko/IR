We find that some equilibrium systems and their non-equilibrium counterparts
actually show the same jerky response or avalanche behavior on many scales in
response to slowly changing external conditions. In other words, their static
and dynamic avalanches behave statistically the same. This suggests that their
critical properties are much more generally applicable than previously assumed.
In this case, systems far from equilibrium may be used to predict equilibrium
critical behavior, and vice versa.
