Based on the drift-kinetic theory, we develop a model for particle
acceleration and transport in solar flares. The model describes the evolution
of the particle distribution function by means of a numerical simulation of the
drift-kinetic Vlasov equation, which allows us to directly compare simulation
results with observations within an actual parameter range of the solar corona.
Using this model, we investigate the time evolution of the electron
distribution in a flaring region. The simulation identifies two dominant
mechanisms of electron acceleration. One is the betatron acceleration at the
top of closed loops, which enhances the electron velocity perpendicular to the
magnetic field line. The other is the inertia drift acceleration in open
magnetic field lines, which produces antisunward electrons. The resulting
velocity space distribution significantly deviates from an isotropic
distribution. The former acceleration can be a generation mechanism of
electrons that radiate loop-top nonthermal emissions, and the latter be of
escaping electrons from the Sun that should be observed by in-situ measurements
in interplanetary space and resulting radio bursts through plasma
instabilities.
