In this paper, we study the theories of analytic and arithmetic local
constants of elliptic curves, with the work of Rohrlich, for the former, and
the work of Mazur and Rubin, for the latter, as a basis. With the Parity
Conjecture as motivation, one expects that the arithmetic local constants
should be the algebraic additive counterparts to ratios of local analytic root
numbers. We calculate the constants on both sides in various cases,
establishing this connection for a substantial class of elliptic curves. By
calculating the arithmetic constants in some new cases, we also extend the
class of elliptic curves for which one can determine lower bounds for the
growth of p-Selmer rank in dihedral extensions of number fields.
