One dimensional nanobeam photonic crystal cavities are fabricated in silicon
dioxide with silicon nanocrystals. Quality factors of over 9 x 10^3 are found
in experiment, matching theoretical predictions, with mode volumes of
1.5(lambda/n)^3 . Photoluminescence from the cavity modes is observed in the
visible wavelength range 600-820 nm. Studies of the lossy characteristics of
the cavities are conducted at varying temperatures and pump powers. Free
carrier absorption effects are found to be significant at pump powers as low as
a few hundred nanowatts.
