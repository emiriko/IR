Let S be a Sobolev or Orlicz-Sobolev space of functions not necessarily
vanishing at the boundary of the domain. We give sufficient conditions on a
nonnegative function in S in order that its spherical rearrangement ("Schwartz
symmetrization") still belongs to S. These results are obtained via relative
isoperimetric inequalities and somewhat generalize a well-known Polya-Szego's
theorem. We also prove that the rearrangement of any function in S is locally
in S.
