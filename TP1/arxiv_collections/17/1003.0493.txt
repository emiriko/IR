We investigate the possible frictionless transport of many composite
(condensed) fermions at room temperature regime along an annular tube with
transversely wavy-corrugations by using the verified transition-rate model and
boundary perturbation approach. We found that for certain activation volume and
energy there exist possible frictionless states at room temperature regime.
