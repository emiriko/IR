Ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices realize simple, fundamental models in
condensed matter physics. Our 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate is confined in a
harmonic trapping potential to which we add an optical lattice potential. Here
we realize the 2D Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian and focus on the effects of the
harmonic trap, not present in bulk condensed matter systems. By measuring
condensate fraction we identify the transition from superfluid to Mott
insulator as a function of atom density and lattice depth. Our results are in
excellent agreement with the quantum Monte Carlo universal state diagram,
suitable for trapped systems, introduced by Rigol et al. (Phys. Rev. A 79,
053605 (2009)).
