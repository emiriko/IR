We use a novel sample geometry to study non-local effects of edge excitations
in the integer quantum Hall effect regime. We find that the condition of local
equilibrium at the quantum Hall edge is affected by the diffusion of
dynamically polarized nuclei. Our analysis indicates, that the nuclear
diffusion is effectively one-dimensional in the present experiment.
