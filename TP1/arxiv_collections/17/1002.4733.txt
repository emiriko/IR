This paper develops different discretization schemes for nonholonomic
mechanical systems through a discrete geometric approach. The proposed methods
are designed to account for the special geometric structure of the nonholonomic
motion. Two different families of nonholonomic integrators are developed and
examined numerically: the geometric nonholonomic integrator (GNI) and the
reduced d'Alembert-Pontryagin integrator (RDP). As a result, the paper provides
a general tool for engineering applications, i.e. for automatic derivation of
numerically accurate and stable dynamics integration schemes applicable to a
variety of robotic vehicle models.
