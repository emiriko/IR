We study thermodynamics of N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons theory by
computing quantum corrections to the free energy. We find that in weakly
coupled ABJM theory on R(2) x S(1), the leading correction is non-analytic in
the 't Hooft coupling lambda, and is approximately of order lambda^2
log(lambda)^3. The free energy is expressed in terms of the scalar thermal mass
m, which is generated by screening effects. We show that this mass vanishes to
1-loop order. We then go on to 2-loop order where we find a finite and positive
mass squared m^2. We discuss differences in the calculation between Coulomb and
Lorentz gauge. Our results indicate that the free energy is a monotonic
function in lambda which interpolates smoothly to the N^(3/2) behaviour at
strong coupling.
