We discuss the heat transfer by photons between two metals coupled by a
linear element with a reactive impedance. Using a simple circuit approach, we
calculate the spectral power transmitted from one resistor to the other and
find that it is determined by the photon transmission coefficient, which
depends on the impedances of the metals and the coupling element. We study the
total photonic power flow for different coupling impedances, both in the linear
regime, where the temperature difference between the metals is small, and in
the non-linear regime of large temperature differences.
