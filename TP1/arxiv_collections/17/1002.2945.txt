HD 65949 is a late B star with exceptionally strong Hg II at 3984[A], but it
is not a typical HgMn star. The Re II spectrum is of extraordinary strength.
Abundances, or upper limits are derived here for 58 elements based on a model
with Teff = 13100K, and log(g) = 4.0. Even-Z elements through nickel show minor
deviations from solar abundances. Anomalies among the odd-Z elements through
copper are mostly small. Beyond the iron peak, a huge scatter is found. The
abundance pattern of the heaviest elements resembles the N=126 r-process peak
of solar material, though not in detail. We find a significant correlation of
the abundance excesses with second ionization potentials for elements with Z >
30. This indicates the relevance of photospheric or near-photospheric
processes. We explore a model with mass accretion of exotic material followed
by the more commonly accepted differentiation by diffusion. That model leads to
a number of predictions which challenge future work.
  Likely primary and secondary masses are near 3.3 and 1.6 M(solar), with a
separation of ca. 0.25 AU. New atomic structure calculations are presented in
two appendices.
