Recent investigations of the WD + MS channel of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia)
imply that this channel may be the main contribution to the old population
(>1Gyr) of SNe Ia. In the WD + MS channel, the WD could accrete material from a
main-sequence or a slightly evolved star until it reaches the Chandrasekhar
mass limit. The companions in this channel would survive after SN explosion and
show distinguishing properties. In this Letter, based on SN Ia production
regions of the WD + MS channel and three formation channels of WD + MS systems,
we performed a detailed binary population synthesis study to obtain the
properties of the surviving companions. The properties can be verified by
future observations. We find that the surviving companions of the old SNe Ia
have a low mass, which provides a possible way to explain the formation of the
population of single low-mass WDs (<0.45Msun).
