{\it GALEX} near ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) light curves of
three extremely low accretion rate polars show distinct modulations in their UV
light curves. While these three systems have a range of magnetic fields from 13
to 70 MG, and of late type secondaries (including a likely brown dwarf in
SDSSJ121209.31+013627.7), the accretion rates are similar, and the UV
observations imply some mechanism is operating to create enhanced emission
zones on the white dwarf. The UV variations match in phase to the two magnetic
poles viewed in the optical in WX LMi and to the single poles evident in the
optical in SDSSJ1212109.31+013627.7 and SDSSJ103100.55+202832.2. Simple spot
models of the UV light curves show that if hot spots are responsible for the UV
variations, the temperatures are on the order of 10,000-14,000K. For the single
pole systems, the size of the FUV spot must be smaller than the NUV and in all
cases, the geometry is likely more complicated than a simple circular spot.
