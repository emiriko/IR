It has already been demonstrated that a mesoscale meteorological model such
as Meso-NH is highly reliable in reproducing 3D maps of optical turbulence.
Preliminary measurements above the Antarctic Plateau have so far indicated a
pretty good value for the seeing: around 0.3" at Dome C. However some
uncertainties remain. That's why our group is focusing on a detailed study of
the atmospheric flow and turbulence in the internal Antarctic Plateau. Our
intention is to use the Meso-NH model to do predictions of the atmospheric flow
and the corresponding optical turbulence in the internal plateau. The use of
this model has another huge advantage: we have access to informations inside an
entire 3D volume which is not the case with observations only. Two different
configurations have been used: a low horizontal resolution (with a mesh-size of
100 km) and a high horizontal resolution with the grid-nesting interactive
technique (with a mesh-size of 1 km in the innermost domain centered above the
area of interest). We present here the turbulence distribution reconstructed by
Meso-NH for 16 nights monitored in winter time 2005, looking at the the seeing
and the surface layer thickness.
