We present N-body cosmological numerical simulations including a primordial
non-Gaussianity in the density fluctuation field quantified by the non-linear
parameter $f_{NL}$. We have used MPGRAFIC code to produce initial conditions
and the Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) code RAMSES to evolve the large scale
structure formation. We estimated the higher order momenta of the initial
distribution of density fluctuations, investigated the redshift evolution of
the non-linear power spectrum and estimated the discrepancy introduced by the
primordial non-Gaussianity in the non-linear power spectrum.
