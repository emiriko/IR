Experiments on the iron-pnictide superconductors appear to show some
materials where the ground state is fully gapped, and others where low-energy
excitations dominate, possibly indicative of gap nodes. Within the framework of
a 5-orbital spin fluctuation theory for these systems, we discuss how changes
in the doping, the electronic structure or interaction parameters can tune the
system from a fully gapped to nodal sign-changing gap with s-wave ($A_{1g}$)
symmetry ($s^\pm$). In particular we focus on the role of the hole pocket at
the $(\pi,\pi)$ point of the unfolded Brillouin zone identified as crucial to
the pairing by Kuroki {\it et al.}, and show that its presence leads to
additional nesting of hole and electron pockets which stabilizes the isotropic
$s^\pm$ state. The pocket's contribution to the pairing can be tuned by doping,
surface effects, and by changes in interaction parameters, which we examine.
Analytic expressions for orbital pairing vertices calculated within the RPA
fluctuation exchange approximation allow us to draw connections between aspects
of electronic structure, interaction parameters, and the form of the
superconducting gap.
