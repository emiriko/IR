Mechanisms for the generation of primordial non-Gaussian metric fluctuations
in the context of multiple-field inflation are reviewed. As long as kinetic
terms remain canonical, it appears that nonlinear couplings inducing
non-gaussianities can be split into two types. The extension of the one-field
results to multiple degrees of freedom leads to gravity mediated couplings that
are ubiquitous but generally modest. Multiple-field inflation offers however
the possibility of generating non-gravity mediated coupling in isocurvature
directions that can eventually induce large non-Gaussianities in the metric
fluctuations. The robustness of the predictions of such models is eventually
examined in view of a case study derived from a high-energy physics
construction.
