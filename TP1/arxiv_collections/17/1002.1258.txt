The complexity of ultrafast molecular photoionization presents an obstacle to
the modelling of pump-probe experiments. Here, a simple optimized model of
atomic rubidium is combined with a molecular dynamics model to predict
quantitatively the results of a pump-probe experiment in which long range
rubidium dimers are first excited, then ionized after a variable delay. The
method is illustrated by the outline of two proposed feasible experiments and
the calculation of their outcomes. Both of these proposals use Feshbach 87Rb2
molecules. We show that long-range molecular pump-probe experiments should
observe spin-orbit precession given a suitable pump-pulse, and that the
associated high-frequency beat signal in the ionization probability decays
after a few tens of picoseconds. If the molecule was to be excited to only a
single fine structure state state, then a low-frequency oscillation in the
internuclear separation would be detectable through the timedependent
ionization cross section, giving a mechanism that would enable observation of
coherent vibrational motion in this molecule.
