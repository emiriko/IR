The interaction of thioglycolic acid with the Au(111) surface is
investigaged, and it is found that at the low coverage the molecule lies down
on the substrate. If the mercaptan-hydrogen atom is eliminated, the resulting
SCH_2COOH molecule is randomly oriented on the surface. If the carboxylic acid
group in the HSCH_2COOH molecule is deprotonated instead, the HSCH_2COO^
molecule lies down on the surface. However, when the mercaptan-hydrogen atom in
the HSCH_2COO^- molecule is removed, the resulting SCH_2COO^- molecule rises up
to a certain level on the substrate. The calculated Raman vibrational spectra
decipher which compounds and atomic displacements contribute to the
corresponding frequencies. We thus propose a consistent mechanism for the
deposition of thioglycolic acid on the Au(111) surface.
