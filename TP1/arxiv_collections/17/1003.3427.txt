The formation of excited compound nucleus (CN) and its statistical decay is
investigated within the dinuclear system (DNS) model.The initial DNS is formed
in the entrance channel when the projectile is captured by a target, and then
the evolution of DNS in mass asymmetry coordinate leads to formation of the hot
CN. The emission barriers for complex fragments were calculated within the DNS
model by using the double folding procedure for the interaction potential. It
is shown that cross sections for complex fragment emission become larger when
excited CN is more neutron deficient. This approach gives also an opportunity
to calculate the new neutron deficient isotopes production cross sections and
can be applied to describe the hot fission of heavy systems.The model was
tested by comparison of calculated results with experimental data
