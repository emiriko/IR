Numerical simulations of dark matter collapse and structure formation show
that in addition to a large halo surrounding the baryonic component of our
galaxy, there also exists a significant number of subhalos that extend hundreds
of kiloparsecs beyond the edge of the observable Milky Way. We find that for
dark matter (DM) annihilation models, galactic subhalos can significantly
modify the spectrum of electrons and positrons as measured at our galactic
position. Using data from the recent Via Lactea II simulation we include the
subhalo contribution of electrons and positrons as boundary source terms for
simulations of high energy cosmic ray propagation with a modified version of
the publicly available GALPROP code. Focusing on the DM DM -> 4e annihilation
channel, we show that including subhalos leads to a better fit to both the
Fermi and PAMELA data. The best fit gives a dark matter particle mass of 1.2
TeV, for boost factors of 90 in the main halo and 1950-3800 in the subhalos
(depending on assumptions about the background), in contrast to the 0.85 TeV
mass that gives the best fit in the main halo-only scenario. These fits suggest
that at least a third of the observed electron cosmic rays from DM annihilation
could come from subhalos, opening up the possibility of a relaxation of recent
stringent constraints from inverse Compton gamma rays originating from the
high-energy leptons.
