Several string backgrounds which arise in the AdS/CFT correspondence are
described by integrable sigma-models. Their target space is always a Z(4)
supercoset (a semi-symmetric superspace). Here we list all semi-symmetric
cosets which have zero beta function and central charge c<=26 at one loop in
perturbation theory.
