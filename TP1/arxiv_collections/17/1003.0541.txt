Context: In the search for extrasolar systems by radial velocity technique, a
precise wavelength calibration is necessary for high-precision measurements.
The choice of the calibrator is a particularly important question in the
infra-red domain, where the precision and exploits still fall behind the
achievements of the optical.
  Aims: We investigate the long-term stability of atmospheric lines as a
precise wavelength reference and analyze their sensitivity to different
atmospheric and observing conditions.
  Methods: We use HARPS archive data on three bright stars, Tau Ceti, Mu Arae
and Epsilon Eri, spanning 6 years and containing high-cadence measurements over
several nights. We cross-correlate this data with an O2 mask and evaluate both
radial velocity and bisector variations down to a photon noise of 1 m/s.
  Results: We find that the telluric lines in the three data-sets are stable
down to 10 m/s (r.m.s.) over the 6 years. We also show that the radial velocity
variations can be accounted for by simple atmospheric models, yielding a final
precision of 1-2 m/s.
  Conclusions: The long-term stability of atmospheric lines was measured as
being of 10 m/s over six years, in spite of atmospheric phenomena. Atmospheric
lines can be used as a wavelength reference for short-time-scales programs,
yielding a precision of 5 m/s "out-of-the box". A higher precision, down to 2
m/s can be reached if the atmospheric phenomena are corrected for by the simple
atmospheric model described, making it a very competitive method even on long
time-scales.
