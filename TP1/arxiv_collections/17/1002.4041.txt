Term extraction is one of the layers in the ontology development process
which has the task to extract all the terms contained in the input document
automatically. The purpose of this process is to generate list of terms that
are relevant to the domain of the input document. In the literature there are
many approaches, techniques and algorithms used for term extraction. In this
paper we propose a new approach using particle swarm optimization techniques in
order to improve the accuracy of term extraction results. We choose five
features to represent the term score. The approach has been applied to the
domain of religious document. We compare our term extraction method precision
with TFIDF, Weirdness, GlossaryExtraction and TermExtractor. The experimental
results show that our propose approach achieve better precision than those four
algorithm.
