Optical resonances in 1D photonic crystal microcavities are investigated
numerically using finite-element light scattering and eigenmode solvers. The
results are validated by comparison to experimental and theoretical findings
from the literature. The influence of nanometer-scale geometry variations on
the resonator performance is studied. Limiting factors to ultra-high Q-factor
performance are identified.
