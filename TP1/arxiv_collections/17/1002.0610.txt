Consider a discrete locally finite subset $\Gamma$ of $R^d$ and the complete
graph $(\Gamma,E)$, with vertices $\Gamma$ and edges $E$. We consider Gibbs
measures on the set of sub-graphs with vertices $\Gamma$ and edges $E'\subset
E$. The Gibbs interaction acts between open edges having a vertex in common. We
study percolation properties of the Gibbs distribution of the graph ensemble.
The main results concern percolation properties of the open edges in two cases:
(a) when the $\Gamma$ is a sample from homogeneous Poisson process and (b) for
a fixed $\Gamma$ with exponential decay of connectivity.
