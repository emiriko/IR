We study the problem of sparse reconstruction from noisy undersampled
measurements when the following two things are available. (1) We are given
partial, and partly erroneous, knowledge of the signal's support, denoted by
$T$. (2) We are also given an erroneous estimate of the signal values on $T$,
denoted by $(\hat{\mu})_T$. In practice, both these may be available from
available prior knowledge. Alternatively, in recursive reconstruction
applications, like real-time dynamic MRI, one can use the support estimate and
the signal value estimate from the previous time instant as $T$ and
$(\hat{\mu})_T$. In this work, we introduce regularized modified-BPDN
(reg-mod-BPDN) and obtain computable bounds on its reconstruction error.
Reg-mod-BPDN tries to find the signal that is sparsest outside the set $T$,
while being "close enough" to $(\hat{\mu})_T$ on $T$ and while satisfying the
data constraint. Corresponding results for modified-BPDN and BPDN follow as
direct corollaries. A second key contribution is an approach to obtain
computable error bounds that hold without any sufficient conditions. This makes
it easy to compare the bounds for the various approaches. Empirical
reconstruction error comparisons with many existing approaches are also
provided.
