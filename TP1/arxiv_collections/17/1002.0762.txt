We present here a theoretical model in order to describe the competition
between the Kondo effect and the spin glass behavior. The spin glass part of
the starting Hamiltonian contains Ising spins with an intersite exchange
interaction given by the local van Hemmen model, while the Kondo effect is
described as usual by the intrasite exchange $J_K$. We obtain, for large $J_K$
values, a Kondo phase and, for smaller $J_K$ values, a succession, with
decreasing
