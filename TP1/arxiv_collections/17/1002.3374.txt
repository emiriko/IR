We explore the behaviour of accreting protoclusters with a Monte Carlo
dynamical code in order to evaluate the relative roles of accretion, two body
relaxation and stellar collisions in the cluster evolution. We corroborate the
suggestion of Clarke & Bonnell that the number of stellar collisions should
scale as $N^{5/3} \dot M^{2/3}$ (independent of other cluster parameters, where
N is the number of stars in the cluster and $\dot M$ the rate of mass
accretion) and thus strengthen the argument that stellar collisions are more
likely in populous (large N) clusters. We however find that the estimates of
Clarke & Bonnell were pessimistic in the sense that we find that more than 99 %
of the stellar collisions occur within the post-adiabatic regime as the cluster
evolves towards core collapse, driven by a combination of accretion and
two-body relaxation. We discuss how the inclusion of binaries may reduce the
number of collisions through the reversal of core collapse but also note that
it opens up another collisional channel involving the merger of stars within
hard binaries; future Nbody simulations are however required in order to
explore this issue.
