In this work we investigate structural properties of native states of a
simple model for short flexible homopolymers, where the steric influence of
monomeric side chains is effectively introduced by a thickness constraint. This
geometric constraint is implemented through the concept of the global radius of
curvature and affects the conformational topology of ground-state structures. A
systematic analysis allows for a thickness-dependent classification of the
dominant ground-state topologies. It turns out that helical structures,
strands, rings, and coils are natural, intrinsic geometries of such tubelike
objects.
