We show that quintessence, when it is described by a tachyonic field, can
amplify a tiny primordial gradient generating a preferred direction in the sky.
In its simplest realization, this mechanism only affects the Cosmic Microwave
Background fluctuations at the quadrupole level. We briefly discuss how higher
multipoles can also be affected, once the full structure of the quintessence
potential is taken into account.
