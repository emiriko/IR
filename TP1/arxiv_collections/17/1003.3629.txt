Networks are pervasive in the real world. Nature, society, economy, and
technology are supported by ostensibly different networks that in fact share an
amazing number of interesting structural properties. Network thinking exploded
in the last decade, boosted by the availability of large databases on the
topology of various real networks, mainly the Web and biological networks, and
converged to the new discipline of network analysis - the holistic analysis of
complex systems through the study of the network that wires their components.
Physicists mainly drove the investigation, studying the structure and function
of networks using methods and tools of statistical mechanics. Here, we give an
alternative perspective on network analysis, proposing a logic for specifying
general properties of networks and a modular algorithm for checking these
properties. The logic borrows from two intertwined computing fields: XML
databases and model checking.
