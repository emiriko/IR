We consider the high gain spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a non
collinear geometry as a paradigmatic scenario to investigate the
quantum-to-classical transition by increasing the pump power, that is, the
average number of generated photons. The possibility of observing quantum
correlations in such macroscopic quantum system through dichotomic measurement
will be analyzed by addressing two different measurement schemes, based on
different dichotomization processes. More specifically, we will investigate the
persistence of non-locality in an increasing size n/2-spin singlet state by
studying the change in the correlations form as $n$ increases, both in the
ideal case and in presence of losses. We observe a fast decrease in the amount
of Bell's inequality violation for increasing system size. This theoretical
analysis is supported by the experimental observation of macro-macro
correlations with an average number of photons of about 10^3. Our results
enlighten the practical extreme difficulty of observing non-locality by
performing such a dichotomic fuzzy measurement.
