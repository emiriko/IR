We establish the cutoff-dependent upper Higgs boson mass bound by means of
direct lattice computations in the framework of a chirally invariant lattice
Higgs-Yukawa model emulating the same chiral Yukawa coupling structure as in
the Higgs-fermion sector of the Standard Model. As expected from the triviality
picture of the Higgs sector, we observe the upper mass bound to decrease with
rising cutoff parameter $\Lambda$. Moreover, the strength of the fermionic
contribution to the upper mass bound is explored by comparing to the
corresponding analysis in the pure $\Phi^4$-theory.
