Monitoring of pulse period variations in accreting binary pulsars is an
important tool to study the interaction between the magnetosphere of the
neutron star and the accretion disk. While the X-ray flux of the brightest
X-ray pulsars have been successfully monitored over many years (e.g. with
RXTE/ASM, CGRO/BATSE, Swift/BAT), the possibility to monitor their pulse timing
properties continuously has so far been very limited. In our work we use
Swift/BAT observations to study one of the most enigmatic X-ray pulsars,
Hercules X-1. For the first time, a quasi-continuous monitoring of the pulse
period and the pulse period derivative of Her X-1, is achieved over a long time
(> 4 yrs). We argue that together with the long-term decrease of the orbital
period in Her X-1 the measured pulse period behaviour requires the presence of
mass ejection from the inner parts of the accretion disk along the open
magnetic field lines. The mass ejection episodes probably take place during
strong spin-down episodes which are associated with the low X-ray luminosity.
