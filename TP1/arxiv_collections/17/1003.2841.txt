We study a holographic model dual to walking/conformal technicolor (W/C TC)
deforming a hard-wall type of bottom-up setup by including effects from
techni-gluon condensation. We calculate masses of (techni-) $\rho$ meson, $a_1$
meson, and flavor/chiral-singlet scalar meson identified with techni-dilaton
(TD)/conformal Higgs boson, as well as the $S$ parameter. It is shown that
gluon contributions and large anomalous dimension tend to decrease specifically
mass of the TD. In the typical model with $S \simeq 0.1$, we find $m_{\rm TD}
\simeq 600$ GeV, while $m_\rho,m_{a_1} \simeq 4 {\rm TeV}$.
