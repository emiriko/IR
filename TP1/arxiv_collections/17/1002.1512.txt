The population dynamics theory of B cells in a typical germinal center could
play an important role in revealing how affinity maturation is achieved.
However, the existing models encountered some conflicts with experiments. To
resolve these conflicts, we present a coarse-grained model to calculate the B
cell population development in affinity maturation, which allows a
comprehensive analysis of its parameter space to look for optimal values of
mutation rate, selection strength, and initial antibody-antigen binding level
that maximize the affinity improvement. With these optimized parameters, the
model is compatible with the experimental observations such as the ~100-fold
affinity improvements, the number of mutations, the hypermutation rate, and the
"all or none" phenomenon. Moreover, we study the reasons behind the optimal
parameters. The optimal mutation rate, in agreement with the hypermutation rate
in vivo, results from a tradeoff between accumulating enough beneficial
mutations and avoiding too many deleterious or lethal mutations. The optimal
selection strength evolves as a balance between the need for affinity
improvement and the requirement to pass the population bottleneck. These
findings point to the conclusion that germinal centers have been optimized by
evolution to generate strong affinity antibodies effectively and rapidly. In
addition, we study the enhancement of affinity improvement due to B cell
migration between germinal centers. These results could enhance our
understandings to the functions of germinal centers.
