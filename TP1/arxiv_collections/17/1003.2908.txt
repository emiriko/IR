We study the inflated phase of two dimensional lattice polygons, both convex
and column-convex, with fixed area A and variable perimeter, when a weight
\mu^t \exp[- Jb] is associated to a polygon with perimeter t and b bends. The
mean perimeter is calculated as a function of the fugacity \mu and the bending
rigidity J. In the limit \mu -> 0, the mean perimeter has the asymptotic
behaviour \avg{t}/4 \sqrt{A} \simeq 1 - K(J)/(\ln \mu)^2 + O (\mu/ \ln \mu) .
The constant K(J) is found to be the same for both types of polygons,
suggesting that self-avoiding polygons should also exhibit the same asymptotic
behaviour.
