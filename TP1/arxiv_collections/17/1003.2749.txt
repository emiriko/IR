Recently there has been considerable interest in the design of efficient
carrier sense multiple access(CSMA) protocol for wireless network. The basic
assumption underlying recent results is availability of perfect carrier sense
information. This allows for design of continuous time algorithm under which
collisions are avoided. The primary purpose of this note is to show how these
results can be extended in the case when carrier sense information may not be
perfect, or equivalently delayed. Specifically, an adaptation of algorithm in
Rajagopalan, Shah, Shin (2009) is presented here for time slotted setup with
carrier sense information available only at the end of the time slot. To
establish its throughput optimality, in additon to method developed in
Rajagopalan, Shah, Shin (2009), understanding properties of stationary
distribution of a certain non-reversible Markov chain as well as bound on its
mixing time is essential. This note presents these key results. A longer
version of this note will provide detailed account of how this gets
incorporated with methods of Rajagopalan, Shah, Shin (2009) to provide the
positive recurrence of underlying network Markov process. In addition, these
results will help design optimal rate control in conjunction with CSMA in
presence of collision building upon the method of Jiang, Shah, Shin, Walrand
(2009).
