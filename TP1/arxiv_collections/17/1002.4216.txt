A new scheme for Yukawa matrices is proposed for free of flavor changing
neutral currents (FCNCs) at tree level in general two-Higgs-doublet model
(THDM) without imposing symmetry. We find that the new type couplings of
charged Higgs to fermions not only depend on the flavors, but also can be
ascribed by new CP violating phases. Unlike conventional THDM, the resulted new
charged Higgs effects could have the specialties: (a) the influence on
$\Gamma(K^\pm_{e 2})/\Gamma(K^\pm_{\mu 2})$ cannot be eliminated, (b) the decay
constant of $D_s$ could be enhanced, and (c) enhancement of branching ratio for
$B^+\to \tau^+ \nu$ could be achieved.
