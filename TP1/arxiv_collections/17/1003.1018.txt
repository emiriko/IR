Slovenia's Current Research Information System (SICRIS) currently hosts
86,443 publications with citation data from 8,359 researchers working on the
whole plethora of social and natural sciences from 1970 till present. Using
these data, we show that the citation distributions derived from individual
publications have Zipfian properties in that they can be fitted by a power law
$P(x) \sim x^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha$ between 2.4 and 3.1 depending on the
institution and field of research. Distributions of indexes that quantify the
success of researchers rather than individual publications, on the other hand,
cannot be associated with a power law. We find that for Egghe's g-index and
Hirsch's h-index the log-normal form $P(x) \sim \exp[-a\ln x -b(\ln x)^2]$
applies best, with $a$ and $b$ depending moderately on the underlying set of
researchers. In special cases, particularly for institutions with a strongly
hierarchical constitution and research fields with high self-citation rates,
exponential distributions can be observed as well. Both indexes yield
distributions with equivalent statistical properties, which is a strong
indicator for their consistency and logical connectedness. At the same time,
differences in the assessment of citation histories of individual researchers
strengthen their importance for properly evaluating the quality and impact of
scientific output.
