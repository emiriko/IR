Confinement asymmetry effects on the photoabsorption of a quantum well are
discussed by means of a sum-rules approach using a Hamiltonian including a
Rashba spin-orbt coupling. We show that while the strength of the excitation is
zero when the spin-orbit coupling is neglected, the inclusion of the spin-orbit
interaction gives rise to a non zero strength and mean excitation energy in the
far-infrared region. A simple expression for these quantities up to the second
order in the Rashba parameter was derived. The effect of two-body Coulomb
interaction is then studied by means of a Quantum Monte Carlo calculation,
showing that electron-electron correlations induce only a small deviation from
the independent particle model result.
