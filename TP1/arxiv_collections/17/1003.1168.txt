In this paper, we intend to answer one key question to the success of cloud
computing: in cloud, do many task computing (MTC) or high throughput computing
(HTC) service providers, which offer the corresponding computing service to end
users, benefit from the economies of scale? Our research contributions are
three-fold: first, we propose an innovative usage model, called dynamic service
provision (DSP) model, for MTC or HTC service providers. In the DSP model, the
resource provider provides the service of creating and managing runtime
environments for MTC or HTC service providers, and consolidates heterogeneous
MTC or HTC workloads on the cloud platform; second, according to the DSP model,
we design and implement DawningCloud, which provides automatic management for
heterogeneous workloads; third, a comprehensive evaluation of DawningCloud has
been performed in an emulatation experiment. We found that for typical
workloads, in comparison with the previous two cloud solutions, DawningCloud
saves the resource consumption maximally by 46.4% (HTC) and 74.9% (MTC) for the
service providers, and saves the total resource consumption maximally by 29.7%
for the resource provider. At the same time, comparing with the traditional
solution that provides MTC or HTC services with dedicated systems, DawningCloud
is more cost-effective. To this end, we conclude that for typical MTC and HTC
workloads, on the cloud platform, MTC and HTC service providers and the
resource provider can benefit from the economies of scale.
