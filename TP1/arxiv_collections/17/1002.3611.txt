We analyze a suite of global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) accretion disk
simulations in order to determine whether scaling laws for turbulence driven by
the magnetorotational instability, discovered via local shearing box studies,
are globally robust. The simulations model geometrically-thin disks with zero
net magnetic flux and no explicit resistivity or viscosity. We show that the
local Maxwell stress is correlated with the self-generated local vertical
magnetic field in a manner that is similar to that found in local simulations.
Moreover, local patches of vertical field are strong enough to stimulate and
control the strength of angular momentum transport across much of the disk. We
demonstrate the importance of magnetic linkages (through the low-density
corona) between different regions of the disk in determining the local field,
and suggest a new convergence requirement for global simulations -- the
vertical extent of the corona must be fully captured and resolved. Finally, we
examine the temporal convergence of the average stress, and show that an
initial long-term secular drift in the local flux-stress relation dies away on
a time scale that is consistent with turbulent mixing of the initial magnetic
field.
