It is well known that at distances shorter than Planck length, no length
measurements are possible. The Volovich hypothesis asserts that at
sub-Planckian distances and times, spacetime itself has a non-Archimedean
geometry. We discuss the structure of elementary particles, their
classification, and their conformal symmetry under this hypothesis.
Specifically, we investigate the projective representations of the $p$-adic
Poincar\'{e} and Galilean groups, using a new variant of the Mackey machine for
projective unitary representations of semidirect products of locally compact
and second countable (lcsc) groups. We construct the conformal spacetime over
$p$-adic fields and discuss the imbedding of the $p$-adic Poincar\'{e} group
into the $p$-adic conformal group. Finally, we show that the massive and so
called eventually masssive particles of the Poincar\'{e} group do not have
conformal symmetry. The whole picture bears a close resemblance to what happens
over the field of real numbers, but with some significant variations.
