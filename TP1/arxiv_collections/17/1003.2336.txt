We present timing analyses of eight X-ray light curves and one optical/UV
light curve of the nova V4743 Sgr (2002) taken by CHANDRA and XMM on days after
outburst: 50 (early hard emission phase), 180, 196, 302, 371, 526 (super soft
source, SSS, phase), and 742 and 1286 (quiescent emission phase). We have
studied the multifrequency nature and time evolution of the dominant peak at
~0.75 mHz using the standard Lomb-Scargle method and a 2-D sine fitting method.
We found a double structure of the peak and its overtone for days 180 and 196.
The two frequencies were closer together on day 196, suggesting that the
difference between the two peaks is gradually decreasing. For the later
observations, only a single frequency can be detected, which is likely due to
the exposure times being shorter than the beat period between the two peaks,
especially if they are moving closer together. The observations on days 742 and
1286 are long enough to detect two frequencies with the difference found for
day 196, but we confidently find only a single frequency. We found significant
changes in the oscillation frequency and amplitude. We have derived blackbody
temperatures from the SSS spectra, and the evolution of changes in frequency
and blackbody temperature suggests that the 0.75-mHz peak was modulated by
pulsations. Later, after nuclear burning had ceased, the signal stabilised at a
single frequency, although the X-ray frequency differs from the optical/UV
frequency obtained consistently from the OM onboard XMM and from ground-based
observations. We believe that the late frequency is the white dwarf rotation
and that the ratio of spin/orbit period strongly supports that the system is an
intermediate polar.
