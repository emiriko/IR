In this article we explore the ability of dynamical systems tools to describe
transport in oceanic flows characterized by data sets measured from satellite.
In particular we have studied the geometrical skeleton describing transport in
the Kuroshio region. For this purpose we have computed special hyperbolic
trajectories, recognized as distinguished hyperbolic trajectories, that act as
organizing centres of the flow. We have computed their stable and unstable
manifolds, and they reveal that the turnstile mechanism is at work during
several spring months in the year 2003 across the Kuroshio current. We have
found that near the hyperbolic trajectories takes place a filamentous transport
front-cross the current that mixes waters at both sides.
