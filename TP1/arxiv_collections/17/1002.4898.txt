We report the discovery of new Herbig-Haro (HH) jets in the Carina Nebula,
and we discuss the protostellar outflow activity of a young OB association.
These are the first results of an HST/ACS H-alpha imaging survey of Carina.
Adding to the one previously known example (HH666), we detect 21 new HH jets,
plus 17 new candidate jets, ranging in length from 0.005 to 3 pc. We derive jet
mass-loss rates ranging from 8e-9 to 1e-6 Msun/yr, but a comparison to the
distribution of jet mass-loss rates in Orion suggests that we may be missing a
large fraction of the jets below 1e-8 Msun/yr. A key qualitative result is that
even some of the smallest dark globules with sizes of 0.01pc are active sites
of ongoing star formation because we see HH jets emerging from them, and that
these offer potential analogs to the cradle of our Solar System because of
their proximity to dozens of imminent supernovae that will enrich them with
radioactive nuclides like 60Fe. HST images reveal proplyd structures in the
core of the Tr14 cluster, only 0.1-0.2 pc from several O-type stars. Many
examples of bent jets serve as "wind socks"; strong photoevaporative flows can
shape the jets, competing with the direct winds and radiation from massive
stars. Finally, even allowing for a large number of jets that may escape
detection, we find that HH jets are negligible to the global turbulence of the
surrounding region, which is driven by massive star feedback.
