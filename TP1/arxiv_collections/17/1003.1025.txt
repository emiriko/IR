The evolution of a vacuum component of the Universe is investigated in the
quantum as well as the classical regimes. Probably our Universe has arisen as a
vacuum fluctuation and very probably that it has had a high symmetry for
Planckian parameters. Besides, vacuum energy density has to be a positive one.
In the early epochs during its cooling the Universe had been losing the high
symmetry by phase transitions since condensates of quantum fields carried
negative contributions (78 orders) to its positive energy density. It was the
period of the Universe evolution during the first parts of the first second of
its life. After the last phase transition (quark-hadron) the vacuum energy `has
hardened'. In this moment its energy density can be calculated using the
Zeldovich's formula inserting an average value of the pseudo-Goldstone boson
masses (pi-mesons) that characterizes this chromodynamical vacuum. The chiral
symmetry was then lost. Dynamics of the equilibrium vacuum after its `hardness'
is considered by applying the holographic conception. In this case the Universe
has been losing vacuum energy (45 orders) on organization of new quantum states
during 13.76 x 10^9 years. Using this conception we can get solution of the
cosmological constant problem. 123 crisis orders problem may be resolved. The
density of vacuum energy cannot have a constant value in principle because of
the new quantum states are organized during expansion of the Universe but the
equation of state vacuum w= - 1 should be naturally constant. The density of
vacuum energy from z=0 up to z=10^11 is also calculated in the classical regime
of the Universe evolution.
