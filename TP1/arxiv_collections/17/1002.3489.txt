Small amplitude oscillations are a commonly observed feature in
prominences/filaments. These oscillations appear to be of local nature, are
associated to the fine structure of prominence plasmas, and simultaneous flows
and counterflows are also present. The existing observational evidence reveals
that small amplitude oscillations, after excited, are damped in short spatial
and temporal scales by some as yet not well determined physical mechanism(s).
Commonly, these oscillations have been interpreted in terms of linear
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, and this paper reviews the theoretical damping
mechanisms that have been recently put forward in order to explain the observed
attenuation scales. These mechanisms include thermal effects, through
non-adiabatic processes, mass flows, resonant damping in non-uniform media, and
partial ionization effects. The relevance of each mechanism is assessed by
comparing the spatial and time scales produced by each of them with those
obtained from observations. Also, the application of the latest theoretical
results to perform prominence seismology is discussed, aiming to determine
physical parameters in prominence plasmas that are difficult to measure by
direct means.
