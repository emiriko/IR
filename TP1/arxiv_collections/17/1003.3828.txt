Mallett has exhibited a cylindrically symmetric spacetime containing closed
timelike curves produced by a light beam circulating around a line singularity.
I analyze the static version of this spacetime obtained by setting the
intensity of the light to zero. Some null geodesics can escape to infinity, but
all timelike geodesics in this spacetime originate and terminate at the
singularity. Freely falling matter originally at rest quickly attains
relativistic velocity inward and is destroyed at the singularity.
