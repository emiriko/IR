Parabolic partial differential equations with state-dependent delays (SDDs)
are investigated. The delay term presented by Stieltjes integral simultaneously
includes discrete and distributed SDDs. The singular Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure
is also admissible. The conditions for the corresponding initial value problem
to be well-posed are presented. The existence of a compact global attractor is
proved.
