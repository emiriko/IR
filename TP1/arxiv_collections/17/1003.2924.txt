In a set of 16 drop tower experiments the motion of sub-mm to mm-sized
particles under microgravity was observed. Illumination by a halogen lamp
induced acceleration of the particles due to photophoresis. Photophoresis on
dust-free chondrules, on chondrules, glass spheres and metal spheres covered
with SiC dust and on pure SiC dust aggregates was studied. This is the first
time that photophoretic motion of mm-sized particles has been studied
experimentally. The absolute values for the photophoretic force are consistent
with theoretical expectations for spherical particles. The strength of the
photophoretic force varies for chondrules, dust covered particles and pure dust
from low to strong, respectively. The measurements support the idea that
photophoresis in the early Solar System can be efficient to transport solid
particles outward.
