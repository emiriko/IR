Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that surfaces strongly influence the
strain localization behavior of amorphous nanowires in tension. A sample
preparation routine that simulates casting was employed to facilitate the
relaxation of the sample surface. Samples as short as 15 nm (7.5 nm in
diameter) form dominant shear bands during deformation. The elastic energy
release during plastic deformation is sufficient to provide the excess
potential energy required for the shear band nucleation at rather small sample
sizes. The results show that shear band formation is almost size-independent
and is bounded only by its own length scale.
