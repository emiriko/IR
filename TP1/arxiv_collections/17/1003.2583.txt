We demonstrate a scheme for direct absorption imaging of an ultracold
ground-state polar molecular gas near quantum degeneracy. A challenge in
imaging molecules is the lack of closed optical cycling transitions. Our
technique relies on photon shot-noise limited absorption imaging on a strong
bound-bound molecular transition. We present a systematic characterization of
this imaging technique. Using this technique combined with time-of-flight (TOF)
expansion, we demonstrate the capability to determine momentum and spatial
distributions for the molecular gas. We anticipate that this imaging technique
will be a powerful tool for studying molecular quantum gases.
