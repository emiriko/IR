Cloud computing promises a radical shift in the provisioning of computing
resource within the enterprise. This paper: i) describes the challenges that
decision makers face when attempting to determine the feasibility of the
adoption of cloud computing in their organisations; ii) illustrates a lack of
existing work to address the feasibility challenges of cloud adoption in the
enterprise; iii) introduces the Cloud Adoption Toolkit that provides a
framework to support decision makers in identifying their concerns, and
matching these concerns to appropriate tools/techniques that can be used to
address them. The paper adopts a position paper methodology such that case
study evidence is provided, where available, to support claims. We conclude
that the Cloud Adoption Toolkit, whilst still under development, shows signs
that it is a useful tool for decision makers as it helps address the
feasibility challenges of cloud adoption in the enterprise.
