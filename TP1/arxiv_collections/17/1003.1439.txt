It is shown that the exact solvability of the massless Thirring model in the
canonical quantization scheme originates from the intrinsic linearizability of
its Heisenberg equations in the method of dynamical mappings. The corresponding
role of inequivalent representations of free massless Dirac field is
elucidated.
