The recent global analysis of helicity parton distributions, which takes into
account available data from inclusive and semi-inclusive polarized deep
inelastic scattering, as well as from polarized proton-proton scattering at
RHIC, appears to offer the first strong evidence that polarized sea-quark
distributions are flavor asymmetric, i.e. $\Delta \bar{u}(x) \ne \Delta
\bar{d}(x)$. We point out that the flavor symmetry breaking pattern indicated
by their analysis, i.e. $\Delta \bar{u}(x) > 0$ and $\Delta \bar{d}(x) < 0$
with the magnitude correlation $|\Delta \bar{u}(x)| < |\Delta \bar{d}(x)|$, is
just consistent with our theoretical predictions given several years ago on the
basis of the chiral quark soliton model. We also address ourselves to
understanding the physics behind this observation.
