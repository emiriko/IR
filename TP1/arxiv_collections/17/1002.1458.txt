A new formula for the partition function $p(n)$ is developed. We show that
the number of partitions of $n$ can be expressed as the sum of a simple
function of the two largest parts of all partitions. Specifically, if $a_1 +
>... + a_k = n$ is a partition of $n$ with $a_1 \leq ... \leq a_k$ and $a_0 =
0$, then the sum of $\lfloor(a_k + a_{k-1}) / (a_{k-1} + 1)\rfloor$ over all
partitions of $n$ is equal to $2p(n) - 1$.
