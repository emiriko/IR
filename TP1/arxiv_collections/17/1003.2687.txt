We study the motion of neutral test particles along circular orbits in the
Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime. We use the method of the effective potential
with the constants of motion associated to the underlying Killing symmetries. A
comparison between the black hole and naked singularity cases is performed. In
particular we find that in the naked singularity case for $r<Q^2/M$ no circular
orbits can exist, this radius plays a fundamental role in the physics of the
naked singularity. For $r>Q^2/M$ and $1<Q/M<\sqrt{9/8}$ there are two stability
regions together with a region where all the circular orbits are instable and a
zone in which all trajectory are possible but not circular orbits, for
$\sqrt{9/8}<Q/M<\sqrt{5}/2$ one stability region and a region where all
circular orbits are instable appear, finally for $Q/M>\sqrt{5}/2$ there are all
stable circular orbits for $r>Q^2/M$.
