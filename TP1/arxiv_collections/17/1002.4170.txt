The electromagnetic form factors of the Delta baryon are evaluated within the
framework of a covariant spectator quark model, where S and D-states are
included in the $\Delta$ wave function. We predict all the four Delta multipole
form factors: the electric charge GE0, the magnetic dipole GM1, the electric
quadrupole GE2 and the magnetic octupole GM3. We compare our predictions with
other theoretical calculations. Our results are compatible with the available
experimental data and recent lattice QCD data.
