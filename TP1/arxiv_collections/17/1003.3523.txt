We review the progress on experimental studies of the non-$D\bar D$ decays of
the $\psi(3770)$ resonance. With the world average of the observed cross
sections for $D\bar D$ production measured at 3.773 GeV by the MARK-I, MARK-II,
BES and CLEO Collaborations, combined together with the cross section for
$\psi(3770)$ production at its peak as well as initial state radiative
correction factor, we find that the non-$D\bar D$ branching fraction of
$\psi(3770)$ decays is $B[\psi(3770)\to {\rm non}-D\bar D]=(19.8\pm 1.8 \pm
5.6)%$, which is consistent within error with $B[\psi(3770)\to {\rm non}-D\bar
D]=(14.7\pm 3.2)%$ measured previously by the BES Collaboration. In addition, a
global amplitude analysis of the cross sections for $e^+e^- \to {\rm LH}$ (LH=
light hadron) measured by the CLEO Collaboration shows that the light hadron
branching fraction of $\psi(3770)$ decays can be as large as about 11%. Combing
the totally measured hadronic and electromegnatic transition rate together with
the light hadron branching fraction in the decays of $\psi(3770)$ yields the
total non-$D\bar D$ branching fraction in the decays of $\psi(3770)$ to be
about 13%.
