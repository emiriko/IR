We analyse the issue of uniqueness of solutions of the static vacuum Einstein
equations with prescribed geometric or Bartnik boundary data. Large classes of
examples are constructed where uniqueness fails. We then discuss the
implications of this behavior for the Bartnik quasi-local mass. A variational
characterization of Bartnik boundary data is also given.
