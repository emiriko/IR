Coherence properties of the down-converted beams generated in spontaneous
parametric down-conversion are investigated in detail using an iCCD camera.
Experimental results are compared with those from a theoretical model developed
for pulsed pumping with a Gaussian transverse profile. The results allow to
tailor the shape of correlation area of the signal and idler photons using
pump-field and crystal parameters. As an example, splitting of a correlation
area caused by a two-peak pump-field spectrum is experimentally studied.
