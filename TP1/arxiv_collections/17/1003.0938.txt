The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) has been used to make the first
extensive search for the class I methanol masers at 9.9 GHz. In total, 48
regions of high-mass star formation were observed. In addition to masers in
W33-Met (G12.80-0.19) and G343.12-0.06 (IRAS 16547-4247) which have already
been reported in the literature, two new 9.9-GHz masers have been found towards
G331.13-0.24 and G19.61-0.23. We have determined absolute positions (accurate
to roughly a second of arc) for all the detected masers and suggest that some
class I masers may be associated with shocks driven into molecular clouds by
expanding HII regions. Our observations also imply that the evolutionary stage
of a high-mass star forming region when the class I masers are present can
outlast the stage when the class II masers at 6.7 GHz are detectable, and
overlaps significantly with the stage when OH masers are active.
