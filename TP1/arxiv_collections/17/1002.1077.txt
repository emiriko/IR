Fast parton probes produced by hard scattering and embedded within collisions
of large nuclei have shown that partons suffer large energy loss and that the
produced medium may respond collectively to the lost energy. We present
measurements of neutral pion trigger particles at transverse momenta p^t_T =
4-12 GeV/c and associated charged hadrons (p^a_T = 0.5-7 GeV/c) as a function
of relative azimuthal angle Delta Phi at midrapidity in Au+Au and p+p
collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV. These data lead to two major observations.
First, the relative angular distribution of low momentum hadrons, whose shape
modification has been interpreted as a medium response to parton energy loss,
is found to be modified only for p^t_T < 7 GeV/c. At higher p^t_T, the data are
consistent with unmodified or very weakly modified shapes, even for the lowest
measured p^a_T. This observation presents a quantitative challenge to medium
response scenarios. Second, the associated yield of hadrons opposite to the
trigger particle in Au+Au relative to that in p+p (I_AA) is found to be
suppressed at large momentum (IAA ~ 0.35-0.5), but less than the single
particle nuclear modification factor (R_AA ~0.2).
