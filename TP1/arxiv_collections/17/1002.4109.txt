We present a modeling framework for dynamical and bursty contact networks
made of agents in social interaction. We consider agents' behavior at short
time scales, in which the contact network is formed by disconnected cliques of
different sizes. At each time a random agent can make a transition from being
isolated to being part of a group, or vice-versa. Different distributions of
contact times and inter-contact times between individuals are obtained by
considering transition probabilities with memory effects, i.e. the transition
probabilities for each agent depend both on its state (isolated or interacting)
and on the time elapsed since the last change of state. The model lends itself
to analytical and numerical investigations. The modeling framework can be
easily extended, and paves the way for systematic investigations of dynamical
processes occurring on rapidly evolving dynamical networks, such as the
propagation of an information, or spreading of diseases.
