We consider a 4D model for photon production induced by a %superluminal
refractive index perturbation in a dielectric medium. We show that, in this
model, we can infer the presence of a Hawking type effect. This prediction
shows up both in the analogue Hawking framework, which is implemented in the
pulse frame and relies on the peculiar properties of the effective geometry in
which quantum fields propagate, as well as in the laboratory frame, through
standard quantum field theory calculations. Effects of optical dispersion are
also taken into account, and are shown to provide a limited energy bandwidth
for the emission of Hawking radiation.
