The phenomenon of entanglement sudden death (ESD) in finite dimensional
composite open systems is described here for both bi-partite as well as
multipartite cases, where individual subsystems undergo Lindblad type heat bath
evolution. ESD is found to be generic for non-zero temperature of the bath. At
T=0, one-sided action of the heat bath on pure entangled states of two qubits
does not show ESD.
