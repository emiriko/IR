We present the first ground-based detection of thermal emission from an
exoplanet in the H-band. Using HAWK-I on the VLT, we observed an occultation of
WASP-19b by its G8V-type host star. WASP-19b is a Jupiter-mass planet with an
orbital period of only 19 h, and thus, being highly irradiated, is expected to
be hot. We measure an H-band occultation depth of (0.259 +0.046 -0.044) %,
which corresponds to an H-band brightness temperature of T_H = 2580 +/- 125 K.
A cloud-free model of the planet's atmosphere, with no redistribution of energy
from day-side to night-side, under predicts the planet/star flux density ratio
by a factor of two. As the stellar parameters, and thus the level of planetary
irradiation, are well-constrained by measurement, it is likely that our model
of the planet's atmosphere is too simple.
