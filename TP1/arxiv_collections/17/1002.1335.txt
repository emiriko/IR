We study the spread of influence in a social network based on the Linear
Threshold model. We derive an analytical expression for evaluating the expected
size of the eventual influenced set for a given initial set, using the
probability of activation for each node in the social network. We then provide
an equivalent interpretation for the influence spread, in terms of acyclic path
probabilities in the Markov chain obtained by reversing the edges in the social
network influence graph. We use some properties of such acyclic path
probabilities to provide an alternate proof for the submodularity of the
influence function. We illustrate the usefulness of the analytical expression
in estimating the most influential set, in special cases such as the
UILT(Uniform Influence Linear Threshold), USLT(Uniform Susceptance Linear
Threshold) and node-degree based influence models. We show that the PageRank
heuristic is either provably optimal or performs very well in the above models,
and explore its limitations in more general cases. Finally, based on the
insights obtained from the analytical expressions, we provide an efficient
algorithm which approximates the greedy algorithm for the influence
maximization problem.
