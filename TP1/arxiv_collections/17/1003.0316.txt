We present an implementation of the GW approximation for the electronic
self-energy within the full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave (FLAPW)
method. The algorithm uses an all-electron mixed product basis for the
representation of response matrices and related quantities. This basis is
derived from the FLAPW basis and is exact for wave-function products. The
singularity of the bare and screened interaction potentials gives rise to a
numerically important self-energy contribution, which we treat analytically to
achieve good convergence with respect to the k-point sampling. As numerical
realizations of the GW approximation typically suffer from the high
computational expense required for the evaluation of the nonlocal and
frequency-dependent self-energy, we demonstrate how the algorithm can be made
very efficient by exploiting spatial and time-reversal symmetry as well as by
applying an optimization of the mixed product basis that retains only the
numerically important contributions of the electron-electron interaction.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that one can employ an extrapolar approximation for
high-lying states to reduce the number of empty states that must be taken into
account explicitly in the construction of the polarization function and the
self-energy. We show convergence tests, CPU timings, and results for prototype
semiconductors and insulators as well as ferromagnetic nickel.
