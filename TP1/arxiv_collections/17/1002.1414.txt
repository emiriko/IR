Base sequences BS(n+1,n) are quadruples of {1,-1}-sequences (A;B;C;D), with A
and B of length n+1 and C and D of length n, such that the sum of their
nonperiodic autocorrelation functions is a delta-function. The base sequence
conjecture, asserting that BS(n+1,n) exist for all n, is stronger than the
famous Hadamard matrix conjecture. We introduce a new definition of equivalence
for base sequences BS(n+1,n) and construct a canonical form. By using this
canonical form, we have enumerated the equivalence classes of BS(n+1,n) for n
<= 30. Due to excessive size of the equivalence classes, the tables in the
paper cover only the cases n <= 13.
