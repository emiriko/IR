We explore the relation of the Holst term with the Nieh-Yan term in terms of
metric variables. We show that the Holst term indeed affects the classical
equations of motion in the presence of matter with spin. Therefore the correct
term to add to the Einstein-Hilbert action such that the equations of motion
are not affected is the Nieh-Yan term. We then calculate the torsion charge due
to this term in the context of a perfect fluid sphere with torsion and show
that it vanishes once a horizon is formed but not otherwise. We also show that
adding on torsion to General Relativity the Einstein's equations are no longer
holographic in torsion although they continue to be so for the metric.
