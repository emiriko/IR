In the last few years multiwavelength observations have boosted our
understanding of Ultraluminous X-ray Sources (ULXs). Yet, the most fundamental
questions on ULXs still remain to be definitively answered: do they contain
stellar or intermediate mass black holes? How do they form? We investigate the
possibility that the black holes hosted in ULXs originate from massive (40-120
$M_\odot$) stars in low metallicity natal environments. Such black holes have a
typical mass in the range $\sim 30-90 M_\odot$ and may account for the
properties of bright (above $\sim 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$) ULXs. More than $\sim
10^5$ massive black holes might have been generated in this way in the metal
poor Cartwheel galaxy during the last $10^7$ years and might power most of the
ULXs observed in it. Support to our interpretation comes from NGC 1313 X-2, the
first ULX with a tentative identification of the orbital period in the optical
band, for which binary evolution calculations show that the system is most
likely made by a massive donor dumping matter on a $50-100 M_\odot$ black hole.
