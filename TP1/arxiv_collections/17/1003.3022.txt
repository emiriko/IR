The relationship between uniformly accelerated reference frames in flat
spacetime and the uniform gravitational field is examined in a relativistic
context. It is shown that, contrary to previous statements in the pages of this
journal, equivalence does not break down in this context. No restrictions to
Newtonian approximations or small enclosures are necessary.
