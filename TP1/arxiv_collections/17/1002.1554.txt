Motivated by the first measurements of the experiment CMS at the LHC at
$\sqrt{s}=0.9$ and 2.36 TeV, we discuss energy dependence of average transverse
momentum of the secondary particles in hadron production in pp collisions. We
suggest a possible explanation of this dependence as a result of collective
rotation of the transient state and associate its further possible decrease
with flattening off at higher energies with transition to the genuine QGP state
of matter.
