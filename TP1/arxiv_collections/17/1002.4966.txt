A negative differential resistance (NDR) in the nanotransport is often
ascribed to electron correlations. We present a simple example which
demonstrates that finite electrode bandwidths and energy dependent electrode
density of states are responsible for significant NDR effects, which occur even
in uncorrelated nanotransport. Therefore, special care is needed in assessing
the contribution of electron correlations to the NDR.
