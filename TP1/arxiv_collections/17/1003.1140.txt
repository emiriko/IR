Radiation from many astrophysical sources, e.g. gamma-ray bursts and active
galactic nuclei, is believed to arise from relativistically shocked
collisionless plasmas. Such sources often exhibit highly transient spectra
evolving rapidly, compared with source lifetimes. Radiation emitted from these
sources is typically associated with non-linear plasma physics, complex field
topologies and non-thermal particle distributions. In such circumstances a
standard synchrotron paradigm may fail to produce accurate conclusions
regarding the underlying physics. Simulating spectral emission and spectral
evolution numerically in various relativistic shock scenarios is then the only
viable method to determine the detailed physical origin of the emitted spectra.
In this Letter we present synthetic radiation spectra representing the early
stage development of the filamentation (streaming) instability of an initially
unmagnetized plasma, which is relevant for both collisionless shock formation
and reconnection dynamics in relativistic astrophysical outflows, as well as
for laboratory astrophysics experiments. Results were obtained using a highly
efficient "in situ" diagnostics method, based on detailed particle-in-cell
modeling of collisionless plasmas. The synthetic spectra obtained here are
compared with those predicted by a semi-analytical model for jitter radiation
from the filamentation instability, the latter including self-consistent
generated field topologies and particle distributions obtained from the
simulations reported upon here. Spectra exhibit dependence on the presence - or
absence - of an inert plasma constituent, when comparing baryonic plasmas (i.e.
containing protons) with pair plasmas. The results also illustrate that
considerable care should be taken when using lower-dimensional models to obtain
information about the astrophysical phenomena generating observed spectra.
