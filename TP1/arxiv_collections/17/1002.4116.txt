In this paper we construct ternary $q$-Virasoro-Witt algebras which
$q$-deform the ternary Virasoro-Witt algebras constructed by Curtright, Fairlie
and Zachos using $su(1,1)$ enveloping algebra techniques. The ternary
Virasoro-Witt algebras constructed by Curtright, Fairlie and Zachos depend on a
parameter and are not Nambu-Lie algebras for all but finitely many values of
this parameter. For the parameter values for which the ternary Virasoro-Witt
algebras are Nambu-Lie, the corresponding ternary $q$-Virasoro-Witt algebras
constructed in this article are also Hom-Nambu-Lie because they are obtained
from the ternary Nambu-Lie algebras using the composition method. For other
parameter values this composition method does not yield Hom-Nambu Lie algebra
structure for $q$-Virasoro-Witt algebras. We show however, using a different
construction, that the ternary Virasoro-Witt algebras of Curtright, Fairlie and
Zachos, as well as the general ternary $q$-Virasoro-Witt algebras we construct,
carry a structure of ternary Hom-Nambu-Lie algebra for all values of the
involved parameters.
