Using the pseudopotential density functional method, we find that a Be atom
on a nanostructure with H2 molecules forms a Be-dihydrogen complex through the
hybridization of the Be s or p orbits with the H2 sigma orbits and the binding
energy of the H2 molecules is in the range of ~0.3 - 0.8 eV/H2. We also study
Be-dihydrogen complexes on various nanostructures and demonstrate the
feasibility of the application of the complexes to a hydrogen storage medium
that operates near room temperature and ambient pressure.
