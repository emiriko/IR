Fragment-size distributions have been studied experimentally in masticated
viscoelastic food (fish sausage).The mastication experiment in seven subjects
was examined. We classified the obtained results into two groups, namely, a
single lognormal distribution group and a lognormal distribution with
exponential tail group. The facts suggest that the individual variability might
affect the fragmentation pattern when the food sample has a much more
complicated physical property. In particular, the latter result (lognormal
distribution with exponential tail) indicates that the fragmentation pattern by
human mastication for fish sausage is different from the fragmentation pattern
for raw carrot shown in our previous study. The excellent data fitting by the
lognormal distribution with exponential tail implies that the fragmentation
process has a size-segregation-structure between large and small parts.In order
to explain this structure, we propose a mastication model for fish sausage
based on stochastic processes.
