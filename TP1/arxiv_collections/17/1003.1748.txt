The introduction of liquid 3He into silica aerogel provides us a with model
system in which to study the effects of disorder on the properties of a
strongly correlated Fermi liquid. The transport of heat, mass and spin exhibits
cross-over behavior from a high temperature regime, where inelastic scattering
dominates, to a low temperature regime dominated by elastic scattering off the
aerogel. We report exact and approximate solutions to the Boltzmann-Landau
transport equation for the thermal conductivity of liquid 3He, including
elastic scattering of quasiparticles by the aerogel and inelastic quasiparticle
collisions. These results provide quantitative predictions for the transport
properties of liquid 3He in aerogel over a wide range of pressure, temperature
and aerogel density. In particular, we obtain a scaling function, F(T/T*), for
the normalized thermal conductivity, K/K_el, in terms of a reduced temperature,
T/T*, where T* is a cross-over temperature defined by the elastic and inelastic
collision rates. Theoretical results are compared with the available
experimental data for the thermal conductivity.
