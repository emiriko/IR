Electromagnetic form factors have long been used to probe the underlying
charge and magnetization densities of hadrons and nuclei. Traditional
three-dimensional Fourier transform methods are not rigorously applicable for
systems with constituents that move relativistically. The use of the transverse
charge density is a new, rigorously defined way to analyze electromagnetic form
factors of hadrons.This review is concerned with the following issues: what is
a transverse charge density; how is one extracted one from elastic scattering
data; the existing results; what is the relationship with other observable
quantities; and, future prospects.
