We apply random matrix theory to derive spectral density of large sample
covariance matrices generated by multivariate VMA(q), VAR(q) and VARMA(q1,q2)
processes. In particular, we consider a limit where the number of random
variables N and the number of consecutive time measurements T are large but the
ratio N/T is fixed. In this regime the underlying random matrices are
asymptotically equivalent to Free Random Variables (FRV). We apply the FRV
calculus to calculate the eigenvalue density of the sample covariance for
several VARMA-type processes. We explicitly solve the VARMA(1,1) case and
demonstrate a perfect agreement between the analytical result and the spectra
obtained by Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed method is purely algebraic
and can be easily generalized to q1>1 and q2>1.
