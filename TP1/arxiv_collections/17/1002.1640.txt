The appearance of travelling-wave-type solutions in pipe Poiseuille flow that
are disconnected from the basic parabolic profile is numerically studied in
detail. We focus on solutions in the 2-fold azimuthally-periodic subspace
because of their special stability properties, but relate our findings to other
solutions as well. Using time-stepping, an adapted Krylov-Newton method and
Arnoldi iteration for the computation and stability analysis of relative
equilibria, and a robust pseudo-arclength continuation scheme we unfold a
double-zero (Takens-Bogdanov) bifurcating scenario as a function of Reynolds
number (Re) and wavenumber (k). This scenario is extended, by the inclusion of
higher order terms in the normal form, to account for the appearance of
supercritical modulated waves emanating from the upper branch of solutions at a
degenerate Hopf bifurcation. These waves are expected to disappear in
saddle-loop bifurcations upon collision with lower-branch solutions, thereby
leaving stable upper-branch solutions whose subsequent secondary bifurcations
could contribute to the formation of the phase space structures that are
required for turbulent dynamics at higher Re.
