The advent of increasingly precise gyroscopes has played a key role in the
technological development of navigation systems. Ring-laser and fibre-optic
gyroscopes, for example, are widely used in modern inertial guidance systems
and rely on the interference of unentangled photons to measure mechanical
rotation. The sensitivity of these devices scales with the number of particles
used as $1/ \sqrt{N}$. Here we demonstrate how, by using sources of entangled
particles, it is possible to do better and even achieve the ultimate limit
allowed by quantum mechanics where the precision scales as 1/N. We propose a
gyroscope scheme that uses ultra-cold atoms trapped in an optical ring
potential.
