We show that the tasks of privacy amplification against quantum adversaries
and data compression with quantum side information are dual in the sense that
the ability to perform one implies the ability to perform the other. These are
two of the most important primitives in classical information theory, and are
shown to be connected by complementarity and the uncertainty principle in the
quantum setting. Applications include a new uncertainty principle formulated in
terms of smooth min- and max-entropies, as well as new conditions for
approximate quantum error correction.
