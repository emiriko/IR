We present an analytic model of the refractive index for matter waves
propagating through atomic or molecular gases. The model, which combines a WKB
treatment of the long range attraction with the Fraunhofer model treatment of
the short range repulsion, furnishes a refractive index in compelling agreement
with recent experiments of Jacquey et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 240405 (2007)]
on Li atom matter waves passing through dilute noble gases. We show that the
diffractive contribution, which arises from scattering by a two dimensional
"hard core" of the potential, is essential for obtaining a correct imaginary
part of the refractive index.
