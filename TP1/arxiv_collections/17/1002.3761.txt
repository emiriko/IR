We study, using transfer-matrix methods, the partition-function zeros of the
square-lattice q-state Potts antiferromagnet at zero temperature (=
square-lattice chromatic polynomial) for the special boundary conditions that
are obtained from an m x n grid with free boundary conditions by adjoining one
new vertex adjacent to all the sites in the leftmost column and a second new
vertex adjacent to all the sites in the rightmost column. We provide numerical
evidence that the partition-function zeros are becoming dense everywhere in the
complex q-plane outside the limiting curve B_\infty(sq) for this model with
ordinary (e.g. free or cylindrical) boundary conditions. Despite this, the
infinite-volume free energy is perfectly analytic in this region.
