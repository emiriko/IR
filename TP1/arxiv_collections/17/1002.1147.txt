The spectral properties of the spinless fermion model with nearest-neighbor
repulsive interactions on a one-dimensional lattice are investigated using the
Bethe ansatz. Although its bulk quantities are exactly the same as those of the
spin-1/2 XXZ chain, the difference in the statistics of particles causes
substantial effects on spectral features, such as gapless points of dispersion
relations and line shapes of spectral functions. In this Letter, we clarify the
origin of the differences in spectral features between fermionic and bosonic
systems in terms of Bethe ansatz solutions. We also confirm that the two-string
solutions have considerable spectral weights in the high-energy regime.
