In chaotic dynamical systems, a number of rare trajectories with low level of
chaoticity are embedded in chaotic sea, while extraordinary unstable
trajectories can exist even in weakly chaotic regions. In this study, a
quantitative method for searching these rare trajectories is developed; the
method is based on multicanonical Monte Carlo and can estimate the probability
of initial conditions that lead to trajectory fragments of a given level of
chaoticity. The proposed method is successfully tested with four-dimensional
coupled standard maps, where probabilities as small as $10^{-14}$ are
estimated.
