Biology-derived algorithms are an important part of computational sciences,
which are essential to many scientific disciplines and engineering
applications. Many computational methods are derived from or based on the
analogy to natural evolution and biological activities, and these biologically
inspired computations include genetic algorithms, neural networks, cellular
automata, and other algorithms.
