We review latest progress in gaseous photomultipliers (GPM) combining solid
photocathodes and various types of novel electron multipliers. Cascaded gaseous
electron multipliers (GEM) coated with CsI photocathodes can efficiently
replace UVsensitive wire chambers for single-photon recording in Cherenkov and
other detectors. Other hole-multipliers with patterned electrodes (Micro-Hole
and Strip Plates) and improved ion-blocking properties are discussed; these
permit reducing considerably photon- and ion-induced secondary effects. Photon
detectors with other electron-multiplier techniques are briefly described,
among them GPMs based on Micromegas, capillary-plates, Thick-GEMs and resistive
Thick GEMs. The two latter techniques, robust and economically produced, are
particularly suited for large-area GPM applications, e.g. in RICH. Cascaded
hole-multipliers with very high ion-blocking performance permitted the
development and the first demonstration of DC-operated visible-sensitive
gaseous photomultipliers with bialkali photocathodes and single-photon
sensitivity. Recent progress is described in GPMs operated at cryogenic
temperatures for rare-event noble-liquid detectors and medical imaging.
