New Neutral Gauge Bosons, Z' 's, are predicted by many models of physics
beyond the Standard Electroweak Theory. It is possible that a Z' would be
discovered early in the Large Hadron Collider program. The next step would be
to measure its properties to identify the underlying theory that gave rise to
the Z'. Heavy quarks have the unique property that they can be identified in
the final states. In this letter we demonstrate that measuring Z' decays to b-
and t-quark final states can act as an effective means of discriminating
between models with extra gauge bosons.
