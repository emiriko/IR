We study the gravitational collapse of an inhomogeneous scalar field with
quantum gravity corrections associated with singularity avoidance. Numerical
simulations indicate that there is critical behaviour at the onset of black
hole formation as in the classical theory, but with the difference that black
holes form with a mass gap.
