We discuss the problems that arise when one wishes to extend the existing
general methods of computing radiative corrections to QCD jet cross sections to
beyond next-to-leading order. Then we present a subtraction scheme that can be
defined at any order in perturbation theory. We give a status report of the
implementation of the method to computing jet cross sections in
electron-positron annihilation at the next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy.
