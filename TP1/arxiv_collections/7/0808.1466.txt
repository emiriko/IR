We theoretically investigate the spontaneous emission process of an optical,
dipolar emitter in metal-dielectric-metal slab and slot waveguide structures.
We find that both structures exhibit strong off-resonant emission enhancements
due to the tight confinement of modes between two metallic plates. The large
enhancement of surface plasmon-polariton excitation enables dipole emission to
be preferentially coupled into plasmon waveguide modes. These structures find
applications in creating nanoscale local light sources or in generating guided
single plasmons in integrated optical circuits.
