This paper presents a new mathematical formalism that describes the
quantization of games. The study of so-called quantum games is quite new,
arising from a seminal paper of D. Meyer \cite{Meyer} published in Physics
Review Letters in 1999. The ensuing near decade has seen an explosion of
contributions and controversy over what exactly a quantized game really is and
if there is indeed anything new for game theory. What has clouded many of the
issues is the lack of a mathematical formalism for the subject in which these
various issues can be clearly and precisely expressed, and which provides a
context in which to present their resolution. Such a formalism is presented
here, along with proposed resolutions to some of the issues discussed in the
literature. One in particular, the question of whether there can exist
equilibria in a quantized version of a game that do not correspond to classical
correlated equilibria of that game and also deliver better payoffs than the
classical correlated equilibria is answered in the affirmative for the
Prisoner's Dilemma and Simplified Poker.
