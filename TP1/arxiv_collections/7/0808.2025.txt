Using a covariant embedding formalism, we find the effective field equations
for the Electromagnetism that emerge on branes in the context of
Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld scenario. Our treatment is essentially
geometrical. We start with Maxwell equations in five-dimensions and project
them into an arbitrary brane. The formalism is quite general and allows us to
consider curved bulk spaces and curved branes whose tension is not necessarily
null. The kinetic electromagnetic term induced on the world volume of the
brane, proper of DGP models, is incorporated in this formulation by means of an
appropriate match condition. We also give an estimate of each term of the
effective field equations and determine the domain in which the
four-dimensional Maxwell equations can be recovered in the brane.
