We have fabricated a metallic structure in an organic Mott insulator
$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Cl. The periodic metallic domains of
approximately 90$\times$90 $\mu$m$^2$ obtained by X-ray irradiation through a
molybdenum mesh mask are visualized by scanning microregion infrared
reflectance spectroscopy technique. No deterioration by irradiation is found in
a range of nanometer to micrometer scales. We demonstrate that the present
processing method is applicable for the fabrication of molecular electronic
devices.
