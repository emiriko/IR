In this article, we present two different parallel Swendsen-Wang Cluster(SWC)
algorithms using message-passing interface(MPI). One is based on Master-Slave
Parallel Model(MSPM) and the other is based on Data-Parallel Model(DPM). A
speedup of 24 with 40 processors and 16 with 37 processors is achieved with the
DPM and MSPM respectively. The speedup of both algorithms at different
temperature and system size is carefully examined both experimentally and
theoretically, and a comparison of their efficiency is made. In the last
section, based on these two parallel SWC algorithms, two parallel probability
changing cluster(PCC) algorithms are proposed.
