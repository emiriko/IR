The gravitational time advancement is a natural but a consequence of curve
space-time geometry. In the present work the expressions of gravitational time
advancement have been obtained for geodesic motions. The situation when the
distance of signal travel is small in comparison to the distance of closest
approach has also been considered. The possibility of experimental detection of
time advancement effect has been explored.
