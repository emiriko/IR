We formulate a new framework in lattice QCD to study the relevant energy
scale of QCD phenomena. By considering the Fourier transformation of link
variable, we can investigate the intrinsic energy scale of a physical quantity
nonperturbatively. This framework is broadly available for all lattice QCD
calculations. We apply this framework for the quark-antiquark potential and
meson masses in quenched lattice QCD. The gluonic energy scale relevant for the
confinement is found to be less than 1 GeV in the Landau or Coulomb gauge.
