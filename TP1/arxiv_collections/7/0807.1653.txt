Metastable manganite perovskites displaying the antiferromagnetic so-called
E-phase are predicted to be multiferroic. Due to the need of high-pressures for
the synthesis of this phase, this prediction has only been confirmed in bulk
HoMnO3. Here we report on the growth and characterization of YbMnO3 perovskite
thin films grown under epitaxial strain. Highly-oriented thin films, with
thickness down to ~30nm, can be obtained showing magneto-dielectric coupling
and magnetic responses as those expected for the E-phase. We observe that the
magnetic properties depart from the bulk behavior only in the case of ultrathin
films (d< 30nm), which display a glassy magnetic behavior. We show that strain
effects alone cannot account for this difference and that the film morphology
plays, instead, a crucial role.
