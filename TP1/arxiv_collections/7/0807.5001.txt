In a recent work \cite{BG}, given a collection of continuous semimartingales,
authors derive a semimartingale decomposition from the corresponding ranked
processes in the case that the ranked processes can meet more than two original
processes at the same time. This has led to a more general decomposition of
ranked processes. In this paper, we derive a more general result for
semimartingales (not necessarily continuous) using a simpler approach.
Furthermore, we also give a generalization of Ouknine \cite{O1, O2} and Yan's
\cite{Y1} formula for local times of ranked processes
