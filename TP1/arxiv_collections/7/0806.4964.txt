We study a toy model for a superconductor on a bipartite lattice, where
intrinsic pairing inhomogeneity is produced by two different coupling constants
on the sublattices. The simplicity of the model allows for analytic solutions
and tests of the consequences of atomic-scale variations in pairing
interactions which have been considered recently in the cuprates. We present
results for the transition temperature, density of states, and thermodynamics
of the system over a phase diagram in the plane of two pairing coupling
constants. For coupling constants of alternating sign, a gapless
superconducting state is stable. Inhomogeneity is generally found to enhance
the critical temperature, and at the same time the superfluid density is
remarkably robust: at T=0, it is suppressed only in the gapless phase.
