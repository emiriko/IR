A code C is Z2Z4-additive if the set of coordinates can be partitioned into
two subsets X and Y such that the punctured code of C by deleting the
coordinates outside X (respectively, Y) is a binary linear code (respectively,
a quaternary linear code). In this paper, the rank and dimension of the kernel
for Z2Z4-linear codes, which are the corresponding binary codes of
Z2Z4-additive codes, are studied. The possible values of these two parameters
for Z2Z4-linear codes, giving lower and upper bounds, are established. For each
possible rank r between these bounds, the construction of a Z2Z4-linear code
with rank r is given. Equivalently, for each possible dimension of the kernel
k, the construction of a Z2Z4-linear code with dimension of the kernel k is
given. Finally, the bounds on the rank, once the kernel dimension is fixed, are
established and the construction of a Z2Z4-additive code for each possible pair
(r,k) is given.
