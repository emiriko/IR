This article presents the design of the autonomous humanoid robot called NAO
that is built by the French company Aldebaran-Robotics. With its height of 0.57
m and its weight about 4.5 kg, this innovative robot is lightweight and
compact. It distinguishes itself from its existing Japanese, American, and
other counterparts thanks to its pelvis kinematics design, its proprietary
actuation system based on brush DC motors, its electronic, computer and
distributed software architectures. This robot has been designed to be
affordable without sacrificing quality and performance. It is an open and
easy-to-handle platform where the user can change all the embedded system
software or just add some applications to make the robot adopt specific
behaviours. The robot's head and forearms are modular and can be changed to
promote further evolution. The comprehensive and functional design is one of
the reasons that helped select NAO to replace the AIBO quadrupeds in the 2008
RoboCup standard league.
