Solving the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation numerically, we
investigate the effect of the potential landscape on the attempt frequency of
magnetization in nanomagnets with the thin-film geometry. Numerical estimates
of the attempt frequency are analyzed in comparison with theoretical
predictions from the Fokker-Planck equation for the Neel-Brown model. It is
found that for a nanomagnet with the thin-film geometry, theoretically
predicted values for the universal case are in excellent agreement with
numerical estimates.
