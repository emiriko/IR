We report a search for the decays B- -> K+ pi- pi- and B- -> K- K- pi+, which
are highly suppressed in the Standard Model. Using a sample of (467 +/- 5) x
10^6 BBbar pairs collected with the BaBar detector, we do not see any evidence
of these decays and determine 90% confidence level upper limits of BF(B- -> K+
pi- pi-) < 9.5 x 10^-7 and BF(B- -> K- K- pi+) < 1.6 x 10^-7 on the
corresponding branching fractions, including systematic uncertainties.
