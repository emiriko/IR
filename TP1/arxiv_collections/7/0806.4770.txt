A Monte Carlo generator of the final state of hadrons emitted from an
ultrarelativistic nuclear collision is introduced. An important feature of the
generator is a possible fragmentation of the fireball and emission of the
hadrons from fragments. Phase space distribution of the fragments is based on
the blast wave model extended to azimuthally non-symmetric fireballs.
Parameters of the model can be tuned and this allows to generate final states
from various kinds of fireballs. A facultative output in the OSCAR1999A format
allows for a comprehensive analysis of phase-space distributions and/or use as
an input for an afterburner.
