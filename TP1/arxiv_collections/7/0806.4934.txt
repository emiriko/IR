We study the ground state quantum spin fluctuations around the N\'eel ordered
state for the one-band ($t,U$) Hubbard model on a site-diluted square lattice.
An effective spin Hamiltonian, $H_{\rm s}^{(4)}$, is generated using the
canonical transformation method, expanding to order $t(t/U)^3$. $H_{\rm
s}^{(4)}$ contains four-spin ring exchange terms as well as second and third
neighbor bilinear spin-spin interactions. Transverse spin fluctuations are
calculated to order $1/S$ using a numerical real space algorithm first
introduced by Walker and Walsteadt. Additional quantum charge fluctuations
appear to this order in $t/U$, coming from electronic hopping and virtual
excitations to doubly occupied sites. The ground state staggered magnetization
on the percolating cluster decreases with site dilution $x$, vanishing very
close to the percolation threshold. We compare our results in the Heisenberg
limit, $t/U \to 0$, with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) results on the same model
and confirm the existence of a systematic $x$-dependent difference between
$1/S$ and QMC results away from $x=0$. For finite $t/U$, we show that the
effects of both the ring exchange and charge fluctuations die away rapidly with
increasing $t/U$. We use our finite $t/U$ results to make a comparison with
results from experiments on La$_2$Cu$_{1-x}$(Mg/Zn)$_x$O$_4$.
