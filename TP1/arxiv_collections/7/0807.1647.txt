Thin film growth of ferroelectric or multiferroic materials on SrTiO3(111)
with a buffer electrode has been hampered by the difficulty of growing flat
electrodes on this polar orientation. We report on the growth and
characterization of SrRuO3 thin films deposited by pulsed laser deposition on
SrTiO3(111). We show that our SrRuO3(111) films are epitaxial and display
magnetic bulk-like properties. Films presenting a thickness between 20 and 30nm
are found to be very flat (with an RMS of about 0.5 nm) and therefore suitable
as bottom electrodes in heterostructures.
