We consider the semiclassical quantization of sine-Gordon solitons on the
circle with periodic and anti-periodic boundary conditions. The 1-loop quantum
corrections to the mass of the solitons are determined using zeta function
regularization in the integral representation. We compare the semiclassical
results with exact numerical calculations in the literature and find excellent
agreement even outside the plain semiclassical regime.
