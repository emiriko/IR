We successfully synthesized the nickel-based compound GdONiBi with
superconducting transition temperature about 4.5 K. By partially substituting
the element Gd with Sr to introduce holes into the material, we got new
superconductor Gd0.9Sr0.1ONiBi with critical temperature about 4.7 K. The
normal state resistivity in nickel-based samples shows a metallic behavior. The
magnetoresistance measurements show a different behavior compared to those in
iron-based compounds which indicates that the mechanism in the two kinds of
superconductors maybe different.
