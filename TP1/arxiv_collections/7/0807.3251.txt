The elastic properties of rutile transition metal dioxides XO$_{2}$ (X=Ru,
Rh, Os, and Ir) are investigated using first-principles calculations based on
density functional theory. Elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus, and
Young's modulus as well as Possion ratio are given. OsO$_2$ and IrO$_2$ show
strong incompressibility. The hardness estimated for these dioxides shows that
they are not superhard solids. The obtained Debye temperatures are comparative
to those of transition metal dinitrides or diborides.
