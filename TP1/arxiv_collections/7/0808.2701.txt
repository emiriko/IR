Given a composite quantum system in which the states of the subsystems are
independently (but not necessarily identically) prepared, we construct separate
measurements on the subsystems from any given joint measurement such that the
former always give at least as large information as the latter. This
construction offers new insights into the understanding of measurements on this
type of composite systems. Moreover, this construction essentially proves the
intuition that separate measurements on the subsystems are sufficient to
extract the maximal information about the separately prepared subsystems, thus
making a joint measurement unnecessary. Furthermore, our result implies that
individual attacks are as powerful as collective attacks in obtaining
information on the raw key in quantum key distribution.
