We investigate the motion of a spinning test particle in a spatially-flat
FRW-type space-time in the framework of the Einstein-Cartan theory. The
space-time has a torsion arising from a spinning fluid filling the space-time.
We show that for spinning particles with nonzero transverse spin components,
the torsion induces a precession of particle spin around the direction of the
fluid spin. We also show that a charged spinning particle moving in a
torsion-less spatially-flat FRW space-time in the presence of a uniform
magnetic field undergoes a precession of a different character.
