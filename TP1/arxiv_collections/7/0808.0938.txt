In this paper we provide the analytical derivation of the global geometric
entanglement per block for the valence bond solid ground state of the spin-1
AKLT chain. In particular, we show that this quantity saturates exponentially
fast to a constant when the sizes of the blocks are sufficiently large. Our
result provides the first known example of an analytical calculation of the
geometric entanglement for a gapped quantum many-body system in one dimension
and far away from a quantum critical point.
