We study the dynamics of strongly correlated one-dimensional Bose gases in a
combined harmonic and optical lattice potential subjected to sudden
displacement of the confining potential. Using the time-evolving block
decimation method, we perform a first-principles quantum many-body simulation
of the experiment of Fertig {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 94}, 120403
(2005)] across different values of the lattice depth ranging from the
superfluid to the Mott insulator regimes. We find good quantitative agreement
with this experiment: the damping of the dipole oscillations is significant
even for shallow lattices, and the motion becomes overdamped with increasing
lattice depth as observed. We show that the transition to overdamping is
attributed to the decay of superfluid flow accelerated by quantum fluctuations,
which occurs well before the emergence of Mott insulator domains.
