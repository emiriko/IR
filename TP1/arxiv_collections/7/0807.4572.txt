The experimental consequences of different order parameters in iron-based
superconductors are theoretically analyzed. We consider both nodeless and nodal
order parameters, with an emphasis on the $\cos(k_x)\cdot \cos(k_y)$ nodeless
order parameter recently derived by two of us. We analyze the effect of this
order parameter on the spectral function, density of states, tunneling
differential conductance, penetration depth, and the NMR spin relaxation time.
This extended s-wave symmetry has line-zeroes in between the electron and hole
pockets, but they do not intersect the two Fermi surfaces for moderate doping,
and the superconductor is fully gapped. However, this suggests several
quantitative tests: the exponential decay of the penetration depth weakens and
the density of states reveals a smaller gap upon electron or hole doping.
Moreover, the $\cos(k_x) \cdot \cos(k_y)$ superconducting gap is largest on the
smallest (hole) Fermi surface. For the $1/T_1$ NMR spin relaxation rate, the
inter-band contribution is consistent with the current experimental results,
including a (non-universal) $T^{3}$ behavior and the absence of a coherence
peak. However, the intra-band contribution is considerably larger than the
inter-band contributions and still exhibits a small enhancement in the NMR spin
relaxation rate right below $T_c$ in the clean limit.
