We have developed a graphical user interface (GUI) running in Matlab, called
Weighted-Interaction Nestedness Estimator, WINE (Fig. 1). WINE is a Matlab
application developed to perform the calculation of the new weighted nestedness
estimator. This program allows the user to: open a data file, select the range
of data to be analysed, and calculate the results, obtaining two graphics and
three indices. The indices shown in the graphical interface are: a) weighted
nestedness of the frequency matrix, b) average weighted nestedness of 100
random matrices of similar characteristics, and c) the new weighted-
interaction nestedness estimator, which compares the two previous results.
