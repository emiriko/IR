Technology-Enhanced Formative Assessment (TEFA) is a pedagogy for teaching
with classroom response technology. Teacher Learning of TEFA is a five-year
research project studying teacher change, in the context of an intensive
professional development program designed to help science and mathematics
teachers learn TEFA. First, we provide an overview of the project's
participating teachers, its intervention (consisting of the technology, the
pedagogy, and the professional development program), and its research design.
Then, we present narratives describing the unfolding change process experienced
by four teachers. Afterward, we present some preliminary findings of the
research, describe a "model for the co-evolution of teacher and pedagogy" that
we are developing, and identify general implications for professional
development.
