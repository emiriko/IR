We study sequential scattering in superradiance from a Bose-Einstein
condensate pumped by a two-frequency laser beam. We find that the distribution
of atomic side modes presents highly different patterns for various frequency
difference between the two pump components. A novel distribution is observed,
with a frequency difference of eight times the recoil frequency. These
observations reveal that the frequency overlap between the end-fire modes
related to different side modes plays an essential role in the dynamics of
sequential superradiant scattering. The numerical results from a semiclassical
model qualitatively agree with our observations.
