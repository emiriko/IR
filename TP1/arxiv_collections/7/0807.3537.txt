We begin with the time-dependent electric and magnetic dipole solution of
Maxwell's equations in Minkowski space. This Maxwell field is then used to
determine the behavior of the gravitational field (the Weyl tensor) as a
second-order perturbation off of the Minkowski background. From the Weyl tensor
we go on and find the spin-coefficients and the full metric in this
approximation. The physical meaning of many of the relations is discussed. In
particular we can identify the conservation law of angular momentum that
contains an angular momentum flux term.
