We present an \emph{ab-initio} study of the graphene quasi-particle band
structure as function of the doping in G_0 W_0 approximation. We show that the
LDA Fermi velocity is substantially renormalized and this renormalization
rapidly decreases as function of the doping. We found, in agreement with
previous papers, that close to the Dirac point the linear dispersion of the
bands is broken but this behaviour disappears with a small doping. We discuss
our results in the light of recent experiments on graphene and intercalate
graphite.
