A major unsolved problem (according to Demailly 1997) towards the Kobayashi
hyperbolicity conjecture in optimal degree is to understand jet differentials
of germs of holomorphic discs that are invariant under any reparametrization of
the source. The underlying group action is not reductive, but we provide a
complete algorithm to generate all invariants, in arbitrary dimension n and for
jets of arbitrary order k.
  Two main new situations are studied in great details. For jets of order 4 in
dimension 4, we establish that the algebra of Demailly-Semple invariants is
generated by 2835 polynomials, while the algebra of bi-invariants is generated
by 16 mutually independent polynomials sharing 41 groebnerized syzygies.
Nonconstant entire holomorphic curves valued in an algebraic 3-fold (resp.
4-fold) X^3 in P^4 (C) (resp. X^4 in P^5(C)) of degree d satisfy global
differential equations as soon as d > 71 (resp. d > 258). A useful asymptotic
formula for the Euler-Poincare characteristic of Schur bundles in terms of
Giambelli's determinants is derived.
  For jets of order 5 in dimension 2, we establish that the algebra of
Demailly-Semple invariants is generated by 56 polynomials, while the algebra of
bi-invariants is generated by 17 mutually independent polynomials sharing 105
groebnerized syzygies.
