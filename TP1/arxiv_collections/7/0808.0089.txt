Quantum fluctuations in the mazer are considered, arising either from the
atomic motion or from the quantized intracavity field. Analytical results, for
both the meza and the hyperbolic secant mode profile, predict for example an
attenuation of tunneling resonances due to such fluctuations. The case of a
Gaussian mode profile is studied numerically using a wave packet propagation
approach. The method automatically takes into account fluctuations in the
atomic motion and the dynamics is especially considered at or adjacent to a
tunnel resonance. We find that the system evolution is greatly sensitive to the
atom-field detuning, bringing about a discussion about the concept of
adiabaticity in this model. Further, a novel collapse-revival phenomena is
demonstrated, originating from the quantum fluctuations in the atomic motion
rather from field fluctuations as is normally the case.
