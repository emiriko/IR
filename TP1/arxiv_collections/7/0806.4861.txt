In quantum information theory it is generally accepted that quantum mutual
information is an information-theoretic measure of total correlations of a
bipartite quantum state. We argue that there exist quantum states for which
quantum mutual information cannot be considered as a measure of total
correlations. Moreover, for these states we propose a different way of
quantifying total correlations.
