We demonstrate that the lightest chargino can be lighter than the lightest
neutralino in supersymmetric models with Dirac gaugino masses as well as within
a curious parameter region of the MSSM. Given also a light gravitino, such as
from low scale supersymmetry breaking, this mass hierarchy leads to an unusual
signal where every superpartner cascades down to a chargino that decays into an
on-shell W and a gravitino, possibly with a macroscopic chargino track. We
clearly identify the region of parameters where this signal can occur. We find
it is generic in the context of the R-symmetric supersymmetric standard model,
whereas it essentially only occurs in the MSSM when sign(M1) is not equal to
sign(M2) = sign(\mu) and tan(beta) is small. We briefly comment on the search
strategies for this signal at the LHC.
