We discuss a novel strategy for computing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
of the relativistic Dirac operator with a radially symmetric potential. The
virtues of this strategy lie on the fact that it avoids completely the
phenomenon of spectral pollution and it always provides two-side estimates for
the eigenvalues with explicit error bounds on both eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions. We also discuss convergence rates of the method as well as
illustrate our results with various numerical experiments.
