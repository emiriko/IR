The recently developed algorithm FIRE performs the reduction of Feynman
integrals to master integrals. It is based on a number of strategies, such as
applying the Laporta algorithm, the s-bases algorithm, region-bases and
integrating explicitly over loop momenta when possible. Currently it is being
used in complicated three-loop calculations.
