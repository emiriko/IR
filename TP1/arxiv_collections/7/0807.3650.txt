This paper explores the representation of quantum computing in terms of
unitary reflections (unitary transformations that leave invariant a hyperplane
of a vector space). The symmetries of qubit systems are found to be supported
by Euclidean real reflections (i.e., Coxeter groups) or by specific imprimitive
reflection groups, introduced (but not named) in a recent paper [Planat M and
Jorrand Ph 2008, {\it J Phys A: Math Theor} {\bf 41}, 182001]. The
automorphisms of multiple qubit systems are found to relate to some Clifford
operations once the corresponding group of reflections is identified. For a
short list, one may point out the Coxeter systems of type $B_3$ and $G_2$ (for
single qubits), $D_5$ and $A_4$ (for two qubits), $E_7$ and $E_6$ (for three
qubits), the complex reflection groups $G(2^l,2,5)$ and groups No 9 and 31 in
the Shephard-Todd list. The relevant fault tolerant subsets of the Clifford
groups (the Bell groups) are generated by the Hadamard gate, the $\pi/4$ phase
gate and an entangling (braid) gate [Kauffman L H and Lomonaco S J 2004 {\it
New J. of Phys.} {\bf 6}, 134]. Links to the topological view of quantum
computing, the lattice approach and the geometry of smooth cubic surfaces are
discussed.
