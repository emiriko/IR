We propose a setup that transforms a photon pair in arbitrary rank-four mixed
state, which could also be unknown, to a Bell state. The setup involves two
linear optical circuits processing the individual photons and a parity gate
working with weak cross-Kerr nonlinearity. By the photon number resolving
detection on one of the output quantum bus or communication beams, the setup
will realize a near deterministic transformation to a Bell state for every
entangling attempt. With the simple threshold detectors, on the other hand, the
system can still reach a considerable success probability of 0.5 per try. The
decoherence effect caused by photon absorption losses in the operation is also
discussed.
