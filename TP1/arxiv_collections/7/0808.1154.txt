Raman scattering, IR reflectance and modulated DSC measurements are performed
on specifically prepared dry (AgI)x(AgPO3)1-x glasses over a wide range of
compositions 0 < x < 0.60. A reversibility window is observed in the 0.095< x <
0.378 range, which fixes the elastically rigid but unstressed regime also known
as the Intermediate Phase. Glass compositions at x < 0.095 are stressed-rigid,
while those at x > 0.378 elastically flexible. Raman optical elasticity
power-laws, trends in the nature of the glass transition endotherms corroborate
the three elastic phase assignments. Ionic conductivities reveal a step-like
increase when glasses become stress-free at x > xc(1) = 0.095, and a
logarithmic increase in conductivity (sigma ~ (x-xc(2)t) once they become
flexible at x > xc(2) = 0.378 with a power-law t = 1.78. The power-law is
consistent with percolation of 3D filamentary conduction pathways. Traces of
water doping lower Tg and narrow the reversibility window, and can also
completely collapse it. Ideas on network flexibility promoting ion-conduction
are in harmony with the unified approach of Ingram et al., who have emphasized
the similarity of process compliance or elasticity relating to ion-transport
and structural relaxation in decoupled systems. Boson mode frequency and
scattering strength display thresholds that coincide with the two elastic phase
boundaries. In particular, the scattering strength of the boson mode increases
almost linearly with glass composition x, with a slope that tracks the floppy
mode fraction as a function of mean coordination number r predicted by
mean-field rigidity theory. These data suggest that the excess low frequency
vibrations contributing to boson mode in flexible glasses come largely from
floppy modes.
