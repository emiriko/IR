We address the influence of the orbital symmetry and of the molecular
alignment with respect to the laser-field polarization on laser-induced
nonsequential double ionization of diatomic molecules, in the length and
velocity gauges. We work within the strong-field approximation and assume that
the second electron is dislodged by electron-impact ionization, and also
consider the classical limit of this model. We show that the electron-momentum
distributions exhibit interference maxima and minima due to the electron
emission at spatially separated centers. The interference patterns survive the
integration over the transverse momenta for a small range of alignment angles,
and are sharpest for parallel-aligned molecules. Due to the contributions of
transverse-momentum components, these patterns become less defined as the
alignment angle increases, until they disappear for perpendicular alignment.
This behavior influences the shapes and the peaks of the electron momentum
distributions.
