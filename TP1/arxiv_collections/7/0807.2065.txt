Open string field theory in the level truncation approximation is considered.
It is shown that the energy conservation law determines existence of rolling
tachyon solution. The coupling of the open string field theory action to a
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric is considered which leads to a new time
dependent rolling tachyon solution is presented and possible cosmological
consequences are discussed.
