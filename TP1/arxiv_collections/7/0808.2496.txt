The geometrical application of split octonions is considered. The modified
Fano graphic, which represents products of the basis units of split octonionic,
having David's Star shape, is presented. It is shown that active and passive
transformations of coordinates in octonionic '8-space' are not equivalent. The
group of passive transformations that leave invariant the norm of split
octonions is SO(4,4), while active rotations is done by the direct product of
O(3,4)-boosts and real non-compact form of the exceptional group $G_2$. In
classical limit these transformations reduce to the standard Lorentz group.
