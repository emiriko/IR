The confinement mechanism proposed earlier by the author is applied to
estimate the possible parameters of the confining SU(3)-gluonic field in an
$\eta^\prime$-meson. For this aim the electric form factor of an
$\eta^\prime$-meson is nonperturbatively computed in an explicit analytic form.
The estimates obtained are also consistent with the width of the
electromagnetic decay $\eta^\prime\to2\gamma$. The corresponding estimates of
the gluon concentrations, electric and magnetic colour field strengths are also
adduced for the mentioned field at the scales of the meson under consideration.
