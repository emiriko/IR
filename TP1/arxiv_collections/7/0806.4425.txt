Wegner's method of flow equations offers a useful tool for diagonalizing a
given Hamiltonian and is widely used in various branches of quantum physics.
Here, generalizing this method, a condition is derived, under which the
corresponding flow of a quantum state becomes geodesic in a submanifold of the
projective Hilbert space, independently of specific initial conditions. This
implies the geometric optimality of the present method as an algorithm of
generating stationary states. The result is illustrated by analyzing some
physical examples.
