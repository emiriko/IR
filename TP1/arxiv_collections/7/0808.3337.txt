Brane model of universe is considered for a particle. Conservation laws
inside the brane are obtained. Equation of motion is derived for a particle
using variation principle from these conservation laws. This equation includes
terms accounting the variation of brane topology. Its solution is obtained at
some approximations and dispersion relation for a particle is derived.
