We introduce the notion of quantum duplicates of an (associative, unital)
algebra, motivated by the problem of constructing toy-models for quantizations
of certain configuration spaces in quantum mechanics. The proposed (algebraic)
model relies on the classification of factorization structures with a
two-dimensional factor. In the present paper, main properties of this
particular kind of structures are determined, and we present a complete
description of quantum duplicates of finite set algebras. As an application, we
obtain a classification (up to isomorphism) of all the algebras of dimension 4
(over an arbitrary field) that can be factorized as a product of two factors.
