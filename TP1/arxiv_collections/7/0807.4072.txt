Let n points be chosen randomly and independently in the unit disk.
"Sylvester's question" concerns the probability p_n that they are the vertices
of a convex n-sided polygon. Here we establish the link with another problem.
We show that for large n this polygon, when suitably parametrized by a function
r(phi) of the polar angle phi, satisfies the equation of the random
acceleration process (RAP), d^2 r/d phi^2 = f(phi), where f is Gaussian noise.
On the basis of this relation we derive the asymptotic expansion log p_n = -2n
log n + n log(2 pi^2 e^2) - c_0 n^{1/5} + ..., of which the first two terms
agree with a rigorous result due to Barany. The nonanalyticity in n of the
third term is a new result. The value 1/5 of the exponent follows from recent
work on the RAP due to Gyorgyi et al. [Phys. Rev. E 75, 021123 (2007)]. We show
that the n-sided polygon is effectively contained in an annulus of width \sim
n^{-4/5} along the edge of the disk. The distance delta_n of closest approach
to the edge is exponentially distributed with average 1/(2n).
