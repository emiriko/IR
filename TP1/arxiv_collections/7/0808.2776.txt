We review some of the most striking properties of the phase diagrams of
higher dimensional black holes in pure gravity. We focus on static black hole
solutions with Kaluza-Klein asymptotics and stationary black hole solutions in
flat Minkowski space. Both cases exhibit a rich pattern of interconnected
phases and merger points with topology changing transitions. In the first case,
the phase diagram includes uniform and non-uniform black strings, localized
black holes and sequences of Kaluza-Klein bubbles. In the latter case, it
includes Myers-Perry black holes, black rings, black saturns and pinched black
holes.
