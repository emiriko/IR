We consider a heavy meson moving slowly through high temperature non-abelian
plasmas. Using a simple dipole effective Lagrangian, we calculate the in-medium
mass shift and the drag coefficient of the meson in $\N=4$ Super Yang Mills
theory at weak and strong coupling. As anticipated, in the large $N$ limit the
mass shift is finite while the drag is suppressed by $1/N^2$ . After comparing
results to perturbative QCD estimates (which are also calculated), we reach the
conclusion that relative to weak coupling expectations the effect of strong
coupling is to reduce the momentum diffusion rate and to {\it increase} the
relaxation time by up to a factor of four.
