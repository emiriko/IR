We investigate the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) signals at the LHC in the
context of supercritical string cosmology (SSC). In this theory, the presence
of a time dependent dilaton provides us with a smoothly evolving dark energy
and modifies the dark matter allowed region of the mSUGRA model with standard
cosmology. Such a dilaton dilutes the supersymmetric dark matter density (of
neutralinos) by a factor O(10) and consequently the regions with too much dark
matter in the standard scenario are allowed in the SSC. The final states
expected at the LHC in this scenario, unlike the standard scenario, consist of
Z bosons, Higgs bosons, and/or high energy taus. We show how to characterize
these final states and determine the model parameters. Using these parameters,
we determine the dark matter content and the neutralino-proton cross section.
All these techniques can also be applied to determine model parameters in SSC
models with different SUSY breaking scenarios.
