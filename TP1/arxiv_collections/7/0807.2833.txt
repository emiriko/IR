The Sm$_{0.95}$La$_{0.05}$FeAsO$_{0.85}$F$_{0.15}$ compound is a quasi-2D
layered superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature T$_c$ = 52
K. Due to the Fe spin-orbital related anisotropic exchange coupling
(antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic fluctuation), the tetragonal
microcrystalline powder can be aligned at room temperature using the
field-rotation method where the tetragonal $\it{ab}$-plane is parallel to the
aligned magnetic field B$_{a}$ and $\it{c}$-axis along the rotation axis.
Anisotropic superconducting properties with anisotropic diamagnetic ratio
$\chi_{c}/\chi_{ab}\sim$ 2.4 + 0.6 was observed from low field susceptibility
$\chi$(T) and magnetization M(B$_{a}$). The anisotropic low-field phase diagram
with the variation of lower critical field gives a zero-temperature penetration
depth $\lambda_{c}$(0) = 280 nm and $\lambda_{ab}$(0) = 120 nm. The magnetic
fluctuation used for powder alignment at 300 K may be related with the pairing
mechanism of superconductivity at lower temperature.
