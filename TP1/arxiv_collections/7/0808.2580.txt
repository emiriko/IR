The low-energy magnetic excitations of the noncentrosymmetric heavy-fermion
superconductor CePt3Si have been measured with inelastic neutron scattering on
a single crystal. Kondo-type spin fluctuations with an anisotropic wave vector
dependence are observed in the paramagnetic state. These fluctuations do not
survive in the antiferromagnetically ordered state below TN=2.2 K but are
replaced by damped spin waves, whose dispersion is much stronger along the
c-axis than in other directions. No change is observed in the excitation
spectrum or the magnetic order as the system enters the superconducting state
below Tc=0.7 K.
