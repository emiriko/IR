The extraction of the parameters of the supersymmetric Lagrangian is discusse
d. Particular emphasis is put on the rigorous treatment of experimental and
theo retical errors. While the LHC can provide a valuable first estimate of the
parameters, the combination of LHC and ILC will be nece ssary to determine with
high precision the parameters of the MSSM.
