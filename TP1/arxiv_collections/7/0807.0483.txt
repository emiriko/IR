W. D. Hamilton's celebrated formula for the age-specific force of natural
selection furnishes predictions for senescent mortality due to mutation
accumulation, at the price of reliance on a linear approximation. Applying to
Hamilton's setting the full non-linear demographic model for mutation
accumulation of Evans et al. (2007), we find surprising differences. Non-linear
interactions cause the collapse of Hamilton-style predictions in the most
commonly studied case, refine predictions in other cases, and allow Walls of
Death at ages before the end of reproduction. Haldane's Principle for genetic
load has an exact but unfamiliar generalization.
