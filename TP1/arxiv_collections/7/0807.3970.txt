Magnetic-field-induced changes of the Fermi surface play a central role in
theories of the exotic quantum criticality of YbRh2Si2. We have carried out de
Haas-van Alphen measurements in the magnetic-field range 8 T <= H <= 16 T, and
directly observe field dependence of the extremal Fermi surface areas. Our data
support the theory that a low-field "large" Fermi surface, including the Yb 4f
quasihole, is increasingly spin split until a majority-spin branch undergoes a
Lifshitz transition and disappears at H0 ~ 10 T, without requiring 4f
localization at H0.
