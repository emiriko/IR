We show that it is possible to describe the ground state of the Luttinger
model in terms of a Jastrow-Slater wave function. Moreover, our findings reveal
that one-particle excitations and their corresponding dynamics can be
faithfully represented only when a Jastrow factor of a similar form is applied
to a coherent superposition of many Slater determinants. We discuss the
possible relevance of this approach for the theoretical description of
photoemission spectra in higher dimensionality, where the present wave function
can be straightforwardly generalized and can be used as a variational ansatz,
that is exact for the 1D Luttinger model.
