I investigate the theoretical uncertainties on the predictions for the
longitudinal structure function. I compare the predictions using fixed-order
perturbative QCD, higher twist corrections, small-x resummations and the dipole
picture. I compare the various predictions to the recent HERA measurements and
examine how the data still to be analysed may discriminate between the
approaches.
