We present a quantum repeater protocol that generates the elementary segments
of entangled photons through the communication of qubus in coherent states. The
input photons at the repeater stations can be in arbitrary states to save the
local state preparation time for the operations. The flexibility of the scheme
accelerates the generation of the elementary segments (close to the exact Bell
states) to a high rate for practical quantum communications. The entanglement
connection to long distances is simplified and sped up, possibly realizing an
entangled pair of high quality within the time in the order of that for
classical communication between two far-away locations.
