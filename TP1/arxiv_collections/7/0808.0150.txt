The effect of particle-hole fluctuations for the BCS-BEC crossover is
investigated by use of functional renormalization. We compute the critical
temperature for the whole range in the scattering length $a$. On the BCS side
for small negative $a$ we recover the Gorkov approximation, while on the BEC
side of small positive $a$ the particle-hole fluctuations play no important
role, and we find a system of interacting bosons. In the unitarity limit of
infinite scattering length our quantitative estimate yields $T_c/T_F=0.264$. We
also investigate the crossover from broad to narrow Feshbach resonances -- for
the later we obtain $T_c/T_F=0.204$ for $a^{-1}=0$. A key ingredient for our
treatment is the computation of the momentum dependent four-fermion vertex and
its bosonization in terms of an effective bound-state exchange.
