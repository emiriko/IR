We consider three broad classes of quantum secret sharing with and without
eavesdropping and show how a graph state formalism unifies otherwise disparate
quantum secret sharing models. In addition to the elegant unification provided
by graph states, our approach provides a generalization of threshold classical
secret sharing via insecure quantum channels beyond the current requirement of
100% collaboration by players to just a simple majority in the case of five
players. Another innovation here is the introduction of embedded protocols
within a larger graph state that serves as a one-way quantum information
processing system.
