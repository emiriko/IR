We propose a semi-classical interpretation of the geometric scalar and vector
potentials that arise due to Berry's phase when an atom moves slowly in a light
field. Starting from the full quantum Hamiltonian, we turn to a classical
description of the atomic centre-of-mass motion while still treating the
internal degrees of freedom as quantum variables. We show that the scalar
potential can be identified as the kinetic energy of an atomic micro-motion
caused by quantum fluctuations of the radiative force, and that the
Lorentz-type force appears as a result of the motion-induced perturbation of
the internal atomic state. For a specific configuration involving two
counter-propagating Gaussian laser beams, we relate the geometric forces to the
radiation pressure and dipole forces known from quantum optics. The simple
physical pictures provided by the present analysis may help for the design and
the implementation of novel geometric forces.
