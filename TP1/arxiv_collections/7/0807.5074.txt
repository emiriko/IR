We obtain some rigorous results on limit theorems for quantum walks driven by
many coins introduced by Brun et al. in the long time limit. The results imply
that whether the behavior of a particle is quantum or classical depends on the
three factors: the initial qubit, the number of coins M, d= [t/M], where t is
time step. Our main theorem shows that we can see a transition from classical
behavior to quantum one for a class of three factors.
