We report results of 75As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on a
self-flux grown single crystal of BaFe2As2. A first-order antiferromagnetic
(AF) transition near 135 K was detected by the splitting of NMR lines, which is
accompanied by simultaneous structural transition as evidenced by a sudden
large change of the electric field gradient tensor at the As site. The NMR
results lead almost uniquely to the stripe spin structure in the AF phase. The
data of spin-lattice relaxation rate indicate development of anisotropic spin
fluctuations of the stripe-type with decreasing temperature in the paramagnetic
phase.
