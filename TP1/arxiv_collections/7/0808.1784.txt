Superconductivity with zero resistance transition temperature (Tc) up to 8.4
K and 8.3 K can be obtained by doping cobalt and sodium in alfa-FeSe with the
nominal composition of Fe0.92Co0.08Se and Na0.1FeSe, respectively. The
electrical resistivity and AC magnetic susceptibility of the prepared samples,
measured with physical property measurement system (PPMS), unambiguously
consistent with each other to indicate that the samples are superconductive.
The respective doping mechanisms for cobalt and sodium into the parent
alfa-FeSe are the Fe-site substitution and the interlayer insertion. It is the
first time that alfa-FeSe can be induced to be a superconductor with Na+
intercalated into the interlayers.
