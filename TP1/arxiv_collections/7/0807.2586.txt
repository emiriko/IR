By deriving analytical formulae for the quantization accuracy of the
acoustoelectric current, we reveal that: 1) the flatness of the current plateau
for the typical present devices has reached the theoretical limit of about
100ppm over a 1/1000 change of the gate voltage; 2) increasing the transport
channel length, and counterintuitively, increasing the acoustic wavelength as
well, would improve the quantization accuracy, and very promisingly up to
0.01ppm as required for a quantum current standard.
