Is every locally compact abelian group which admits a Heisenberg central
extension isomorphic to the product of a locally compact abelian group and its
Pontryagin dual? An affirmative answer is obtained for all the commonly
occurring types of abelian groups having Heisenberg central extensions,
including Lie groups and certain finite Cartesian products of local fields and
adeles. Furthermore, for these types of groups, it is found that the
isomorphism class of the abelian group determines the Heisenberg group up to
isomorphism, thereby providing a classification of such Heisenberg groups.
