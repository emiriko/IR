Exchange interaction strongly influences the long-range behaviour of
localised electron orbitals. It violates the oscillation theorem (creates extra
nodes) and produces a power-law decay instead of the usual exponential decrease
at large distances. For inner orbitals inside molecules decay is 1/r^2, for
macroscopic systems cos(k_f r)/r^n, where k_f is the Fermi momentum and n=3 for
1D, n=3.5 for 2D and n=4 for 3D crystal. Slow decay increases the exchange
interaction between localised spins and the under-barrier tunneling
amplitude.The under-barrier transmission coefficients in solids (e.g. for point
contacts) become temperature-dependent.
