We report that femtosecond surface plasmon polariton pulses can propagate
along a metal-dielectric waveguide and that they can be modulated on the
femtosecond timescale by direct ultrafast optical excitation of the metal,
thereby offering unprecedented terahertz plasmonic bandwidth - a key missing
component in the development of surface plasmons as information carriers for
next generation nanophotonic devices.
