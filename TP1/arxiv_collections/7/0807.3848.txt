Transport and mixing properties of surface currents can be detected from
altimetric data by both Eulerian and Lagrangian diagnostics. In contrast with
Eulerian diagnostics, Lagrangian tools like the local Lyapunov exponents have
the advantage of exploiting both spatial and temporal variability of the
velocity field and are in principle able to unveil subgrid filaments generated
by chaotic stirring. However, one may wonder whether this theoretical advantage
is of practical interest in real-data, mesoscale and submesoscale analysis,
because of the uncertainties and resolution of altimetric products, and the
non-passive nature of biogeochemical tracers. Here we compare the ability of
standard Eulerian diagnostics and the finite-size Lyapunov exponent in
detecting instantaneaous and climatological transport and mixing properties. By
comparing with sea-surface temperature patterns, we find that the two
diagnostics provide similar results for slowly evolving eddies like the first
Alboran gyre. However, the Lyapunov exponent is also able to predict the
(sub-)mesoscale filamentary process occuring along the Algerian current and
above the Balearic Abyssal Plain. Such filaments are also observed, with some
mismatch, in sea-surface temperature patterns. Climatologies of Lyapunov
exponents do not show any compact relation with other Eulerian diagnostics,
unveiling a different structure even at the basin scale. We conclude that
filamentation dynamics can be detected by reprocessing available altimetric
data with Lagrangian tools, giving insight into (sub-)mesoscale stirring
processes relevant to tracer observations and complementing traditional
Eulerian diagnostics.
