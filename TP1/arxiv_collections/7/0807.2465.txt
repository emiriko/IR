We construct an effective lagrangian for new strong interactions at the LHC,
including as a first step the two lightest triplets of spin-1 resonances. Our
parametrization is general enough to allow for previously unstudied spectrum
and couplings. Among available frameworks to describe the spin-1 sector, we
rely on an extra-dimensional description. Our approach limits the number of
parameters, yet is versatile enough to describe the phenomenology of a wide
range of new scenarios of strong electroweak symmetry breaking.
