The authors use two insulator layers in thermotunnel refrigerator to modify
the shape of the tunneling barrier so that electrons with high kinetic energy
pass it with increased probability. Theoretical analysis show that the overall
tunneling current between the electrodes contains an increased number of high
kinetic energy electrons and a reduced number of low energy ones, leading to
high efficiency. The particular case of vacuum gap and solid insulator layer is
calculated using digital methods. Efficiency remains high in the wide range of
the emitter electric field. The cooling coefficient is found to be as high as
40%-50% in the wide range of the emitter electric field.
