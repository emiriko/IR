In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, studying jet correlations and their
dependence on the angle of emission with respect to the reaction plane can be
used to shed light on the path length dependence of the energy lost by the jet.
In this paper, we present recent PHENIX results on jet correlations versus
reaction plane, as a function of centrality and transverse momentum.
