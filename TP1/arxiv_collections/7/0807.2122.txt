Quantum low density parity check (QLDPC) codes are useful primitives for
quantum information processing because they can be encoded and decoded
efficiently. Besides, the error correcting capability of a few QLDPC codes
exceeds the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound. Here, we report a numerical
performance analysis of an adaptive entanglement distillation scheme using
QLDPC codes. In particular, we find that the expected yield of our adaptive
distillation scheme to combat depolarization errors exceed that of Leung and
Shor whenever the error probability is less than about 0.07 or greater than
about 0.28. This finding illustrates the effectiveness of using QLDPC codes in
entanglement distillation.
