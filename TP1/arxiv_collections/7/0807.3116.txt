Using 23Na NMR measurements on sodium cobaltates at intermediate dopings
(0.44<=x<=0.62), we establish the qualitative change of behavior of the local
magnetic susceptibility at x*=0.63-0.65, from a low x Pauli-like regime to the
high x Curie-Weiss regime. For 0.5<=x<=0.62, the presence of a maximum T* in
the temperature dependence of the susceptibility shows the existence of an
x-dependent energy scale. T_1 relaxation measurements establish the
predominantly antiferromagnetic character of spin correlations for x<x*. This
contradicts the commonly assumed uncorrelated Pauli behavior in this x range
and is at odds with the observed ferromagnetic correlations for x>x*. It is
suggested that at a given x the ferromagnetic correlations might dominate the
antiferromagnetic ones above T*. From 59Co NMR data, it is shown that moving
towards higher x away from x=0.5 results in the progressive appearance of
nonmagnetic Co3+ sites, breaking the homogeneity of Co states encountered for
x<=0.5. The main features of the NMR-detected 59Co quadrupolar effects,
together with indications from the powder x-ray diffraction data, lead us to
sketch a possible structural origin for the Co3+ sites. In light of this
ensemble of new experimental observations, a new phase diagram is proposed,
taking into account the systematic presence of correlations and their
x-dependence.
