We examine four WTC 7 descent curves, labeled "C," "E," "N," and "O," either
anonymously published, or confidentially communicated to us. Descent curve
describes apparent height of a collapsing building as a function of time. The
set "C" suggests that there are three active phases of collapse. Phase I is a
free fall for the first $H_1\simeq28$m or $T_1\simeq2.3$s, during which the
acceleration $a$ is that of the gravity, $a=g=9.8$m/s$^2$. In Phase II, which
continues until drop $H_2\simeq68$m, or $T_2\simeq3.8$s, the acceleration is
$a\simeq5$m/s$^2$, while in Phase III which continues for the remaining of the
data set, $a \simeq -1$m/s$^2$. We propose that the collapse of WTC 7 is
initiated by a total and sudden annihilation of the base (section of the
building from the ground level to $H_1$), which then allows the top section
(building above $H_1$) to free fall during Phase I, and then collide with the
ground in Phase II and III. The total duration of the collapse, assuming that
Phase III continues to the end, is in the range $7.8-8.6$s. We derive a
physical model for collision of the building with the ground, in which we
correct the "crush-up" model of Ba\v{z}ant and Verdure, J. Engr. Mech. ASCE,
{\bf 133} (2006) 308, and estimate the magnitude of the resistive force in the
top section. We compare our findings to those of NIST investigators and find an
agreement with respect to the distribution of damage in the primary zone. We
conclude that the building was destroyed in a highly controlled fashion.
