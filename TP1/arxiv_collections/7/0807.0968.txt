We have measured the carrier spin dynamics in p-doped InAs/GaAs quantum dots
by pump-probe photo-induced circular dichroism and time-resolved
photoluminescence experiments. We show that the hole spin dephasing is
controlled by the hyperfine interaction between hole and nuclear spins. In the
absence of external magnetic field, we find a characteristic hole spin
dephasing time of 15 ns, in close agreement with our calculations based on
dipole-dipole coupling between the hole and the quantum dot nuclei. Finally we
demonstrate that a small external magnetic field, typically 10 mT instead of
200 mT for the case of electrons, quenches the hyperfine hole spin dephasing.
