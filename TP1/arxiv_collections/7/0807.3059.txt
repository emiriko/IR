Indirect competition emerged from the complex organization of human
societies, and knowledge of the existing network topology may aid in developing
effective strategies for success. Here, we propose an agent-based model of
competition with systems co-existing in a `small-world' social network. We show
that within the range of parameter values obtained from the model and empirical
data, the network evolution is highly dependent on $k$, the local parameter
describing the density of neighbors in the network. The model applied to
language death and competition of telecommunication companies show strong
correspondence with empirical data.
