In this paper, we study some quantum properties of a superposition of
displaced squeezed two-mode vacuum and single-photon states, such as the
second-order correlation function, the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, quadrature
squeezing, quasiprobability distribution functions and purity. This type of
states includes two mechanisms, namely, interference in phase space and
entanglement. We show that these states can exhibit sub-Piossonian statistics,
squeezing and deviate from the classical Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. Moreover,
the amount of entanglement in the system can be increased by increasing the
squeezing mechanism. In the framework of the quasiprobability distribution
functions we show that the single-mode state can tend to thermal state based on
the correlation mechanism. Generation scheme for such states is given.
