We report on light-shift tomography of a cloud of 87 Rb atoms in a
far-detuned optical-dipole trap at 1565 nm. Our method is based on standard
absorption imaging, but takes advantage of the strong light-shift of the
excited state of the imaging transition, which is due to a quasi-resonance of
the trapping laser with a higher excited level. We use this method to (i) map
the equipotentials of a crossed optical-dipole trap, and (ii) study the
thermalisation of an atomic cloud by following the evolution of the
potential-energy of atoms during the free-evaporation process.
