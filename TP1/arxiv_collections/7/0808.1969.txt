We report x-ray absorption and x-ray linear dichroism measurements at the Fe
L2,3 edges of the geometrically frustrated systems of potassium and hydronium
iron jarosite. Comparison with simulated spectra, involving ligand-field
multiplet calculations modelling the 3d-2p hybridization between the iron ion
and the oxygen ligands, has yielded accurate estimates for the ligand metal-ion
hybridization and the resulting single-ion crystal field anisotropy energy.
Using this method we provide an experimentally verified scenario for the
appearance of a single-ion anisotropy in this nominally high-spin 3d5 orbital
singlet 6S system, which accounts for features of the spin-wave dispersion in
the long-range ordered ground state of potassium iron jarosite.
