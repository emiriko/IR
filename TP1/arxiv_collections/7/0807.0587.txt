Using the numerical unrestricted Hartree-Fock approach, we study the ground
state of a two-orbital model describing newly discovered FeAs-based
superconductors. We observe the competition of a $(0, \pi)$ mode spin-density
wave and the superconductivity as the doping concentration changes. There might
be a small region in the electron-doping side where the magnetism and
superconductivity coexist. The superconducting pairing is found to be spin
singlet, orbital even, and mixed s$_{xy}$ + d$_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ wave (even
parity).
