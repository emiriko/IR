We investigate the addition of stiffness to the lattice model of
hydrogen-bonded polymers in two and three dimensions. We find that, in contrast
to polymers that interact via a homogeneous short-range interaction, the
collapse transition is unchanged by any amount of stiffness: this supports the
physical argument that hydrogen bonding already introduces an effective
stiffness. Contrary to possible physical arguments, favouring bends in the
polymer does not return the model's behaviour to that comparable to the
semi-flexible homogeneous interaction model, where the canonical $\theta$-point
occurs for a range of parameter values. In fact, for sufficiently large bending
energies the crystal phase disappears altogether, and no phase transition of
any type occurs. We also compare the order-disorder transition from the globule
phase to crystalline phase in the semi-flexible homogeneous interaction model
to that for the fully-flexible hybrid model with both hydrogen and non-hydrogen
like interactions. We show that these phase transitions are of the same type
and are a novel polymer critical phenomena in two dimensions. That is, it is
confirmed that in two dimensions this transition is second-order, unlike in
three dimensions where it is known to be first order. We also estimate the
crossover exponent and show that there is a divergent specific heat, finding
$\phi=0.7(1)$ or equivalently $\alpha=0.6(2)$. This is therefore different from
the $\theta$ transition, for which $\alpha=-1/3$.
