The logarithmic conformal field theory describing critical percolation is
further explored using Watts' determination of the probability that there
exists a cluster connecting both horizontal and vertical edges. The boundary
condition changing operator which governs Watts' computation is identified with
a primary field which does not fit naturally within the extended Kac table.
Instead a "shifted" extended Kac table is shown to be relevant. Augmenting the
previously known logarithmic theory based on Cardy's crossing probability by
this field, a larger theory is obtained, in which new classes of indecomposable
rank-2 modules are present. No rank-3 Jordan cells are yet observed. A highly
non-trivial check of the identification of Watts' field is that no
Gurarie-Ludwig-type inconsistencies are observed in this augmentation. The
article concludes with an extended discussion of various topics related to
extending these results including projectivity, boundary sectors and
inconsistency loopholes.
