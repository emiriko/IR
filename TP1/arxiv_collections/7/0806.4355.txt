We study the dynamics of domain walls in Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton theory.
Dilaton is non-trivially coupled with the Born-Infeld electromagnetic field. We
find three different types of solutions consistent with the dynamic domain
walls. For every case, the solutions have singularity. Further more, in these
backgrounds, we study the dynamics of domain walls. We qualitatively plot
various form of the bulk metrics and the potential encountered by the domain
walls. In many cases, depending upon the value of the parameters, the domain
walls show bouncing universe and also undergo inflationary phase followed by
standard decelerated expansion.
