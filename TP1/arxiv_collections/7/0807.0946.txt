InAs nanowires have been actively explored as the channel material for high
performance transistors owing to their high electron mobility and ease of ohmic
metal contact formation. The catalytic growth of non-epitaxial InAs nanowires,
however, has often relied on the use of Au colloids which is non-CMOS
compatible. Here, we demonstrate the successful synthesis of high yield of
crystalline InAs nanowires with high yield and tunable diameters by using Ni
nanoparticles as the catalyst material on amorphous SiO2 substrates. The
nanowires show superb electrical properties with field-effect electron mobility
~2,700 cm2/Vs and ION/IOFF >103. The uniformity and purity of the grown InAs
nanowires are further demonstrated by large-scale assembly of parallel arrays
of nanowires on substrates via the contact printing process that enables high
performance, printable transistors, capable of delivering 5-10 mA ON currents
(~400 nanowires).
