The DIS process on nuclei is considered in the framework of LO BK equation
with local impact parameter dependence. Solving BK equation parameters for
initial conditions of GBW type found in \cite{Serg1} were used. Integrated
gluon density function and $F_2$ nucleus structure function for different
nuclei are calculated. Obtained results are compared with the different
parameterizations of integrated gluon density function from
\cite{Flor,Eskola1,Eskola2,Tywon}. The anomalous dimensions and saturation
scales for different nuclei are calculated at different energies. Fitting
obtained results, expressions for the form of saturation scale are obtained for
the proton and different nuclei as functions of impact parameter and energy.
