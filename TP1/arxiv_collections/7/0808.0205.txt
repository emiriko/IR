We formulate an exact result, which we refer to as the pumping restriction
theorem (PRT). It imposes strong restrictions on the currents generated by
periodic driving in a generic dissipative system with detailed balance. Our
theorem unifies previously known results with the new ones and provides a
universal nonperturbative approach to explore further restrictions on the
stochastic pump effect in non-adiabatically driven systems.
