Channeling of recoil ions in various crystals strongly depends on their
direction. This, along with the WIMP wind due to the rotation of the galactic
disc generates {\it daily} modulations of the channeling. Since channeling
affect the characteristics of the WIMP induced recoil events these modulations
may be observed in single crystal detectors and serve as a WIMP signature. We
suggest in particular searching for such modulations in the DAMA scintillation
data.
