We construct infinite families of non-simply connected locally conformally
flat (LCF) 4-manifolds realizing rich topological types. These manifolds have
strictly negative scalar curvature and the underlying topological 4-manifolds
do not admit any Einstein metrics. Such 4-manifolds are of particular interest
as examples of Bach-flat but non-Einstein spaces in the non-simply connected
case. Besides that the underlying smooth manifolds are examples of spaces that
admit open book decomposition in dimension 4.
