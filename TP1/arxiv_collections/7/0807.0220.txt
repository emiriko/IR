We have demonstrated production of antihydrogen in a 1$,$T solenoidal
magnetic field. This field strength is significantly smaller than that used in
the first generation experiments ATHENA (3$,$T) and ATRAP (5$,$T). The
motivation for using a smaller magnetic field is to facilitate trapping of
antihydrogen atoms in a neutral atom trap surrounding the production region. We
report the results of measurements with the ALPHA (Antihydrogen Laser PHysics
Apparatus) device, which can capture and cool antiprotons at 3$,$T, and then
mix the antiprotons with positrons at 1$,$T. We infer antihydrogen production
from the time structure of antiproton annihilations during mixing, using mixing
with heated positrons as the null experiment, as demonstrated in ATHENA.
Implications for antihydrogen trapping are discussed.
