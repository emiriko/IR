Using Upsilon(2S) and Upsilon(3S) data collected with the CLEO III detector
we have searched for decays of chi_bJ to final states with open charm. We fully
reconstruct D0 mesons with p_D0 > 2.5 GeV/c in three decay modes (K-pi+,
K-pi+pi0, and K-pi-pi+pi+) in coincidence with radiative transition photons
that tag the production of one of the chi_bJ(nP) states. We obtain significant
signals for the two J=1 states. Recent NRQCD calculations of chi_{bJ}(nP) --> c
cbar X depend on one non-perturbative parameter per chi_bJ triplet. The
extrapolation from the observed D0 X rate over a limited momentum range to a
full c cbar X rate also depends on these same parameters. Using our data to fit
for these parameters, we extract results which agree well with NRQCD
predictions, confirming the expectation that charm production is largest for
the J=1 states. In particular, for J=1, our results are consistent with c cbar
g accounting for about one-quarter of all hadronic decays.
