Mass deformations of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in three spacetime
dimensions are considered. The gluons of the theories are made massive by the
inclusion of a non-local gauge and Poincare invariant mass term due to
Alexanian and Nair, while the matter fields are given standard Gaussian
mass-terms. It is shown that the dimensional reduction of such mass deformed
gauge theories defined on $R^3$ or $R\times T^2$ produces matrix quantum
mechanics with massive spectra. In particular, all known massive matrix quantum
mechanical models obtained by the deformations of dimensional reductions of
minimal super Yang-Mills theories in diverse dimensions are shown also to arise
from the dimensional reductions of appropriate massive Yang-Mills theories in
three spacetime dimensions. Explicit formulae for the gauge theory actions are
provided.
