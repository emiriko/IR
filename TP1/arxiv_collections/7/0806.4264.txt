For a packet erasure broadcast channel with three receivers, we propose a new
coding algorithm that makes use of feedback to dynamically adapt the code. Our
algorithm is throughput optimal, and we conjecture that it also achieves an
asymptotically optimal average decoding delay at the receivers. We consider
heavy traffic asymptotics, where the load factor \rho approaches 1 from below
with either the arrival rate (\lambda) or the channel parameter (\mu) being
fixed at a number less than 1. We verify through simulations that our algorithm
achieves an asymptotically optimal decoding delay of O(1/(1-\rho)).
