We present a new classification of Clifford algebra elements. Our
classification is based on the notion of quaternion type. Using this
classification we develop a method for analyzing of commutators and
anticommutators of Clifford algebra elements. This method allows us to find out
and prove a number of new properties of Clifford algebra elements.
