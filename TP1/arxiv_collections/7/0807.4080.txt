We test the quark mass dependence implemented in the quasiparticle dispersion
relations of our quasiparticle model for the QCD equation of state by comparing
with recently available lattice QCD data near $T_c$ employing almost physical
quark masses. In addition, we emphasize the capability of our model to
successfully describe lattice QCD results for imaginary chemical potential and
to analytically continue the latter to real chemical potential.
