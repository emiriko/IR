We define the concept of Tschirnhaus-Weierstrass curve, named after the
Weierstrass form of an elliptic curve and Tschirnhaus transformations. Every
pointed curve has a Tschirnhaus-Weierstrass form, and this representation is
unique up to a scaling of variables. This is useful for computing isomorphisms
between curves.
