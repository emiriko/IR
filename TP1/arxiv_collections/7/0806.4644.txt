We review theoretical explanation of mechanisms of control of uniformity in
growth of nanosize particles and colloids. The nanoparticles are synthesized as
nanocrystals, by burst nucleation from solution. The colloids are
self-assembled by aggregation of these nanocrystals. The two kinetic processes
are coupled, and both are driven by diffusional transport. The interrelation of
the two processes allows for formation of narrow-size-distribution colloid
dispersions which are of importance in many applications. We review a
mathematical model of cluster growth by capture of diffusing "singlets." Burst
nucleation of nanoparticles in solution is then analyzed. Finally, we couple it
to the secondary process of aggregation of nanoparticles to form colloids. We
address aspects of modeling of particle size distribution, as well as other
properties.
