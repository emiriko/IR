Ultracold sodium atoms have been trapped inside a hollow-core optical fiber.
The atoms are transferred from a free space optical dipole trap into a trap
formed by a red-detuned gaussian light mode confined to the core of the fiber.
We show that at least 5% of the atoms held initially in the free space trap can
be loaded into the core of the fiber and retrieved outside.
