Hawking radiation is obtained from anomalies resulting from a breaking of
diffeomorphism symmetry near the event horizon of a black hole. Such anomalies,
manifested as a nonconservation of the energy momentum tensor, occur in two
different forms -- covariant and consistent. The crucial role of covariant
anomalies near the horizon is revealed since this is the {\it only} input
required to obtain the Hawking flux, thereby highlighting the universality of
this effect. A brief description to apply this method to obtain thermodynamic
entities like entropy or temperature is provided.
