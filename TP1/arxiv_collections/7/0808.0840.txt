We review recent progress on the resolution of gravitational singularities in
string theory. The main example is the fundamental string in five dimensions
which is singular in the standard supergravity description but regular after
taking into account higher derivative corrections determined by anomalies and
supersymmetry. The application of the AdS/CFT correspondence to geometries that
require higher derivatives for regularity poses interesting challenges.
