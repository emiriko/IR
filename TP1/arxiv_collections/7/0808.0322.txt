We present a new method to test the Standard Model expectations at the LHC
using photon-induced $WW$ production. Both $W$ decay in the main ATLAS or CMS
detectors while scattered protons are measured in forward detectors. The
sensitivity to anomalous $WW\gamma$ triple gauge coupling can be improved by
more than a factor 5 or 30 compared to the present LEP or Tevatron sensitivity
respectively.
