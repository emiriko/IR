The structure of a single layer of graphene on Ru(0001) has been studied
using surface x-ray diffraction. A surprising superstructure has been
determined, whereby 25 x 25 graphene unit cells lie on 23 x 23 unit cells of
Ru. Each supercell contains 2 x 2 crystallographically inequivalent subcells
caused by corrugation. Strong intensity oscillations in the superstructure rods
demonstrate that the Ru substrate is also significantly corrugated down to
several monolayers, and that the bonding between graphene and Ru is strong and
cannot be caused by van der Waals bonds. Charge transfer from the Ru substrate
to the graphene expands and weakens the C-C bonds, which helps accommodate the
in-plane tensile stress. The elucidation of this superstructure provides
important information in the potential application of graphene as a template
for nanocluster arrays.
