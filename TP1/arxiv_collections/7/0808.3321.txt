Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we study a mixture of bosons and
fermions loaded on an optical lattice. With simple on-site repulsive
interactions, this system can be driven into a solid phase. We dope this phase
and, in analogy with pure bosonic systems, identify the conditions under which
the bosons enter a supersolid phase, i.e., exhibiting at the same time charge
density wave and superfluid order. We perform finite size scaling analysis to
confirm the presence of a supersolid phase and discuss its properties, showing
that it is a collective phase that also involve phase coherence of the
fermions.
