Although the isotope effect in superconducting materials is well-documented,
changes in the magnetic properties of antiferromagnets due to isotopic
substitution are seldom discussed and remain poorly understood. This is perhaps
surprising given the possible link between the quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D)
antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases of the layered cuprates. Here we
report the experimental observation of shifts in the N\'{e}el temperature and
critical magnetic fields ($\Delta T_{\rm N}/T_{\rm N}\approx 4%$; $\Delta
B_{\rm c}/B_{\rm c}\approx 4%$) in a Q2D organic molecular antiferromagnets on
substitution of hydrogen for deuterium. These compounds are characterized by
strong hydrogen bonds through which the dominant superexchange is mediated. We
evaluate how the in-plane and inter-plane exchange energies evolve as the
hydrogens on different ligands are substituted, and suggest a possible
mechanism for this effect in terms of the relative exchange efficiency of
hydrogen and deuterium bonds.
