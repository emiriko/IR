We compute the probability of finding metastable states at a given field in
the mean-field random field Ising model at T=0. Remarkably, this probability is
finite in the thermodynamic limit, even on the so-called ``unstable'' branch of
the magnetization curve. This implies that the branch is reachable when the
magnetization is controlled instead of the magnetic field, in contrast with the
situation in the pure system.
