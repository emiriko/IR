Optimal prediction approximates the average solution of a large system of
ordinary differential equations by a smaller system. We present how optimal
prediction can be applied to a typical problem in the field of molecular
dynamics, in order to reduce the number of particles to be tracked in the
computations. We consider a model problem, which describes a surface coating
process, and show how asymptotic methods can be employed to approximate the
high dimensional conditional expectations, which arise in optimal prediction.
The thus derived smaller system is compared to the original system in terms of
statistical quantities, such as diffusion constants. The comparison is carried
out by Monte-Carlo simulations, and it is shown under which conditions optimal
prediction yields a valid approximation to the original system.
