We develop a new notion of security against timing attacks where the attacker
is able to simultaneously observe the execution time of a program and the
probability of the values of low variables. We then show how to measure the
security of a program with respect to this notion via a computable estimate of
the timing leakage and use this estimate for cost optimisation.
