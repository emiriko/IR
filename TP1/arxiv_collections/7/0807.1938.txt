The change in entropy, /DeltaS, associated with the quasi-static absorption
of a particle of energy u by a Schwarzschild black hole (ScBH) is approximately
(u/T)-s, where T is the Hawking temperature of the black hole and s is the
entropy of the particle. Motivated by the statistical interpretation of
entropy, it is proposed here that absorption should be suppressed, but not
forbidden, when /DeltaS<0, which requires the absorption cross-section to be
sensitive to /DeltaS. A purely thermodynamic formulation of the probability for
absorption is obtained from the standard relationship between microstates and
entropy. If /DeltaS>>1 and s<<u/T then the probability for the particle not to
be absorbed is approximately exp[-u/T], which is identical to the probability
for quantum mechanical reflection by the horizon of a ScBH. The manifestation
of quantum behaviors in the new probability function may intimate a fundamental
physical unity between thermodynamics and quantum mechanics.
