The effect of the shape of six different periodic forces and second periodic
forces on the onset of horseshoe chaos are studied both analytically and
numerically in a Duffing oscillator. The external periodic forces considered
are sine wave, square wave, symmetric saw-tooth wave, asymmetric saw-tooth
wave, rectified sine wave, and modulus of sine wave. An analytical threshold
condition for the onset of horseshoe chaos is obtained in the Duffing
oscillator driven by various periodic forces using the Melnikov method.
Melnikov threshold curve is drawn in a parameter space. For all the forces
except modulus of sine wave, the onset of cross-well asymptotic chaos is
observed just above the Melnikov threshold curve for onset of horseshoe chaos.
For the modulus of sine wave long time transient motion followed by a periodic
attractor is realized. The possibility of controlling of horseshoe and
asymptotic chaos in the Duffing oscillator by an addition of second periodic
force is then analyzed. Parametric regimes where suppression of horseshoe chaos
occurs are predicted. Analytical prediction is demonstrated through direct
numerical simulations. Starting from asymptotic chaos we show the recovery of
periodic motion for a range of values of amplitude and phase of the second
periodic force. Interestingly, suppression of chaos is found in the parametric
regimes where the Melnikov function does not change sign.
