The dynamics of grain ejection consecutive to a sphere impacting a granular
material is investigated experimentally and the variations of the
characteristics of grain ejection with the control parameters are
quantitatively studied. The time evolution of the corona formed by the ejected
grains is reported, mainly in terms of its diameter and height, and favourably
compared with a simple ballistic model. A key characteristic of the granular
corona is that the angle formed by its edge with the horizontal granular
surface remains constant during the ejection process, which again can be
reproduced by the ballistic model. The number and the kinetic energy of the
ejected grains is evaluated and allows for the calculation of an effective
restitution coefficient characterizing the complex collision process between
the impacting sphere and the fine granular target. The effective restitution
coefficient is found to be constant when varying the control parameters.
