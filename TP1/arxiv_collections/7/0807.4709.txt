In this paper we will define a Lagrangian for scalar and gauge fields on
causal sets, based on the selection of an Alexandrov set in which the
variations of appropriate expressions in terms of either the scalar field or
the gauge field holonomies around suitable loops take on the least value. For
these fields, we will find that the values of the variations of these
expressions define Lagrangians in covariant form.
