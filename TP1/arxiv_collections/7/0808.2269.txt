The purpose of this note is to announce an extension of the descent method of
Ginzburg, Rallis and Soudry to the setting of essentially self dual
representations. This extension of the descent construction provides a
complement to recent work of Asgari and Shahidi on the generic transfer for
general Spin groups as well as to the work of Asgari and Raghuram on
cuspidality of the exterior square lift for representations of GL4. Complete
proofs of the results announced in the present note will appear in our
forthcoming articles.
