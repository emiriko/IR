Shape/phase transitions in atomic nuclei have first been discovered in the
framework of the Interacting Boson Approximation (IBA) model. Critical point
symmetries appropriate for nuclei at the transition points have been introduced
as special solutions of the Bohr Hamiltonian, stirring the introduction of
additional new solutions describing wide ranges of nuclei. A short review of
these recent developments will be attempted.
