Experimental measurements of properties of the large-scale circulation (LSC)
in turbulent convection of a fluid heated from below in a cylindrical container
of aspect ratio one are presented and used to test a model of diffusion in a
potential well for the LSC. The model consists of a pair of stochastic ordinary
differential equations motivated by the Navier-Stokes equations. The two
coupled equations are for the azimuthal orientation theta_0, and for the
azimuthal temperature amplitude delta at the horizontal midplane. The dynamics
is due to the driving by Gaussian distributed white noise that is introduced to
represent the action of the small-scale turbulent fluctuations on the
large-scale flow. Measurements of the diffusivities that determine the noise
intensities are reported. Two time scales predicted by the model are found to
be within a factor of two or so of corresponding experimental measurements. A
scaling relationship predicted by the model between delta and the Reynolds
number is confirmed by measurements over a large experimental parameter range.
The Gaussian peaks of probability distributions p(delta) and p(\dot\theta_0)
are accurately described by the model; however the non-Gaussian tails of
p(delta) are not. The frequency, angular change, and amplitude bahavior during
cessations are accurately described by the model when the tails of the
probability distribution of $\delta$ are used as experimental input.
