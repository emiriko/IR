SuperNEMO is a next-generation double beta decay experiment based on the
successful tracking plus calorimetry design approach of the NEMO3 experiment
currently running in the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM). SuperNEMO can
study a range of isotopes, the baseline isotopes are 82Se and possibly 150Nd.
The total isotope mass will be 100-200 kg. A sensitivity to neutrinoless double
beta decay half-life greater than 10e26 years can be reached which gives access
to Majorana neutrino masses of 50-100 meV. One of the main challenges of the
SuperNEMO R&D is the development of the calorimeter with an unprecedented
energy resolution of 4% FWHM at 3 MeV (Qbb value of 82Se).
