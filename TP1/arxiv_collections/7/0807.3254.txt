We study the stability of supersymmetry breaking vacuum in the presence of
cosmic strings arising in the messenger sector. For certain ranges of the
couplings, the desired supersymmetry breaking vacua become unstable against
decay into phenomenologically unacceptable vacua. This sets constraints on the
range of allowed values of the coupling constants appearing in the models and
more generally on the chosen dynamics of gauge symmetry breaking.
