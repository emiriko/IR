Applying Newtonian dynamics in five dimensions rather than four, to a
universe that is closed, isotropic and expanding,suggests that under certain
circumstances an additional and previously unidentified acceleration, a_A, can
arise affecting the four dimensional motion of spacecraft. The two cases of
this acceleration being either real or virtual are considered. In the real
case, simple estimates of a_A are shown to be in partial agreement with
reported acceleration anomalies from several Earth flybys and from the Pioneer
spacecraft. However, these estimates do not fully reconcile with radio Doppler
tracking data. The virtual case, by contrast, appears to overcome these and
other difficulties with the real case, and is discussed in an addendum.
Furthermore, the virtual case has an altitude dependence which makes detection
of any anomaly unlikely above ~2000 km. Equations governing this additional
acceleration have been derived from first principles, without the introduction
of free parameters or new constants and without amendment to the law of
gravity.
