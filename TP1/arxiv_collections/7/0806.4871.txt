Two methods the complex energy shell model (CXSM) and the complex scaling
(CS) approach were used for calculating isobaric analog resonances (IAR) in the
Lane model. The IAR parameters calculated by the CXSM and the CS methods were
checked against the parameters extracted from the direct numerical solution of
the coupled channel Lane equations (CC). The agreement with the CC results was
generally better than 1 keV for both methods and for each partial waves
concerned. Similarities and differences of the CXSM and the CS methods are
discussed. CXSM offers a direct way to study the configurations of the IAR wave
function in contrast to the CS method.
