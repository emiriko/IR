We compare the interaction parameters measured on LaMnO$_3$ to single site
dynamical mean field estimates of the critical correlation strength needed to
drive a Mott transition, finding that the total correlation strength
(electron-electron plus electron-lattice) is very close to but slightly larger
than the critical value, while if the electron lattice interaction is neglected
the model is metallic. Our results emphasize the importance of additional
physics including the buckling of the Mn-O-Mn bonds.
