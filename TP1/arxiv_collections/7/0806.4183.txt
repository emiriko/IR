In this paper we carry out a quantization of gravity coupled to massless spin
1/2 fermions through the instanton representation of Plebanski gravity. We have
constructed a Hilbert space of states for this model, and we have computed the
Hamilton's equations of motion. The classical equations appear, at a
superficial level, to be consistent with the quantum dynamics of the theory.
