Several large-scale interferometric gravitational-wave detectors use resonant
arm cavities to enhance the light power in the interferometer arms. These
cavities are based on different optical designs: One design uses wedged input
mirrors to create additional optical pick-off ports for deriving control
signals. The second design employs input mirrors without wedge and thus offers
the possibility to use the etalon effect inside the input mirrors for tuning
the finesse of the arm cavities. In this article we introduce a concept of
maximized flexibility that combines both of these options, by featuring wedges
at the input mirrors and using the etalon effect instead in the end mirrors. We
present a design for the arm cavities of Advanced Virgo. We have used numerical
simulations to derive requirements for the manufacturing accuracy of an end
mirror etalon for Advanced Virgo. Furthermore, we give analytical
approximations for the achievable tuning range of the etalon in dependence on
the reflectance, the curvature and the orientation of the etalon back surface.
