We examine ground state properties of the spin-1/2 easy-axis Heisenberg model
on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice with ferromagnetic transverse spin exchange
using quantum Monte Carlo and degenerate perturbation theory. For vanishing
transverse exchange, the model reduces to an antiferromagnetic Ising model that
besides Neel order harbors regions of extensive ground state degeneracy. In the
quantum regime, we find a dimerized phase of triplet states, separated from the
Neel ordered phase by a superfluid. The quantum phase transitions between these
phases are characterized. The magnetization process shows a magnetization
plateau at 1/3 of the saturation value, that persists down to the Ising limit,
and a further plateau at 1/2 only in the quantum regime. For both plateaus, we
determine the crystalline patterns of the localized triplet excitations. No
further plateaus nor supersolid phases are found in this model.
