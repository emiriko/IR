The methods which can be employed to determine the properties of new neutral
resonant states that may be observed in the Drell-Yan channel at the LHC are
reviewed. If these states are sufficiently light we discuss how polarized $ep$
scattering at the LHeC can assist in the determination of their couplings to
the Standard Model (SM) fermions.
