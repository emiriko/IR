We present a calculation of magnetic moments for selected spin-1 mesons using
the techniques of lattice QCD. This is carried out by introducing progressively
small static magnetic field on the lattice and measuring the linear response of
a hadron's mass shift. The calculations are done on $24^4$ quenched lattices
using standard Wilson actions, with $\beta$=6.0 and pion mass down to 500 MeV.
The results are compared to those from the form factor method where available.
