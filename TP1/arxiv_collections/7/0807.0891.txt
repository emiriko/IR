Let k_1,...,k_d be positive integers, and D be a subset of [k_1]x...x[k_d],
whose complement can be decomposed into disjoint sets of the form
{x_1}x...x{x_{s-1}}x[k_s]x{x_{s+1}}x...x{x_d}. We conjecture that the number of
elements of D can be represented as a linear combination of the numbers
k_1,..., k_d with non-negative integer coefficients. A connexion of this
conjecture with the structure of periodical cube tilings is revealed.
