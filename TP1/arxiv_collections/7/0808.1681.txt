We have performed non-resonant x-ray diffraction, resonant soft and hard
x-ray magnetic diffraction, soft x-ray absorption and x-ray magnetic circular
dichroism measurements to clarify the electronic and magnetic states of the
Co3+ ions in GdBaCo2O5.5. Our data are consistent with a 3+ Py Co HS state at
the pyramidal sites and a 3+ Oc Co LS state at the octahedral sites. The
structural distortion, with a doubling of the a axis (2ap x 2ap x 2ap cell),
shows alternating elongations and contractions of the pyramids and indicates
that the metal-insulator transition is associated with orbital order in the t2g
orbitals of the 3+ Py Co HS state. This distortion corresponds to an
alternating ordering of xz and yz orbitals along the a and c axes for the 3+ Py
Co . The orbital ordering and pyramidal distortion lead to deformation of the
octahedra, but the 3+ Oc Co LS state does not allow an orbital order to occur
for the 3+ Oc Co ions. The soft x-ray magnetic diffraction results indicate
that the magnetic moments are aligned in the ab plane but are not parallel to
the crystallographic a or b axes. The orbital order and the doubling of the
magnetic unit cell along the c axis support a non-collinear magnetic structure.
The x-ray magnetic circular dichroism data indicate that there is a large
orbital magnetic contribution to the total ordered Co moment.
