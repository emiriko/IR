We prove the ill-posedness in $ H^s(\T) $, $s<0$, of the periodic cubic
Schr\"odinger equation in the sense that the flow-map is not continuous from
$H^s(\T) $ into itself for any fixed $ t\neq 0 $. This result is slightly
stronger than the one obtained by Christ-Colliander-Tao where the discontinuity
of the solution map is established. Moreover our proof is different and
clarifies the ill-posedness phenomena. Our approach relies on a new result on
the behavior of the associated flow-map with respect to the weak topology of $
L^2(\T) $.
