In 1914, Kempner proved that the series 1/1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/8 + 1/10 + 1/11 +
... + 1/18 + 1/20 + 1/21 + ... where the denominators are the positive integers
that do not contain the digit 9, converges to a sum less than 90. The actual
sum is about 22.92068. In 1916, Irwin proved that the sum of 1/n where n has at
most a finite number of 9's is also a convergent series. We show how to compute
sums of Irwins' series to high precision. For example, the sum of the series
1/9 + 1/19 + 1/29 + 1/39 + 1/49 + ... where the denominators have exactly one
9, is about 23.04428708074784831968. Another example: the sum of 1/n where n
has exactly 100 zeros is about 10 ln(10) + 1.007x10^-197 ~ 23.02585; note that
the first, and largest, term in this series is the tiny 1/googol.
