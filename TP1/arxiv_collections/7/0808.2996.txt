We construct the moduli space of r-jets at a point of Riemannian metrics on a
smooth manifold. The construction is closely related to the problem of
classification of jet metrics via differential invariants. The moduli space is
proved to be a differentiable space which admits a finite canonical
stratification into smooth manifolds. A complete study on the stratification of
moduli spaces is carried out for metrics in dimension n=2.
