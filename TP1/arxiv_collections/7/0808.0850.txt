We analytically examine the excitation of surface Josephson plasma waves
(SJPWs) in periodically-modulated layered superconductors. We show that the
absorption of the incident electromagnetic wave can be substantially increased,
for certain incident angles, due to the resonance excitation of SJPWs. The
absorption increase is accompanied by the decrease of the specular reflection.
Moreover, we find the physical conditions guaranteeing the total absorption
(and total suppression of the specular reflection). These conditions can be
realized for Bi2212 superconductor films.
