We propose a systematic method to extract conformal loop models for rational
conformal field theories (CFT). Method is based on defining an ADE model for
boundary primary operators by using the fusion matrices of these operators as
adjacency matrices. These loop models respect the conformal boundary
conditions. We discuss the loop models that can be extracted by this method for
minimal CFTs and then we will give dilute O(n) loop models on the square
lattice as examples for these loop models. We give also some proposals for WZW
SU(2) models.
