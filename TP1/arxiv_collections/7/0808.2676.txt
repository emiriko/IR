Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) rely on in-network aggregation for
efficiency, however, this comes at a price: A single adversary can severely
influence the outcome by contributing an arbitrary partial aggregate value.
Secure in-network aggregation can detect such manipulation. But as long as such
faults persist, no aggregation result can be obtained. In contrast, the
collection of individual sensor node values is robust and solves the problem of
availability, yet in an inefficient way. Our work seeks to bridge this gap in
secure data collection: We propose a system that enhances availability with an
efficiency close to that of in-network aggregation. To achieve this, our scheme
relies on costly operations to localize and exclude nodes that manipulate the
aggregation, but \emph{only} when a failure is detected. The detection of
aggregation disruptions and the removal of faulty nodes provides robustness. At
the same time, after removing faulty nodes, the WSN can enjoy low cost (secure)
aggregation. Thus, the high exclusion cost is amortized, and efficiency
increases.
