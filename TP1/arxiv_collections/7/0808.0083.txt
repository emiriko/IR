Quantal effects on growth of spinodal instabilities in charge asymmetric
nuclear matter are investigated in the framework of a stochastic mean field
approach. Due to quantal effects, in both symmetric and asymmetric matter,
dominant unstable modes shift towards longer wavelengths and modes with wave
numbers larger than the Fermi momentum are strongly suppressed. As a result of
quantum statistical effects, in particular at lower temperatures, magnitude of
density fluctuations grows larger than those calculated in semi-classical
approximation.
