Solution of the Dirac equation predicts that when an electron with non-zero
orbital angular momentum propagates in a cylindrically symmetric potential, its
spin and orbital degrees of freedom interact, causing the electron's phase
velocity to depend on whether its spin and orbital angular momenta vectors are
oriented parallel or anti-parallel with respect to each other. This spin-orbit
splitting of the electronic dispersion curves can result in a rotation of the
electron's spatial state in a manner controlled by the electron's own spin
z-component value. These effects persist at non-relativistic velocities. To
clarify the physical origin of this effect, we compare solutions of the Dirac
equation to perturbative predictions of the Schrodinger-Pauli equation with a
spin-orbit term, using the standard Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian. This clearly
shows that the origin of the effect is the familiar relativistic spin-orbit
interaction.
