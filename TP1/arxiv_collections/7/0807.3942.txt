There has been interest in generalizing models of gauge mediation of
supersymmetry breaking. As shown by Meade, Seiberg, and Shih (MSS), the soft
masses of general gauge mediation can be expressed in terms of the current
two-point functions of the susy-breaking sector. We here give a simple
extension of their result which provides, for general gauge mediation, the full
effective potential for squark pseudo-D-flat directions. The effective
potential reduces to the sfermion soft masses near the origin, and the full
potential, away from the origin, can be useful for cosmological applications.
We also generalize the soft masses and effective potential to allow for general
gauge mediation by Higgsed gauge groups. Finally, we discuss general gauge
mediation in the limit of small F-terms, and how the results of MSS connect
with the analytic continuation in superspace results, based on a spurion
analysis.
