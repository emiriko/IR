We consider a modified gravity fluid on a Randall-Sundrum II brane situated
at y=0, the action containing a power \alpha of the scalar curvature. As is
known from 4D spatially flat modified gravity, the presence of a bulk viscosity
may drive the cosmic fluid into the phantom region (w < -1) and thereafter
inevitably into the Big Rip singularity, even it is initially nonviscous and
lies in the quintessence region (w > -1). The condition for this to occur is
that the bulk viscosity contains the power (2\alpha-1) of the scalar expansion.
We combine this with the 5D RS II model, and find that the Big Rip, occurring
for \alpha > 1/2, carries over to the metric for the bulk metric, |y|>0.
Actually, the scale factors on the brane and in the bulk become simply
proportional to each other.
