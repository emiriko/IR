In this note we study the possibility of obtaining dark energy solution in a
D-brane scenario in a warped background that includes brane-position dependent
corrections for the non-perturbative superpotential. The volume modulus is
stabilized at instantaneous minima of the potential. Though the model can
account for the existence of dark energy within present observational bound -
fine-tuning of the model parameters becomes unavoidable. Moreover, the model
does not posses a tracker solution.
