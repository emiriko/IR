We investigate the phenomenological consequences of kappa-Minkowski extension
of the Standard Model, working in the linear order in inverse $\kappa$. At this
order the *-deformed Lagrangian can be expanded in the series of dimension five
operators that have non-trivial transformation properties under the ordinary
Lorentz invariance. Such operators cause the Lorentz-violating signatures at
low energies, and in particular lead to the anomalous spin precession linked to
the external direction. The experimental bounds on this phenomenon then
restrict parameter $\kappa$ to be above 10^{23} GeV, making it difficult to
impose a direct connection between this theory and quantum gravity.
