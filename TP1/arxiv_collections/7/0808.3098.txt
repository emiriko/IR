\rm We obtain the global smooth effects for the solutions of the linear
Schr\"odinger equation in anisotropic Lebesgue spaces. Applying these
estimates, we study the Cauchy problem for the generalized elliptical and
non-elliptical derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (DNLS) and get the
global well posedness of solutions with small data in modulation spaces
$M^{3/2}_{2,1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Noticing that $H^{\tilde{s}} \subset M^s_{2,1}$
$(\tilde{s}-s>n/2)$ is an optimal inclusion, we have shown the global well
posedness of DNLS with a class of very rough data.
