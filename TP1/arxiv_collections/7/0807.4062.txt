We here discuss the process of opinion formation in an open community where
agents are made to interact and consequently update their beliefs. New actors
(birth) are assumed to replace individuals that abandon the community (deaths).
This dynamics is simulated in the framework of a simplified model that accounts
for mutual affinity between agents. A rich phenomenology is presented and
discussed with reference to the original (closed group) setting. Numerical
findings are supported by analytical calculations.
