The KTeV collaboration at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory has recently
completed searches for and measurements of several decay modes of the neutral
kaon and pion. These include new searches for lepton flavor violating decays
(which have not been seen), and a new study of the parity properties of the
decay pi^0 -> e^+e^-e^+e^-.
