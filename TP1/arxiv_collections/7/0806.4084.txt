This paper is devoted to the study of the Cauchy problem for the Boussinesq
system with partial viscosity in dimension $N\geq3.$ First we prove a global
existence result for data in Lorentz spaces satisfying a smallness condition
which is at the scaling of the equations. Second, we get a uniqueness result in
Besov spaces with {\it negative} indices of regularity (despite the fact that
there is no smoothing effect on the temperature). The proof relies on a priori
estimates with loss of regularity for the nonstationary Stokes system with
convection. As a corollary, we obtain a global existence and uniqueness result
for small data in Lorentz spaces.
