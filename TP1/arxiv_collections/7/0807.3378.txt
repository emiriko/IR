We develop a theoretical model for how organic molecules can control the
electronic and transport properties of an underlying transistor channel to
whose surface they are chemically bonded. The influence arises from a
combination of long-ranged dipolar electrostatics due to the molecular
head-groups, as well as short-ranged charge transfer and interfacial dipole
driven by equilibrium band-alignment between the molecular backbone and the
reconstructed semiconductor surface atoms.
