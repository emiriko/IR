We update the ground-state energy ratio of unitary Fermi gas to
noninteracting Fermi gas (xi) from the epsilon expansion by including the
next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) term near two spatial dimensions.
Interpolations of the NNLO epsilon expansions around four and two spatial
dimensions with the use of Pade approximants give xi=0.360+/-0.020 in three
dimensions with the uncertainty due to different interpolation functions. This
value is consistent with the previous interpolations of the NLO epsilon
expansions xi=0.377+/-0.014 in spite of the large NNLO corrections.
