We perform a bifurcation analysis of the mathematical model of Jones and
Kompala [K.D. Jones and D.S. Kompala, Cybernetic model of the growth dynamics
of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in batch and continuous cultures, J. Biotech.,
71:105-131, 1999]. Stable oscillations arise via Andronov-Hopf bifurcations and
exist for intermediate values of the dilution rate as has been noted from
experiments previously. A variety of discontinuity induced bifurcations arise
from a lack of global differentiability. We identify and classify discontinuous
bifurcations including several codimension-two scenarios. Bifurcation diagrams
are explained by a general unfolding of these singularities.
