The LHCb collaboration has studied various promising ways to determine the
Unitarity Triangle angle $\gamma$. Three complementary methods will be
considered. The potential of the $B \to DK^{(*)}$ decays has been studied by
employing the combined Gronau-London-Wyler (GLW) and the Atwood-Dunietz-Soni
(ADS) methods, making use of a large sample of simulated data. $\gamma$ can
also be extracted with a time-dependent analysis of $B_s \to D_s K$ decays,
provided that the $B_s$ mixing phase is measured independently. In addition,
the combined measurement of the $B^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ and $B^0_s \to K^+K^-$
time-dependent CP asymmetries allows the determination of $\gamma$, up to
U-spin flavour symmetry breaking corrections. For each method the expected
sensitivities to the angle $\gamma$ are presented.
