The seismogenic area in the lithosphere is considered as an open physical
system. The mathematical analysis of its inflow - outflow energy balance
reveals the presence of specific energy flow physical models. The later comply
with what has been observed by seismologists as "accelerated deformation" and
"seismic quiescence". These physical models are represented by low-order
cumulative seismic energy release analytical polynomial functions in time. The
time derivatives of these functions, analytically calculated, provide a more
sharp indication for the time of occurrence of a future large EQ. Examples from
the application of this approach on real large EQs from the Greek territory are
presented. Moreover, this methodology can be used for the determination of: the
maximum expected magnitude of a future large EQ of a specific seismically
activated seismogenic area and the compilation of seismic potential regional
maps. The later will be presented in details in articles to follow soon.
