We present a measurement of the ratio of t-tbar production cross section via
gluon-gluon fusion to the total t-tbar production cross section in p-pbar
collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV at the Tevatron. Using a data sample with an
integrated luminosity of 955/pb recorded by the CDF II detector at Fermilab, we
select events based on the t-tbar decay to lepton+jets. Using an artificial
neural network technique we discriminate between t-tbar events produced via
q-qbar annihilation and gluon-gluon fusion, and find
Cf=(gg->ttbar)/(pp->ttbar)<0.33 at the 68% confidence level. This result is
combined with a previous measurement to obtain the most precise measurement of
this quantity, Cf=0.07+0.15-0.07.
