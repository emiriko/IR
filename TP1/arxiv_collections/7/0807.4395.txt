The underdamped Langevin equation of motion of a particle, in a symmetric
periodic potential and subjected to a symmetric periodic forcing with mean zero
over a period, with nonuniform friction, is solved numerically. The particle is
shown to acquire a steady state mean velocity at asymptotically large time
scales. This net particle velocity or the ratchet current is obtained in a
range of forcing amplitudes $F_0$ and peaks at some value of $F_0$ within the
range depending on the value of the average friction coefficient and
temperature of the medium. At these large time scales the position dispersion
grows proportionally with time, $t$, allowing for calculating the steady state
diffusion coefficient $D$ which, interestingly, shows a peaking behaviour
around the same $F_0$. The ratchet current, however, turns out to be largely
coherent. At intermediate time scales, which bridge the small time scale
behaviour of dispersion$\sim t^2$ to the large time one, the system shows, in
some cases, periodic oscillation between dispersionless and steeply growing
dispersion depending on the frequency of the forcing. The contribution of these
different dispersion regimes to ratchet current is analysed.
