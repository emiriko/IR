We study the ultrafast dynamics of surface electromagnetic waves
photogenerated on aluminum film perforated with subwavelength holes array by
means of transient photomodulation with 100 fs time resolution. We observed a
pronounced blueshift of the resonant transmission band that reveals the
important role of plasma attenuation in the dynamics and that is inconsistent
with plasmon-polariton mechanism of extraordinary transmission. The transient
photomodulation spectra were successfully modeled within the Boltzmann equation
approach for the electron-phonon relaxation dynamics, involving non-equilibrium
hot electrons and quasi-equilibrium phonons.
