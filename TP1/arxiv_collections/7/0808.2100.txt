We study realistic models of relativistic radiating stars undergoing
gravitational collapse which have vanishing Weyl tensor components. Previous
investigations are generalised by retaining the inherent nonlinearity at the
boundary. We transform the boundary condition to an Abel equation of the first
kind. A variety of nonlinear solutions are generated all of which can be
written explicitly. Several classes of infinite solutions exist.
