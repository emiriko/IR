Raman spectroscopic investigations are carried out on one-dimensional
nanostructures of InN,such as nanowires and nanobelts synthesized by chemical
vapor deposition. In addition to the optical phonons allowed by symmetry; A1,
E1 and E2(high) modes, two additional Raman peaks are observed around 528 cm-1
and 560 cm-1 for these nanostructures. Calculations for the frequencies of
surface optical (SO) phonon modes in InN nanostructures yield values close to
those of the new Raman modes. A possible reason for large intensities for SO
modes in these nanostructures is also discussed.
