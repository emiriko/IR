The solid-solid coexistence of a polydisperse hard sphere system is studied
by using the Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that for large enough
polydispersity the solid-solid coexistence state is more stable than the
single-phase solid. The two coexisting solids have different composition
distributions but the same crystal structure. Moreover, there is evidence that
the solid-solid transition terminates in a critical point as in the case of the
fluid-fluid transition.
