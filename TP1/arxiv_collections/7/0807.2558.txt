We present a novel scheme for the appearance of Stochastic Resonance when the
dynamics of a Brownian particle takes place in a confined medium. The presence
of uneven boundaries, giving rise to an entropic contribution to the potential,
may upon application of a periodic driving force result in an increase of the
spectral amplification at an optimum value of the ambient noise level. This
Entropic Stochastic Resonance (ESR), characteristic of small-scale systems, may
constitute a useful mechanism for the manipulation and control of
single-molecules and nano-devices.
