In this paper, we analyze the algebraic structure of some null boundary as
well as some periodic boundary 2-D Cellular Automata (CA) rules by introducing
a new matrix multiplication operation using only AND, OR instead of most
commonly used AND, EX-OR. This class includes any CA whose rule, when written
as an algebra, is a finite Abelean cyclic group in case of periodic boundary
and a finite commutative cyclic monoid in case of null boundary CA
respectively. The concept of 1-D Multiple Attractor Cellular Automata (MACA) is
extended to 2-D. Using the family of 2-D MACA and the finite Abelian cyclic
group, an efficient encompression algorithm is proposed for binary images.
