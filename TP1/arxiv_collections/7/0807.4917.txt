We have calculated the radiative corrections to the Dalitz plot of baryon
semileptonic decays with angular correlation between polarized emitted baryons
and charged leptons. This work covers both charged and neutral decaying baryons
and is restricted to the so-called three-body region of the Dalitz plot. Also
it is specialized at the center-of-mass frame of the emitted baryon. We have
considered terms up to order (alpha/pi)(q/M_1)^0, where q is the
momentum-transfer and M_1 is the mass of the decaying baryon, and neglected
terms of order (alpha/pi)(q/M_1)^n$ for n >= 1. The expressions displayed are
ready to obtain numerical results, suitable for model-independent experimental
analyses.
