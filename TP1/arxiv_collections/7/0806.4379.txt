The cause of an infringement in GR of a gravitational field energy
conservation law is investigated . The equation of a gravitational field not
contradicting to the energy conservation law is suggested. This equation
satisfy to the Einstein,s requirement of equivalence of all energy kinds as
sources of a gravitational field. This equation is solved in paper for cosmic
objects. It is showed, that results for some objects - for black holes and
gravitating strings-essentialy differ from such for Einstein,s equation, have
the symple meaning and do not contradictions.
