We investigate the geodesic motions of a massive particle and light ray in
the hyperplane orthogonal to the symmetry axis in the 5-dimensional
hypercylindrical spacetime. The class of the solutions depends on one constant
a which is the ratio of string mass density and tension. There exist unstable
orbits in null geodesic only in some range of a. The innermost stable circular
orbits in timelike geodesic also exist only in a certain range of the parameter
a. The capture cross section and the deflection angle of light ray are also
computed.
