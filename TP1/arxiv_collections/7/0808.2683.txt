Various processes have been proposed previously to study a0(980)-f0(980)
mixing through f0(980)->a0(980) transition. Here we investigate in detail the
difference between a0(980)->f0(980) and f0(980)->a0(980) transitions. It is
found that the a0(980)->f0(980) transition can provide additional constrains to
the parameters of a0(980) and f0(980) mesons. Proposal is made to study
a0(980)-f0(980) mixing from chi_{c1}->pi^0 a0(980) -> pi^0 f0(980) reaction at
the upgraded Beijing electron positron collider with the BESIII detector.
