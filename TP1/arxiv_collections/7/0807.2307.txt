The two-dimensional multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis is applied to
reveal the multifractal properties of the fracture surfaces of foamed
polypropylene/polyethylene blends at different temperatures. Nice power-law
scaling relationship between the detrended fluctuation function $F_{q}$ and the
scale $s$ is observed for different orders $q$ and the scaling exponent $h(q)$
is found to be a nonlinear function of $q$, confirming the presence of
multifractality in the fracture surfaces. The multifractal spectra $f(\alpha)$
are obtained numerically through Legendre transform. The shape of the
multifractal spectrum of singularities can be well captured by the width of
spectrum $\Delta\alpha$ and the difference of dimension $\Delta f$. With the
increase of the PE content, the fracture surface becomes more irregular and
complex, as is manifested by the facts that $\Delta\alpha$ increases and
$\Delta f$ decreases from positive to negative. A qualitative interpretation is
provided based on the foaming process.
