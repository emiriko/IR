It is shown that in non-perturbative massless QED an anomalous magnetic
moment is dynamically induced by an applied magnetic field. The induced
magnetic moment produces a Zeeman splitting for electrons in Landau levels
higher than $l=0$. The expressions for the non-perturbative Lande g-factor and
Bohr magneton are obtained. Possible applications of this effect are outlined.
