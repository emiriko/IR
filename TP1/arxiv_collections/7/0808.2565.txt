Very diluted Bose gas placed into a disordered environment falls into a
fragmented localized state. At some critical density the repulsion between
particles overcomes the disorder. The gas transits into a coherent superfluid
state. In this article the geometrical and energetic characteristics of the
localized state at zero temperature and the critical density at which the
quantum phase transition from the localized to the superfluid state proceeds
are found.
