The decay rates and spectroscopy of the $Q \bar Q$ $(Q \in c, b)$ mesons are
computed in non-relativistic phenomenological quark antiquark potential of the
type $V(r)=-\frac{\alpha_c}{r}+A r^{\nu}$, (CPP$_{\nu}$) with different choices
$\nu$. Numerical solution of the schrodinger equation has been used to obtain
the spectroscopy of $Q\bar{Q}$ mesons. The spin hyperfine, spin-orbit and
tensor components of the one gluon exchange interaction are employed to compute
the spectroscopy of the few lower $S$ and orbital excited states. The
numerically obtained radial solutions are employed to obtain the decay
constant, di-gamma and di-leptonic decay widths. The decay widths are
determined with and without radiative corrections. Present results are compared
with other potential model predictions as well as with the known experimental
values.
