A two-level atom interacting with a single mode of quantized electromagnetic
radiation is discussed using a representation in which the atom and the
radiation are unified into a {\em new} canonical radiation. At the {\em
twice-resonance}, when the frequency of the original radiation is twice the
atomic transition frequency ($\omega=2\epsilon$), the {\em emergent} unified
field in the non-interacting atom-field system resembles a free radiation of
frequency $\epsilon$. This free emergent radiation is further shown to exist in
the presence of an interaction which looks similar to the atom-field
interaction in the dipole approximation. The one-photon correlation and the
population inversion are discussed as the possible means of observing the
emergent radiation. The entanglement properties of the emergent radiation are
also discussed.
