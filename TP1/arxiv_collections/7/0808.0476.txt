Samples of Nd(2-x)Ce(x)CuO(4), an electron-doped high temperature
superconducting cuprate (HTSC), near optimal doping at x = 0.155 were measured
via angle resolved photoemission (ARPES). We report a renormalization feature
in the self energy ("kink") in the band dispersion at 50 - 60 meV present in
nodal and antinodal cuts across the Fermi surface. Specifically, while the kink
had previously only been seen in the antinodal region, it is now observed also
in the nodal region, reminiscent of what has been observed in hole-doped
cuprates.
