Transport phenomena at the nanoscale are of interest due to the presence of
both quantum and classical behavior. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum
transport efficiency can be enhanced by a dynamical interplay of the system
Hamiltonian with pure dephasing induced by a fluctuating environment. This is
in contrast to fully coherent hopping that leads to localization in disordered
systems, and to highly incoherent transfer that is eventually suppressed by the
quantum Zeno effect. We study these phenomena in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson
protein complex as a prototype for larger photosynthetic energy transfer
systems. We also show that disordered binary tree structures exhibit enhanced
transport in the presence of dephasing.
