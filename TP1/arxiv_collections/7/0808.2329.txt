An approximate treatment of exchange in finite-temperature path integral
Monte Carlo simulations for fermions has been proposed. In this method, some of
the fine details of density matrix due to permutations have been smoothed over
or averaged out by using the coarse-grained approximation. The practical
usefulness of the method is tested for interacting fermions in a three
dimensional harmonic well. The results show that, the present method not only
reduces the sign fluctuation of the density matrix, but also avoid the fermion
system collapsing into boson system at low temperatures. The method is
substantiated to be exact when applied to free particles.
