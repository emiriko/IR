We present a lattice QCD calculation of the low energy constants of the
leading order chiral Lagrangian. In these simulations the epsilon regime is
reached by using tree-level improved nHYP Wilson fermions combined with
reweighting in the quark mass. We analyze two point functions on two ensembles
with lattices of size (1.85fm)^4 and (2.8fm)^4, and at several quark mass
values between 4 and 20 MeV. The data are well fitted with next-to-leading
order chiral perturbative formulae and predict F=90(4)MeV and
Sigma^(1/3)=248(6)MeV in the MS-bar scheme at 2 GeV.
