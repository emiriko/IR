Fixing a gauge in the non-perturbative domain of Yang-Mills theory is a
non-trivial problem due to the presence of Gribov copies. In particular, there
are different gauges in the non-perturbative regime which all correspond to the
same definition of a gauge in the perturbative domain. Gauge-dependent
correlation functions may differ in these gauges. Two such gauges are the
minimal and absolute Landau gauge, both corresponding to the perturbative
Landau gauge. These, and their numerical implementation, are described and
presented in detail. Other choices will also be discussed.
  This investigation is performed, using numerical lattice gauge theory
calculations, by comparing the propagators of gluons and ghosts for the minimal
Landau gauge and the absolute Landau gauge in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. It is
found that the propagators are different in the far infrared and even at energy
scales of the order of half a GeV. In particular, also the finite-volume
effects are modified. This is observed in two and three dimensions. Some
remarks on the four-dimensional case are provided as well.
