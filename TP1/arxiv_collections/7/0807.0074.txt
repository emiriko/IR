We report results from a novel diagnostic that probes the outer radial
profile of trapped antiproton clouds. The diagnostic allows us to determine the
profile by monitoring the time-history of antiproton losses that occur as an
octupole field in the antiproton confinement region is increased. We show
several examples of how this diagnostic helps us to understand the radial
dynamics of antiprotons in normal and nested Penning-Malmberg traps. Better
understanding of these dynamics may aid current attempts to trap antihydrogen
atoms.
