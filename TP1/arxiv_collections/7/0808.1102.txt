While feedback control has many applications in quantum systems, finding
optimal control protocols for this task is generally challenging. So-called
"verification theorems" and "viscosity solutions" provide two useful tools for
this purpose: together they give a simple method to check whether any given
protocol is optimal, and provide a numerical method for finding optimal
protocols. While treatments of verification theorems usually use sophisticated
mathematical language, this is not necessary. In this article we give a simple
introduction to feedback control in quantum systems, and then describe
verification theorems and viscosity solutions in simple language. We also
illustrate their use with a concrete example of current interest.
