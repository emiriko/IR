We propose a method of measuring the electron temperature $T_e$ in mesoscopic
conductors and demonstrate experimentally its applicability to micron-size
graphene devices in the linear-response regime ($T_e\approx T$, the bath
temperature). The method can be {especially useful} in case of overheating,
$T_e>T$. It is based on analysis of the correlation function of mesoscopic
conductance fluctuations. Although the fluctuation amplitude strongly depends
on the details of electron scattering in graphene, we show that $T_e$ extracted
from the correlation function is insensitive to these details.
