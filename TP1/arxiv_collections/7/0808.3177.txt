It was pointed out in the first part of this study that EPR-type entanglement
is defined by the possibility of performing any of two mutually incompatible
distant, i. e.,direct-interaction-free, measurements. They go together under
the term 'EPR-type disentanglement'. In this second part, quantum-mechanical
insight is gained in the real random delayed-choice erasure experiment of Kim
et al. [Kim et al.: Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 1-5 (2000)] by a relative-reality-of-
unitarily-evolving-state (RRUES) approach (explained in the first part).
Finally, it is shown that this remarkable experiment, which performs, by random
choice, two incompatible measurements at the same time, is actually an EPR-type
disentanglement experiment, closely related to the micromaser experiment
discussed in the first part.
