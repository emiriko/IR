We put forward new properties of lattice solitons in materials and geometries
where both, the linear refractive index and the nonlinearity are spatially
modulated. We show that the interplay between linear and out-of-phase nonlinear
refractive index modulations results in new soliton properties, including
modifications of the soliton stability and transverse mobility, as well as
shape transformations that may be controlled, e.g., by varying the light
intensity.
