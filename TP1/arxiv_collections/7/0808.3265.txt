This short note proves a generalization of the Hirzebruch Riemann-Roch
theorem equivalent to the Cardy condition described in [1]. This is done using
an earlier result [4] that explicitly describes what the Mukai pairing in [1]
descends to in Hodge cohomology via the Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg map
twisted by the root Todd genus.
