We formulate the low energy theorem for virtual Compton scattering off a
nucleon and examine its consequences for generalized nucleon polarizabilites.
As a result of a new, model independent definition of the low energy limit for
VVCS reaction, all generalized sum rules of the nucleon have continuous limit
for real photons and obtain contributions from the $t$-channel that were not
included previously.
