Recently H.Georgi has introduced the concept of unparticles in order to
describe the low energy physics of a nontrivial scale invariant sector of an
effective theory. We investigate its physical effects on the neutrino flux to
be detected in a kilometer cubic neutrino telescope such as IceCube. We study
the effects, on different observables, of the survival neutrino flux after
through the Earth and the regeneration originated in the neutral currents. We
calculate the contribution of unparticle physics to the neutrino-nucleon
interaction and, then, to the observables in order to evaluate detectable
effects in IceCUbe. Our results are compared with the bounds obtained by other
non-underground experiments. Finally, the results are presented as an exclusion
plot in the relevant parameters of the new physics stuff.
