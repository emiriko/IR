We apply the procedure that was suggested in [arXiv:0806.1639] to the case of
abelian D2-brane Dirac-Born-Infeld effective action and discuss its limitation.
Then we suggest an alternative form of this procedure that is based on an
existence of interpolating action proposed in [hep-th/9707113,hep-th/9707011].
