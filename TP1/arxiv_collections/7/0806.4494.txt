We investigate the spin/charge transport in a one-dimensional strongly
correlated system by using the adaptive time-dependent density-matrix
renormalization group method. The model we consider is a non-half-filled
Hubbard chain with a bond of controllable spin-dependent electron hoppings,
which is found to cause a blockade of spin current with little influence on
charge current. We have considered (1) the spread of a wave packet of both spin
and charge in the Hubbard chain and (2) the spin and charge currents induced by
a spin-dependent voltage bias that is applied to the ideal leads attached at
the ends of this Hubbard chain. It is found that the spin-charge separation
plays a crucial role in the spin-current blockade, and one may utilize this
phenomenon to observe the spin-charge separation directly.
