We develop a theoretical framework that allows us to compare electromagnetism
and gravitation in a fully covariant way. This new scenario does not rely on
any kind of approximation nor associate objects with different operational
meaning as it's sometime done in the literature. We construct the
electromagnetic analogue to the Riemann and Weyl tensors and develop the
equations of motion for these objects. In particular, we are able to identify
precisely how and in what conditions gravity can be mapped to electrodynamics.
As a consequence, many of the gemometrical tools of General Relativity can be
applied to Electromagnetism and vice-versa. We hope our results would shed new
light in the nature of electromagnetic and gravitational theories.
