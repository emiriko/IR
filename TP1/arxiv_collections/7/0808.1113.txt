We deal with the problem of bridging the gap between two scales in neuronal
modeling. At the first (microscopic) scale, neurons are considered individually
and their behavior described by stochastic differential equations that govern
the time variations of their membrane potentials. They are coupled by synaptic
connections acting on their resulting activity, a nonlinear function of their
membrane potential. At the second (mesoscopic) scale, interacting populations
of neurons are described individually by similar equations. The equations
describing the dynamical and the stationary mean field behaviors are considered
as functional equations on a set of stochastic processes. Using this new point
of view allows us to prove that these equations are well-posed on any finite
time interval and to provide a constructive method for effectively computing
their unique solution. This method is proved to converge to the unique solution
and we characterize its complexity and convergence rate. We also provide
partial results for the stationary problem on infinite time intervals. These
results shed some new light on such neural mass models as the one of Jansen and
Rit \cite{jansen-rit:95}: their dynamics appears as a coarse approximation of
the much richer dynamics that emerges from our analysis. Our numerical
experiments confirm that the framework we propose and the numerical methods we
derive from it provide a new and powerful tool for the exploration of neural
behaviors at different scales.
