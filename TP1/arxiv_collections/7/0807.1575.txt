We report a novel effect that the visible photoluminescence (in the
blue-green band) from ZnO anoparticles can be controlled by changing the ionic
or polar nature of the medium in which the nanoparticles are dispersed. We find
that the presence of sufficient amount of electrolytes can even quench the
emission. We propose an explanation based on surface charge of the ZnO
nanoparticles which control the band bending in the depletion layer at the
surface of the anoparticles. The band bending in turn, decides the predominant
nature of the visible emission. The explanation is validated by establishing a
direct correlation between the visible emission and the zeta potential.
