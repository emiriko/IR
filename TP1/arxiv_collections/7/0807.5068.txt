We propose, in this article, an analysis of the Darwin's approach to
sociality. Sociality is perfectly integrated into the selective model, and is
caused by the same process as struggle for existence. Thus, the selective
process does not prohibit demonstrating cooperation, but on the contrary,
explains it. We will see that the unification of sociality, in a more adequate
representation to mammals, is not an expression of a naive anthropomorphism,
but of a methodological anthropomorphism; normal consequence of his gradualist
approach of phylogeny.
