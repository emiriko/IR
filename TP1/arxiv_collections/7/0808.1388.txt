Di-hadron correlation measurements have been used to probe di-jet production
in collisions at RHIC. A strong suppression of the away-side high-pT yield in
these measurements is direct evidence that high-pT partons lose energy as they
traverse the strongly interacting medium. However, since the momentum of the
trigger particle is not a good measure of the jet energy, azimuthal di-hadron
correlations have limited sensitivity to the shape of the fragmentation
function. We explore the possibility to better constrain the initial parton
energy by using clusters of multiple high-pT hadrons in a narrow cone as the
'trigger particle' in the azimuthal correlation analysis. We present first
results from this analysis of multi-hadron triggered correlated yields in Au+Au
collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 200 GeV from STAR. The results are compared to Pythia
calculations, and the implications for energy loss and jet fragmentation are
discussed.
