The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of authenticated
throughput-efficient routing in an unreliable and dynamically changing
synchronous network in which the majority of malicious insiders try to destroy
and alter messages or disrupt communication in any way. More specifically, in
this paper we seek to answer the following question: Given a network in which
the majority of nodes are controlled by a malicious adversary and whose
topology is changing every round, is it possible to develop a protocol with
polynomially-bounded memory per processor that guarantees throughput-efficient
and correct end-to-end communication? We answer the question affirmatively for
extremely general corruption patterns: we only request that the topology of the
network and the corruption pattern of the adversary leaves at least one path
each round connecting the sender and receiver through honest nodes (though this
path may change at every round). Out construction works in the public-key
setting and enjoys bounded memory per processor (that does not depend on the
amount of traffic and is polynomial in the network size.) Our protocol achieves
optimal transfer rate with negligible decoding error. We stress that our
protocol assumes no knowledge of which nodes are corrupted nor which path is
reliable at any round, and is also fully distributed with nodes making
decisions locally, so that they need not know the topology of the network at
any time.
