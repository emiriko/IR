As the variation of temperature alters the intrinsic carrier density in a
semiconductor, numerical simulations indicate that the consequent variation of
the relative permittivity in the terahertz regime provides a way to realize
thermally tunable split-ring resonators. Electromagnetic metasurfaces and
metamaterials that are thermally tunable in the terahertz regime can thus be
implemented.
