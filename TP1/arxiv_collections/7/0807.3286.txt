We strengthen "The Free Will Theorem" [1] in several ways, by replacing the
axiom FIN by a weaker axiom MIN, and also by allowing the particles' responses
to depend on past half-spaces rather than on on past light cones. This change
allows us to directly apply our theorem to relativistic theories of the GRW
type.
