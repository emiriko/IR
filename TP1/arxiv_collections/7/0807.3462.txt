A stochastic epidemic model accounting for the effect of contact-tracing on
the spread of an infectious disease is studied. Precisely, individuals
identified as infected may contribute to detecting other infectious individuals
by providing information related to persons with whom they have had possibly
infectious contacts. The population evolves through demographic, infection and
detection processes, in a way that its temporal evolution is described by a
stochastic Markov process, of which the component accounting for the
contact-tracing feature is assumed to be valued in a space of point measures.
For adequate scalings of the demographic, infection and detection rates, it is
shown to converge to the weak deterministic solution of a PDE system, as a
parameter n, interpreted as the population size roughly speaking, becomes
large. From the perspective of the analysis of infectious disease data, this
approximation result may serve as a key tool for exploring the asymptotic
properties of standard inference methods such as maximum likelihood estimation.
We state preliminary statistical results in this context. Eventually, relation
of the model to the available data of the HIV epidemic in Cuba, in which
country a contact-tracing detection system has been set up since 1986, is
investigated and numerical applications are carried out.
