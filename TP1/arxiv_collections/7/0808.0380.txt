We study ballistic thermal transport in Heisenberg spin chain with
nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions at low temperatures. Explicit
expressions for transmission coefficients are derived for thermal transport in
a periodic spin chain of arbitrary junction length by a spin-wave model. Our
analytical results agree very well with the ones from nonequilibrium Green's
function method. Our study shows that the transmission coefficient oscillates
with the frequency of thermal wave. Moreover, the thermal transmission shows
strong dependence on the intrachain coupling, the length of the spin chain, and
the external magnetic field. The results demonstrate the possibility of
manipulating spin-wave propagation and magnetothermal conductance in the
spin-chain junction by adjusting the intrachain coupling and/or the external
magnetic field.
