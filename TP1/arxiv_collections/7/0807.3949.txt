The surface magnetic phase transition of a double-exchange model for metallic
manganites is studied using a Schwinger-boson mean-field method. About three
unit-cells wide surface layers are identified. The magnetic moment in these
layers decreases more rapidly than that in the bulk when the temperature is
increased. This behavior is consistent with experimental observations. We also
discuss the implication of this behavior on the tunneling magnetoresistance
effect using manganites and possible improvement of the magnetoresistance
effect near the bulk Curie temperature.
