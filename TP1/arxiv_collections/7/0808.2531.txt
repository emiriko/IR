Cavity-assisted storage and retrieval of single-photon wave packets in
optically thin spatially extended resonant materials are analyzed. It is shown
that the use of cavity tuning allows one to store and recall time-symmetric
double-sided exponential pulses with near unit efficiency. The optimal regime
of the cavity tuning is determined and the effect of time jitter on the storage
efficiency is analyzed.
