The quantum critical fluctuations of the time-reversal breaking order
parameter which is observed in the pseudogap regime of the Cuprates are shown
to couple to the lattice equivalent of the local angular momentum of the
fermions. Such a coupling favors scattering of fermions through angles close to
$\pm \pi/2$ which is unambiguously shown to promote d-wave pairing. The right
order of magnitude of both $T_c$ and the normalized zero temperature gap
$\Delta/T_c$ are calculated using the same fluctuations which give the
temperature, frequency and momentum dependence of the the anomalous normal
state properties for dopings near the quantum-critical value and with two
parameters extracted from fit to such experiments.
