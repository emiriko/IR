A complete discussion of tree-level flavor-changing effects in the
Randall-Sundrum (RS) model with brane-localized Higgs sector and bulk gauge and
matter fields is presented. The bulk equations of motion for the gauge and
fermion fields, supplemented by boundary conditions taking into account the
couplings to the Higgs sector, are solved exactly. For gauge fields the
Kaluza-Klein (KK) decomposition is performed in a covariant R_xi gauge. For
fermions the mixing between different generations is included in a completely
general way. The hierarchies observed in the fermion spectrum and the quark
mixing matrix are explained naturally in terms of anarchic five-dimensional
Yukawa matrices and wave-function overlap integrals. Detailed studies of the
flavor-changing couplings of the Higgs boson and of gauge bosons and their KK
excitations are performed, including in particular the couplings of the
standard W and Z bosons. A careful analysis of electroweak precision
observables including the S and T parameters and the Zbb couplings shows that
the simplest RS model containing only Standard Model particles and their KK
excitations is consistent with all experimental bounds for a KK scale as low as
a few TeV, if one allows for a heavy Higgs boson and/or for an ultra-violet
cutoff below the Planck scale. The study of flavor-changing effects includes
analyses of the non-unitarity of the quark mixing matrix, anomalous
right-handed couplings of the W bosons, tree-level flavor-changing neutral
current couplings of the Z and Higgs bosons, the rare decays t-->c(u)+Z and
t-->c(u)+h, and the flavor mixing among KK fermions. The results obtained in
this work form the basis for general calculations of flavor-changing processes
in the RS model and its extensions.
