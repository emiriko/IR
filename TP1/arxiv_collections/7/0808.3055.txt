For a particular experimental design, there is interest in finding which
polynomial models can be identified in the usual regression set up. The
algebraic methods based on Groebner bases provide a systematic way of doing
this. The algebraic method does not in general produce all estimable models but
it can be shown that it yields models which have minimal average degree in a
well-defined sense and in both a weighted and unweighted version. This provides
an alternative measure to that based on "aberration" and moreover is applicable
to any experimental design. A simple algorithm is given and bounds are derived
for the criteria, which may be used to give asymptotic Nyquist-like
estimability rates as model and sample sizes increase.
