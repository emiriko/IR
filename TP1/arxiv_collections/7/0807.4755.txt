This paper constitutes the first part of a program to classify all affine
prime regular Hopf algebras $H$ of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension one over an
algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. We prove a number of
properties of such an algebra, list some classes of examples, and then prove
that - when the PI-degree of $H$ is prime - our list contains all such
algebras.
