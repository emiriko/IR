In global supersymmetric Wess-Zumino models with minimal K\"ahler potentials,
F-type supersymmetry breaking always yields instability or continuous
degeneracy of non-supersymmetric vacua. As a generalization of the original
O'Raifeartaigh's result, the existence of instability or degeneracy is true to
any higher order corrections at tree level for models even with
non-renormalizable superpotentials. The degeneracy generically coincides the
R-axion direction under some assumptions of R-charge assignment, but generally
requires neither R-symmetries nor any assumption of generic superpotentials.
The result also confirms the well-known fact that tree level supersymmetry
breaking is a very rare occurrence in global supersymmetric theories with
minimal K\"ahler potentials. The implication for effective field theory method
in the landscape is discussed and we point out that choosing models with
minimal K\"ahler potentials may result in unexpected answers to the vacuum
statistics. Supergravity theories or theories with non-minimal K\"ahler
potentials in general do not suffer from the existence of instability or
degeneracy. But very strong gauge dynamics or small compactification dimension
reduces the K\"ahler potential from non-minimal to minimal, and gravity
decoupling limit reduces supergravity to global supersymmetry. Instability or
degeneracy may appear in these limits. Away from these limits, a large number
of non-SUSY vacua may still be found in an intermediate region.
