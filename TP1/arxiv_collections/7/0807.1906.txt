In this paper we extend Inagaki Weighted Operators fusion rule (WO) in
information fusion by doing redistribution of not only the conflicting mass,
but also of masses of non-empty intersections, that we call Double Weighted
Operators (DWO). Then we propose a new fusion rule Class of Proportional
Redistribution of Intersection Masses (CPRIM), which generates many interesting
particular fusion rules in information fusion. Both formulas are presented for
any number of sources of information. An application and comparison with other
fusion rules are given in the last section.
