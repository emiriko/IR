Tunable interaction between two atoms in a cavity is realized by interacting
the two atoms with an extra controllable single-mode squeezed field. Such a
controllable interaction can be further used to control entanglement between
the two atoms against amplitude damping decoherence caused by spontaneous
emissions. For the independent amplitude damping decoherence channel,
entanglement will be lost completely without controls, while it can be
partially preserved by the proposed strategy. For the collective amplitude
damping decoherence channel, our strategy can enhance the entanglement compared
with the uncontrolled case when the entanglement of the uncontrolled stationary
state is not too large.
