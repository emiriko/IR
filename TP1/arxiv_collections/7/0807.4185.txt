We develop an effective field theory for finding critical properties of 1D
spin gapped fermions at the onset of magnetization. It is shown how the
spin-charge interaction leads to a linear critical behavior and finite
susceptibility for a wide range of models. We also discuss possible
manifestations of spin-charge coupling in cold atomic gases.
