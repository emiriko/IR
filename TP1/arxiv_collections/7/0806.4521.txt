We derive the closure relation for $N$ polaritons made of three different
types of excitons: bosonized excitons, Frenkel or Wannier excitons. In the case
of polaritons made of Wannier excitons, we show how this closure relation,
which appears as non-diagonal, may reduce to the one of $N$ elementary bosons,
the photons, with its $1/N!$ prefactor, or to the one of $N$ Wannier excitons,
with its $(1/N!)^2$ prefactor. Widely different forms of closure relations are
thus found depending on the composite bosons at hand. Comparison with closure
relations of excitons, either bosonized or kept composite as Frenkel or Wannier
excitons, allows us to discuss the influence of a reduction of the number of
internal degrees of freedom, as well as the importance of the composite nature
of the particles and the existence of fermionic components.
