We study phase transition of a nonequilibrium statistical-mechanical model,
in which two degrees of freedom with different time scales separated from each
other touch to their own heat bath. A general condition for finding anomalous
negative latent heat recently discovered is derived a from thermodynamic
argument. As a specific example, phase diagram of a spin-lattice gas model is
studied based on a mean-field analysis with replica method. While
configurational variables are spin and particle in this model, it is found that
the negative latent heat appears in a parameter region of the model,
irrespective of the order of their time scale. Qualitative differences in the
phase diagram are also discussed.
