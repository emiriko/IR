The large-N behavior of the quartic-cubic generalized two dimensional Yang
Mills U(N) on the sphere is investigated, for small cubic couplings. It is
shown that single transition at the critical area which is present for the
quartic model, is split into two transitions, both of them are third order. the
phase diagram of the system for small cubic couplings is obtained.
