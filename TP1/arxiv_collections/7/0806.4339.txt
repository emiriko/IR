Fano resonances are proposed to perform a measurement of a spin state
(whether it is up or down) of a single electron in a quantum dot via a
spin-polarized current in an adjacent quantum wire. Rashba-like spin-orbit
interaction in a quantum dot prohibits spin-flip events (Kondo-like
phenomenon). That ensures the measurement to be non-demolishing.
