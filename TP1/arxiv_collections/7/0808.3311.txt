Memory is an indispensable element for computer besides logic gates. In this
Letter we report a model of thermal memory. We demonstrate via numerical
simulation that thermal (phononic) information stored in the memory can be
retained for a long time without being lost and more importantly can be read
out without being destroyed. The possibility of experimental realization is
also discussed.
