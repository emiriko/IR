Cross sections of the colored scalar particle production in $pp$-collisions
are calculated and differential and total cross sections of the corresponding
parton subprocesses are obtained. The total cross section of scalar gluon
production in $pp$-collisions at the LHC is estimated and the dominant decays
of scalar gluons are discussed. The production cross section of scalar gluons
$F$ with masses $m_F\lesssim 1300$ GeV is shown to be sufficient for the
effective production of these particles at the LHC.
