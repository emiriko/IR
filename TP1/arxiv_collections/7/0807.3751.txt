We give an achievable secret key rate of a binary modulated continuous
variable quantum key distribution schemes in the collective attack scenario
considering quantum channels that impose arbitrary noise on the exchanged
signals. Bob performs homodyne measurements on the received states and the two
honest parties employ a reverse reconciliation procedure in the classical
post-processing step of the protocol.
