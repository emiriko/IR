We calculate correlation functions of the energy-momentum tensor in the
vicinity of the deconfinement phase transition of (3+1)-dimensional SU(2) gauge
theory and discuss their critical behavior in the vicinity of the second order
deconfinement transition. We show that correlation functions of the trace of
the energy momentum tensor diverge uniformly at the critical point in
proportion to the specific heat singularity. Correlation functions of the
pressure, on the other hand, stay finite at the critical point. We discuss the
consequences of these findings for the analysis of transport coefficients, in
particular the bulk viscosity, in the vicinity of a second order phase
transition point.
