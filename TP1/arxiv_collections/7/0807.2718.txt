An innovative photosensitive gaseous detector, consisting of a GEM like
amplification structure with double layered electrodes (instead of commonly
used metallic ones) coated with a CsI reflective photocathode, is described. In
one of our latest designs, the inner electrode consists of a metallic grid and
the outer one is made of resistive strips; the latter are manufactured by a
screen printing technology on the top of the metallic strips grid The inner
metallic grid is used for 2D position measurements whereas the resistive layer
provides an efficient spark protected operation at high gains - close to the
breakdown limit. Detectors with active areas of 10cm x10cm and 10cm x20cm were
tested under various conditions including the operation in photosensitive gas
mixtures containing ethylferrocene or TMAE vapors. The new technique could have
many applications requiring robust and reliable large area detectors for UV
visualization, as for example, in Cherenkov imaging devices.
