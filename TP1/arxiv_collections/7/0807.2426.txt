In current experiments with cold quantum gases in periodic potentials,
interference fringe contrast is typically the easiest signal in which to look
for effects of non-trivial many-body dynamics. In order better to calibrate
such measurements, we analyse the background effect of thermal decoherence as
it occurs in the absence of dynamical interparticle interactions. We study the
effect of optical lattice potentials, as experimentally applied, on the
condensed fraction of a non-interacting Bose gas in local thermal equilibrium
at finite temperatures. We show that the experimentally observed decrease of
the condensate fraction in the presence of the lattice can be attributed, up to
a threshold lattice height, purely to ideal gas thermodynamics; conversely we
confirm that sharper decreases in first-order coherence observed in stronger
lattices are indeed attributable to many-body physics. Our results also suggest
that the fringe visibility 'kinks' observed in F.Gerbier et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 95, 050404 (2005) may be explained in terms of the competition between
increasing lattice strength and increasing mean gas density, as the gaussian
profile of the red-detuned lattice lasers also increases the effective strength
of the harmonic trap.
