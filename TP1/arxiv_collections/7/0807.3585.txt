We measure the response and thermal motion of a high-Q nanomechanical
oscillator coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity in the
resolved-sideband regime where the oscillator's resonance frequency exceeds the
cavity's linewidth. The coupling between the microwave field and mechanical
motion is strong enough for radiation pressure to overwhelm the intrinsic
mechanical damping. This radiation-pressure damping cools the fundamental
mechanical mode by a factor of 5 below the thermal equilibrium temperature in a
dilution refrigerator to a phonon occupancy of 140 quanta.
