We report on a recent extraction of the higher twist contributions to the
deep inelastic structure functions $F_2^{ep,ed}(x,Q^2)$ in the large $x$
region. It is shown that the size of the extracted higher twist contributions
is strongly correlated with the higher order corrections applied to the leading
twist part. A gradual lowering of the higher twist contributions going from NLO
to N$^4$LO is observed, where in the latter case only the leading large $x$
terms were considered.
