An elementary pedagogical derivation of the Lense-Thirring precession is
given based on the use of Hamilton vector. The Hamilton vector is an extra
constant of motion of the Kepler/Coulomb problem related simply to the more
popular Runge-Lenz vector. When a velocity-dependent Lorentz-like
gravitomagnetic force is present, the Hamilton vector, as well as the canonical
orbital momentum are no longer conserved and begin to precess. It is easy to
calculate their precession rates, which are related to the Lense-Thirring
precession of the orbit.
