We establish general estimates for simple random walk on an arbitrary
infinite random graph, assuming suitable bounds on volume and effective
resistance for the graph. These are generalizations of the results in
\cite[Section 1,2]{BJKS}, and in particular, imply the spectral dimension of
the random graph. We will also give an application of the results to random
walk on a long range percolation cluster.
