We study three-leg antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with the periodic
boundary conditions in the rung direction. Since the rungs form regular
triangles, spin frustration is induced. We use the density-matrix
renormalization group method to investigate the ground state. We find that the
spin excitations are always gapped to remove the spin frustration as long as
the rung coupling is nonzero. We also visibly confirm spin-Peierls dimerization
order in the leg direction. Both the spin gap and the dimerization order are
basically enhanced as the rung coupling increases.
