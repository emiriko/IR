We study in this paper the finite-size effects of a non-periodic lattice on a
lattice calculation. To this end we use a finite lattice equipped with a
central difference derivative with homogeneous boundary conditions to calculate
the bosonic mass associated to the Schwinger model. We found that the
homogeneous boundary conditions produce absence of fermion doubling and chiral
invariance, but we also found that in the continuum limit this lattice model
does not yield the correct value of the boson mass as other models do. We
discuss the reasons for this and, as a result, the matrix which cause the
fermion doubling problem is identified.
