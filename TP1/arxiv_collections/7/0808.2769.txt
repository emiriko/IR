We investigate the angular correlation between pions and photons produced in
deuteron-gold collisions at RHIC and proton-lead collisions at LHC using the
Color Glass Condensate formalism and make predictions for the dependence of the
production cross section on the angle between the pion and photon at different
rapidities and transverse momenta. Measuring this dependence would shed further
light on the role of high gluon density and saturation dynamics at RHIC and
LHC.
