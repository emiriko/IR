In this paper we study interpolation in local extensions of a base theory. We
identify situations in which it is possible to obtain interpolants in a
hierarchical manner, by using a prover and a procedure for generating
interpolants in the base theory as black-boxes. We present several examples of
theory extensions in which interpolants can be computed this way, and discuss
applications in verification, knowledge representation, and modular reasoning
in combinations of local theories.
