Computations in small Coxeter groups or dihedral groups suggest that the
partition into Kazhdan-Lusztig cells with unequal parameters should obey to
some semicontinuity phenomenon (as the parameters vary). The aim of this paper
is to provide a rigorous theoretical background for supporting this intuition
that will allow to state several precise conjectures.
