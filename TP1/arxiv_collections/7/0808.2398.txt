We find that in two dimensions wires can crumple into different morphologies
and present the associated morphological phase diagram. Our results are based
on experiments with different metallic wires and confirmed by numerical
simulations using a discrete element model. We show that during crumpling, the
number of loops increases according to a power-law with different exponents in
each morphology. Furthermore, we observe a power-law divergence of the
structure's bulk stiffness similar to what is observed in forced crumpling of
membranes.
