We present AceWiki, a prototype of a new kind of semantic wiki using the
controlled natural language Attempto Controlled English (ACE) for representing
its content. ACE is a subset of English with a restricted grammar and a formal
semantics. The use of ACE has two important advantages over existing semantic
wikis. First, we can improve the usability and achieve a shallow learning
curve. Second, ACE is more expressive than the formal languages of existing
semantic wikis. Our evaluation shows that people who are not familiar with the
formal foundations of the Semantic Web are able to deal with AceWiki after a
very short learning phase and without the help of an expert.
