Minkowski's concept of a four-dimensional physical space is a central
paradigm of modern physics. The three-dimensional Maxwellian electrodynamics is
uniquely generalized to the covariant four-dimensional form. Is the (1+3)
decomposition of the covariant four-dimensional form unique? How do the
different sign assumptions of electrodynamics emerge from this decomposition?
Which of these assumptions are fundamental and which of them may be modified?
How does the Minkowski space-time metric emerge from this preliminary
metric-free construction? In this paper we are looking for answers to the
problems mentioned. Our main result is the derivation of four different
possible sets of electrodynamic equations which may occur in different types of
isotropic electromagnetic media. The wave propagation in each of these media is
described by the Minkowskian optical metrics. Moreover, the electric and
magnetic energies are nonnegative in all cases. We also show that the correct
directions of the Lorentz force (as a consequence of the Dufay and the Lenz
rules) hold true for all these cases. However, the differences between these
four types of media must have a physical meaning. In particular, the signs of
the three electromagnetic invariants are different.
