We consider a ballistic Josephson junction with a quantum point contact in a
two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The point contact
acts as a spin filter when embedded in a circuit with normal electrodes. We
show that with an in-plane external magnetic field an anomalous supercurrent
appears even for zero phase difference between the superconducting electrodes.
In addition, the external field induces large critical current asymmetries
between the two flow directions, leading to supercurrent rectifying effects.
