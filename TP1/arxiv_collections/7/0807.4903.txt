We use a technique recently developed by Blondel et al. (2008) in order to
detect scientific specialties from author cocitation networks. This algorithm
has distinct advantages over most of the previous methods used to obtain
cocitation "clusters", since it avoids the use of similarity measures, relies
entirely on the topology of the weighted network and can be applied to
relatively large networks. Most importantly, it requires no subjective
interpretation of the cocitation data or of the communities found. Using two
examples, we show that the resulting specialties are the smallest coherent
"group" of researchers (within a hierarchy of cluster sizes) and can thus be
identified unambiguously. Furthermore, we confirm that these communities are
indeed representative of what we know about the structure of a given scientific
discipline and that, as specialties, they can be accurately characterized by a
few keywords (from the publication titles). We argue that this robust and
efficient algorithm is particularly well-suited to cocitation networks, and
that the results generated can be of great use to researchers studying various
facets of the structure and evolution of science.
