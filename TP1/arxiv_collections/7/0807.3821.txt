SIDE (Super Ifu Deployable Experiment) is proposed as second-generation,
common-user instrument for the GTC. It will be a low and intermediate
resolution fiber fed spectrograph, highly efficient in multi-object and 3D
spectroscopy. The low resolution part (R = 1500, 4000) is called Dual VIS-NIR
because it will observe in the VIS and NIR bands (0.4 ~V 1.7 microns)
simultaneously. Because of the large number of fibers, a set of ~10 identical
spectrographs is needed, each with a mirror collimator, a dichroic and two
refractive cameras. The cameras are optimized for 0.4 - 0.95 microns (VIS) and
0.95 - 1.7 microns (NIR) respectively.
