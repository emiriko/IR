A fourth generation could provide, within SUSY, a solution to baryogenesis at
the EW scale. It is allowed by precision measurements. Available data from
Tevatron already restrict the allowed domain of parameters for the new quarks
and the Higgs boson. There are some indications from b->s transitions which
could be interpreted within an extension of the CKM matrix to 4x4, in
particular CPV in the Bs time-dependence for the J/Psi-Phi mode observed at
Tevatron. If confirmed with more data the 4MSSM interpretation predicts a very
interesting scenario for LHC and a TeV LC.
