We report on the experimental demonstration of stimulated Raman adiabatic
passage (STIRAP) in a Tm$^{3+}$:YAG crystal. Tm$^{3+}$:YAG is a promising
material for use in quantum information processing applications, but as yet
there are few experimental investigations of coherent Raman processes in this
material. We investigate the effect of inhomogeneous broadening and Rabi
frequency on the transfer efficiency and the width of the two-photon spectrum.
Simulations of the complete Tm$^{3+}$:YAG system are presented along with the
corresponding experimental results.
