We consider a modified form of gravity, which has an extra term quadratic in
the Riemann tensor. This term mimics a Yang-Mills theory. The other defining
characteristic of this gravity is having the affine connection independent of
the metric. (The metricity of the metric is rejected, too, since it implies a
Levi-Civita connection.) It is then shown that, in the low density limit, this
modified gravity does not differ from the General Theory of Relativity. We then
point out that its Lagrangian does not contain partials of the metric, so that
the metric is not a quantum field, nor does it contribute propagators to the
Feynman diagrams of the theory. We also point out that the couplings of this
theory (that determine the topological structure of the Feynman diagrams) all
come from the term quadratic in the Riemann tensor. As a result of this
situation, the diagrams of this theory and the diagrams of a Yang-Mills theory
all have the same topology and degree of divergence, up to numerical
coefficients. Since Yang-Mills theories are renormalizable, it follows that
this theory should also be renormalizable.
