We present the results of calculations determining the cross sections for
indirect dissociative recombination of LiH$_2^+$ + $e^-$. These calculations
employ multichannel quantum defect theory and Fano's rovibrational frame
transformation technique to obtain the indirect DR cross section in the manner
described by Ref.\cite{hamilton}. We use \textit{ab initio} electron-molecule
scattering codes to calculate quantum defects. In contrast to H$_3^+$, the
LiH$_2^+$ molecule exhibits considerable mixing between rotation and vibration;
however, by incorporating an exact treatment of the rovibrational dynamics of
the LiH$_2^+$, we show that this mixing has only a small effect on the observed
DR rate. We calculate a large DR rate for this cation, 4.0 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$
cm$^{3}$ s$^{-1}$ at 1 meV incident electron energy.
