The existence of a new kind of massive boson-fermion symmetry is shown
explicitly in the framework of the heterotic, type II and type II orientifold
superstring theories. The target space-time is two-dimensional. Higher
dimensional models are defined via large marginal deformations of JxJ-type. The
spectrum of the initial undeformed two dimensional vacuum consists of massless
boson degrees of freedom, while all massive boson and fermion degrees of
freedom exhibit a new Massive Spectrum Degeneracy Symmetry (MSDS). This precise
property, distinguishes the MSDS theories from the well known supersymmetric
SUSY-theories. Some proposals are stated in the framework of these theories
concerning the structure of: (i) The Early Non-singular Phase of the Universe,
(ii) The two dimensional boundary theory of AdS3 Black-Holes, (iii) Plausible
applications of the MSDS theories in particle physics, alternative to SUSY.
