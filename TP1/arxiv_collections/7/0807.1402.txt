I review the current status of Lattice QCD calculations and the progress that
we have made in consolidating the 'lattice QCD revolution' of four years ago.
Significant results from formalisms other than the improved staggered
formalism, which has been leading the revolution, are now appearing. Comparison
between formalisms gives additional confidence in the results. More precision
tests against experiment have been made and predictions that are needed by the
experimental programme have been improved. There has been particular progress
this year in charm and strange physics.
