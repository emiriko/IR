The mapping of the Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation with a random potential on
the Fokker-Planck equation is used to calculate the localization length of its
stationary states. The asymptotic growth rates of the moments of the wave
function and its derivative for the linear Schroedinger Equation in a random
potential are computed analytically and resummation is used to obtain the
corresponding growth rate for the nonlinear Schroedinger equation and the
localization length of the stationary states.
