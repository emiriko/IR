We derive the thermodynamic curvature of a two dimensional ideal anyon gas of
particles obeying fractional statistics. The statistical interactions of anyon
gas can be attractive or repulsive. For attractive statistical interactions,
thermodynamic curvature is positive and for repulsive statistical interactions,
it is negative, which indicates a more stable anyon gas. There is a special
case between the two where the thermodynamic curvature is zero. Small
deviations from the classical limit will also be explored.
