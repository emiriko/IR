We study rational streams (over a field) from a coalgebraic perspective.
Exploiting the finality of the set of streams, we present an elementary and
uniform proof of the equivalence of four notions of representability of
rational streams: by finite dimensional linear systems; by finite stream
circuits; by finite weighted stream automata; and by finite dimensional
subsystems of the set of streams.
