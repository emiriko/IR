This paper offers a brief review of cognitive verbs typically used in the
literature to describe standard spreadsheet practices. The verbs identified are
then categorised in terms of Bloom's Taxonomy of Hierarchical Levels, and then
rated and arranged to distinguish some of their qualities and characteristics.
Some measurement items are then evaluated to see how well computerised test
question items validate or reinforce training or certification. The paper
considers how establishing standard practices in spreadsheet training and
certification can help reduce some of the risks associated with spreadsheets,
and help promote productivity.
