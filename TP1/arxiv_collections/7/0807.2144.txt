We investigate a class of quiver-type Chern-Simons gauge theories with some
Chern-Simons couplings vanishing. The vanishing of the couplings means that the
corresponding vector fields are auxiliary fields. We show that these theories
possess N=4 supersymmetry by writing down the actions and the supersymmetry
transformation in terms of component fields in manifestly Spin(4) covariant
form.
