An analysis of the stability of a duplex containing G.A mispairs or G.A/A.G
tandem during DNA melting has revealed that duplex stability depends on both
DNA sequences and on the conformations of the G.A mispairs. The thermodynamics
of single pair opening for G(anti).A(syn) and G(anti).A(anti) conformations
adopted by G.A mispairs is found to strongly correlate with that of the
canonical base pairs, while for sheared conformation a significant difference
is observed.
