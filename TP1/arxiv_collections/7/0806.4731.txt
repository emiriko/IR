We demonstrate the predicted out-of-plane precession induced by spin transfer
in magnetic nanostructures with in-plane magnetic field. We show that other
magnetic excitations have a significant effect on the stability of the out-of
plane precession, making it extremely sensitive to the orientation of the
applied magnetic field. The data are supported with micromagnetic simulations.
Our results elucidate the relation between the excitation spectrum and the
specific dynamical behaviors of nanoscale magnets.
