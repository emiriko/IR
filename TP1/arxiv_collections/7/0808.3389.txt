The object of this work is the spinor L-function of degree 3 and certain
degeneration related to the functoriality principle. We study liftings of
automorphic forms on the pair of symplectic groups
$(\text{GSp}(2),\text{GSp}(4))$ to $\text{GSp}(6)$. We prove cuspidality and
demonstrate the compatibility with conjectures of Andrianov, Panchishkin,
Deligne and Yoshida. This is done on a motivic and analytic level. We discuss
an underlying torus and L-group homomorphism and put our results in the context
of the Langlands program.
