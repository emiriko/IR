Given a smooth and separated K(pi,1) variety X over a field k, we associate a
"cycle class" in etale cohomology with compact supports to any continuous
section of the natural map from the arithmetic fundamental group of X to the
absolute Galois group of k. We discuss the algebraicity of this class in the
case of curves over p-adic fields, and deduce in particular a new proof of
Stix's theorem according to which the index of a curve X over a p-adic field k
must be a power of p as soon as the natural map from the arithmetic fundamental
group of X to the absolute Galois group of k admits a section. Finally, an
etale adaptation of Beilinson's geometrization of the pronilpotent completion
of the topological fundamental group allows us to lift this cycle class in
suitable cohomology groups.
