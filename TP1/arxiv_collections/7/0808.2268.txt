In his 1985 survey of notions of exchangeability, Aldous introduced a form of
exchangeability corresponding to the symmetries of the infinite discrete cube,
and asked whether these exchangeable probability measures enjoy a
representation theorem similar to those for exchangeable sequences, arrays and
set-indexed families. In this note we to prove that, whereas the known
representation theorems for different classes of partially exchangeable
probability measure imply that the compact convex set of such measures is a
Bauer simplex (that is, its subset of extreme points is closed), in the case of
cube-exchangeability it is a copy of the Poulsen simplex (in which the extreme
points are dense). This follows from the arguments used by Glasner and Weiss'
for their characterization of property (T) in terms of the geometry of the
simplex of invariant measures for associated generalized Bernoulli actions.
  The emergence of this Poulsen simplex suggests that, if a representation
theorem for these processes is available at all, it must take a very different
form from the case of set-indexed exchangeable families.
