Possible anomalous single productions of the fourth standard model generation
up and down type quarks at CERN Large Hadron Collider are studied. Namely, $p p
\to u_4 (d_4) X$ with subsequent $u_4\to bW^{+}$ process followed by leptonic
decay of $W$ boson and $d_4\to b\gamma$ (and its h.c.) decay channel are
considered. Signatures of these processes and corresponding standard model
backgrounds are discussed in detail. Discovery limits for quark mass and
achievable values of anomalous coupling strength are determined.
