We apply the method of nonlinear steepest descent to compute the long-time
asymptotics of the periodic (and slightly more generally of the quasi-periodic
finite-gap) Toda lattice for decaying initial data in the soliton region. In
addition, we show how to reduce the problem in the remaining region to the
known case without solitons.
