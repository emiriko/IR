We study a suspended graphene sheet subject to the electric field of a gate
underneath. We compute the elastic deformation of the sheet and the
corresponding effective gauge field, which modifies the electronic transport.
In a clean system the two-terminal conductance of the sample is reduced below
the ballistic limit and is almost totally suppressed at low carrier
concentrations in samples under tension. Residual disorder restores a small
finite conductivity.
