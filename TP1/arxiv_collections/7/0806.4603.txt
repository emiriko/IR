The spin-polarized transport through a coherent strongly coupled double
quantum dot (DQD) system is analyzed theoretically in the sequential and
cotunneling regimes. Using the real-time diagrammatic technique, we analyze the
current, differential conductance, shot noise and tunnel magnetoresistance
(TMR) as a function of both the bias and gate voltages for double quantum dots
coupled in series, in parallel as well as for T-shaped systems. For DQDs
coupled in series, we find a strong dependence of the TMR on the number of
electrons occupying the double dot, and super-Poissonian shot noise in the
Coulomb blockade regime. In addition, for asymmetric DQDs, we analyze transport
in the Pauli spin blockade regime and explain the existence of the leakage
current in terms of cotunneling and spin-flip cotunneling-assisted sequential
tunneling. For DQDs coupled in parallel, we show that the transport
characteristics in the weak coupling regime are qualitatively similar to those
of DQDs coupled in series. On the other hand, in the case of T-shaped quantum
dots we predict a large super-Poissonian shot noise and TMR enhanced above the
Julliere value due to increased occupation of the decoupled quantum dot. We
also discuss the possibility of determining the geometry of the double dot from
transport characteristics. Furthermore, where possible, we compare our results
with existing experimental data on nonmagnetic systems and find qualitative
agreement.
