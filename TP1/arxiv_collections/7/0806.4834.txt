Continuous-time mean-variance portfolio selection model with nonlinear wealth
equations and bankruptcy prohibition is investigated by the dual method. A
necessary and sufficient condition which the optimal terminal wealth satisfies
is obtained through a terminal perturbation technique. It is also shown that
the optimal wealth and portfolio is the solution of a forward-backward
stochastic differential equation with constraints.
