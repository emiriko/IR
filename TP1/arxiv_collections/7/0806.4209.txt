We formulate an analytical model for vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers
(VCSELs) with injection (pump) of spin-polarized electrons. Our results for two
different modes of carrier recombination allow for a systematic analysis of the
operational regimes of the spin-VCSELs. We demonstrate that threshold reduction
by electrically-pumped spin-polarized carriers can be larger than previously
assumed possible. Near the threshold, such VCSELs can act as effective
non-linear filters of circularly-polarized light, owing to their spin-dependent
gain.
