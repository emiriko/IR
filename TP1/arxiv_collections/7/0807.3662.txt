For a complex analytic map f from n-space to p-space with n<p and with an
isolated instability at the origin, the disentanglement of f is a local
stabilization of f that is analogous to the Milnor fibre for functions.
  For mono-germs it is known that the disentanglement is a wedge of spheres of
possibly varying dimensions. In this paper we give a condition that allows us
to deduce that the same is true for a large class of multi-germs.
