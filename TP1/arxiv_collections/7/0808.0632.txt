We investigate photoproduction of eta mesons off protons and neutrons within
a coupled-channels effective-Lagrangian method which is based on the K-matrix
approach. The two-body final channels included are pi-N, eta-N, phi-N, rho-N,
gamma-N, K-Lambda, and K-Sigma. Non-resonant meson-baryon interactions are
included in the model via nucleon intermediate states in the s- and u-channels,
meson exchanges in the t-channel amplitude and the u-channel resonances. The
nucleon resonances S_{11}(1535), S_{11}(1650), S_{31}(1620), P_{11}(1440),
P_{11}(1710), P_{13}(1720), P_{33}(1232), P_{33}(1600), D_{13}(1520),
D_{13}(1700), and D_{33}(1700) are included explicitly in calculations. Our
model describes simultaneously the available data as well on total and
differential cross sections as on beam and target asymmetries. This holds for
the p(gamma,eta)p reaction for photon energies ranging from very close to
threshold to up to 3 GeV. The polarization observables show strong sensitivity
to resonances that otherwise contribute only weakly to the total cross section.
It is found that the pronounced bump-like structure seen in the excitation
function of the n(gamma,eta)n cross section at gamma energies around 1 GeV, can
be explained by the interference effects of S_{11}, P_{11} and P_{13} resonance
contributions.
