We use first-principles methods to investigate the adsorption of Cu, Pb, Ag,
and Mg onto a H-terminated Si surface. We show that Cu and Pb can adsorb
strongly while Ag and Mg are fairly inert. In addition, two types of adsorption
states are seen to exist for Pb. We also study the clustering energetics of Cu
and Pb on the surface and find that while Cu clusters eagerly, Pb may prefer to
form only small clusters of a few atoms. This kind of behavior of impurities is
incorporated in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of wet etching of Si. The
simulation results agree with experiments supporting the idea that micromasking
by Cu clusters and Pb atoms is the mechanism through which these impurities
affect the etching process.
