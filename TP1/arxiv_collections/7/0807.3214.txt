Bound state in continuum (BIC) might appear in open quantum dots for
variation of the dot's shape. By means of the equations of motion of Green
functions we investigate effect of strong intradot Coulomb interactions on that
phenomenon in the framework of impurity Anderson model. Equation that imaginary
part of poles of the Green function equals to zero gives condition for BICs. As
a result we show that Coulomb interactions replicate the single-electron BICs
into two-electron ones.
