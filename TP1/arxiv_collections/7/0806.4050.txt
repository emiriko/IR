Basing on the Chetaev's theorem on stable trajectories in dynamics in the
presence of dissipative forces we obtain a generalized stability condition for
Hamiltonian systems that has the form of the Schrodinger equation. We show that
the energy of the dissipative forces generating generalized Chetaev's stability
condition exactly coincides with Bohm's "quantum" potential. Using the
principle of least action of perturbation we prove that the Bohmian quantum
mechanics complemented with the Chetaev's generalized theorem does not have
hidden variables.
