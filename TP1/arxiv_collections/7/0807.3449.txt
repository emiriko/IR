It is used the mechanical method of Abrikosov vortex stimulated dynamics
investigation in superconductors. With its help it was studied relaxation
phenomena in vortex matter of high-temperature superconductors. It established
that pulsed magnetic fields change the course of relaxation processes taking
place in vortex matter. The study of the influence of magnetic pulses differing
by their durations and amplitudes on vortex system of strongly anisotropic
high-temperature superconductors system Bi1.7Pb0.3Sr2Ca2Cu3O10-d showed the
presence of threshold phenomena. The small duration pulses do not change the
course of relaxation processes taking place in vortex matter. When the duration
of pulses exceeds some critical value (threshold), then their influence change
the course of relaxation process which is revealed by stepwise change of
relaxing mechanical moment.. These investigation showed that the time for
formatting of Abrikosov vortex lattice in Bi1.7Pb0.3Sr2Ca2Cu3O10-d is of the
order of 150 us which on the order of value exceeds the time necessary for
formation of a single vortex observed in isotropic high-temperature
superconductor HoBa2Cu3O7-d and on two orders exceeds the creation time of a
single vortex observed in classical type II superconductors.
