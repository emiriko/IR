An infinite-dimensional version of Calogero-Moser operator of $BC$-type and
the corresponding Jacobi symmetric functions are introduced and studied,
including the analogues of Pieri formula and Okounkov's binomial formula. We
use this to describe all the ideals linearly generated by the Jacobi symmetric
functions and show that the deformed $BC(m,n)$ Calogero-Moser operators,
introduced in our earlier work, appear here in a natural way as the
restrictions of the $BC_{\infty}$ operator to the corresponding
finite-dimensional subvarieties. As a corollary we have the integrability of
these quantum systems and all the main formulas for the related super Jacobi
polynomials.
