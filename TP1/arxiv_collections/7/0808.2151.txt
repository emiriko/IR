The spectral function for an electron one-component plasma is calculated
self-consistently using the GW0 approximation for the single-particle
self-energy. In this way, correlation effects which go beyond the mean-field
description of the plasma are contained, i.e. the collisional damping of
single-particle states, the dynamical screening of the interaction and the
appearance of collective plasma modes. Secondly, a novel non-perturbative
analytic solution for the on-shell GW0 self-energy as a function of momentum is
presented. It reproduces the numerical data for the spectral function with a
relative error of less than 10% in the regime where the Debye screening
parameter is smaller than the inverse Bohr radius, kappa<1/a_B. In the limit of
low density, the non-perturbative self-energy behaves as n^(1/4), whereas a
perturbation expansion leads to the unphysical result of a density independent
self-energy [W. Fennel and H. P. Wilfer, Ann. Phys. Lpz._32_, 265 (1974)]. The
derived expression will greatly facilitate the calculation of observables in
correlated plasmas (transport properties, equation of state) that need the
spectral function as an input quantity. This is demonstrated for the shift of
the chemical potential, which is computed from the analytical formulae and
compared to the GW0-result. At a plasma temperature of 100 eV and densities
below 10^21 cm^-3, both approaches deviate less than 10% from each other.
