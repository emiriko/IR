A recent chiral perturbation theory calculation of the in-medium quark
condensate $<\bar q q>$ is extended to the isospin-asymmetric case of pure
neutron matter. In contrast to the behavior in isospin-symmetric nuclear matter
we find only small deviations from the linear density approximation. This
feature originates primarily from the reduced weight factors (e.g. 1/6 for the
dominant contributions) of the $2\pi$-exchange mechanisms in pure neutron
matter. Our result suggests therefore that the tendencies for chiral symmetry
restoration are actually favored in systems with large neutron excess (e.g.
neutron stars). We also analyze the behavior of the density-dependent quark
condensate $<\bar q q>(\rho_n)$ in the chiral limit $m_\pi\to 0$.
