We present an approximate analytic expression for the photoluminescence
spectral function of a model polariton system, which describes a quantum dot,
with a finite number of fermionic levels, strongly interacting with the lowest
photon mode of a pillar microcavity. Energy eigenvalues and wavefunctions of
the electron-hole-photon system are obtained by numerically diagonalizing the
Hamiltonian. Pumping and photon losses through the cavity mirrors are described
with a master equation, which is solved in order to determine the stationary
density matrix. The photon first-order correlation function, from which the
spectral function is found, is computed with the help of the Quantum Regression
Theorem. The spectral function qualitatively describes the polariton lasing
regime in the model, corresponding to pumping rates two orders of magnitude
lower than those needed for ordinary (photon) lasing. The second-order
coherence functions for the photon and the electron-hole subsystems are
computed as functions of the pumping rate.
