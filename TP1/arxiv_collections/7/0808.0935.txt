The resulting stationary states and scattering properties of an effective
potential brought about by embedding a quantum well in another well are
investigated in this work. The composite well system is constructed via a
superposition of modified Poeschl - Teller potential wells. The energy spectrum
in each composite well is obtained using the shooting method and the transport
of a particle above this system is analyzed using the transfer matrix method.
It is shown that decreasing the size of the embedded middle well lowers the
ground state energy of the well-in-a-well system. Moreover, the bound states
increase in number and become more evenly spaced. In addition, the transmission
probability of a free particle incident above a composite well is lowest for
the system with a large embedded well as compared to well-in-a-well systems of
the same depth. Small variations in designed potential wells yield different
quantum mechanical features.
