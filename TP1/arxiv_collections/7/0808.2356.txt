This work reports on the novel Heusler superconductor ZrNi2Ga. Compared to
other nickel-based superconductors with Heusler structure, ZrNi2Ga exhibits a
relatively high superconducting transition temperature of Tc=2.9 K and an upper
critical field of 1.5 T. Electronic structure calculations show that this
relatively high transition temperature is caused by a van Hove singularity,
which leads to an enhanced density of states at the Fermi energy. The van Hove
singularity originates from a higher order valence instability at the L-point
in the electronic structure. The enhanced density of states at the Fermi level
was confirmed by specific heat and susceptibility measurements. Although many
Heusler compounds are ferromagnetic, our measurements of ZrNi2Ga indicate a
paramagnetic state above Tc and could not reveal any traces of magnetic order
down to temperatures of at least 0.35 K. We investigated in detail the
superconducting state with specific heat, magnetization, and resistivity
measurements. The resulting data show the typical behavior of a conventional,
weakly coupled BCS (s-wave) superconductor.
