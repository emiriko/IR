We study anomalous elasticity in the tubule phases of nematic and smectic
elastomer membranes, which are flat in one direction and crumpled in another.
These phases share the same macroscopic symmetry properties including
spontaneously-broken in-plane isotropy and hence belong to the same
universality class. Below an upper critical value $D_c =3$ of the membranes'
intrinsic dimension D, thermal fluctuations renormalize the elasticity with
respect to elastic displacements along the tubule axis so that elastic moduli
for compression along the tubule axis and for bending the tubule axis become
length-scale dependent. This anomalous elasticity belongs to the same
universality class as that of d-dimensional conventional smectics with D taking
on the role of d. For physical tubule, D=2, this anomaly is of power-law type
and thus might by easier to detect experimentally than the logarithmic anomaly
in conventional smectics.
