In some class of supersymmetric (SUSY) models, the neutral Wino becomes the
lightest superparticle and the Bino decays into the Wino and standard-model
particles. In such models, we show that the measurement of the Bino mass is
possible if the short charged tracks (with the length of O(10 cm)) can be
identified as a signal of the charged-Wino production. We pay particular
attention to the anomaly-mediated SUSY-breaking (AMSB) model with a generic
form of K\"ahler potential, in which only the gauginos are kinematically
accessible superparticles to the LHC, and discuss the implication of the Bino
mass measurement for the test of the AMSB model.
