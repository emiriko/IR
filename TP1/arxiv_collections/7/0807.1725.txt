Single-photon sources (SPSs) are mainly characterized by the minimum value of
their second-order coherence function, viz. their $g^{(2)}$ function. A precise
measurement of $g^{(2)}$ may, however, require high time-resolution devices, in
whose absence, only time-averaged measurements are accessible. These
time-averaged measures, standing alone, do not carry sufficient information for
proper characterization of SPSs. Here, we develop a theory, corroborated by an
experiment, that allows us to scrutinize the coherence properties of heralded
SPSs that rely on continuous-wave parametric down-conversion. Our proposed
measures and analysis enable proper standardization of such SPSs.
