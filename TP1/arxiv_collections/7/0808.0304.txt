We investigate the dynamical content of both hard- and soft-wall
approximations to holographic QCD by deriving the corresponding glueball
correlation functions and by confronting them with a variety of QCD results. We
further calculate the glueball decay constants in both holographic duals,
discuss emerging limitations and improvement strategies, and comment on a
recent attempt to generalize the glueball correlator in the soft-wall
background.
