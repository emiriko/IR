The results of low temperature thermoelectric power and the specific heat of
1T-VSe2 (Vanadium diselenide) have been reported along with the electrical
resistivity, and Hall coefficient of the compound. The Charge Density Wave
(CDW) transition is observed near 110K temperature in all these properties. The
Thermoelectric power has been measured from 15K to 300K spanning the
incommensurate and commensurate CDW regions. We observed a weak anomaly at the
CDW transition for the first time in the specific heat of VSe2. The linear
temperature dependence of resistivity and thermoelectric power at higher
temperatures suggests a normal metallic behavior and electron-phonon scattering
above the CDW transition. The positive thermoelectric power and negative Hall
coefficient along with strongly temperature dependent behavior in the CDW phase
suggest a mixed conduction related to the strongly hybridized s-p-d bands in
this compound.
