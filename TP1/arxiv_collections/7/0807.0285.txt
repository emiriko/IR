We study the quasi-one-dimensional limit of the spin-1/2 quantum Heisenberg
antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice. The lattice is divided into
antiferromagnetic spin-chains (exchange J) that are weakly coupled via
intermediate "dangling" spins (exchange J'). Using one-dimensional
bosonization, renormalization group methods, and current algebra techniques the
ground state is determined in the limit J'<<J. We find that the dangling spins
and chain spins form a spiral with O(1) and O(J'/J) static moments,
respectively, atop of which the chain spins exhibit a smaller O[(J'/J)^2]
antiferromagnetically ordered component along the axis perpendicular to the
spiral plane.
