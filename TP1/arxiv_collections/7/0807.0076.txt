In a recent paper, Michael J. Saxton proposes to interpret as anomalous
diffusion the occurrence of apparent transient sub-diffusive regimes in
mean-squared displacements (MSD) plots, calculated from experimental
trajectories of molecules diffusing in living cells, acquired by Single
Particle (or Molecule) Tracking techniques (SPT or SMT). In this Comment,
without questioning the existence of sub-diffusive behaviors, which certainly
play a key role in numbers of mechanisms in living systems, we point out that
the data used by J.M. Saxton can as well be fitted by a simple law, resulting
from confined diffusion at short times, with a slower free diffusion
superimposed at larger times. When visualizing MSD plots, the transition from
short-term diffusion confined in domains of size L, to slower, longer-term free
diffusion, can be confused with anomalous diffusion over several orders of
magnitude of time.
