In the case where the charge of the particle is small compared to its mass,
we describe the asymptotics of the Lorentz-Maxwell equation for any
finite-energy data. As time goes to infinity, we prove that the speed of the
particle converges to a certain limit, whereas the electromagnetic field can be
decomposed into a soliton plus a free solution of the Maxwell equation. It is
the first instance of a scattering result for general finite energy data in a
field-particle equation.
