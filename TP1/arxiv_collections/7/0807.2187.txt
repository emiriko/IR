We compute the Green's function for the Hodge Laplacian on the symmetric
spaces M\times\Sigma, where M is a simply connected n-dimensional Riemannian or
Lorentzian manifold of constant curvature and \Sigma is a simply connected
Riemannian surface of constant curvature. Our approach is based on a
generalization to the case of differential forms of the method of spherical
means and on the use of Riesz distributions on manifolds. The radial part of
the Green's function is governed by a fourth order analogue of the Heun
equation.
