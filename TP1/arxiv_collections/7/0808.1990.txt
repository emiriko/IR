In this paper we study the state determination for composite systems of two
spatial qubits. We show, theoretically, that one can use the technique of
quantum tomography to reconstruct the density matrixes of these systems. This
tomographic reconstruction is based on the free evolution of the spatial qubits
and a postelection process.
