We test the performance of a RG-improved kernel in the determination of the
amplitude of a physical process, the electroproduction of two light vector
mesons,in the BFKL approach at the next-to-leading approximation (NLA). We find
that a smooth behavior of the amplitude with the center-of-mass energy can be
achieved, setting the renormalization and energy scales appearing in the
subleading terms to values much closer to the kinematical scales of the process
than in approaches based on unimproved kernels.
