This paper proposes a novel chaotic reaction-diffusion model of cellular
tumor growth and metastasis. The model is based on the multiscale diffusion
cancer-invasion model (MDCM) and formulated by introducing strong nonlinear
coupling into the MDCM. The new model exhibits temporal chaotic behavior (which
resembles the classical Lorenz strange attractor) and yet retains all the
characteristics of the MDCM diffusion model. It mathematically describes both
the processes of carcinogenesis and metastasis, as well as the sensitive
dependence of cancer evolution on initial conditions and parameters. On the
basis of this chaotic tumor-growth model, a generic concept of carcinogenesis
and metastasis is formulated.
