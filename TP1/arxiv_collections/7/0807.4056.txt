With a Stark decelerator, beams of neutral polar molecules can be
accelerated, guided at a constant velocity, or decelerated. The effectiveness
of this process is determined by the 6D volume in phase space from which
molecules are accepted by the Stark decelerator. Couplings between the
longitudinal and transverse motion of the molecules in the decelerator can
reduce this acceptance. These couplings are nearly absent when the decelerator
operates such that only every third electric field stage is used for
deceleration, while extra transverse focusing is provided by the intermediate
stages. For many applications, the acceptance of a Stark decelerator in this
so-called $s=3$ mode significantly exceeds that of a decelerator in the
conventionally used ($s=1$) mode. This has been experimentally verified by
passing a beam of OH radicals through a 2.6 meter long Stark decelerator. The
experiments are in quantitative agreement with the results of trajectory
calculations, and can qualitatively be explained with a simple model for the 6D
acceptance. These results imply that the 6D acceptance of a Stark decelerator
in the $s=3$ mode of operation approaches the optimum value, i.e. the value
that is obtained when any couplings are neglected.
