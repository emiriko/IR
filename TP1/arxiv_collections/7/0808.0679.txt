Quantum cellular automata (QCA) are reviewed, including early and more recent
proposals. QCA are a generalization of (classical) cellular automata (CA) and
in particular of reversible CA. The latter are reviewed shortly. An overview is
given over early attempts by various authors to define one-dimensional QCA.
These turned out to have serious shortcomings which are discussed as well.
Various proposals subsequently put forward by a number of authors for a general
definition of one- and higher-dimensional QCA are reviewed and their properties
such as universality and reversibility are discussed.
