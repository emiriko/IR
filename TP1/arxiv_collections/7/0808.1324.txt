Recent years have seen an explosive research and development of
nanoplasmonics in the visible and near-infrared (near-ir) frequency regions.
One of the most fundamental effects in nanoplasmonics is nano-concentration of
optical energy. Plasmonic nanofocusing has been predicted and experimentally
achieved. It will be very beneficial for the fundamental science, engineering,
environmental, and defense applications to be able to nano-concentrate
terahertz radiation (frequency 1 - 10 THz or vacuum wavelength 300 - 30
microns). This will allow for the nanoscale spatial resolution for THz imaging
and introduce the THz spectroscopy on the nanoscale, taking full advantage of
the rich THz spectra and submicron to nanoscale structures of many engineering,
physical, and biological objects of wide interest: electronic components
(integrated circuits, etc.), bacteria, their spores, viruses, macromolecules,
carbon clusters and nanotubes, etc. In this Letter we establish the principal
limits for the nanoconcentration of the THz radiation in metal/dielectric
waveguides and determine their optimum shapes required for this
nanoconcentration We predict that the adiabatic compression of THz radiation
from the initial spot size of light wavelength to the final size of R = 100 -
250 nm can be achieved with the THz radiation intensity increased by a factor
of 10 to 250. This THz energy nanoconcentration will not only improve the
spatial resolution and increase the signal/noise ratio for the THz imaging and
spectroscopy, but in combination with the recently developed sources of
powerful THz pulses will allow the observation of nonlinear THz effects and a
carrying out a variety of nonlinear spectroscopies (such as two-dimensional
spectroscopy), which are highly informative.
