The general relativistic version is developed for Robertson's discussion of
the Poynting-Robertson effect that he based on special relativity and Newtonian
gravity for point radiation sources like stars. The general relativistic model
uses a test radiation field of photons in outward radial motion with zero
angular momentum in the equatorial plane of the exterior Schwarzschild or Kerr
spacetime.
