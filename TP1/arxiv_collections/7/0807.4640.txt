Following Ben-Artzi and LeFloch, we consider nonlinear hyperbolic
conservation laws posed on a Riemannian manifold, and we establish an L1-error
estimate for a class of finite volume schemes allowing for the approximation of
entropy solutions to the initial value problem. The error in the L1 norm is of
order h^(1/4) at most, where h represents the maximal diameter of elements in
the family of geodesic triangulations. The proof relies on a suitable
generalization of Cockburn, Coquel, and LeFloch's theory which was originally
developed in the Euclidian setting. We extent the arguments to curved
manifolds, by taking into account the effects to the geometry and overcoming
several new technical difficulties.
