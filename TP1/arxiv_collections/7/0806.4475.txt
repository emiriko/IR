We study Andreev reflection in graphene nanoribbon/superconductor hybrid
junctions. By using a tight-binding approach and the scattering formalism we
show that finite-size effects lead to notable differences with respect to the
bulk graphene case. At subgap voltages, conservation of pseudoparity, a quantum
number characterizing the ribbon states, yields either a suppression of Andreev
reflection when the ribbon has an even number of sites in the transverse
direction or perfect Andreev reflection when the ribbon has an odd number of
sites. In the former case the suppression of Andreev reflection induces an
insulating behavior even when the junction is biased; electron conduction can
however be restored by applying a gate voltage.
