We present an experimental investigation of the magnetic, electrical and
structural properties of Ga0.94Mn0.06As1-yPy layers grown by molecular beam
epitaxy on GaAs substrates for y less than or equal to 0.3. X-ray diffraction
measurements reveal that the layers are under tensile strain which gives rise
to a magnetic easy axis perpendicular to the plane of the layers. The strength
of the magnetic anisotropy and the coercive field increase as the phosphorous
concentration is increased. The resistivity of all samples shows metallic
behaviour with the resistivity increasing as y increases. These materials will
be useful for studies of micromagnetic phenomena requiring metallic
ferromagnetic material with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.
