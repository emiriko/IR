Ps ionization in Ps-atom scattering is of fundamental importance. The singly
differential cross sections (SDCS) provides more accurate information to test a
theory than integrated or total ionization cross section since the averaging
over one parameter is not required. We evaluate the SDCS for Ps-ionization with
respect to the longitudinal energy distribution of the break-up positron and
electron in Ps-H and Ps-He scattering and compare them with the recently
available experimental and theoretical data.
