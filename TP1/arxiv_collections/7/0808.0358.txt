A model for anomalous $J/\Psi$ suppression in high energy heavy ion
collisions is presented. As the additional suppression mechanism beyond
standard nuclear absorption inelastic $J/\Psi$ scattering with hadronic matter
is considered. Hadronic matter is modeled as an evolving multi-component gas of
point-like non-interacting particles (MCHG). Estimates for the sound velocity
of the MCHG are given and the equation of state is compared with Lattice QCD
data in the vicinity of the deconfinement phase transition. The approximate
cooling pattern caused by longitudinal expansion is presented. It is shown that
under these conditions the resulting $J/\Psi$ suppression pattern agrees well
with NA38 and NA50 data.
