We study a four-band model for the iron oxypnictides, in which the
superconducting properties are assumed to be determined by the interband
coupling between hole-like and electron-like Fermi sheets. We show that
reasonable parameters can account for the angle-resolved photoemission spectra
showing multiple gaps in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, and for the temperature
dependence of the superfluid density. At the same time, the zero-temperature
value of the superfluid density shows a conventional scaling with the number of
carriers.
