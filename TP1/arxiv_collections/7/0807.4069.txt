We are interested in the modeling of wave propagation in an infinite
bilayered acoustic/poroelastic media. We consider the biphasic Biot's model in
the poroelastic layer. The first part is devoted to the calculation of
analytical solution in two dimensions, thanks to Cagniard de Hoop method. In
this second part we consider the 3D case.
