We study the lensing properties of an asymmetric mass distribution and vector
field in Generalized Einstein-Aether (GEA) theory. As vector field fluctuations
are responsible in GEA for seeding baryonic structure formation, vector field
concentrations can exist independently of baryonic matter. Such concentrations
would not be expected to be tied to baryonic matter except gravitationally, and
so, like dark matter halos, would become separated from baryonic matter in
interacting systems such as the Bullet Cluster. These vector field
concentrations cause metric deviations that affect weak lensing. Therefore, the
distribution of weak lensing deviates from that which would be inferred from
the luminous mass distribution, in a way that numerical calculations
demonstrate can be consistent with observations. This suggests that
MOND-inspired theories can reproduce weak lensing observations, but makes clear
the price: the existence of a coherent large-scale fluctuation of a field(s)
weakly tied to the baryonic matter, not completely dissimilar to a dark matter
halo.
