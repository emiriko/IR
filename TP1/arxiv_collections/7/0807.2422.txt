We analyze the propagation of a pulse across a vacuum gap separating opposite
flat parallel faces of two transparent dielectrics by means of an explicitly
causal and retarded propagator constructed directly from the free-space wave
equation. Nevertheless, our approach yields apparently superluminal propagation
for the case of frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR), that is, a
transmitted wave packet appears on the far side of the gap at the same time
that the corresponding incident packet crosses the front one. Thus, in this
example superluminality is just an illusion, being consistent with both
casuality and classical electrodynamics. We study the origin of the apparent
superluminality in this case, which is inherent to light pulse propagation in
free space and does not depend on the particulars of light-matter interaction,
and find that it is due to propagation from the lateral wings of the incident
pulse to the central part of the transmitted pulse. Thus, notwithstanding their
similarities, FTIR is not equivalent to 1D tunneling. We propose experiments to
test our explanation of superluminality using opaque screens to block part of
the wavefront, although we demonstrate that the propagation of smooth finite
pulses constrained to be made up completely of evanescent Fourier components is
indistinguishable from truly superluminal propagation, i.e., it may be
completely accounted for using an explicitely superluminal and acausal
propagator as well as the causal subluminal one.
