The electronic properties of a bricklayer model, which shares the same
topology as the hexagonal lattice of graphene, are investigated numerically. We
study the influence of random magnetic-field disorder in addition to a strong
perpendicular magnetic field. We found a disorder-driven splitting of the
longitudinal conductance peak within the narrow lowest Landau band near the
Dirac point. The energy splitting follows a relation which is proportional to
the square root of the magnetic field and linear in the disorder strength. We
calculate the scale invariant peaks of the two-terminal conductance and obtain
the critical exponents as well as the multifractal properties of the chiral and
quantum Hall states. We found approximate values $\nu\approx 2.5$ for the
quantum Hall states, but $\nu=0.33\pm 0.1$ for the divergence of the
correlation length of the chiral state at E=0 in the presence of a strong
magnetic field. Within the central $n=0$ Landau band, the multifractal
properties of both the chiral and the split quantum Hall states are the same,
showing a parabolic $f[\alpha(s)]$ distribution with $\alpha(0)=2.27\pm 0.02$.
In the absence of the constant magnetic field, the chiral critical state is
determined by $\alpha(0)=2.14\pm 0.02$.
