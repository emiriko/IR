The use of complex analysis for computing one-loop scattering amplitudes is
naturally induced by generalised unitarity-cut conditions, fulfilled by complex
values of the loop variable. We report on two techniques: the cut-integration
with spinor-variables as contour integrals of rational functions; and the use
of the Discrete Fourier Transform to optimize the reduction of tensor-integrals
to master scalar integrals.
