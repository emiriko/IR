A constructive approach to theory of diffusion processes is proposed, which
is based on application of both the symmetry analysis and method of modelling
functions. An algorithm for construction of the modelling functions is
suggested. This algorithm is based on the error functions expansion (ERFEX) of
experimental concentration profiles. The high-accuracy analytical description
of the profiles provided by ERFEX approximation allows a convenient extraction
of the concentration dependence of diffusivity from experimental data and
prediction of the diffusion process. Our analysis is exemplified by its
employment to experimental results obtained for surface diffusion of lithium on
the molybdenum (112) surface pre-covered with dysprosium. The ERFEX
approximation can be directly extended to many other diffusion systems.
