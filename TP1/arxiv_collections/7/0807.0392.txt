Monte Carlo simulations of Ising models coupled to heat baths at two
different temperatures are used to study a fluctuation relation for the heat
exchanged between the two thermostats in a time $\tau$. Different kinetics
(single--spin--flip or spin--exchange Kawasaki dynamics), transition rates
(Glauber or Metropolis), and couplings between the system and the thermostats
have been considered. In every case the fluctuation relation is verified in the
large $\tau $ limit, both in the disordered and in the low temperature phase.
Finite-$\tau$ corrections are shown to obey a scaling behavior.
