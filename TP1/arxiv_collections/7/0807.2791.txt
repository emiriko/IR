We present a method devised by Jacobi to derive Lagrangians of any
second-order differential equation: it consists in finding a Jacobi Last
Multiplier. We illustrate the easiness and the power of Jacobi's method by
applying it to the same equation studied by Musielak et al. with their own
method [Musielak ZE, Roy D and Swift LD. Method to derive Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian for a nonlinear dynamical system with variable coefficients. Chaos,
Solitons & Fractals, 2008;58:894-902]. While they were able to find one
particular Lagrangian after lengthy calculations, Jacobi Last Multiplier method
yields two different Lagrangians (and many others), of which one is that found
by Musielak et al, and the other(s) is(are) quite new.
