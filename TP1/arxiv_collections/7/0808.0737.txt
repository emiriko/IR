Free electrons or holes can mediate the nonradiative recombination of
excitons in carbon nanotubes. Kinematic constraints arising from the quasi
one-dimensional nature of excitons and charge carriers lead to a thermal
activation barrier for the process. However, a model calculation suggests that
the rate for recombination mediated by a free electron is the same order of
magnitude as that of two-exciton recombination. Small amounts of doping may
contribute to the short exciton lifetimes and low quantum yields observed in
carbon nanotubes.
