We present the program BOKASUN for fast and precise evaluation of the Master
Integrals of the two-loop self-mass sunrise diagram for arbitrary values of the
internal masses and the external four-momentum. We use a combination of two
methods: a Bernoulli accelerated series expansion and a Runge-Kutta numerical
solution of a system of linear differential equations.
