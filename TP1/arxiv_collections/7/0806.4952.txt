We study the properties of a system consisting of an uncharged spherically
symmetric two dimensional extended object which encloses a stationary point
charge placed in the shell's center. We show that there can be a static and
stable configuration for the neutral shell, using only the gravitational field
of the charged source as a stabilizing mechanism. In particular, two types of
shells are studied: a dust shell and a string gas shell. The dynamical
possibilities are also analyzed, including the possibility of child universe
creation.
