The elastic and large-angle quasi-elastic scattering reactions were studied
with the same nucleus-nucleus potential proposed for describing fusion
reactions. The elastic scattering angle distributions of some reactions are
reasonably well reproduced by the proposed Woods-Saxon potential with fixed
parameters at energies much higher than the Coulomb barrier. With an empirical
barrier distribution based on the modified Woods-Saxon potential and taking
into account the influence of nucleons transfer, the calculated quasi-elastic
scattering cross sections of a series of reactions are in good agreement with
the experimental data.
