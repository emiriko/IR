We discuss metacognitive modelling as an enhancement to cognitive modelling
and computing. Metacognitive control mechanisms should enable AI systems to
self-reflect, reason about their actions, and to adapt to new situations. In
this respect, we propose implementation details of a knowledge taxonomy and an
augmented data mining life cycle which supports a live integration of obtained
models.
