We have recently shown that the output field in the Braunstein-Kimble
protocol of teleportation is a superposition of two fields: the input one and a
field created by Alice's measurement and by displacement of the state at Bob's
station by using the classical information provided by Alice. We study here the
noise added by teleportation and compare its influence in the Gaussian and
non-Gaussian settings.
