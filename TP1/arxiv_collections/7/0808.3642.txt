The ferrimagnetic spinel oxide Zn(x)Fe(3-x)O(4) combines high Curie
temperature and spin polarization with tunable electrical and magnetic
properties, making it a promising functional material for spintronic devices.
We have grown epitaxial thin films with 0<=x<=0.9 on MgO(001) substrates with
excellent structural properties both in pure Ar atmosphere and an Ar/O2 mixture
by laser molecular beam epitaxy. We find that the electrical conductivity and
the saturation magnetization can be tuned over a wide range during growth. Our
extensive characterization of the films provides a clear picture of the
underlying physics of this spinel ferrimagnet with antiparallel Fe moments on
the A and B sublattice: (i) Zn substitution removes both Fe3+ moments from the
A sublattice and itinerant charge carriers from the B sublattice, (ii) growth
in finite oxygen partial pressure generates Fe vacancies on the B sublattice
also removing itinerant charge carriers, and (iii) application of both Zn
substitution and excess oxygen results in a compensation effect as Zn
substitution partially removes the Fe vacancies. A decrease (increase) of
charge carrier density results in a weakening (strengthening) of double
exchange and thereby a decrease (increase) of conductivity and the saturation
magnetization. This scenario is confirmed by the observation that the
saturation magnetization scales with the longitudinal conductivity. The
combination of tailored films with semiconductor materials such as ZnO in
multi-functional heterostructures seems to be particularly appealing.
