The present paper reports interesting new features that wormhole solutions in
the scalar field gravity theory have. To demonstrate these, we obtain, by using
a slightly modified form of the Matos-Nunez algorithm, an extended class of
asymptotically flat wormhole solutions belonging to Einstein minimally coupled
scalar field theory. Generally, solutions in these theories do not represent
traversable wormholes due to the occurrence of curvature singularities.
However, the Ellis I solution of the Einstein minimally coupled theory, when
Wick rotated, yields Ellis class III solution, the latter representing a
singularity-free traversable wormhole. We see that Ellis I and III are not
essentially independent solutions. The Wick rotated seed solutions, extended by
the algorithm, contain two new parameters a and \delta;. The effect of the
parameter a on the geodesic motion of test particles reveals some remarkable
features. By arguing for Sagnac effect in the extended Wick rotated solution,
we find that the parameter a can indeed be interpreted as a rotation parameter
of the wormhole. The analyses reported here have wider applicability in that
they can very well be adopted in other theories, including in the string
theory.
