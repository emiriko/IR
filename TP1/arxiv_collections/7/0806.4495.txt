A new method based on the concept of probability distribution is proposed to
analyze the finite volume energy spectrum in lattice QCD. Using synthetic
lattice data, we demonstrate that for the channel with quantum numbers of the
Delta-resonance a clear resonance structure emerges in such an analysis.
Consequently, measuring the volume-dependence of the energy levels in lattice
QCD will allow to determine the mass and the width of the Delta with reasonable
accuracy.
