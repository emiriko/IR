We increase the efficiency of a recently proposed time integration scheme for
time dependent quantum transport by using the Lanczos method for time
evolution. We illustrate our modified scheme in terms of a simple one
dimensional model. Our results show that the Lanczos-adapted scheme gives a
large increase in numerical efficiency, and is an advantageous route for
numerical time integration in ab-initio treatment of open boundary quantum
transport phenomena.
