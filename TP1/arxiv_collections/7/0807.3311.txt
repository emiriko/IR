This talk will address how various experiments will address the following
issues: the $\nu_e$ flavor content of the 3rd neutrino mass eigenstates,
$\sin^2 \theta_{13}$, the mass ordering of the neutrinos, ${\rm sign}(\delta
m^2_{31})$ and whether CP is violated in the neutrino sector, $\sin \delta \neq
0$.
