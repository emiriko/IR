We present spectral calculations of nuclear matter properties including
three-body forces. Within the in-medium T-matrix approach, implemented with the
CD-Bonn and Nijmegen potentials plus the three-nucleon Urbana interaction, we
compute the energy per particle in symmetric and neutron matter. The three-body
forces are included via an effective density dependent two-body force in the
in-medium T-matrix equations. After fine tuning the parameters of the
three-body force to reproduce the phenomenological saturation point in
symmetric nuclear matter, we calculate the incompressibility and the energy per
particle in neutron matter. We find a soft equation of state in symmetric
nuclear matter but a relatively large value of the symmetry energy. We study
the the influence of the three-body forces on the single-particle properties.
For symmetric matter the spectral function is broadened at all momenta and all
densities, while an opposite effect is found for the case of neutrons only.
Noticeable modification of the spectral functions are realized only for
densities above the saturation density. The modifications of the self-energy
and the effective mass are not very large and appear to be strongly suppressed
above the Fermi momentum.
