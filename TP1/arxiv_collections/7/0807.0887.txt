Several users of our AS relationship inference data
(http://www.caida.org/data/active/as-relationships/), released with cs/0604017,
asked us why it contained AS relationship cycles, e.g., cases where AS A is a
provider of AS B, B is a provider of C, and C is a provider of A, or other
cycle types. Having been answering these questions in private communications,
we have eventually decided to write down our answers here for future reference.
