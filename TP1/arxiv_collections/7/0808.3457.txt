HBT correlations of $\pi^--\pi^-$ pairs at FAIR/AGS energies are investigated
by using the UrQMD transport model and the CRAB analyzing program. Three
different possible sources (treatment of resonance lifetimes, a soft equation
of state and non-Gaussian effects) to understand the HBT $R_O/R_S$ puzzle are
investigated. Firstly, we find that different treatments of the resonance decay
time can not resolve the HBT time-related puzzle, however it can modify the HBT
radii at low transverse momenta to some extent to explain the data slightly.
Secondly, with a soft equation of state with momentum dependence, the measured
transverse momentum dependent HBT radii and $R_O/R_S$ ratio can be described
fairly well. Thirdly, non-Gaussian effects are visible in the calculated
correlation function. Using the Edgeworth expansion, one finds that the
non-Gaussian effect is strongest in the longitudinal direction and weakest in
the sideward direction.
