We investigate the tail behaviour of the steady state distribution of a
stochastic recursion that generalises Lindley's recursion. This recursion
arises in queuing systems with dependent interarrival and service times, and
includes alternating service systems and carousel storage systems as special
cases. We obtain precise tail asymptotics in three qualitatively different
cases, and compare these with existing results for Lindley's recursion and for
alternating service systems.
