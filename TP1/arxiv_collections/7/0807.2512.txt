In particle physics, most of the classical models consider that the centre of
mass and centre of charge of an elementary particle, are the same point. This
presumes some particular relationship between the charge and mass distribution,
a feature which cannot be checked experimentally. In this paper we give three
different kinds of arguments suggesting that, if assumed different points, the
centre of charge of an elementary spinning particle moves in a helical motion
at the speed of light, and it thus satisfies, in general, a fourth order
differential equation. If assumed a kind of rigid body structure, it is
sufficient the description of the centre of charge to describe also the
evolution of the centre of mass and the rotation of the body. This assumption
of a separation betwen the centre of mass and centre of charge gives a
contribution to the spin of the system and also justifies the existence of a
magnetic moment produced by the relative motion of the centre of charge. This
corresponds to an improved model of a charged elementary particle, than the
point particle case. This means that a Lagrangian formalism for describing
elementary spinning particles has to depend, at least, up to the acceleration
of the position of the charge, to properly obtain fourth order dynamical
equations. This result is compared with the description of a classical Dirac
particle obtained from a general Lagrangian formalism for describing spinning
particles.
