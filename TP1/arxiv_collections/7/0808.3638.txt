The full counting statistics of a non adiabatic pure spin pump are calculated
with particular emphasis on the second and third moments. We show that
incoherence can change the sign of spin shot noise cross-correlations from
negative to positive, implying entanglement for spin-singlet electronic
sources, a truly counterintuitive result. The third moment on the other hand is
shown to be much more resilient to incoherence.
