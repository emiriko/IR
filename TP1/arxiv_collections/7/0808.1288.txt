In this paper we implement Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time path integral
formalism in non-equilibrium QCD to the definition of Collins-Soper
fragmentation function. We consider a high p_T parton in QCD medium at initial
time t_0 with arbitrary non-equilibrium (non-isotropic) distribution function
f(\vec{p}) fragmenting to hadron. We formulate parton to hadron fragmentation
function in non-equilibrium QCD in the light-cone quantization formalism. It
may be possible to include final state interactions with the medium via
modification of the Wilson lines in this definition of the non-equilibrium
fragmentation function. This may be relevant to study hadron production from
quark-gluon plasma at RHIC and LHC.
