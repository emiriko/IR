The nature of space-time and surrounding matter objects was and persists to
be a one of the most intriguing and challenging problems facing the mankind and
natural scientists especially. As we know one of the most brilliant inventions
in physics of XIX-th century was combining of electricity and magnetism within
the Faraday-Maxwell electromagnetism theory. This theory explained the main
physical laws of light propagation in space-time and posed new questions
concerning the nature of vacuum. Nonetheless, almost all attempts aiming to
unveil the real state of art of the vacuum problem appeared to be unsuccessful
in spite of new ideas suggested by Mach, Lorentz, Poincare, Einstein and some
others physicists. Moreover, the non-usual way of treating the space-time
devised by Einstein, in reality, favored to eclipsing both its nature and the
related physical vacuum origin problems \cite{Fe,Ga,Ma,TW,Ba,BP}, reducing them
to some physically unmotivated formal mathematical principles and recipes,
combined in the well known special relativity theory (SRT). The SRT appeared to
be adapted to the only inertial reference systems and faced with hard problems
of the electromagnetic Lorentz forces explanation and relationships between
inertial and gravity forces. The latter was artificially "dissolved" by means
of the well known "equivalence" principle owing to which the "inertial" mass of
a material object was postulated to coincide with its "gravity" mass.
  In work we try to unveil some nontrivial aspects of the real space-time and
vacuum origin problems to derive from the natural field theory principles all
of the well known Maxwell electromagnetism and relativity theories results, to
show their relative or only visible coincidence with real physical phenomena
and to feature new perspectives facing the modern fundamental physics.
