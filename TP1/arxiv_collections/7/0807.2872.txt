Some new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, like
Supersymmetry, Extra-dimensions etc., and their effect on the nature of
different standard model phenomena are explored in this thesis. We discuss the
power law scaling of the gauge, Yuakawa and quartic scalar couplings in the
Universal Extra-Dimensional scenario assuming compactification on an $S^1/Z_2$
orbifold. We get a low unification scale around 30 TeV for a radius $R \sim 1
TeV^{-1}$. We show that the effect of one (two) extra-dimension(s) will allow
to relax the upper limit on the mass of the lightest CP-even neutral Higgs in
the minimal supersymmetric standard model upto around 200 GeV (300 GeV). We
obtain a low intermediate scale $(M_R)$, a desirable feature to accommodate
leptogenesis, within minimal supersymmetric SO(10) Grand Unified Theory with
the help of any one of three options -- threshold corrections,
non-renormalizable operators or presence of additional light Higgs multiplets.
In the triplet Higgs scalar model irrespective of these corrections, from the
perturbitivity requirement, we find a lower bound $M_R > 10^9$ GeV. On the
other hand remaining in the standard quark model we estimate the pentaquark
mass after taking care of the colour-spin symmetry properties for the triquark
$(qq\bar q)$ state.
