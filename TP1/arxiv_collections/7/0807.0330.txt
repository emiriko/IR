Avalanche photodiodes are widely used as practical detectors of single
photons.1 Although conventional devices respond to one or more photons, they
cannot resolve the number in the incident pulse or short time interval.
However, such photon number resolving detectors are urgently needed for
applications in quantum computing,2-4 communications5 and interferometry,6 as
well as for extending the applicability of quantum detection generally. Here we
show that, contrary to current belief,3,4 avalanche photodiodes are capable of
detecting photon number, using a technique to measure very weak avalanches at
the early stage of their development. Under such conditions the output signal
from the avalanche photodiode is proportional to the number of photons in the
incident pulse. As a compact, mass-manufactured device, operating without
cryogens and at telecom wavelengths, it offers a practical solution for photon
number detection.
