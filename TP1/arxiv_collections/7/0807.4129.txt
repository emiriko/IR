Up to the moment there are two known algorithms of sector decomposition: an
original private algorithm of Binoth and Heinrich and an algorithm made public
lastyear by Bogner and Weinzierl. We present a new program performing the
sector decomposition and integrating the expression afterwards. The program
takes a set of propagators and a set of indices as input and returns the
epsilon-expansion of the corresponding integral.
