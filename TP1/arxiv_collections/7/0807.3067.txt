We propose a method of constructing cold atom analogs of the spintronic
device known as the Datta-Das transistor (DDT), which despite its seminal
conceptual role in spintronics, has never been successfully realized with
electrons. We propose two alternative schemes for an atomic DDT, both of which
are based on the experimental setup for tripod stimulated Raman adiabatic
passage. Both setups involve atomic beams incident on a series of laser fields
mimicking the relativistic spin orbit coupling for electrons that is the
operating mechanism of the DDT.
