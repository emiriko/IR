We use interlayer tunneling to study bilayer 2D electron systems at $\nu_T =
1$ over a wide range of charge density imbalance, $\Delta \nu =\nu_1-\nu_2$,
between the two layers. We find that the strongly enhanced tunneling associated
with the coherent excitonic $\nu_T = 1$ phase at small layer separation can
survive at least up to an imbalance of $\Delta \nu$ = 0.5, i.e $(\nu_1, \nu_2)$
= (3/4, 1/4). Phase transitions between the excitonic $\nu_T = 1$ state and
bilayer states which lack significant interlayer correlations can be induced in
three different ways: by increasing the effective interlayer spacing $d/\ell$,
the temperature $T$, or the charge imbalance, $\Delta \nu$. We observe that
close to the phase boundary the coherent $\nu_T = 1$ phase can be absent at
$\Delta \nu$ = 0, present at intermediate $\Delta \nu$, but then absent again
at large $\Delta \nu$, thus indicating an intricate phase competition between
it and incoherent quasi-independent layer states. At zero imbalance, the
critical $d/\ell$ shifts linearly with temperature, while at $\Delta \nu$ = 1/3
the critical $d/\ell$ is only weakly dependent on $T$. At $\Delta \nu$ = 1/3 we
report the first observation of a direct phase transition between the coherent
excitonic $\nu_T = 1$ bilayer integer quantum Hall phase and the pair of single
layer fractional quantized Hall states at $\nu_1$ = 2/3 and $\nu_2=1/3$.
