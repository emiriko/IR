The non-equilibrium process due to irreversible heat exchanges occurring
during a temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry experiment is
investigated in detail. This enables us to define an experimental frequency
dependent complex heat capacity from this calorimetric method. The physical
meaning of this dynamic heat capacity is discussed. A relationship is clearly
established between the imaginary part of this complex quantity and the net
entropy created during the experimental time-scale.
