We present a fully adaptive multiresolution scheme for spatially
one-dimensional quasilinear strongly degenerate parabolic equations with
zero-flux and periodic boundary conditions. The numerical scheme is based on a
finite volume discretization using the Engquist-Osher numerical flux and
explicit time stepping. An adaptive multiresolution scheme based on cell
averages is then used to speed up the CPU time and the memory requirements of
the underlying finite volume scheme, whose first-order version is known to
converge to an entropy solution of the problem. A particular feature of the
method is the storage of the multiresolution representation of the solution in
a graded tree, whose leaves are the non-uniform finite volumes on which the
numerical divergence is eventually evaluated. Moreover using the $L^1$
contraction of the discrete time evolution operator we derive the optimal
choice of the threshold in the adaptive multiresolution method. Numerical
examples illustrate the computational efficiency together with the convergence
properties.
