We outline a general mechanism for Orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT),
the coexistence of both itinerant and localized conduction electrons, and show
how it can take place in a wide range of realistic situations, even for bands
of identical width and correlation, provided a crystal field splits the energy
levels in manifolds with different degeneracies and the exchange coupling is
large enough to reduce orbital fluctuations. The mechanism relies on the
different kinetic energy in manifolds with different degeneracy. This phase has
Curie-Weiss susceptibility and non Fermi-liquid behavior, which disappear at a
critical doping, all of which is reminiscent of the physics of the pnictides.
