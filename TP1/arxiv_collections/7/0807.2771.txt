Based on the atomistic studies presented in Part I we develop analytical
yield criteria for single crystals that capture the effect of shear stresses
other than the Schmid stress (non-glide stresses) on the shear stress needed
for dislocation glide (Peierls stress). These yield criteria characterize a
non-associated plastic flow that originates owing to the complex response of
1/2<111> screw dislocations to an applied stress tensor. Employing these
criteria we identify the operative slip systems for tensile/compressive loading
along various axes within the standard stereographic triangle and determine the
ensuing tension-compression asymmetry. This result is in an excellent
qualitative agreement with available experimental data. Moreover, using the
constructed yield criteria within the Taylor homogenization procedure, we
demonstrate that effects associated with non-planar cores of screw dislocations
persist in random polycrystals. This affects significantly critical phenomena
such as shear localization, which is demonstrated by analyzing the cavitation
in a ductile plastic solid.
