We review hadron formation from a deconfined quark gluon plasma (QGP) via
coalescence or recombination of quarks and gluons. We discuss the abundant
experimental evidence for coalescence from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC) and compare the various coalescence models advocated in the literature.
We comment on the underlying assumptions and remaining challenges as well as
the merits of the models. We conclude with a discussion of some recent
developments in the field.
