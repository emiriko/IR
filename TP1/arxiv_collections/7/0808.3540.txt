We have extended the Falkon lightweight task execution framework to make
loosely coupled programming on petascale systems a practical and useful
programming model. This work studies and measures the performance factors
involved in applying this approach to enable the use of petascale systems by a
broader user community, and with greater ease. Our work enables the execution
of highly parallel computations composed of loosely coupled serial jobs with no
modifications to the respective applications. This approach allows a new-and
potentially far larger-class of applications to leverage petascale systems,
such as the IBM Blue Gene/P supercomputer. We present the challenges of I/O
performance encountered in making this model practical, and show results using
both microbenchmarks and real applications from two domains: economic energy
modeling and molecular dynamics. Our benchmarks show that we can scale up to
160K processor-cores with high efficiency, and can achieve sustained execution
rates of thousands of tasks per second.
