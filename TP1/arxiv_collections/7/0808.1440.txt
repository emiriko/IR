In this work, we report original properties inherent to independent particles
subjected to a magnetic field by emphasizing the existence of regular
structures in the energy spectrum's outline. We show that this fractal curve,
the well-known Hofstadter butterfly's outline, is associated to a specific
sequence of Chern numbers that correspond to the quantized transverse
conductivity. Indeed the topological invariant that characterizes the
fundamental energy band depicts successive stairways as the magnetic flux
varies. Moreover each stairway is shown to be labeled by another Chern number
which measures the charge transported under displacement of the periodic
potential. We put forward the universal character of these properties by
comparing the results obtained for the square and the honeycomb geometries.
