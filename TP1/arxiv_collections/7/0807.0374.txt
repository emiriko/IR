A method of reversible quantum optical data storage is presented using
resonant Raman field excited spin coherence, where the spin coherence is stored
in an inhomogeneously broadened spin ensemble. Unlike the photon echo method,
present technique uses a 2 pi Raman optical rephasing pulse, and multimode
(parallel) optical channels can be utilized, where the multimode access gives a
great benefit to both all-optical and quantum information processing.
