In this paper, we propose the MIML (Multi-Instance Multi-Label learning)
framework where an example is described by multiple instances and associated
with multiple class labels. Compared to traditional learning frameworks, the
MIML framework is more convenient and natural for representing complicated
objects which have multiple semantic meanings. To learn from MIML examples, we
propose the MimlBoost and MimlSvm algorithms based on a simple degeneration
strategy, and experiments show that solving problems involving complicated
objects with multiple semantic meanings in the MIML framework can lead to good
performance. Considering that the degeneration process may lose information, we
propose the D-MimlSvm algorithm which tackles MIML problems directly in a
regularization framework. Moreover, we show that even when we do not have
access to the real objects and thus cannot capture more information from real
objects by using the MIML representation, MIML is still useful. We propose the
InsDif and SubCod algorithms. InsDif works by transforming single-instances
into the MIML representation for learning, while SubCod works by transforming
single-label examples into the MIML representation for learning. Experiments
show that in some tasks they are able to achieve better performance than
learning the single-instances or single-label examples directly.
