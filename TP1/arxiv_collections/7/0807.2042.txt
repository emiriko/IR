We present a treatment of cold hydrogen-antihydrogen collisions based on the
asymptotic properties of atom-antiatom interactions. We derive general formulas
for the elastic and inelastic cross sections and for the scattering lengths and
analyze their sensitivity to the parameters characterizing the inelasticity of
the collision process. Given the inelasticity, we obtain bounds for the complex
scattering length. We investigate the influence of strong nuclear forces and
the isotope effects in $\bar{\rm H}{\rm H}$ and $\bar{\rm H}{\rm D}$ collisions
and demonstrate enhancement of these effects due to the presence of the
near-threshold narrow ${\rm H}\bar{\rm H}$ ($\bar{\rm H}{\rm D}$) states. The
values of the elastic and inelastic cross-sections with simultaneous account of
rearrangement and strong forces are presented. General expressions for the
(complex) energies of the near-threshold $\rm{H}\bar{\rm H}$ states are
obtained.
