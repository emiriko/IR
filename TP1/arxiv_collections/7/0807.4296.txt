The coherent tunneling spin current in the bilayer system with spin-orbit
coupling is investigated. Based on the continuity-like equations, we discuss
the definition of the tunneling current and show that the overlaps between
wavefunctions for different layers contribute to the tunneling current. We
study the linear response of the tunneling spin current to an in-plane electric
field in the presence of nonmagnetic impurities. The tunneling spin
conductivity we obtained presents a feature asymmetrical with respect to the
gate voltage when the strengthes of impurity potentials are different in each
layer.
