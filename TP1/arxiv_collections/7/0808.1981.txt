We investigate a planar heterostructure composed of two graphene films
separated by a narrow-gap semiconductor ribbon. We show that there is no the
Klein paradox when the Dirac points of the Brillouin zone of graphene are in a
band gap of a narrow-gap semiconductor. There is the energy range depending on
an angle of incidence, in which the above-barrier damped solution exists.
Therefore, this heterostructure is a "filter" transmitting particles in a
certain range of angles of incidence upon a potential barrier. We discuss the
possibility of an application of this heterostructure as a "switch".
