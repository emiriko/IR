In this paper the magnetic behaviour of SmFeAsO and SmFeAs(O0.85F0.15)
samples is presented and discussed. Molar susceptibility of SmFeAsO exhibits a
local peak at T around 140K due to the establishment of a long range
antiferromagnetic ordering of the Fe moments in Fe-As layers. This feature has
already been observed with different techniques, and frequently ascribed to the
onset of a Spin Density Wave (SDW). At TN around 6K another peak, which we
attribute to the establishment of antiferromagnetic ordering of Sm ion
sublattice, is observed. Furthermore, a temperature independent signal (Pauli
paramagnetism, Landau and core diamagnetism...) is also present in the magnetic
behaviour of this sample. In SmFeAs(O0.85F0.15) the antiferromagnetic ordering
in Fe-As plane is suppressed and superconductivity occurs at T = 52 K, whereas
the antiferromagnetic ordering of Sm ions at low temperature persists, leading
to the coexistence and competition between superconducting and magnetic
orderings. Above the transition temperature, after the subtraction of the Sm
ion sublattice paramagnetic contribution and of the temperature independent
contribution to the experimental susceptibility data, a Curie-Weiss behaviour
for Fe is observed, with a magnetic moment of 1.4 Bohr magneton.
