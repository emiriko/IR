We find the exact winding number distribution of Riemann-Liouville fractional
Brownian motion for large times in two dimensions using the propagator of a
free particle. The distribution is similar to the Brownian motion case and it
is of Cauchy type. In addition we find the winding number distribution of
fractal time process, i.e., time fractional Fokker-Planck equation, in the
presence of finite size winding center.
