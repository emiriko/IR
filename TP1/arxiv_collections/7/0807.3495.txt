We consider a dynamical model for a Fermi gas in the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid state, trapped in a combination of a
1D or 2D optical lattice (OL) and a tight parabolic potential acting in the
transverse direction(s). The model is based on an equation for the order
parameter (wave function), which is derived from the energy density for the
weakly coupled BCS superfluid. The equation includes a nonlinear self-repulsive
term of power 7/3, which accounts for the Fermi pressure. Reducing the equation
to the 1D or 2D form, we construct families of stable 1D and 2D gap solitons
(GSs) by means of numerical simulations, which are guided by the variational
approximation (VA). The GSs are, chiefly, compact objects trapped in a single
cell of the OL potential. In the linear limit, the VA predicts almost exact
positions of narrow Bloch bands that separate the semi-infinite and first
finite gaps, as well as the first and second finite ones. Families of stable
even and odd bound states of 1D GSs are constructed too. We also demonstrate
that the GS can be dragged without much distortion by an OL moving at a
moderate velocity ($\sim $ 1 mm/s, in physical units). The predicted GSs
contain $\sim 10^{3}-10^{4}$ and $\sim 10^{3}$ atoms per 1D and 2D settings,
respectively.
