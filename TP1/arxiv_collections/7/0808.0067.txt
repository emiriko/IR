The electronic density of states (DOS) of
La$_{0.625}$Ca$_{0.375}$MnO$_3$(LCMO) strain free epitaxial thin films with an
insulator-metal transition temperature (T$_{IM}$) of 250 K was probed using
variable temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We find a
depression in the DOS with a finite zero bias conductance (ZBC) signifying a
pseudogap (PG) in 78-310 K temperature range. With cooling, the ZBC is found to
increase indicating an increased DOS near E$_F$. We interpret PG as a signature
of Jahn-Teller polarons while ZBC change, in agreement with the bulk
insulator-metal transition, optical Drude peak, and photoemission experiments
indicates the presence of free carriers at the Fermi energy in the metallic
phase. The free carriers are discussed in terms of correlated polaronic states.
