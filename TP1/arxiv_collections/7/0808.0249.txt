We reconstruct quantum mechanics by introducing "information operators" and
excluding the concept of wave functions. Multiple information operators
simultaneously describe a single system and continuously develop in time even
in the process of a measurement. We also introduce the concept of condensation
for a system with many degrees of freedom in a rather general meaning. In terms
of the multiplicity of description and the condensation, we explain quantum
phenomena including measurements without the collapse of the wave function.
