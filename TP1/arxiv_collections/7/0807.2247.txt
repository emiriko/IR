We describe the effects of vacancies on the electronic properties of a
graphene sheet in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field: from a single
defect to an organized vacancy lattice. An isolated vacancy is the minimal
possible inner edge, showing an antidotlike behaviour, which results in an
extra level between consecutive Landau levels. Two close vacancies may couple
to each other, forming a vacancy molecule tuned by the magnetic field. We show
that a vacancy lattice introduce an extra band in between Landau levels with
localization properties that could lead to extra Hall resistance plateaus.
