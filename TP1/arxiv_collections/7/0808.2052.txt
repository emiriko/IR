Low-scale gaugino mediation predicts that gauginos are significantly heavier
than scalar superpartners. In order of increasing mass the lightest
superpartners are the gravitino, right-handed sleptons and left-handed sleptons
(no light neutralino!). This implies that squark decay chains pass through one
or more sleptons and typical final states from squark and gluino production at
the LHC include multiple leptons. In addition, left-handed staus have large
branching fractions into right-handed staus and the Higgs. As an example, we
compute the spectrum of low-scale deconstructed gaugino mediation. In this
model gauginos acquire masses at tree level at 5 TeV while scalar masses are
generated radiatively from the gaugino masses.
