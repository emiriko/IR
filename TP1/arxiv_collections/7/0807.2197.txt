We introduce a modified version of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes
equation, preserving energy and momentum of inertia, which is motivated by the
occurrence of different dissipation time scales and related to the gradient
flow structure of the 2-D Navier-Stokes equation. The hope is to understand
intermediate asymptotics. The analysis we present here is purely formal. A
rigorous study of this equation will be done in a forthcoming paper.
