The structure and modular properties of N=4 superconformal characters are
reviewed and exploited, in an attempt to construct elliptic genera-like
functions by decompactifying K3. The construction is tested against expressions
obtained in the context of strings propagating in background ALE spaces of type
A(n-1), using the underlying superconformal theory, i.e the tensor product of
N=2 minimal with N=2 Liouville theory.
