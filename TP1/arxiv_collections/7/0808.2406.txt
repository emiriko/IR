We study quantum teleportation via a two-qubit Heisenberg XXZ chain under an
inhomogeneous magnetic field. We first consider entanglement teleportation, and
then focus on the teleportation fidelity under different conditions. The
effects of anisotropy and the magnetic field, both uniform and inhomogeneous,
are discussed. We also find that, though entanglement teleportation does
require an entangled quantum channel, a nonzero critical value of minimum
entanglement is not always necessary.
