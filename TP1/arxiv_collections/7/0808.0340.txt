The paper sets forth comprehensive basics of Discrete Thermodynamics of
Chemical Equilibria (DTD), developed by the author during the last decade and
spread over series of publications. Based on the linear equations of
irreversible thermodynamics, De Donder's definition of the thermodynamic force,
and the Le Chatelier principle, DTD brings forward a notion of chemical
equilibrium as a balance of internal and external thermodynamic forces, acting
against a chemical system. The basic expression of DTD is a logistic map that
ties together energetic characteristics of the chemical transformation in the
system, its deviation from true thermodynamic equilibrium, and the sum of
thermodynamic forces, causing that deviation. System deviation from
thermodynamic equilibrium is the major variable of the theory. Solutions to the
basic map define the chemical system domain of states comprising bifurcation
diagrams with four areas, from true thermodynamic equilibrium to chaos, having
specific distinctive meaning for chemical systems. The theory is derived from
the currently recognized ideas of chemical thermodynamics and binds classical
and contemporary thermodynamics of chemical equilibria into a unique concept.
DTD opens new opportunities in understanding and analysis of equilibria in
chemical systems. Some new results, included in the paper, have never been
published before.
