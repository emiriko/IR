Recent rate measurements of B_s mesons and Lambda_b baryons produced in
sqrt{s} = 1.96 TeV proton-antiproton and Upsilon(5S) electron-positron
collisions are reviewed, including the first observations of six new decay
modes: B_s -> D_s^+ K^- (CDF), B_s -> D_s^- D_s^+ (CDF), B_s -> D_{s1}^-(2536)
mu^+ nu_mu X (DZero), B_s -> phi gamma (Belle), Lambda_b -> p pi^- (CDF), and
Lambda_b -> p K^- (CDF). Also examined are branching-fraction measurements or
limits for the B_s -> D_s^{(*)} D_s^{(*)} modes (Belle, CDF, and DZero), the
B_s -> gamma gamma radiative penguin decay (Belle), and three two-body
charmless B_s meson decay channels (CDF). Implications for the phenomenology of
electroweak and QCD physics, as well as searches for physics beyond the
Standard Model, are identified where applicable.
