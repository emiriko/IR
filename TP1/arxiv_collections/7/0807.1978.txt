We report the results of a set of simulations of small arrays of submicron
ferromagnetic particles. The actions of dipolar and exchange interactions were
qualitatively investigated by analysing the ferromagnetic resonance spectra at
9.37 GHz resulting from the magnetization response of con- nected and
unconnected particles in the array as a function of the applied dc magnetic
field. We find that the magnetization precession movement (at resonance)
observed in individual particles in the array presents a distinctive behaviour
(an amplitude mismatch) in comparison to isolated, one-particle reference
simulations, a result that we attribute to the action of interparticle dipolar
couplings. Exchange interactions appear to have an important role in modifying
the spectra of connected particles, even through a small contact surface.
