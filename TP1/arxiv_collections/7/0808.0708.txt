We have studied the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in
LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ and Ca(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$. While
antiferromagnetic spin density wave formation is suppressed and
superconductivity evolves, all samples show a doping independent strong
increase of the normal state susceptibility upon heating which appears a
general feature of iron pnictides. The data provide evidence for robust local
antiferromagnetic correlations persisting even in the superconducting regime of
the phase diagram.
