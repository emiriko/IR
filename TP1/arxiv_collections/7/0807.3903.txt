We present a local convergence analysis of inexact Newton-like methods for
solving nonlinear equations under majorant conditions. This analysis provides
an estimate of the convergence radius and a clear relationship between the
majorant function, which relaxes the Lipschitz continuity of the derivative,
and the nonlinear operator under consideration. It also allow us to obtain some
important special cases
