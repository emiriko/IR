On experimental side, BaFe$_2$As$_2$ without doping has been made
superconducting by applying appropriate pressure (2-6 GPa). Here, we use a
full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method within the
density-functional theory to investigate the effect of pressure on its crystal
structure, magnetic order, and electronic structure. Our calculations show that
the striped antiferromagnetic order observed in experiment is stable against
pressure up to 13 GPa. Calculated antiferromagnetic lattice parameters are in
good agreements with experimental data, while calculations with nonmagnetic
state underestimate Fe-As bond length and c-axis lattice constant. The effects
of pressure on crystal structure and electronic structure are investigated for
both the antiferromagnetic state and the nonmagnetic one. We find that the
compressibility of the antiferromagnetic state is quite isotropic up to about
6.4 GPa. With increasing pressure, the FeAs$_4$ tetrahedra is hardly distorted.
We observe a transition of Fermi surface topology in the striped
antiferromagnetic state when the compression of volume is beyond 8% (or
pressure 6 GPa), which corresponds to a large change of $c/a$ ratio. These
first-principles results should be useful to understanding the
antiferromagnetism and electronic states in the FeAs-based materials, and may
have some useful implications to the superconductivity.
