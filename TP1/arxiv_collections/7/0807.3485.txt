In this paper the results obtained by Minic and his colleagues on the
uncertainty relation of the pair "cosmological constant - volume of
space-time", where cosmological constant is a dynamical quantity, are
reconsidered and generalized proceeding from a more natural viewpoint. It is
demonstrated that on the basis of simple and natural assumptions this relation
may be understood with the help of the uncertainty relation for the pair
"energy - time". Since the latter is generalized at Planck's scales (Early
Universe)- GUP, the first one may be generalized in a similar way. This means
that we can suggest GUP for the pair "cosmological constant - space-time
volume". Here the relation is derived in the explicit form, and also some
implications are considered.
