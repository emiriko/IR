We study the dynamics of a phantom scalar field dark energy interacting with
dark matter in loop quantum cosmology (LQC). Two kinds of coupling of the form
$\alpha{\rho_m}{\dot\phi}$ (case I) and $3\beta H (\rho_\phi +\rho_m)$ (case
II) between the phantom energy and dark matter are examined with the potential
for the phantom field taken to be exponential. For both kinds of interactions,
we find that the future singularity appearing in the standard FRW cosmology can
be avoided by loop quantum gravity effects. In case II, if the phantom field is
initially rolling down the potential, the loop quantum effect has no influence
on the cosmic late time evolution and the universe will accelerate forever with
a constant energy ratio between the dark energy and dark matter.
