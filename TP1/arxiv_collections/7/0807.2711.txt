We show a mechanism that projects a pair of neutral two-level atoms from an
initially uncorrelated state to a maximally entangled state while they remain
spacelike separated. The atoms begin both excited in a common electromagnetic
vacuum, and the radiation is collected with a partial Bell-state analyzer. If
the interaction time is short enough and a certain two-photon Bell state is
detected after the interaction, a high degree of entanglement, even maximal,
can be generated while one atom is outside the light cone of the other, for
arbitrary large interatomic distances.
