We review the sources and phenomenology of non-minimal flavour violation in
the MSSM. We discuss in some detail the most important theoretical and
experimental constraints, as well as promising observables to look for
supersymmetric effects at the LHC and in the future. We emphasize the
sensitivity of flavour physics to the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking and
to new degrees of freedom present at fundamental scales, such as the grand
unification scale. We include a discussion of present data that may hint at
departures from the Standard Model.
