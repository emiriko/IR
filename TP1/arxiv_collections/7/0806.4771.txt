We consider the internal diffusion limited aggregation (IDLA) process on the
infinite cluster in supercritical Bernoulli bond percolation on Euclidean
lattices. It is shown that the process on the cluster behaves like it does on
the Euclidean lattice, in that the aggregate covers all the vertices in a
Euclidean ball around the origin, such that the ratio of vertices in this ball
to the total number of particles sent out approaches one almost surely.
