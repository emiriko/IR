We present a mathematical approach that simplifies the theoretical treatment
of electromagnetic localization in random media and leads to closed form
analytical solutions. Starting with the assumption that the dielectric
permittivity of the medium has delta-correlated spatial fluctuations, and using
the Ito lemma, we derive a linear stochastic differential equation for a one
dimensional random medium. The equation leads to localized wave solutions. The
localized wave solutions have a localization length that scales inversely with
the square of the frequency of the wave in the low frequency regime, whereas in
the high frequency regime, this length varies inversely with the frequency to
the power of two thirds.
