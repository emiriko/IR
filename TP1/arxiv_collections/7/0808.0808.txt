These proceedings present a brief overview of the main results on
jet-modifications in heavy ion collisions at RHIC. In heavy ion collisions,
jets are studied using single hadron spectra and di-hadron correlations with a
high-\pt{} trigger hadrons. At high pt, a suppression of the yields due to
parton energy loss is observed. A quantitative confrontation of the data with
various theoretical approaches to energy loss in a dense QCD medium is being
pursued. First results from $\gamma$-jet events, where the photon balances the
initial jet energy, are also presented and compared to expectations from models
based on di-hadron measurements. At intermediate pt, two striking modifications
of the di-hadron correlation structure are found in heavy ion collisions: the
presence of a long-range {\it ridge} structure in \deta{}, and a large
broadening of the recoil jet. Both phenomena seem to indicate an interplay
between hard and soft physics.
