We investigate O'Raifeartaigh-type models for F-term supersymmetry breaking
in gauge mediation scenarios in the presence of gravity. It is pointed out that
the vacuum structure of those models is such that in metastable vacua gravity
mediation contribution to scalar masses is always suppressed to the level below
1 percent, almost sufficient for avoiding FCNC problem. Close to that limit,
gravitino mass can be in the range 10-100 GeV, opening several interesting
possibilities for gauge mediation models, including Giudice-Masiero mechanism
for mu and Bmu generation. Gravity sector can include stabilized moduli.
