We simulate a relaxation process of non-brownian particles in a sheared
viscous medium; the small shear strain is initially applied to a system, which
then undergoes relaxation. The relaxation time and the correlation length are
estimated as functions of density, which algebraically diverge at the jamming
density. This implies that the relaxation time can be scaled by the correlation
length using the dynamic critical exponent, which is estimated as 4.6(2). It is
also found that shear stress undergoes power-law decay at the jamming density,
which is reminiscent of critical slowing down.
