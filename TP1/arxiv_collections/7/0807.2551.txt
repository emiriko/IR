The dynamics of a cascaded system that consists of two atom-cavity subsystems
is studied by using the quantum trajectory method. Considering the two
atom-cavity subsystems driven by a Raman interaction, analytical solutions are
obtained. Subsequently, the entanglement evolution between the two atoms is
studied, and it is shown that the entanglement can be stored by switching off
the Raman coupling. By monitoring the radiation field, the entanglement between
the two atoms can be enhanced.
