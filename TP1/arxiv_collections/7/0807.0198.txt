This contribution describes the HOPPET Fortran~95 package for carrying out
DGLAP evolution and other common manipulations of PDFs. The PDFs are
represented on a grid in $x$-space so as to avoid limitations on the functional
form of input distributions. Good speed and accuracy are obtained through the
representation of splitting functions in terms of their convolution with a set
of piecewise polynomial basis functions. We briefly describe the structure of
the code and discuss its quantitative performance. Finally we comment of future
directions for the program's development.
