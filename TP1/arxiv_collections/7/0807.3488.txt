We present a construction of the pion electromagnetic form factor where the
transition from large-Nc Regge vector meson dominance models with infinitely
many resonances to perturbative QCD is built in explicitly. The construction is
based on an appropriate assignment of residues to the Regge poles, which
fulfills the constraints of the parton-hadron duality and perturbative QCD. The
model contains a slowly falling off non-perturbative contribution which
dominates over the perturbative QCD radiative corrections for the
experimentally accessible momenta. The leading order and next-to-leading order
calculations show a converging pattern which describes the available data
within uncertainties, while the onset of asymptotic QCD takes place at
extremely high momenta, Q ~ 10^3-10^4 GeV. The method can be straightforwardly
extended to study other form factors where the perturbative QCD result is
available.
