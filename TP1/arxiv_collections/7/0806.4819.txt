The gyrokinetic description of particle dynamics faces a basic difficulty
when a special type of canonical variables is sought, i.e., the so-called
\textit{gyrokinetic canonical variables}. These are defined in such a way that
two of them are respectively identified with the gyrophase-angle, describing
the fast particle gyration motion around magnetic field lines, and its
canonically conjugate momentum. In this paper we intend to discuss the
conditions of existence for these variables.
