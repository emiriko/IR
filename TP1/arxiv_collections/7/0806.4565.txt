We generalize the well known formulation of the susceptibles, infected,
susceptibles (SIS) spatial epidemics with creation and annihilation operators
to the reinfection model including recovered which can be reinfected, the SIRI
model, using ladder operators constructed from the Gell-Mann matrices known in
quantum chromodynamics.
