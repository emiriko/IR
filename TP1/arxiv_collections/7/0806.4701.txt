In this paper we present a survey of the use of differential geometric
formalisms to describe Quantum Mechanics. We analyze Schr\"odinger framework
from this perspective and provide a description of the Weyl-Wigner
construction. Finally, after reviewing the basics of the geometric formulation
of quantum mechanics, we apply the methods presented to the most interesting
cases of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces: those of two, three and four level
systems (one qubit, one qutrit and two qubit systems). As a more practical
application, we discuss the advantages that the geometric formulation of
quantum mechanics can provide us with in the study of situations as the
functional independence of entanglement witnesses.
