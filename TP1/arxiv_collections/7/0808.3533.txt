In this paper we give a direct proof of the Ponzano-Regge asymptotic formula
for the Wigner 6j symbol starting from Racah's single sum formula. Our method
treats halfinteger and integer spins on the same footing. The generalization to
Minkowskian tetrahedra is direct. This result should be relevant for the
introduction of renormalization scales in spin foam models.
