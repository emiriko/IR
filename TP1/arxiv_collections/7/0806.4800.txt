Closed string field theory is constructed by stochastically quantizing a
matrix model for Polyakov loops that describes phases of a large N gauge theory
at finite temperature. Coherent states in this string field theory describes
winding string condensation which has been expected to cause a topology change
from thermal AdS geometry to AdS-Schwarzschild black hole geometry. D-branes in
this closed string field theory is also discussed. Slightly extended version of
a talk given at CosPA 2007, Nov.13-15, Taipei, Taiwan.
