A non-perturbative formalism is developed that simplifies the understanding
of self-forces and self-torques acting on extended scalar charges in curved
spacetimes. Laws of motion are locally derived using momenta generated by a set
of generalized Killing fields. Self-interactions that may be interpreted as
arising from the details of a body's internal structure are shown to have very
simple geometric and physical interpretations. Certain modifications to the
usual definition for a center-of-mass are identified that significantly
simplify the motions of charges with strong self-fields. A derivation is also
provided for a generalized form of the Detweiler-Whiting axiom that pointlike
charges should react only to the so-called regular component of their
self-field. Standard results are shown to be recovered for sufficiently small
charge distributions.
