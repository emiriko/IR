A recent Comment [arXiv:0806.2142] has argued that "there is a simple duality
between A-site and B-site" R3c ABO$_3$ materials and that our Letter [PRL 100,
167203 (2208)] "breaks this duality by ignoring a non-polar distortion that is
directly measured in crystallography." Here we point out that this is not
correct. The Comment contains three elementary crystallographic errors. In this
response we address each error in some detail.
