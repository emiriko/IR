We have developped a fitting code based on the leading-twist handbag Deep
Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) amplitude in order to extract the Generalized
Parton Distributions (GPD) information from DVCS observables in the valence
region. In a first stage, with simulations and pseudo-data, we show that the
full GPD information can be recovered from experimental data if enough
observables are measured. If only part of these observables are measured,
valuable information can still be extracted, certain observables being
particularly sensitive to certain GPDs. In a second stage, we make a practical
application of this code to the recent DVCS Jefferson Lab Hall A data from
which we can extract numerical constraints for the two $H$ GPD Compton Form
Factors.
