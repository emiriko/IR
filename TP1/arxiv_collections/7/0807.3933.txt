The development of many highly dynamic environments, like pervasive
environments, introduces the possibility to use geographically close-related
services. Dynamically integrating and unintegrating these services in running
applications is a key challenge for this use. In this article, we classify
service integration issues according to interfaces exported by services and
internal combining techniques. We also propose a contextual integration
service, IntegServ, and an interface, Integrable, for developing services.
