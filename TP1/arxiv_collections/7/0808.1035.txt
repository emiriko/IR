The simple quantum gravity model, based on a new conjecture within the
canonically quantized 3+1 general relativity, is presented. The conjecture
states that matter fields are functionals of an embedding volume form only, and
reduces the quantum geometrodynamics. By dimensional reduction the resulting
theory is presented in the form of the Dirac equation, and application of the
Fock quantization with the diagonalization procedure yields construction of the
appropriate quantum field theory. The 1D wave function is derived, the
corresponding 3-dimensional manifolds are discussed, and physical scales are
associated with quantum correlations.
