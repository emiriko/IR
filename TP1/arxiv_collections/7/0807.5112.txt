A non-supersymmetric grand unified theory can exhibit a "radiative fermion
mass hierarchy", in which the heavier quarks and leptons get mass at tree level
and the lighter ones get mass from loop diagrams. Recently the first predictive
model of this type was proposed. Here it is analyzed numerically and it is
shown to give an excellent fit to the quark and lepton masses and mixings,
including the CP phase violating phase $\delta_{CKM}$. A relation between the
neutrino angle $\theta_{13}$ and the atmospheric neutrino angle is obtained
