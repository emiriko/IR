Transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions can be introduced
gauge-invariantly in QCD from high-energy factorization. We discuss Monte Carlo
applications of these distributions to parton showers and jet physics, with a
view to the implications for the Monte Carlo description of complex hadronic
final states with multiple hard scales at the LHC.
