Understanding the melting of short DNA sequences probes DNA at the scale of
the genetic code and raises questions which are very different from those posed
by very long sequences, which have been extensively studied. We investigate
this problem by combining experiments and theory. A new experimental method
allows us to make a mapping of the opening of the guanines along the sequence
as a function of temperature. The results indicate that non-local effects may
be important in DNA because an AT-rich region is able to influence the opening
of a base pair which is about 10 base pairs away. An earlier mesoscopic model
of DNA is modified to correctly describe the time scales associated to the
opening of individual base pairs well below melting, and to properly take into
account the sequence. Using this model to analyze some characteristic sequences
for which detailed experimental data on the melting is available [Montrichok et
al. 2003 Europhys. Lett. {\bf 62} 452], we show that we have to introduce
non-local effects of AT-rich regions to get acceptable results. This brings a
second indication that the influence of these highly fluctuating regions of DNA
on their neighborhood can extend to some distance.
