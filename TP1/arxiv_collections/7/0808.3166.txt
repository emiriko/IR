The privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) has been one of the most
interesting, yet challenging, research issues. In the PPDM, we seek to
outsource our data for data mining tasks to a third party while maintaining its
privacy. In this paper, we revise one of the recent PPDM schemes (i.e., FS)
which is designed for privacy preserving association rule mining (PP-ARM). Our
analysis shows some limitations of the FS scheme in term of its storage
requirements guaranteeing a reasonable privacy standard and the high
computation as well. On the other hand, we introduce a robust definition of
privacy that considers the average case privacy and motivates the study of a
weakness in the structure of FS (i.e., fake transactions filtering). In order
to overcome this limit, we introduce a hybrid scheme that considers both
privacy and resources guidelines. Experimental results show the efficiency of
our proposed scheme over the previously introduced one and opens directions for
further development.
