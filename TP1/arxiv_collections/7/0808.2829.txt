We study the Braunstein-Kimble protocol for the continuous variable
teleportation of a coherent state. We determine lower and upper bounds for the
optimal fidelity of teleportation, maximized over all local Gaussian operations
for a given entanglement of the two-mode Gaussian state shared by the sender
(Alice) and the receiver (Bob). We also determine the optimal local
transformations at Alice and Bob sites and the corresponding maximum fidelity
when one restricts to local trace-preserving Gaussian completely positive maps.
