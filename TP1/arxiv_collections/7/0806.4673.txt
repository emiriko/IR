I review our recent attempts toward obtaining the MSSM from string orbifold
compactification. The required constraints are the existence of three families
and R parity, vectorlike exotics, one pair of Higgs doublets, and the SU(5)$'$
hidden sector for dynamical breaking of SUSY toward a GMSB scenario. We also
comment on the threshold correction which are influenced by a power law
evolution of gauge couplings through the KK radius in non-prime orbifolds and
can be used to fit the couplings.
