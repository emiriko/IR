Recent experiments of Groeblacher et al. proved the violation of a
Leggett-type inequality that was claimed to be valid for a broad class of
non-local hidden-variable theories. The impossibility of constructing a
non-local and realistic theory, unless it entails highly counterintuitive
features, seems thus to have been experimentally proved. This would bring us
close to a definite refutation of realism. Indeed, realism was proved to be
also incompatible with locality, according to a series of experiments testing
Bell inequalities. The present paper addresses the said experiments of
Groeblacher et al. and presents an explicit, contextual and realistic, model
that reproduces the predictions of quantum mechanics. It thus violates the
Leggett-type inequality that was established with the aim of ruling out a
supposedly broad class of non-local models. We can thus conclude that plausible
contextual, realistic, models are still tenable. This restates the possibility
of a future completion of quantum mechanics by a realistic and contextual
theory which is not in a class containing only highly counterintuitive models.
The class that was ruled out by the experiments of Groeblacher et al. is thus
proved to be a limited one, arbitrarily separating models that physically
belong in the same class.
