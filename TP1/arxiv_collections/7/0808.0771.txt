We briefly review the progress and problems in the electromagnetic production
of KLambda on the nucleon. The problem of the data discrepancy in this channel
as well as the corresponding physics consequence are highlighted. We also
discuss the effect of the new beam-recoil polarization data Cx and Cz on our
analysis. For this purpose we use the isobar model Kaon-Maid and a recent
multipoles model that can describe recent experimental data. We also present a
new multipoles model for the KSigma channels to complete our analysis.
