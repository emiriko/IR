Using three-pulse four-wave-mixing femtosecond spectroscopy, we excite a
non-radiative coherence between the discrete Landau levels of an undoped
quantum well and study its dynamics. We observe quantum beats that reflect the
time evolution of the coherence between the two lowest Landau level
magnetoexcitons. We interpret our observations using a many-body theory and
find that the inter Landau level coherence decays with a new time constant,
substantially longer than the corresponding interband magnetoexciton dephasing
times. Our results indicate a new intraband excitation dynamics that cannot be
described in terms of uncorrelated interband excitations.
