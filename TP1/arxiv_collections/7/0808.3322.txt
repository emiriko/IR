Here we are starting the study of the field equations of relativistic scalar
tensor theories in the spherically symmetric gravitational field. In the
present article we shall consider as an example only the simplest
Jordan-Brans-Dicke (JBD) one. To illustrate the property of the spherically
symmetric JBD configuration we exhibit a new representation of the well-known
four dimensional solutions. In this model, a suitable segment of Brans solution
is chosen for the interior of the object while the outer region consists of a
Schwarzschild vacuum. We have constructed "Jordan's scalar stars" model
consisting of three parts: a homogeneous inner core with linear equation of
state; an envelope of Brans spacetime matching the core and the exterior
Schwarzschild spacetime. We have also showed that this toy model can explain
the intergalactic effects without the dark matter hypothesis.
