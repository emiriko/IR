We construct an explicit isomorphism between blocks of cyclotomic Hecke
algebras and (sign-modified) Khovanov-Lauda algebras in type A. These
isomorphisms connect the categorification conjecture of Khovanov and Lauda to
Ariki's categorification theorem. The Khovanov-Lauda algebras are naturally
graded, which allows us to exhibit a non-trivial Z-grading on blocks of
cyclotomic Hecke algebras, including symmetric groups in positive
characteristic.
