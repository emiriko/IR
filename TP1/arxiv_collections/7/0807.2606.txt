Electronic waveguides in graphene formed by counterpropagating snake states
in suitable inhomogeneous magnetic fields are shown to constitute a realization
of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. Due to the spatial separation of the right- and
left-moving snake states, this non-Fermi liquid state induced by
electron-electron interactions is essentially unaffected by disorder. We
calculate the interaction parameters accounting for the absence of Galilei
invariance in this system, and thereby demonstrate that non-Fermi liquid
effects are significant and tunable in realistic geometries.
