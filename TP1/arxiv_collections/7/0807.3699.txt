A representation of finite fields that has proved useful when implementing
finite field arithmetic in hardware is based on an isomorphism between subrings
and fields. In this paper, we present an unified formulation for multiplication
in cyclotomic rings and cyclotomic fields in that most arithmetic operations
are done on vectors. From this formulation we can generate optimized algorithms
for multiplication. For example, one of the proposed algorithms requires
approximately half the number of coordinate-level multiplications at the
expense of extra coordinate-level additions. Our method is then applied to the
finite fields GF(q^m) to further reduce the number of operations. We then
present optimized algorithms for multiplication in finite fields with type-I
and type-II optimal normal bases.
