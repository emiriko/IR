We discuss flavour dependent lepton asymmetries in the Exceptional
Supersymmetric Standard Model (E$_6$SSM). In the E$_6$SSM, the right-handed
neutrinos do not participate in gauge interactions, and they decay into leptons
and leptoquarks. Their Majorana nature allows violation of lepton number. New
particles and interactions can result in substantial lepton asymmetries, even
for scales as low as $10^6 {\rm GeV}$.
