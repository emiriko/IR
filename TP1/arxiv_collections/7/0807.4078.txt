Ex-situ Powder-In-Tube MgB2 tapes prepared with ball-milled, undoped powders
showed a strong enhancement of the irreversibility field H*, the upper critical
field Hc2 and the critical current density Jc(H) together with the suppression
of the anisotropy of all of these quantities. Jc reached 104 A/cm2 at 4.2 K and
10 T, with an irreversibility field of about 14 T at 4.2 K, and Hc2 of 9 T at
25 K, high values for not-doped MgB2. The enhanced Jc and H* values are
associated with significant grain refinement produced by milling of the MgB2
powder, which enhances grain boundary pinning, although at the same time also
reducing the connectivity from about 12% to 8%. Although enhanced pinning and
diminished connectivity are in opposition, the overall influence of ball
milling on Jc is positive because the increased density of grains with a size
comparable with the mean free path produces strong electron scattering that
substantially increases Hc2, especially Hc2 perpendicular to the Mg and B
planes.
