The square-gradient density-functional model with triple-parabolic free
energy is used to study homogeneous bubble nucleation in a stretched liquid to
check the scaling rule for the work of formation of the critical bubble as a
function of scaled undersaturation $\Delta\mu/\Delta\mu_{\rm spin}$, the
difference in chemical potential $\Delta\mu$ between the bulk undersaturated
and saturated liquid divided by $\Delta\mu_{\rm spin}$ between the liquid
spinodal and saturated liquid. In contrast to our study, a similar
density-functional study for a Lennard-Jones liquid by Shen and Debenedetti [J.
Chem. Phys. {\bf 114}, 4149 (2001)] found that not only the work of formation
but other various quantities related to the critical bubble show the scaling
rule, however, we found virtually no scaling relationships in our model near
the coexistence. Although some quantities show almost perfect scaling relations
near the spinodal, the work of formation divided by the value deduced from the
classical nucleation theory shows no scaling in this model even though it
correctly vanishes at the spinodal. Furthermore, the critical bubble does not
show any anomaly near the spinodal as predicted many years ago. In particular,
our model does not show diverging interfacial width at the spinodal, which is
due to the fact that compressibility remains finite until the spinodal is
reached in our parabolic models.
