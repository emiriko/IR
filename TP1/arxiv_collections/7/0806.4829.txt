It is known that the Selberg zeta function for the modular group has an
expression in terms of the class numbers and the fundamental units of the
indefinite binary quadratic forms. In the present paper, we generalize such a
expression to any congruence subgroup of the modular groups in SL(2,R) and
SL(2,C).
