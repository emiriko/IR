We identify the operational conditions for maximum power of a
nanothermoelectric engine consisting of a single quantum level embedded between
two leads at different temperatures and chemical potentials. The corresponding
thermodynamic efficiency agrees with the Curzon-Ahlborn expression up to
quadratic terms in the gradients, supporting the thesis of universality beyond
linear response.
