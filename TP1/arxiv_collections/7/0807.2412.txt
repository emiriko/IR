Using the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation and Landau theory we
identify possible phases competing with superconductivity in FeAs layers. We
find that close to half-filling the transition from the paramagnet to the
magnetically ordered phase is first-order making anharmonicities relevant and
leading to a rich phase diagram. Between the already known one dimensionally
modulated magnetic stripe phase and the paramagnet we find a new phase which
has the same structure factor as the former but in which magnetic moments at
nearest-neighbor sites are at right angles making electrons to acquire a non
trivial phase when circulating a plaquette at strong coupling. Another
competing phase has magnetic and charge order and may be stabilized by charged
impurities.
