In the framework of algebraic supergeometry, we give a construction of the
scheme-theoretic supergeometric analogue of Chevalley groups, namely affine
algebraic supergroups associated to simple Lie superalgebras of classical type.
In particular both basic (even exceptional) and strange cases are covered.
  This provides a unified approach to most of the algebraic supergroups
considered so far in literature, and an effective method to construct new ones.
  As an intermediate step, we prove an existence theorem for Chevalley bases of
simple classical Lie superalgebras and a PBW-like theorem for their associated
Kostant superalgebras.
