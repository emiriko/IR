Pade Approximants can be used to go beyond Vector Meson Dominance in a
systematic approximation. We illustrate this fact with the case of the pion
vector form factor and extract values for the first two coefficients of its
Taylor expansion. Pade Approximants are shown to be a useful and simple tool
for incorporating high-energy information, allowing an improved determination
of these Taylor coefficients.
