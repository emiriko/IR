We compute and discuss the Esscher martingale transform for exponential
processes, the Esscher martingale transform for linear processes, the minimal
martingale measure, the class of structure preserving martingale measures, and
the minimum entropy martingale measure for stochastic volatility models of
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type as introduced by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard. We
show, that in the model with leverage, with jumps both in the volatility and in
the returns, all those measures are different, whereas in the model without
leverage, with jumps in the volatility only and a continuous return process,
several measures coincide, some simplifications can be made and the results are
more explicit. We illustrate our results with parametric examples used in the
literature.
