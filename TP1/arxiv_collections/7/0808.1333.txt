We present our results of the effect of Fe intercalation on the structural,
transport and magnetic properties of 1T-VSe2. Intercalation of iron, suppresses
the 110K charge density wave (CDW) transition of the 1T-VSe2. For the higher
concentration of iron, formation of a new kind of first order transition at
160K takes place, which go on stronger for the 33% Fe intercalation.
Thermopower of the FexVSe2 compounds (x = 0 - 0.33), however do not show any
anomaly around the transition. The intercalation of Fe does not trigger any
magnetism in the weak paramagnetic 1T-VSe2, and Fe is the low spin state of
Fe3+.
