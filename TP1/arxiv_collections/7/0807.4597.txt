Monte Carlo simulations of the Asakura-Oosawa (AO) model for colloid-polymer
mixtures confined between two parallel repulsive structureless walls are
presented and analyzed in the light of current theories on capillary
condensation and interface localization transitions. Choosing a polymer to
colloid size ratio of q=0.8 and studying ultrathin films in the range of D=3 to
D=10 colloid diameters thickness, grand canonical Monte Carlo methods are used;
phase transitions are analyzed via finite size scaling, as in previous work on
bulk systems and under confinement between identical types of walls. Unlike the
latter work, inequivalent walls are used here: while the left wall has a
hard-core repulsion for both polymers and colloids, at the right wall an
additional square-well repulsion of variable strength acting only on the
colloids is present. We study how the phase separation into colloid-rich and
colloid-poor phases occurring already in the bulk is modified by such a
confinement. When the asymmetry of the wall-colloid interaction increases, the
character of the transition smoothly changes from capillary condensation-type
to interface localization-type. The critical behavior of these transitions is
discussed, as well as the colloid and polymer density profiles across the film
in the various phases, and the correlation of interfacial fluctuations in the
direction parallel to the confining walls. The experimental observability of
these phenomena also is briefly discussed.
