Our understanding of the rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis process in
universe depends on the reliability of nuclear mass predictions. Initiated by
the newly developed mass table in the relativistic mean field theory (RMF), in
this paper the influence of mass models on the $r$-process calculations is
investigated assuming the same astrophysical conditions. The different model
predictions on the so far unreachable nuclei lead to significant deviations in
the calculated r-process abundances.
