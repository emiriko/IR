We consider CP-violating effects in tau->K pi pi nu_tau, assuming that a
charged Higgs boson provides a new amplitude that can interfere with the usual
Standard Model amplitude. We consider four CP-odd observables -- the regular
rate asymmetry, two modified rate asymmetries and a triple-product asymmetry.
The regular rate asymmetry is expected to be small because it requires the
interference of the new physics amplitude with the standard model amplitude
containing the hadronic scalar form factor. The other CP asymmetries may be
more promising in terms of their new physics reach. Numerical estimates
indicate that the maximum obtainable values for the modified and triple-product
asymmetries are on the order of a percent.
