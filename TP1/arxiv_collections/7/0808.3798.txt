This article reconsiders the relative-velocity-dependent approach to modeling
electromagnetism that was proposed initially by Weber before data from
cathode-ray-tube (CRT) experiments was available. It is shown that identifying
the nonlinear, relative-velocity terms using CRT data results in a model, which
not only captures standard relativistic effects in optics, high-energy
particles, and gravitation, but also explains apparent discrepancies between
predicted and measured energy (i) in high-energy-particle absorption
experiments and (ii) in the classical beta-ray spectrum of radium-E.
