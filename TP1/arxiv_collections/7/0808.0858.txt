The STAR Collaboration has measured the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry
for inclusive jet production in polarized p+p collisions at sqrt{s} = 200 GeV.
The results set significant new constraints on the gluon polarization within
the nucleon. Future measurements of asymmetries for di-jet production will
provide direct access to the momentum dependence of the gluon polarization,
Delta g(x,Q^2).
