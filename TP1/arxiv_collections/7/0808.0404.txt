Here, cosmology is obtained from the variable gravitational constant $ G
\propto \phi^{-2}$ with $ \phi(x) $ being a scalar and its fluctuations around
the ground state. The gravitational action contains Einstein-Hilbert like term
with variable $ G $, kinetic energy and self-interaction potential for $
\phi(x) $. Two phase transitions take place in this model. The first one takes
place at the GUT (grand unified theory) scale $ \sim 2.45 \times 10^{14}{\rm
GeV} $, when the early universe exits the inflationay phase and the second one
at the electro-weak scale. Spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place around
this scale As a consequence, variable $ G $ acquires constant value $G_N$ (the
Newtonian gravitational constant).The standard model of cosmology is obtained
in the post-second phase transition era. Interestingly, the dark matter and
quintessence dark energy are created from the gravitational sector as a
combined effect of the linear term of scalar curvature and $ \phi(x) $ without
using non-linear terms of curvature or any other matter fields. It is
interesting to find that fluctuations in $ \phi(x) $ cause the phantom dark
energy after the second phase transition, which grows later in the expanding
universe. It is also found that the phantom era is free from big-rip
singularity.
