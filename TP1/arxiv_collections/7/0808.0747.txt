Anti-neutrino emission rates from nuclear reactors are determined from
thermal power measurements and fission rate calculations. The uncertainties in
these quantities for commercial power plants and their impact on the calculated
interaction rates in electron anti-neutrino detectors is examined. We discuss
reactor-to-reactor correlations between the leading uncertainties and their
relevance to reactor anti-neutrino experiments.
