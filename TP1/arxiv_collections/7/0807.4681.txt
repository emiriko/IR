We have used medium-energy ion scattering (MEIS) to quantitatively analyze
the structure of holmium silicide islands grown on the Si(100) surface.
Structure fitting to the experimental data unambiguously shows that the
tetragonal silicide phase is present and not the hexagonal phase, which is
associated with the growth of nanowires at submonolayer coverages. Islands
formed with a lower holmium coverage of 3 ML are also shown to be tetragonal,
which suggests that the hexagonal structure is not a low coverage precursor to
the growth of the tetragonal phase. MEIS simulations of large nanoislands,
which include the effects of lateral strain relief, have been performed and
these compare well with the experimental data.
