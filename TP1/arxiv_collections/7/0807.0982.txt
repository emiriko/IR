We study the geometry of projective manifolds whose tangent bundles are nef
on sufficiently general curves (i.e. the tangent bundle is generically nef) and
show that manifolds whose anticanonical bundles are semi-ample have this
property. Furthermore we introduce a notion of sufficient nefness and
investigate the relation with manifolds whose anticanonical bundles are nef.
