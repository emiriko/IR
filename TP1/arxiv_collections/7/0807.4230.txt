Cylindrically symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological model for bulk viscous
fluid distribution with electromagnetic field is obtained. The source of the
magnetic field is due to an electric current produced along the z-axis.
$F_{12}$ is the non-vanishing component of electromagnetic field tensor. To get
the deterministic solution, it has been assumed that the expansion $\theta$ in
the model is proportional to the shear $\sigma$. The values of cosmological
constant for these models are found to be small and positive at late time,
which are consistent with the results from recent supernovae Ia observations.
Physical and geometric aspects of the models are also discussed in presence and
absence of magnetic field.
