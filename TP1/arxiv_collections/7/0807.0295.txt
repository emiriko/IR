Temperature dependence of the longitudinal and Hall resistance is studied in
the regime of localization-delocalization transition. We carry out measurements
of a scaling exponent $\kappa$ in the Landau level mixing region at several
filling factors. The localization exponent $\gamma$ is extracted using an
approach based on the variable range hopping theory. The values of $\gamma$ and
$\kappa$ are found to be universal, independent of filling factor in our
sample. We can conclude that although Landau level mixing can change the
degeneracy of a quantum Hall state, the value of the scaling exponent remains
the same for a given sample that contains a fixed disorder profile.
