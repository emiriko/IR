We simulate the assembly dynamics of icosahedral capsids from subunits that
interconvert between different conformations (or quasi-equivalent states). The
simulations identify mechanisms by which subunits form empty capsids with only
one morphology but adaptively assemble into different icosahedral morphologies
around nanoparticle cargoes with varying sizes, as seen in recent experiments
with brome mosaic virus (BMV) capsid proteins. Adaptive cargo encapsidation
requires moderate cargo-subunit interaction strengths; stronger interactions
frustrate assembly by stabilizing intermediates with incommensurate curvature.
We compare simulation results to experiments with cowpea chlorotic mottle virus
empty capsids and BMV capsids assembled on functionalized nanoparticles and
suggest new cargo encapsidation experiments. Finally, we find that both empty
and templated capsids maintain the precise spatial ordering of subunit
conformations seen in the crystal structure even if interactions that preserve
this arrangement are favored by as little as the thermal energy, consistent
with experimental observations that different subunit conformations are highly
similar.
