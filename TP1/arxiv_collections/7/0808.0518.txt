The paper reports about results on the GESIS-IZ project "Competence Center
Modeling and Treatment of Semantic Heterogeneity" (KoMoHe). KoMoHe supervised a
terminology mapping effort, in which 'cross-concordances' between major
controlled vocabularies were organized, created and managed. In this paper we
describe the establishment and implementation of cross-concordances for search
in a digital library (DL).
