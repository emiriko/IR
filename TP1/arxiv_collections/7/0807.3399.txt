We introduce a simple approach for a tunable up-conversion detector. This
scheme is relevant for both single photon detection or anywhere where low light
levels at telecom wavelengths need to be detected with a high degree of
temporal resolution or where high count rates are desired. A system combining a
periodically poled Lithium niobate waveguide for the nonlinear wavelength
conversion and a low jitter Silicon avalanche photodiode are used in
conjunction with a tunable pump source. We report more than a ten-fold increase
in the detectable bandwidth using this tuning scheme.
