We study the supersymmetric model with the A4 lepton flavor symmetry, in
particular soft supersymmetry breaking terms, which are predicted from the A4
lepton flavor symmetry. We evaluate soft slepton masses and A-terms within the
framework of supergravity theory. Constraints due to experiments of flavor
changing neutral current processes are examined.
