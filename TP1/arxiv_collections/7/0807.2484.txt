The correspondence between theories in anti-de Sitter space and conformal
field theories in physical space-time leads to an analytic, semiclassical model
for strongly-coupled QCD which has scale invariance at short distances and
color confinement at large distances. Light-front holography is a remarkable
feature of AdS/CFT: it allows hadronic amplitudes in the AdS fifth dimension to
be mapped to frame-independent light-front wavefunctions of hadrons in physical
space-time, thus providing a relativistic description of hadrons at the
amplitude level. Some novel features of QCD are discussed, including the
consequences of confinement for quark and gluon condensates and the behavior of
the QCD coupling in the infrared. We suggest that the spatial support of QCD
condensates is restricted to the interior of hadrons, since they arise due to
the interactions of confined quarks and gluons. Chiral symmetry is thus broken
in a limited domain of size of the inverse pion mass in analogy to the limited
physical extent of superconductor phases. A new method for computing the
hadronization of quark and gluon jets at the amplitude level, an event
amplitude generator, is outlined.
