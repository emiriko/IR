We develop a new interpretation of the geometric phase in evolution with a
non-Hermitian real value Hamiltonian by relating it to the angle developed
during the parallel transport along a closed curve by a unit vector triad in
the 3D-Minkovsky space. We also show that this geometric phase is responsible
for the anholonomy effects in stochastic processes considered in [N. A.
Sinitsyn and I. Nemenman, EPL {\bf 77}, 58001 (2007)], and use it to derive the
stochastic system response to periodic parameter variations.
