We investigate the effect of a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate on a system
of immersed impurity atoms trapped by an optical lattice. We analytically show
that for a one-dimensional, ring-shaped setup the coupling of the impurities to
the Bogoliubov phonons of the condensate leads to a non-trivial phase in the
impurity hopping. The presence of this phase can be tested by observing a drift
in the transport properties of the impurities. These results are quantitatively
confirmed by a numerically exact simulation of a two-mode Bose-Hubbard model.
We also give analytical expressions for the occurring phase terms for a
two-dimensional setup. The phase realises an artificial magnetic field and can
for instance be used for the simulation of the quantum Hall effect using atoms
in an optical lattice.
