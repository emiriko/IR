We present a microscopic theory of fluctuation-mediated pairing mechanism in
a two-dimensional extended Hubbard model. In contrast to conventional wisdom,
odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing can be stabilized near the spin-density-wave
critical point. Favorable conditions for the odd-frequency pairing are the
presence of geometrical frustration and off-site Coulomb interaction.
