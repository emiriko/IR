High-resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission measurements have
been carried out on the electron-doped (Nd$_{1.85}$Ce$_{0.15}$)CuO$_4$ high
temperature superconductor. We have revealed a clear kink at $\sim$60 meV in
the dispersion along the (0,0)-($\pi$,$\pi$) nodal direction, accompanied by a
peak-dip-hump feature in the photoemission spectra. This indicates that the
nodal electrons are coupled to collective excitations (bosons) in
electron-doped superconductors, with the phonons as the most likely candidate
of the boson. This finding has established a universality of nodal electron
coupling in both hole- and electron-doped high temperature cuprate
superconductors.
