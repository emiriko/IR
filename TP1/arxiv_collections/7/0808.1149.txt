We describe a Groebner basis of relations among conditional probabilities in
a discrete probability space, with any set of conditioned-upon events. They may
be specialized to the partially-observed random variable case, the purely
conditional case, and other special cases. We also investigate the connection
to generalized permutohedra and describe a conditional probability simplex.
