We discuss the fission barrier height of neutron-rich nuclei in a r-process
site at highly excited state, which is resulted from the beta-decay or the
neutron-capture processes. We particularly investigate the sensitivity of the
fission barrier height to the temperature, including the effect of pairing
phase transition from superfluid to normal fluid phases. To this end, we use
the finite-temperature Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogolubov method with a zero-range
pairing interaction. We also discuss the temperature dependence of the fission
decay rate.
