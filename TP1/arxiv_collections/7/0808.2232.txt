Several of the next generation sequencers are limited in their sample
preparation process by the need to make an absolute measurement of the number
of template molecules in the library to be sequenced. As currently practiced,
the practical effects of this requirement compromise sequencing performance,
both by requiring large amounts of sample DNA and by requiring extra sequencing
runs to be performed. We used digital PCR to quantitate sequencing libraries,
and demonstrated its sensitivity and robustness by preparing and sequencing
libraries from subnanogram amounts of bacterial and human DNA on the 454 and
Solexa sequencing platforms. This assay allows absolute quantitation and
eliminates uncertainties associated with the construction and application of
standard curves. The digital PCR platform consumes subfemptogram amounts of the
sequencing library and gives highly accurate results, allowing the optimal DNA
concentration to be used in setting up sequencing runs without costly and
time-consuming titration techniques. This approach also reduces the input
sample requirement more than 1000-fold: from micrograms of DNA to less than a
nanogram.
