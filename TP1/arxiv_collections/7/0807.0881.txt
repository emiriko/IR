We scrutinize congruence as one of the basic definitions of equality in
geometry and pit it against physics of Special Relativity. We show that two
non-rigid rods permanently kept congruent during their common expansion or
compression may have different instantaneous proper lengths (when measured at
the same time of their respective reference clocks) if they have different mass
distributions over their lengths. Alternatively, their proper lengths can come
out equal only when measured at different but strictly correlated moments of
time of their respective clocks. The derived expression for the ratio of
instantaneous proper lengths of two permanently congruent changing objects
explicitly contains information about the objects mass distribution. The same
is true for the ratio of readings of the two reference clocks, for which the
instantaneous measurements of respective proper lengths produce the same
result. In either case the characteristics usually considered as purely
kinematic depend on mass distribution, which is a dynamic property. This is a
spectacular demonstration of dynamic aspect of geometry already in the
framework of Special Relativity.
