Various experimental settings that involve drying solutions or suspensions of
nanoparticles -- often called nanofluids -- have recently been used to produce
structured nanoparticle layers. In addition to the formation of polygonal
networks and spinodal-like patterns, the occurrence of branched structures has
been reported. After reviewing the experimental results we use a modified
version of the Monte Carlo model first introduced by Rabani et al. [Nature 426,
271 (2003)] to study structure formation in evaporating films of nanoparticle
solutions for the case that all structuring is driven by the interplay of
evaporating solvent and diffusing nanoparticles.
  After introducing the model and its general behavior we focus on receding
dewetting fronts which are initially straight but develop a transverse
fingering instability. We analyze the dependence of the characteristics of the
resulting branching patterns on the driving chemical potential, the mobility
and concentration of the nanoparticles, and the interaction strength between
liquid and nanoparticles. This allows us to understand the underlying
instability mechanism.
