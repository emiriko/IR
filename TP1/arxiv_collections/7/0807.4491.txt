2008 was a vintage year for the QCD Moriond meeting. Plenty of new data from
Tevatron, HERA, B-Factories and other experiments have been reported. Some
brand new results became public just before or even during the conference. A
few new hints for New Physics came up in Winter 2008, but these await further
scrutiny. This paper is the write-up of the experimental summary talk given at
the Moriond QCD March meeting.
