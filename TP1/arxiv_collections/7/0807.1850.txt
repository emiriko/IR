Symmetry adapted bases in quantum chemistry and bases adapted to quantum
information share a common characteristics: both of them are constructed from
subspaces of the representation space of the group SO(3) or its double group
(i.e., spinor group) SU(2). We exploit this fact for generating spin bases of
relevance for quantum systems with cyclic symmetry and equally well for quantum
information and quantum computation. Our approach is based on the use of
generalized Pauli matrices arising from a polar decomposition of SU(2). This
approach leads to a complete solution for the construction of mutually unbiased
bases in the case where the dimension d of the considered Hilbert subspace is a
prime number. We also give the starting point for studying the case where d is
the power of a prime number. A connection of this work with the unitary group
U(d) and the Pauli group is brielly underlined.
