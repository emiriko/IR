Our model comprehensively simulates modern nanoscale semiconductor
microcavities incorporating cavity quantum electrodynamics within both the weak
and strong coupling regimes, using on-resonant laser excitation and nonresonant
excitation due to a wetting layer. For weak coupling, the most significant
effect is photon antibunching with nonresonant emission. We investigate how the
antibunching characteristics change as the cavity finesse is increased towards
the strong coupling regime. Antibunching can also be observed in a strongly
coupled system with resonant excitation, using the photon blockade mechanism
which has been demonstrated in atom systems. We calculate what cavity
parameters are required to observe this effect. Experimentally these studies
are equivalent to nonlinear pump probe measurements, where a strong pump,
either resonant or nonresonant, is used to excite the coupled system, and the
resulting state is characterized using a weak, resonant probe beam.
