Using the Vlasov-wave formalism, it is shown that self-consistency vanishes
in the plateau regime of the bump-on-tail instability if the plateau is broad
enough. This shows that, in contrast with the "turbulent trapping" Ansatz, a
renormalization of the Landau growth rate or of the quasilinear diffusion
coefficient is not necessarily related to the limit where the Landau growth
time becomes large with respect to the time of spreading of the particle
positions due to velocity diffusion.
