We report here first extensive measurements of the temperature dependence of
phonon density of states of BaFe2As2, the parent compound of the newly
discovered FeAs-based superconductors, using inelastic neutron scattering. The
experiments were carried out on the thermal time-of-flight neutron spectrometer
IN4 at the ILL on a polycrystalline sample. There is no appreciable change in
the spectra between T = 10 K and 200 K, although the sample undergoes a
magnetic as well as a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural phase transition at
140 K. This indicates a rather harmonic phonon system. Shell model lattice
dynamical calculations based on interatomic potentials are carried out to
characterize the phonon data. The calculations predict a shift of the
Ba-phonons to higher energies at 4 GPa. The average energy of the phonons of
the Ba-sublattice is also predicted to increase on partial substitution of Ba
by K to Ba0.6K0.4. The calculations show good agreement with the experimental
phonon spectra, and also with the specific heat data from the literature.
