The planar surface tension of coexisting liquid and vapor phases of a fluid
of Lennard-Jones atoms is studied as a function of the range of the potential
using both Monte Carlo simulations and Density Functional Theory. The
interaction range is varied from $r_c^* = 2.5$ to $r_c^* = 6$ and the surface
tension is determined for temperatures ranging from $T^* = 0.7$ up to the
critical temperature in each case. The results are shown to be consistent with
previous studies. The simulation data are well-described by Guggenheim's law of
corresponding states but the agreement of the theoretical results depends on
the quality of the bulk equation of state.
