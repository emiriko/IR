Based on the conception of quantum entanglement of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen we
construct generalized phase space representation associated with the entangled
state |Gamma>_{e}, which is endowed with definite physical meaning. The set of
states make up a complete and non-orthogonal representation. The Weyl ordered
form of |Gamma>_{ee}_<Gamma| is derived which clearly exhibit the statistical
behavior of marginal distribution of |Gamma>_{ee}_<Gamma|.The minimum
uncertainty relation obeyed by |Gamma>_{e} is also demonstrated.
