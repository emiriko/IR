We study the Harvey-Lawson spark characters of level p on complex manifolds.
Presenting Deligne cohomology classes by sparks of level $p$, we give an
explicit analytic product formula for Deligne cohomology. We also define
refined Chern classes in Deligne cohomology for holomorphic vector bundles over
complex manifolds. Applications to algebraic cycles are given. A Bott-type
vanishing theorem in Deligne cohomology for holomorphic foliations is
established. A general construction of Nadel-type invariants is given together
with a new proof of Nadel's conjecture.
