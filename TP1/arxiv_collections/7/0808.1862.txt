We report magnetotransport measurements on a single-layer graphene in pulsed
magnetic fields up to $B$ = 53 T. With either electron- or hole-type charge
carriers, the Hall resistance $R_{H}$ is quantized into $R_{H}$ = $(h/e^2)\nu
^{-1}$ with $\nu$ = $\pm$2, $\pm$6, and $\pm$10, which demonstrates the
observation of half-integer quantum Hall effect (QHE). At $B$ = 50 T, the
half-integer QHE is even observed at room temperature in spite of a
conventional carrier mobility $\mu$ = 4000 cm$^2$/Vs.
