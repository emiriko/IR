Polycrystalline materials can be viewed as composites of crystalline
particles or grains separated from one another by thin amorphous grain boundary
(GB) regions. While GB have been exhaustively investigated at low temperatures,
where these regions resolve into complex ordered structures accessible to
measurement, much less is known about them at higher temperatures where the GB
can exhibit significant mobility, structural disorder, and where experimental
characterization methods are limited. The time and spatial scales accessible to
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation make this method appropriate for
investigating both the dynamical and structural properties of grain boundaries
at elevated temperatures. In the present study, we use MD simulations to
determine how the GB dynamics changes with temperature and applied stress. It
has long been hypothesized that GB have features in common with glass-forming
liquids based on the processing characteristics of polycrystalline materials.
We find remarkable support for this suggestion, as evidenced by string-like
collective motion, transient caging of atom motion, and non-Arrhenius
(Vogel-Fulcher) temperature dependence of GB mobility. Evidently, the
frustration caused by the inability of atoms in GB region to simultaneously
order with respect to competing grains is responsible for this striking
similarity. The paradigm that grains in a polycrystalline material are
encapsulated by a frustrated fluid provides a powerful conceptual model of
polycrystalline materials, pointing the way to improved control over their
material properties.
