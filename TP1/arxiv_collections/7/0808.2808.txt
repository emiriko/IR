We study classical solutions in the SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory.
The spherically symmetric ans\"atze for all fields are given and the equations
of motion are derived as a system of ordinary differential equations. The
asymptotics and the boundary conditions at space origin for regular solutions
and at event horizon for black hole solutions are studied. Using the shooting
method, we found numerical solutions to the theory. For regular solutions, we
find two new sets of asymptotically flat solutions. Each of these sets contains
continua of solutions in the parameter space spanned by the shooting
parameters. The solutions bifurcate along these parameter curves and the
bifurcation are argued to be due to the internal structure of the model. Both
sets of the solutions are asymptotically flat but one is exponentially so and
the other is so with oscillations. For black holes, a new set of boundary
conditions is studied and it is found that there also exists a continuum of
black hole solutions in parameter space and similar bifurcation behavior is
also present to these solutions. The SU(2) charges of these solutions are found
zero and these solutions are proven to be unstable.
