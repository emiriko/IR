Several self-stabilizing time division multiple access (TDMA) algorithms are
proposed for sensor networks. In addition to providing a collision-free
communication service, such algorithms enable the transformation of programs
written in abstract models considered in distributed computing literature into
a model consistent with sensor networks, i.e., write all with collision (WAC)
model. Existing TDMA slot assignment algorithms have one or more of the
following properties: (i) compute slots using a randomized algorithm, (ii)
assume that the topology is known upfront, and/or (iii) assign slots
sequentially. If these algorithms are used to transform abstract programs into
programs in WAC model then the transformed programs are probabilistically
correct, do not allow the addition of new nodes, and/or converge in a
sequential fashion. In this paper, we propose a self-stabilizing deterministic
TDMA algorithm where a sensor is aware of only its neighbors. We show that the
slots are assigned to the sensors in a concurrent fashion and starting from
arbitrary initial states, the algorithm converges to states where
collision-free communication among the sensors is restored. Moreover, this
algorithm facilitates the transformation of abstract programs into programs in
WAC model that are deterministically correct.
