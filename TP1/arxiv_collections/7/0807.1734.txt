The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a popular similarity measure between time
series. The DTW fails to satisfy the triangle inequality and its computation
requires quadratic time. Hence, to find closest neighbors quickly, we use
bounding techniques. We can avoid most DTW computations with an inexpensive
lower bound (LB_Keogh). We compare LB_Keogh with a tighter lower bound
(LB_Improved). We find that LB_Improved-based search is faster for sequential
search. As an example, our approach is 3 times faster over random-walk and
shape time series. We also review some of the mathematical properties of the
DTW. We derive a tight triangle inequality for the DTW. We show that the DTW
becomes the l_1 distance when time series are separated by a constant.
