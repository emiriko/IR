Stochastic Bloch equations which model the fluorescence of two level
molecules and atoms, NMR experiments and Josephson junctions are investigated
to illustrate the profound effect of multiplicative noise on the critical
frequency of a dynamical system. Using exact solutions and the cumulant
expansion we find two main effects: (i) even very weak noise may double or
triple the number of critical frequencies, which is related to an instability
of the system and (ii) strong multiplicative noise may induce a non-trivial
zero critical frequency thus wiping out the over-damped phase.
