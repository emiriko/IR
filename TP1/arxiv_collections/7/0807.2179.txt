We give the exact solution of classical equation of motion of a quartic
scalar massless field theory showing that this is massive and is represented by
a superposition of free particle solutions with a discrete spectrum. Then we
show that this is also a solution of the classical Yang-Mills field theory that
is so proved acquiring mass by dynamical evolution with a corresponding
discrete mass spectrum. Finally we develop quantum field theory starting with
this solution.
