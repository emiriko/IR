This paper is focused on the design and analysis of power control procedures
for the uplink of multipath code-division-multiple-access (CDMA) channels based
on the large system analysis (LSA). Using the tools of LSA, a new decentralized
power control algorithm aimed at energy efficiency maximization and requiring
very little prior information on the interference background is proposed;
moreover, it is also shown that LSA can be used to predict with good accuracy
the performance and operational conditions of a large network operating at the
equilibrium over a multipath channel, i.e. the power,
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and utility profiles across
users, wherein the utility is defined as the number of bits reliably delivered
to the receiver for each energy-unit used for transmission. Additionally, an
LSA-based performance comparison among linear receivers is carried out in terms
of achieved energy efficiency at the equilibrium. Finally, the problem of the
choice of the utility-maximizing training length is also considered. Numerical
results show a very satisfactory agreement of the theoretical analysis with
simulation results obtained with reference to systems with finite (and not so
large) numbers of users.
