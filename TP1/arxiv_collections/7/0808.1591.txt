We describe a scalable, high-speed, and robust architecture for
measurement-based quantum-computing with trapped ions. Measurement-based
architectures offer a way to speed-up operation of a quantum computer
significantly by parallelizing the slow entangling operations and transferring
the speed requirement to fast measurement of qubits. We show that a 3D cluster
state suitable for fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computing can be
implemented on a 2D array of ion traps. We propose the projective measurement
of ions via multi-photon photoionization for nanosecond operation and discuss
the viability of such a scheme for Ca ions.
