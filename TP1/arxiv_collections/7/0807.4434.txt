The density distributions of the two components of a trapped, ultracold Fermi
gas with population imbalance reveal the effect of imbalance on superfluid
pairing. We develop a path-integral derivation of the density, that takes into
account both fluctuations beyond mean-field and effects of nonzero temperature.
The calculated density profiles compare favorably to the measured density
profiles, and illustrate the necessity to incorporate both quantum fluctuations
and finite temperature effects. The temperature dependence of the density
profiles, especially near the superfluid-normal interface, allows determining
the temperature of the superfluid core in current experiments.
