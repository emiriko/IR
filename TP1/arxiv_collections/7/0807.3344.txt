We study the highest-weight representation of N=2 supersymmetric Schrodinger
algebra which appears in non-relativistic superconformal field theories in
(1+2) dimension. We define the index for the non-relativistic superconformal
field theories and study its properties. As a concrete example, we compute the
index for the non-relativistic limit of N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons-matter
theory recently proposed by Aharony et al.
