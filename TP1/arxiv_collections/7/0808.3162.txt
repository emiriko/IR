A new type of deterministic (non-probabilistic) computer logic system
inspired by the stochasticity of brain signals is shown. The distinct values
are represented by independent stochastic processes: independent voltage (or
current) noises. The orthogonality of these processes provides a natural way to
construct binary or multi-valued logic circuitry with arbitrary number N of
logic values by using analog circuitry. Moreover, the logic values on a single
wire can be made a (weighted) superposition of the N distinct logic values.
Fuzzy logic is also naturally represented by a two-component superposition
within the binary case (N=2). Error propagation and accumulation are
suppressed. Other relevant advantages are reduced energy dissipation and
leakage current problems, and robustness against circuit noise and background
noises such as 1/f, Johnson, shot and crosstalk noise. Variability problems are
also nonexistent because the logic value is an AC signal. A similar logic
system can be built with orthogonal sinusoidal signals (different frequency or
orthogonal phase) however that has an extra 1/N type slowdown compared to the
noise-based logic system with increasing number of N furthermore it is less
robust against time delay effects than the noise-based counterpart.
