Different from previous models based on scatter theory and random matrix
theory, a new interpretation of the observed log-normal type time-headway
distribution of vehicles is presented in this paper. Inspired by the well known
Galton Board, this model views driver's velocity adjusting process similar to
the dynamics of a particle falling down a board and being deviated at decision
points. A new car-following model based on this idea is proposed to reproduce
the observed traffic flow phenomena. The agreement between the empirical
observations and the simulation results suggests the soundness of this new
approach.
