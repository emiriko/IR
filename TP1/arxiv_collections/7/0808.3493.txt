We consider the Hanany-Witten type brane configuration in a background of RR
4-form field strength and examine the behavior of Euclidean D0-branes
propagating between two NS5-branes. We evaluate the partition function of the
D0-branes and show that it coincides with the Nekrasov partition function of
instantons for four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. In this
analysis, the Myers effect plays a crucial role. We apply the same method to
the brane configuration realizing four-dimensional N=2 theory with
hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation and reproduce the
corresponding Nekrasov partition function.
