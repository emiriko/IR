Over the last 25 years Monte Carlo programs were being developped in Cracow
in the group guided by Prof. Stanislaw Jadach. Many of those programs became
standard in their application domains. In the following let us review some
aspects of such projects which were probably at the foundation of their
success. We will concentrate on mathematical aspects of their design and
history of their construction. It is rather difficult to cover 25 years of the
research in a single talk. That is why, I have organized my presentation around
Monte Carlo PHOTOS but stressing its relation to other activities and projects
often realized together with Prof. Jadach. Many of omitted aspects will find
their way into other perentations collected in this volume.
  I will concentrate on issues related to phasespace parametrization and spin
amplitudes as used in our Monte Carlo programs such as MUSTRAAL, TAUOLA or KKMC
and their similarities and differences with respect to solution used in PHOTOS.
