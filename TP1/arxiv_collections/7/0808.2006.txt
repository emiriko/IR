We find, within the pQCD dipole model for DIS processes, a rapid increase
with energy of the scale of parton momenta in the current fragmentation region
in the limit $s\to \infty$ and fixed $Q^2$ . We explain the equivalence between
the dispersion representation over $Q^2$ for LT pQCD zero angle amplitude of
$\gamma^*+T\to \gamma^*+T$ scattering at large energies and the $k_t$
factorization, and use it to evaluate the scales of the hard processes in the
current fragmentation region. We derive within the black disc (BD) regime the
modified Gribov formula for the total cross-section of the DIS. We evaluate the
coherence length of the processes relevant for the BD regime and find that it
increases with energy as $\sim s^{0.6}$ i.e. significantly slower than in the
parton model ($1/2m_Nx$ - the Ioffe length) as well as in pQCD. In the BD
regime we estimate the gluon densities, local in the coordinate space, and find
that they do not decrease with the energy. We discuss briefly how the new pQCD
phenomena may reveal itself in the proton-proton collisions at LHC
