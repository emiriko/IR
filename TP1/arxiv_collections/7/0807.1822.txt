We discuss the open charm production in peripheral reactions
  $\bar pp\to \bar Y_cY_c$ and $\bar pp\to M_c\bar M_c$, where
  $Y_c$ and $M_c$ stand for $\Lambda_c^+,\Sigma_c^+$ and
  $D,D^*$, respectively, at $\sqrt{s}\lesssim 15$ GeV, which corresponds to the
energy range of FAIR. Our consideration is based on the topological
decomposition of the planar quark and diquark diagrams which allows to estimate
consistently meson and baryon exchange trajectories and energy scale parameters
as well. The spin dependence is determined by the effective interaction of
lowest exchanged resonance. Unknown parameters are fixed by an independent
analysis of open strangeness production in $\bar pp\to \bar YY$ and $\bar pp\to
\bar KK$ reactions and of SU(4) symmetry. We present the corresponding cross
sections and longitudinal double-spin asymmetries for exclusive binary
reactions with open charm mesons and baryons in the final state. The
polarization observables have a non-trivial $t$ and $s$ dependence which is
sensitive to details of the open charm production mechanism.
