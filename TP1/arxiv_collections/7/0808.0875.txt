Number-state expansions are derived for the squeezed states produced by
four-wave mixing (modulation interaction and phase conjugation) in fibers.
These expansions are valid for arbitrary pump-induced coupling and
dispersion-induced mismatch coefficients. To illustrate their use, formulas are
derived for the associated field-quadrature and photon-number variances and
correlations.
