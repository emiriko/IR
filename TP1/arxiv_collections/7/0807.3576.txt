We study the orbits of a polynomial f in C[X], namely the sets
{e,f(e),f(f(e)),...} with e in C. We prove that if nonlinear complex
polynomials f and g have orbits with infinite intersection, then f and g have a
common iterate. More generally, we describe the intersection of any line in C^d
with a d-tuple of orbits of nonlinear polynomials, and we formulate a question
which generalizes both this result and the Mordell--Lang conjecture.
