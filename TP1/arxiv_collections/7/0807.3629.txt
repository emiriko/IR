We report detailed results on ionization in metallic quantum--dot (QD)
nanorings described by the extended Hubbard model at half filling obtained by
exact numerical diagonalization. In spite of very strong electron correlations,
the ionization spectra are astonishingly scarce. We attribute this scarcity to
a hidden quasi--symmetry, generalizing thereby similar results on optical
absorption recently reported [I. Baldea and L. S. Cederbaum, \prb {\bf 75},
125323 (2007); {\bf 77}, 165339 (2008)]. Numerical results indicate that this
hidden quasi--symmetry of the extended Hubbard model does not evolve into a
true (hidden) symmetry but remains a quasi--symmetry in the case of the
restricted Hubbard model as well. Based on the observation on the number of
significant ionization signals per each spatial symmetry, we claim the
existence of a one--to--one map between the relevant ionization signals of the
correlated half-filled nanorings and the one-hole and two-hole--one-particle
processes possible in the noninteracting case. Similar to the case of optical
absorption, numerous avoided crossings (anticrossings) are present in the
ionization spectra, which often involve more than two states. The present
results demonstrate that ionization could be a useful tool to study electron
correlations in metallic QD--nanoarrays, providing information that is
complementary to optical absorption.
