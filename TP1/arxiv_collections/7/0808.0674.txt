We study direct CP violation of tau -> K pi(eta,eta')nu decays. By studying
the forward and backward asymmetry, the interference of L=0 and L=1 amplitudes
of the hadronic system can be extracted.
  By including the scalar and vector mesons into the chiral Lagrangian, we
compute the form factors which correspond to L=0 and L=1 angular momentum state
of the hadronic system. We include real and imaginary parts of the one loop
corrections to the self-energies of the scalar and vector mesons.
  The direct CP violation of the forward and backward asymmetry is computed
using a two Higgs doublet model in which a new CP violating phase is
introduced. We show how the CP violation of the forward and the backward
asymmetry may depend on the new CP violating phase and the strong phase of the
form factors.
