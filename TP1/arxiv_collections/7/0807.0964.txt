Molecular motors transport various cargos along cytoskeletal filaments,
analogous to trucks on roads. In contrast to vehicles, however, molecular
motors do not work alone but in small teams. We describe a simple model for the
transport of a cargo by one team of motors and by two teams of motors, which
walk into opposite directions. The cooperation of one team of motors generates
long-range transport, which we observed experimentally in vitro. Transport by
two teams of motors leads to a variety of bidirectional motility behaviour and
to dynamic instabilities reminiscent of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We also
discuss how cargo transport by teams of motors allows the cell to generate
robust long-range bidirectional transport.
