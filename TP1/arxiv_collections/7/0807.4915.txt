When a negative slope of the dispersion curve is encountered, the propagating
light may be either 'fast light' or 'backward propagating'. We show that
causality considerations select only one of which for each scenario, and
demonstrate that the same photonic (plasmonic) system can support both type of
solutions depending on parameters.
