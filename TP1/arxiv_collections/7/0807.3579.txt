A general formulation is presented to derive the equation of motion and to
demonstrate thermodynamic consistency for several classes of phase field models
at once. It applies to models with a conserved phase field, describing either
uniform or periodic stable states, and containing slow as well as fast
thermodynamic variables. The approach is based on an entropy functional
formalism previously developed in the context of phase field models for uniform
states [P. Galenko and D. Jou, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 71}, 046125 (2005)] and thus
allows to extend several properties of the latter to phase field models for
periodic states (phase field crystal models). In particular, it allows to
demonstrate the concept of thermodynamic consistency for phase field crystal
models with fast dynamics.
