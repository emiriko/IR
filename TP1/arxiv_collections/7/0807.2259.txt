In the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM), the presence of
light pseudoscalars can have a dramatic effect on the decays of the Standard
Model-like Higgs boson. These pseudoscalars are naturally light if
supersymmetry breaking preserves an approximate U(1)_R symmetry, spontaneously
broken when the Higgs bosons take on their expectation values. We investigate
two classes of theories that possess such an approximate U(1)_R at the
mediation scale: deformations of gauge and gaugino mediation. In the models we
consider, we find two disjoint classes of phenomenologically allowed parameter
regions. One of these regions corresponds to a limit where the singlet of the
NMSSM largely decouples. The other can give rise to a Standard Model-like Higgs
boson with a dominant branching into light pseudoscalars.
