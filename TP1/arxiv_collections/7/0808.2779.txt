There exist many simple tools for jointly capturing variability and
incomplete information by means of uncertainty representations. Among them are
random sets, possibility distributions, probability intervals, and the more
recent Ferson's p-boxes and Neumaier's clouds, both defined by pairs of
possibility distributions. In the companion paper, we have extensively studied
a generalized form of p-box and situated it with respect to other models . This
paper focuses on the links between clouds and other representations.
Generalized p-boxes are shown to be clouds with comonotonic distributions. In
general, clouds cannot always be represented by random sets, in fact not even
by 2-monotone (convex) capacities.
