We calculate the light hadron spectrum in full QCD using two plus one flavor
Asqtad sea quarks and domain wall valence quarks. Meson and baryon masses are
calculated on a lattice of spatial size $L \approx 2.5$\texttt{fm}, and a
lattice spacing of $a \approx 0.124$\texttt{fm}, for pion masses as light as
$m_\pi \approx 300$\texttt{MeV}, and compared with the results by the MILC
collaboration with Asqtad valence quarks at the same lattice spacing. Two- and
three-flavor chiral extrapolations of the baryon masses are performed using
both continuum and mixed-action heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. Both
the three-flavor and two-flavor functional forms describe our lattice results,
although the low-energy constants from the next-to-leading order SU(3) fits are
inconsistent with their phenomenological values. Next-to-next-to-leading order
SU(2) continuum formulae provide a good fit to the data and yield and
extrapolated nucleon mass consistent with experiment, but the convergence
pattern indicates that even our lightest pion mass may be at the upper end of
the chiral regime. Surprisingly, our nucleon masses are essentially lineaer in
$m_\pi$ over our full range of pion masses, and we show this feature is common
to all recent dynamical calculations of the nucleon mass. The origin of this
linearity is not presently understood, and lighter pion masses and increased
control of systematic errors will be needed to resolve this puzzling behavior.
