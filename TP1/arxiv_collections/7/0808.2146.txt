We study "the Caged Anisotropic Harmonic Oscillator", which is a new example
of a superintegrable, or accidentally degenerate Hamiltonian. The potential is
that of the harmonic oscillator with rational frequency ratio (l:m:n), but
additionally with barrier terms describing repulsive forces from the principal
planes. This confines the classical motion to a sector bounded by the principal
planes, or cage. In 3 degrees, there are five isolating integrals of motion,
ensuring that all bound trajectories are closed and strictly periodic. Three of
the integrals are quadratic in the momenta, the remaining two are polynomials
of order 2(l+m-1) and 2(l+n-1). In the quantum problem, the eigenstates are
multiply degenerate, exhibiting multiple copies of the fundamental pattern of
the symmetry group SU(3).
