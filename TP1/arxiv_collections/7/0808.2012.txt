Within the frame of the 'CRL' (Corinth Rift Laboratory project) (Cornet et
al, 2004a) centered on the south western sector of the Gulf of Corinth
(http://www.corinth-rift-lab.org), fault zone cores from the active Aigion
fault have been collected continuously from depths between 708 m to 782 m.
Inside this clayey core, a clear shearing surface with marked slip lines is
visible on a plane that makes a 68 degree angle with respect to the core axis.
This failure surface was not induced by the decompression process but is indeed
a slip plane as clear striation is observed at the interface. On the basis of
an elastoplastic constitutive model calibrated on triaxial tests on the clayey
gouge, it is shown that shear band formation inside the clayey core is
possible. The solution for the orientation of the shear band is compared to the
orientation of an existing slip surface inside the clayey gouge and this result
is used to deduce the orientation of the principal stresses. It is shown that
as commonly observed in weak fault zones, the orientation of the principal
stresses is locally almost parallel and perpendicular to the fault axis.
