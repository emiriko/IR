We discuss kinematical enhancements of cutoff effects at short and
intermediate distances. Starting from a pedagogical example with periodic
boundary conditions, we switch to the case of the Schroedinger Functional,
where the theoretical analysis is checked by precise numerical data with Nf=2
dynamical O(a)-improved Wilson quarks. Finally we present an improved
determination of the renormalization of the axial current in that theory.
