The search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the four lepton (electron
and muon) final state with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The
analysis strategy and the efficiency for selecting the signal and rejecting the
background are discussed, focusing on the performance of the lepton
identification that can be achieved with the first data of LHC expected in
2008.
