We investigate an $N$-particle Bose-Hubbard dimer with an additional
effective decay term in one of the sites. A mean-field approximation for this
non-Hermitian many-particle system is derived, based on a coherent state
approximation. The resulting nonlinear, non-Hermitian two-level dynamics, in
particular the fixed point structures showing characteristic modifications of
the self-trapping transition, are analyzed. The mean-field dynamics is found to
be in reasonable agreement with the full many-particle evolution.
