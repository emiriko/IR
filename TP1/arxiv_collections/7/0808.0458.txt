We pursue the possibility of using subcritical string theory in 4 space-time
dimensions to establish a string dual for large N QCD. In particular we study
the even G-parity sector of the 4 dimensional Neveu-Schwarz dual resonance
model as the natural candidate for this string theory. Our point of view is
that the open string dynamics given by this model will {\it determine} the
appropriate subcritical closed string theory, a tree level background of which
should describe the sum of planar multi-loop open string diagrams. We examine
the one loop open string diagram, which contains information about the closed
string spectrum at weak coupling. Higher loop open string diagrams will be
needed to determine closed string interactions. We also analyze the field
theory limit of the one loop open string diagram and recover the correct
running coupling behavior of the limiting gauge theory.
