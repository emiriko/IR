We propose a simple explanation of unconventional thermodynamical and
magnetic properties observed for Sr2RuO4. Actually, our two-phase model of
superconductivity, based on a straight generalization of the Ginzburg-Landau
theory, does predict two jumps in the heat capacity as well as a double curve
for the dependence of the critical temperature on an external magnetic field.
Such theoretical previsions well agree with the currently available
experimental data for Sr2RuO4
