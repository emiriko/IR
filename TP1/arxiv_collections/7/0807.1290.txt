The production of excited charm, D_1(2420)^0 and D_2^*(2460)^0, and
charm-strange, D_{s1}(2536)^+-, mesons in ep collisions was measured with the
ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 126 pb^-1. Masses,
widths and helicity parameters were determined. The measured yields were
converted to the rates of c quarks hadronising as a given excited charm meson
and to the ratios of the dominant D_2^*(2460)^0 and D_{s1}(2536)^+- branching
fractions. A search for the radially excited charm meson, D^{*'}(2640)^+-, was
also performed. The results are compared with those measured previously and
with theoretical expectations.
