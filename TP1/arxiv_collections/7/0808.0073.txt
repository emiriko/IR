We perform a systematic study of the possible molecular states composed of a
pair of heavy mesons such as $D\bar D$, $D^\ast\bar D$, $D^\ast \bar D^\ast$ in
the framework of the meson exchange model. The exchanged mesons include the
pseudoscalar, scalar and vector mesons. Through our investigation, we find that
(1) the structure X(3764) is not a molecular state; (2) There exists strong
attraction in the range $r < 1$ fm for the $D^*\bar D^*$ system with $J=0, 1$.
If future experiments confirm $Z^+(4051)$ as a loosely bound molecular state,
its quantum number is probably $J^{P}=0^+$. Its partner state $\Phi^{**0}$ may
be searched for in the $\pi^0\chi_{c1}$ channel; (3) The vector meson exchange
provides strong attraction in the $D^\ast \bar D$ channel together with the
pion exchange. A bound state solution exists with a reasonable cutoff parameter
$\Lambda\sim 1.4$ GeV. X(3872) may be accommodated as a molecular state
dynamically although drawing a very definite conclusion needs further
investigation; (4) The $B^\ast \bar B$ molecular state exists.
