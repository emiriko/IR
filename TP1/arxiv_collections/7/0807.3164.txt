Much experimental effort is invested these days in fabricating
nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) that are sufficiently small, cold, and
clean, so as to approach quantum mechanical behavior as their typical quantum
energy scale $\hbar\Omega$ becomes comparable to that of the ambient thermal
energy $k_{B}T$. Such systems will hopefully enable one to observe the quantum
behavior of human-made objects, and test some of the basic principles of
quantum mechanics. Here we expand and elaborate on our recent suggestion [PRL
99 (2007) 040404] to exploit the nonlinear nature of a nanoresonator in order
to observe its transition into the quantum regime. We study this transition for
an isolated resonator, as well as one that is coupled to a heat bath at either
zero or finite temperature. We argue that by exploiting nonlinearities, quantum
dynamics can be probed using technology that is almost within reach. Numerical
solutions of the equations of motion display the first quantum corrections to
classical dynamics that appear as the classical-to-quantum transition occurs.
This provides practical signatures to look for in future experiments with NEMS
resonators.
