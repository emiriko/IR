Recently we have proposed (J. Chem. Phys. 128 (2008) 134508) a new rescaling
of fluid density $\rho $ by its critical value $\rho_c^{2/3}$ to apply the
corresponding states law for the attractive Yukawa fluids study. Analysis of
precise simulation results allows us to generalize this concept to the case of
simple fluids with different interparticle interactions, like Mie (n,m) and
Sutherland pair potentials. It is shown, that there is a linear relationship
between the critical pressure and critical temperature, as well as the critical
density and inverse critical temperature for these frequently used pair
potentials. As a consequence, the critical compressibility factor of these
model fluids is close to its universal value measured experimentally for
different real substances.
