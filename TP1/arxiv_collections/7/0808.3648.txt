Radiative strength functions of 117Sn has been measured below the neutron
separation energy using the (3He,3He'gamma) reactions. An increase in the slope
of the strength functions around E_gamma= 4.5 MeV indicates the onset of a
resonance-like structure, giving a significant enhancement of the radiative
strength function compared to standard models in the energy region 4.5 <=
E_gamma <= 8.0 MeV. For the first time, the functional form of this
resonance-like structure has been measured in an odd tin nucleus below neutron
threshold in the quasi-continuum region.
