We propose a one mutation model for cancer with a mutation rate that
increases with time. Under rather general hypotheses the number of mutations is
necessarily a (non homogeneous) Poisson process with the prescribed mutation
rate. We show that the cumulative probability of cancer up to time $t$ is, up
to a multiplicative constant, an antiderivative of the mutation rate.
