We study the interaction of two cylinders with helical charge distribution
mediated by neutralizing counterions, by analyzing the separation as well as
the azimuthal angle dependence of the interaction force in the weak and strong
coupling limit. While the azimuthal dependence of the interaction in the weak
coupling limit is overall small and mostly negligible, the strong coupling
limit leads to qualitatively new features of the interaction, among others also
to an orientationally dependent optimal configuration that is driven by angular
dependence of the correlation attraction. We investigate the properties of this
azimuthal ordering in detail and compare it to existing results.
