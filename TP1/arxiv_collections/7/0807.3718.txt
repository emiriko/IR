Using a total of 2.74 x 10^7 decays of the psi(2S) collected with the CLEO-c
detector, we present a study of chi_cJ -> gamma V, where V = rho^0, omega, phi.
The transitions chi_c1 -> gamma rho^0 and chi_c1 -> gamma omega are observed
with B(chi_c1 -> gamma rho^0) = (2.43 +- 0.19 +- 0.22) x 10^-4 and B(chi_c1 ->
gamma omega) = (8.3 +- 1.5 +- 1.2) x 10^-5. In the chi_c1 -> gamma rho^0
transition, the final state meson is dominantly longitudinally polarized. Upper
limits on the branching fractions of other chi_cJ states to light vector mesons
are presented.
