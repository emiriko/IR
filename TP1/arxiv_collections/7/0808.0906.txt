We have investigated the behavior of the resistance of graphene at the $n=0$
Landau Level in an intense magnetic field $H$. Employing a low-dissipation
technique (with power $P<$3 fW), we find that, at low temperature $T$, the
resistance at the Dirac point $R_0(H)$ undergoes a 1000-fold increase from
$\sim$10 k$\Omega$ to 40 M$\Omega$ within a narrow interval of field. The
abruptness of the increase suggests that a transition to an insulating, ordered
state occurs at the critical field $H_c$. Results from 5 samples show that
$H_c$ depends systematically on the disorder, as measured by the offset gate
voltage $V_0$. Samples with small $V_0$ display a smaller critical field $H_c$.
Empirically, the steep increase in $R_0$ fits acccurately a
Kosterlitz-Thouless-type correlation length over 3 decades. The curves of $R_0$
vs. $T$ at fixed $H$ approach the thermal-activation form with a gap
$\Delta\sim$15 K as $H\to H_c^{-}$, consistent with a field-induced insulating
state.
