This paper reports viscosity data for mixtures containing a refrigerant
(HFC-134a) and a lubricant (triethylene glycol dimethyether, TriEGDME, or
tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether, TEGDME), at 12% of TriEGDME or 14% mass
fraction of TEGDME. The measurements (140 data points) were obtained at various
pressures (between 10 and 140 MPa) in the monophasic liquid state from 293.15
to 373.15 K. Because HFC-134a and the polyethers are not in the same single
phase at normal pressure and temperature (the refrigerant is a gas, whereas the
polyethers are liquids), accurate measurements of their mixtures require
specific procedures for preparation of the samples and filling of the
apparatus. A specially designed isobaric-transfer falling-body viscometer is
used in this work. The viscosities of the mixtures are, on average, 40% higher
than that of the pure refrigerant, and this increase is more noticeable at low
temperatures. The experimental viscosities have been used to check the
predictive and correlation ability of several viscosity models (mixing rules,
Geller and Davis method, self-referencing model, hard-sphere theory,
free-volume model, and friction theory). Most of the studied models
underestimate the dynamic viscosity values over all of the temperature and
pressure ranges investigated.
