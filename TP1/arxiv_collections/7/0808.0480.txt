The sequence-dependent folding landscapes of nucleic acid hairpins reflect
much of the complexity of biomolecular folding. Folding trajectories, generated
using single molecule force clamp experiments by attaching semiflexible
polymers to the ends of hairpins have been used to infer their folding
landscapes. Using simulations and theory, we study the effect of the dynamics
of the attached handles on the handle-free RNA free energy profile
$F^o_{eq}(z_m)$, where $z_m$ is the molecular extension of the hairpin.
Accurate measurements of $F^o_{eq}(z_m)$ requires stiff polymers with small
$L/l_p$, where $L$ is the contour length of the handle, and $l_p$ is the
persistence length. Paradoxically, reliable estimates of the hopping rates can
only be made using flexible handles. Nevertheless, we show that the equilibrium
free energy profile $F^o_{eq}(z_m)$ at an external tension $f_m$, the force
($f$) at which the folded and unfolded states are equally populated, in
conjunction with Kramers' theory, can provide accurate estimates of the
force-dependent hopping rates in the absence of handles at arbitrary values of
$f$. Our theoretical framework shows that $z_m$ is a good reaction coordinate
for nucleic acid hairpins under tension.
