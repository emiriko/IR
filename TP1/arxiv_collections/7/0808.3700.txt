We confront the latest H1 and ZEUS data on diffractive dijet photoproduction
with next-to-leading order QCD predictions in order to determine whether a
rapidity gap survival probability of less than one is supported by the data. We
find evidence for this hypothesis when assuming global factorization breaking
for both the direct and resolved photon contributions, in which case the
survival probability would have to be E_T^jet-dependent, and for the resolved
or in addition the related direct initial-state singular contribution only,
where it would be independent of E_T^jet.
