We give bounds for the global attractor of the delay differential equation
$x'(t) =-\mu x(t)+f(x(t-\tau))$, where $f$ is unimodal and has negative
Schwarzian derivative. If $f$ and $\mu$ satisfy certain condition, then,
regardless of the delay, all solutions enter the domain where f is monotone
decreasing and the powerful results for delayed monotone feedback can be
applied to describe the asymptotic behaviour of solutions. In this situation we
determine the sharpest interval that contains the global attractor for any
delay. In the absence of that condition, improving earlier results, we show
that if the d5A5Aelay is sufficiently small, then all solution enter the domain
where $f'$ is negative. Our theorems then are illustrated by numerical examples
using Nicholson's blowflies equation and the Mackey-Glass equation.
