We present measurements of net charge fluctuations in $Au + Au$ collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $ 19.6, 62.4, 130, and 200 GeV, $Cu + Cu$ collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $ 62.4, 200 GeV, and $p + p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = $ 200
GeV using the net charge dynamical fluctuations measure $\nu_{+-,dyn}$. The
dynamical fluctuations are non-zero at all energies and exhibit a rather modest
dependence on beam energy. We find that at a given energy and collision system,
net charge dynamical fluctuations violate $1/N_{ch}$ scaling, but display
approximate $1/N_{part}$ scaling. We observe strong dependence of dynamical
fluctuations on the azimuthal angular range and pseudorapidity widths.
