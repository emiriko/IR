We perform no-core full configuration calculations for a set of light nuclei
including $^{16}$O with a realistic NN interaction, JISP16. We obtain ground
state energies and their uncertainties through exponential extrapolations that
we demonstrate are reliable in $^2$H, $^3$H and $^4$He test cases where fully
converged results are obtained directly. We find that $^6$He, $^6$Li and $^8$He
are underbound by about 600 keV, 560 keV and 1.7 MeV, respectively. $^{12}$C is
overbound by about 1.7 MeV and $^{16}$O is overbound by about 16 MeV. The first
excited $0^+$ states in $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O are also evaluated but their
uncertainties are significantly larger than the uncertainties for the ground
states.
