This paper proposes rigorous geometrical treatment of bioelectrodynamics,
underpinning two fast-growing biomedical research fields: bioelectromagnetism,
which deals with the ability of life to produce its own electromagnetism, and
bioelectromagnetics, which deals with the effect on life from external
electromagnetism.
