Tribimaximal lepton mixing can be obtained assuming A4 flavour symmetry. Many
possibilities have been explored in the literature and we give a classification
in terms of A4 representations. We propose some phenomenological and
theoretical criteria to distinguish between different assignment. As example we
consider the possibility to extend A4 to SO(10) grand unified model.
