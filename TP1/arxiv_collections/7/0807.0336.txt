Let EMBED(k,d) be the following algorithmic problem: Given a finite
simplicial complex K of dimension at most k, does there exist a (piecewise
linear) embedding of K into R^d? Known results easily imply polynomiality of
EMBED(k,2) (k=1,2; the case k=1, d=2 is graph planarity) and of EMBED(k,2k) for
all k>2 (even if k is not considered fixed).
  We observe that the celebrated result of Novikov on the algorithmic
unsolvability of recognizing the 5-sphere implies that EMBED(d,d) and
EMBED(d-1,d) are undecidable for each d>4. Our main result is NP-hardness of
EMBED(2,4) and, more generally, of EMBED(k,d) for all k,d with d>3 and d\geq k
\geq (2d-2)/3. These dimensions fall outside the so-called metastable range of
a theorem of Haefliger and Weber, which characterizes embeddability using the
deleted product obstruction. Our reductions are based on examples, due to
Segal, Spie\.z, Freedman, Krushkal, Teichner, and Skopenkov, showing that
outside the metastable range the deleted product obstruction is not sufficient
to characterize embeddability.
