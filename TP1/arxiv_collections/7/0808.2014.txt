We demonstrate how CP violation manifests itself in the Higgs sector of the
minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). Starting with a
brief introduction to CP violation in the MSSM and its effects on the Higgs
sector, we discuss some phenomenological aspects of the Higgs sector CP
violation based on the two scenarios called CPX and Trimixing
