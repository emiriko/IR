A comparative study of thermal properties of SmFeAsO, SmFeAs(O0.93F0.07) and
SmFeAs(O0.85F0.15) samples is presented. Specific heat and thermal conductivity
show clear evidences of the spin density wave (SDW) ordering below TSDW 135 K
in undoped SmFeAsO. At low level of F-doping, SmFeAs(O0.93F0.07), SDW ordering
is suppressed and superconducting features are not yet optimally developed in
both specific heat and thermal conductivity. At optimal level of F-doping
SmFeAs(O0.85F0.15) anomalies related to the superconducting transition are well
noticeable. By a compared analysis of doped and undoped samples we conclude
that, despite F-doping modifies definitely the electronic ground state, it does
not substantially alter phonon and electron parameters, like phonon modes,
Sommerfeld coefficient, electro-phonon coupling. The analysis of the thermal
conductivity curves provides an evaluation of SDW and superconducting energy
gap, showing that phonons can suitably probe features of electronic ground
state.
