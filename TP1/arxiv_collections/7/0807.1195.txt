The topological susceptibility is calculated within the Hamiltonian approach
to Yang-Mills theory in Coulomb gauge, using the vacuum wave functional
previously determined by a variational solution of the Yang-Mills Schroedinger
equation. The numerical result agrees qualitatively with the predictions of
lattice simulations.
