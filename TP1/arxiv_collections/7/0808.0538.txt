We demonstrate an alternative nuclear spin resonance using radio frequency
(RF) electric field (nuclear electric resonance: NER) instead of magnetic
field. The NER is based on the electronic control of electron spins forming a
domain structure. The RF electric field applied to a gate excites spatial
oscillations of the domain walls and thus temporal oscillations of the
hyperfine field to nuclear spins. The RF power and burst duration dependence of
the NER spectrum provides insight into the interplay between nuclear spins and
the oscillating domain walls.
