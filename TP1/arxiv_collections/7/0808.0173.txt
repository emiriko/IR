It is found that, in closed-$l$-subshell atoms, the exact local exchange
potential of the density functional theory is very well represented, within the
region of every atomic shell, by each of the suitably shifted potentials
obtained with the non-local Fock exchange operator acting on the Hartree-Fock
(HF) orbitals that belong to this shell. This explains the outstanding
proximity of Kohn-Sham and HF orbitals and the high quality of the
Krieger-Li-Iafrate and localized HF (or, equivalently,
common-energy-denominator) approximations to the exchange potential.
