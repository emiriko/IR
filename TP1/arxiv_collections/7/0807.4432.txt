We report on a study of electronic transport in semi-metallic
Bi$_{0.96}$Sb$_{0.04}$. At zero field, the system is a very dilute Fermi liquid
displaying a T$^{2}$ resistivity with an enhanced prefactor. Quantum
oscillations in resistivity as well as in Hall, Nernst and Seebeck responses of
the system are detectable and their period quantifies the shrinking of the
Fermi surface with antimony doping. For a field along the trigonal axis, the
quantum limit was found to occur at a field as low as 3T. An ultraquantum
anomaly at twice this field was detected in both charge transport and Nernst
response. Its origin appears to lie beyond the one-particle picture and linked
to unidentified many-body effects.
