Using a dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo approximation, we investigate
the effect of local disorder on the stability of d-wave superconductivity
including the effect of electronic correlations in both particle-particle and
particle-hole channels. With increasing impurity potential, we find an initial
rise of the critical temperature due to an enhancement of anti-ferromagnetic
spin correlations, followed by a decrease of Tc due to scattering from
impurity-induced moments and ordinary pairbreaking. We discuss the weak initial
dependence of Tc on impurity concentration found in comparison to experiments
on cuprates.
