Accurate QED calculation of transition probabilities for the low-lying
two-electron configurations of multicharged ions is presented. The calculation
is performed for the nondegenerate states $(1s2s) 3S1$, $(1s2p_{3/2}) 3P2$ ($M
1$ and $M 2$ transitions, respectively) and for the quasidegenerate states
$(1s2p) 1P1$, $(1s2p) 3P1$ ($E 1$ transitions) decaying to the ground state
$(1s1s) 1S0$. Two-electron ions with nuclear charge numbers $Z=10-92$ are
considered. The line profile approach is employed for the description of the
process in multicharged ions within the framework of QED.
