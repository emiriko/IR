In many applications sampled data are collected in irregular fashion or are
partly lost or unavailable. In these cases it is required to convert
irregularly sampled signals to regularly sampled ones or to restore missing
data. In this paper, we address this problem in a framework of a discrete
sampling theorem for band-limited discrete signals that have a limited number
of non-zero transform coefficients in a certain transform domain. Conditions
for the image unique recovery, from sparse samples, are formulated and then
analyzed for various transforms. Applications are demonstrated on examples of
image super-resolution and image reconstruction from sparse projections.
