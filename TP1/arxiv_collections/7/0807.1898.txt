Protein domains are found on genomes with notable statistical distributions,
which bear a high degree of similarity. Previous work has shown how these
distributions can be accounted for by simple models, where the main ingredients
are probabilities of duplication, innovation, and loss of domains. However, no
one so far has addressed the issue that these distributions follow definite
trends depending on protein-coding genome size only. We present a stochastic
duplication/innovation model, falling in the class of so-called Chinese
Restaurant Processes, able to explain this feature of the data. Using only two
universal parameters, related to a minimal number of domains and to the
relative weight of innovation to duplication, the model reproduces two
important aspects: (a) the populations of domain classes (the sets, related to
homology classes, containing realizations of the same domain in different
proteins) follow common power-laws whose cutoff is dictated by genome size, and
(b) the number of domain families is universal and markedly sublinear in genome
size. An important ingredient of the model is that the innovation probability
decreases with genome size. We propose the possibility to interpret this as a
global constraint given by the cost of expanding an increasingly complex
interactome.
