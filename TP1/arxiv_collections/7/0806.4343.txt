We investigate the relationship between electronics and geometry in a
nonplanar SiGe/Si resonant quantum cavity (RQC) subject to a magnetic field.
The transfer matrix technique originally due to Usuki and coworkers (Phys. Rev.
B 52, 8244 1995) has been modified to account for the nonzero local curvature
of the RQC. Our results demonstrate that low-temperature ballistic
magnetoconductance in nonplanar RQCs is highly sensitive to the changes in
curvature for a wide range of magnetic field strengths.
