We compute the corrections, using the tunneling formalisim based on a quantum
WKB approach, to the Hawking temperature and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for the
Schwarzschild black hole. The results are related to the trace anomaly and are
shown to be equivalent to findings inferred from Hawking's original calculation
based on path integrals using zeta function regularization. Finally, exploiting
the corrected temperature and periodicity arguments we also find the
modification to the original Schwarzschild metric which captures the effect of
quantum corrections.
