In this paper, we present the results of a study made for the effect of
nuclear medium in the charged current induced quasielastic lepton
production(CCQE) and the incoherent and coherent one pion production
(CC1$\pi^+$)processes from $^{12}C$ in the $\nu_\mu$ energy region of 0.4-3GeV.
The theoretical results are compared with the recent experimental results for
the ratio of charged current $\nu_\mu$ induced one pion production cross
section to the quasielastic lepton production cross section reported by K2K
collaboration. We also present the results for the angular and momentum
distributions of leptons and pions produced in these processes.
