We have studied interoccurrence time distributions by analyzing the synthetic
and three natural catalogs of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the
Southern California Earthquake Data Center (SCEDC), and Taiwan Central Weather
Bureau (TCWB) and revealed the universal feature of the interoccurrence time
statistics, Weibull - log Weibull transition. This transition reinforces the
view that the interoccurrence time statistics possess Weibull statistics and
log-Weibull statistics. Here in this paper, the crossover magnitude from the
superposition regime to the Weibull regime $m_c^2$ is proportional to the plate
velocity. In addition, we have found the region-independent relation,
$m_c^2/m_{max} = 0.54 \pm 0.004$.
