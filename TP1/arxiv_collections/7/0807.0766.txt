We report the observation of quantum jumps between macroscopic quantum states
in a superconducting phase qubit coupled to the two-level systems in the
Josephson tunnel junction, and all key features of quantum jumps are confirmed
in the experiments. Moreover, quantum jumps can be used to calibrate such
two-level systems, which are believed to be one of the main decoherence sources
in Josephson devices.
