We suggest a scenario where the three light quark flavors are sequentially
deconfined under increasing pressure in cold asymmetric nuclear matter, e.g.,
as in neutron stars. The basis for our analysis is a chiral quark matter model
of Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type with diquark pairing in the spin-1 single
flavor (CSL) and spin-0 two/three flavor (2SC/CFL) channels, and a
Dirac-Brueckner Hartree-Fock (DBHF) approach in the nuclear matter sector. We
find that nucleon dissociation sets in at about the saturation density, n_0,
when the down-quark Fermi sea is populated (d-quark dripline) due to the flavor
asymmetry imposed by beta-equilibrium and charge neutrality. At about 3n_0
u-quarks appear forming a two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) phase, while
the s-quark Fermi sea is populated only at still higher baryon density. The
hybrid star sequence has a maximum mass of 2.1 M_sun. Two- and three-flavor
quark matter phases are found only in gravitationally unstable hybrid star
solutions.
