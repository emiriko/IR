Three different strategies to extract the weak mixing phase phi_s of the Bs
system using B--> VV decays (Bs--> K* anti-K*, Bs--> phi anti-K* and Bs--> phi
phi) are discussed. Those penguin-mediated decays are computed in the framework
of a new combined QCD-Factorisation/Flavour Symmetry Method. Also some comments
on the recent interesting results found by Babar concerning the decay B--> K*
l+l- are included.
