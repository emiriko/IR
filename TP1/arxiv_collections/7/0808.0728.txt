Numerous searches for evidence of supersymmetry at the Tevatron have been
performed by the CDF and D0 collaborations. Recent results are presented here
including squarks and gluinos in jets and missing transverse energy, stop in
several different decay modes, charginos and neutralinos in trileptons,
neutralinos in di-photons, R-parity violating sneutrinos in e+mu events, and
long-lived particles. These explore many variations of SUSY such as MSSM,
mSUGRA, and GMSB. While no evidence of SUSY production is observed, 95% CL
limits on cross sections and SUSY parameter space are set. Most of these limits
are the world's best.
