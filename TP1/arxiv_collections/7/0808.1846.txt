We formulate a complete theory of Edge Radiation based on a novel method
relying on Fourier Optics techniques. Similar types of radiation like
Transition Undulator Radiation are addressed in the framework of the same
formalism. Special attention is payed in discussing the validity of
approximations upon which the theory is built. Our study makes consistent use
of both similarity techniques and comparisons with numerical results from
simulation. We discuss both near and far zone. Physical understanding of many
asymptotes is discussed. Based on the solution of the field equation with a
tensor Green's function technique, we also discuss an analytical model to
describe the presence of a vacuum chamber. In particular, explicit calculations
for a circular vacuum chamber are reported. Finally, we consider the use of
Edge Radiation as a tool for electron beam diagnostics. We discuss Coherent
Edge Radiation, Extraction of Edge Radiation by a mirror, and other issues
becoming important at high electron energy and long radiation wavelength. Based
on this work we also study the impact of Edge Radiation on XFEL setups and we
discuss recent results.
