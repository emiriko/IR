A local theory with a local correlation is proposed to give an explanation
for the contractions in the GHZ-like proofs for Bell's theorem and the
violation to Bell's inequality. It agrees with the experimental predictions for
the GHZ state of three entangled spins, the Bell state of two entangled spins
and one spin state. It is found that the contradiction in the GHZ-like proofs
and the violation to Bell's inequality can be attributed to the local
correlation.
