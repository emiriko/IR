We consider a scheme of quantum teleportation where a receiver has multiple
(N) output ports and obtains the teleported state by merely selecting one of
the N ports according to the outcome of the sender's measurement. We
demonstrate that such teleportation is possible by showing an explicit protocol
where N pairs of maximally entangled qubits are employed. The optimal
measurement performed by a sender is the square-root measurement, and a perfect
teleportation fidelity is asymptotically achieved for a large N limit. Such
asymptotic teleportation can be utilized as a universal programmable processor.
