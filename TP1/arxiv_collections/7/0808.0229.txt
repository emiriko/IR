The scaling of the optimal cooling power of a reciprocating quantum
refrigerator is sought as a function of the cold bath temperature as $T_c \to
0$. The working medium consists of noninteracting particles in a harmonic
potential. Two closed-form solutions of the refrigeration cycle are analyzed,
and compared to a numerical optimization scheme, focusing on cooling toward
zero temperature. The optimal cycle is characterized by linear relations
between the heat extracted from the cold bath, the energy level spacing of the
working medium and the temperature. The scaling of the optimal cooling rate is
found to be proportional to $T_c^{3/2}$ giving a dynamical interpretation to
the third law of thermodynamics.
