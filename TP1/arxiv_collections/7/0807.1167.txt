We study gauge/string duality with flavor degrees of freedom in type 0B
string theory. We construct a model by placing the N_f probe D9_-/anti-D9_-
brane pairs in the background of the N_c electric D3-branes. This model has
some features in common with QCD, as in AdS/QCD model. By analyzing the
effective action, we obtain the linear confinement behavior for the masses of
the highly excited spin-1 mesons.
