In this paper we study a two-step version of EPR-B experiment, the Bohm
version of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment. Its theoretical resolution
in space and time enables us to refute the classic "impossibility" to decompose
a pair of entangled atoms into two distinct states, one for each atom. We
propose a new causal interpretation of the EPR-B experiment where each atom has
a position and a spin while the singlet wave function verifies the two-body
Pauli equation. In conclusion we suggest a physical explanation of non-local
influences, compatible with Einstein's point of view on relativity.
