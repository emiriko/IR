Effects of strong electric fields on hopping conductivity are studied
theoretically. Monte-Carlo computer simulations show that the analytical theory
of Nguyen and Shklovskii [Solid State Commun. 38, 99 (1981)] provides an
accurate description of hopping transport in the limit of very high electric
fields and low concentrations of charge carriers as compared to the
concentration of localization sites and also at the relative concentration of
carriers equal to 0.5. At intermediate concentrations of carriers between 0.1
and 0.5 computer simulations evidence essential deviations from the results of
the existing analytical theories.
  The theory of Nguyen and Shklovskii also predicts a negative differential
hopping conductivity at high electric fields. Our numerical calculations
confirm this prediction qualitatively. However the field dependence of the
drift velocity of charge carriers obtained numerically differs essentially from
the one predicted so far. Analytical theory is further developed so that its
agreement with numerical results is essentially improved.
