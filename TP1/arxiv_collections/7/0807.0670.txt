We report on the quantum interference and spin accumulation on double quantum
dots with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interaction, based
on the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green function formalism. It is shown that Rashba
spin-orbit interaction can strongly affect the conductance spectrum. By
gradually increasing the Rashba parameter from zero, Fano resonances in strong
overlap regime continuously evolve to resolve antiresonances. This transition
is ascribed to the phase shift of couplings between molecular states and the
lead due to spin precession. We also show that both bias and Rashba effect
strengthen the induced spin polarization in this device. For particular energy
position, up- and down-spin electron occupation can intersect to form a
crossing point. Spin polarization on different side of this point has opposite
sign in consequence. The magnitude and direction of spin polarization are
therefore controllable by tuning the dot levels and the Rashba parameter
through gates.
