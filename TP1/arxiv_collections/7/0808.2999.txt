The nucleation process under different external conditions is considered. It
is shown that the duration of this process can be connected with the
microscopic corrections to the free energy of the critical embryo. Connection
between variations in the value of the critical embryo free energy and the
duration of the nucleation stage is given for several types of external
conditions. This connection is in some cases reciprocal to uncertainty relation
in quantum theory. In Appendix the derivation of main features of the general
theory on the base of restrictions coming from the possibility of effective and
stable observations is given.
