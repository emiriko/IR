The electroweak radiative correction, which turned out to be marginal within
the standard electroweak model having the minimal Higgs sector in view of the
present experimental information, fits well the experiment when the Higgs
sector is extended to have two Higgs doublets. We predict the range where the
charged and CP odd Higgs boson masses would lie, taking the two CP even neutral
Higgs boson masses to be degenerate which makes the analysis in multiparameter
space feasible. It is shown that the mass of neutral Higgs doublet boson can
arbitrarily be large consistently with the $W$ mass, if the charged Higgs boson
is present and it's mass lies in some appropriate ranges.
