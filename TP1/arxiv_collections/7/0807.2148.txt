We present an analysis of the static properties of heavy baryons at
next-to-leading order in the perurbative expansion of QCD. We obtain analytical
next-to-leading order three-loop results for the two-point correlators of
baryonic currents with one finite mass quark field for a variety of quantum
numbers of the baryonic currents. We consider both the massless limit and the
HQET limit of the correlator as special cases of the general finite mass
formula and find agreement with previous results. We present closed form
expressions for the moments of the spectral density. We determine the residues
of physical baryon states using sum rule techniques.
