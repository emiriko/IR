Motivated by signal processing, we present a new class of channel codes,
called signal codes, for continuous-alphabet channels. Signal codes are lattice
codes whose encoding is done by convolving an integer information sequence with
a fixed filter pattern. Decoding is based on the bidirectional sequential stack
decoder, which can be implemented efficiently using the heap data structure.
Error analysis and simulation results indicate that signal codes can achieve
low error rate at approximately 1dB from channel capacity.
