Motivated by the possibility of pressure-induced exciton condensation in
intermediate-valence Tm[Se,Te] compounds we study the Falicov-Kimball model
extended by a finite f-hole valence bandwidth. Calculating the Frenkel-type
exciton propagator we obtain excitonic bound states above a characteristic
value of the local interband Coulomb attraction. Depending on the system
parameters coherence between c- and f-states may be established at low
temperatures, leading to an excitonic insulator phase. We find strong evidence
that the excitonic insulator typifies either a BCS condensate of electron-hole
pairs (weak-coupling regime) or a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of preformed
excitons (strong-coupling regime), which points towards a BCS-BEC transition
scenario as Coulomb correlations increase.
