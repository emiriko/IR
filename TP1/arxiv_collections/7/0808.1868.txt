We investigate several scaling properties of a translocating homopolymer
through a thin pore driven by an external field present inside the pore only
using Langevin Dynamics (LD) simulation in three dimension (3D). Specifically
motivated by several recent theoretical and numerical studies that are
apparently at odds with each other, we determine the chain length dependence of
the scaling exponents of the average translocation time, the average velocity
of the center of mass, $<v_{CM}>$, the effective radius of gyration during the
translocation process, and the scaling exponent of the translocation coordinate
($s$-coordinate) as a function of the translocation time. We further discuss
the possibility that in the case of driven translocation the finite pore size
and its geometry could be responsible that the veclocity scaling exponent is
less than unity and discuss the dependence of the scaling exponents on the pore
geometry for the range of $N$ studied here.
