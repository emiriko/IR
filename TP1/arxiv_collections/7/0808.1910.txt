We consider Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs) with a finite
set of discrete states. In the regime of fast jumps between discrete states, we
prove a law of large number and a large deviation principle. In the regime of
fast and slow jumps, we analyze a coarse-grained process associated to the
original one and prove its convergence to a new PDMP with effective force
fields and jump rates. In all the above cases, the continuous variables evolve
slowly according to ODEs.
  Finally, we discuss some applications related to the mechanochemical cycle of
macromolecules, including strained--dependent power--stroke molecular motors.
Our analysis covers the case of fully--coupled slow and fast motions.
