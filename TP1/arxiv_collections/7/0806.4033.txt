We expose the role of collisional energy loss on high $p_T$ photon data
measured by PHENIX collaboration by calculating photon yield in jet plasma
interaction. The phase space distribution of the participating jet is
dynamically evolved by solving Fokker-Planck equation. It is shown that the
data is reasonably well reproduced when contributions from all the relevant
sources are taken into account. Predictions at higher beam energies relevant
for LHC experiment have been made.
