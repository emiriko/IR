The beam-beam effects have been the dominating sources of beam loss and
lifetime limitations in the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider [1]. Electron
lenses were originally proposed for compensation of electromagnetic long-range
and head-on beam-beam interactions of proton and antiproton beams [2]. Results
of successful employment of two electron lenses built and installed in the
Tevatron are reported in [3,4,5]. In this paper we present design features of
the Tevatron electron lenses (TELs), discuss the generation of electron beams,
describe different modes of operation and outline the technical parameters of
various subsystems.
