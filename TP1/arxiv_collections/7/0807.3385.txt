We investigate the physics potential of NuSOnG experiment to probe new
physics contributions to Z-neutrino-neutrino couplings in muon-neutrino
electron elastic and neutral-current deep-inelastic scattering processes. We
employ an effective Lagrangian approach and do not a priori assume universality
of the coupling of neutrinos to Z. We obtain 95% C.L. limits on possible
universality violating couplings.
