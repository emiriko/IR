The suggestion of writing, for some problems, nonlinear state equations not
as dx/dt = F(x,u,t), but as dx/dt = [A(t,x)]x + [B(t,x)]u(t), which is more
"constructive", is considered supported by arguments related to: the
axiomatization of system theory, the classification of switched circuits as
linear and nonlinear, the use of nonlinear sampling for measuring frequency
without clock, the consideration of an ensemble of colliding particles in which
the establishing of the chaotic movements is seen as a result of the same kind
of nonlinearity as in electronic switching circuits, the modeling of a liquid
medium as a "system" whose structure is directly influenced by the "input", and
some other problems.
