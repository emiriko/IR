Possible analogies between vacuum state and quantum fluid provide a model to
study vacuum energy density induced by thermal corrections, space-time
curvature, boundary conditions and quantum back-reaction. We find that vacuum
energy density in this quantum fluid model is not naturally of the order of the
matter energy density. We show how higher-order corrections in quantum
back-reaction can also contribute to vacuum energy density, and how the
cosmological expansion is a manifestation of an universe out of mechanical
equilibrium. This last fact implies that simple thermodynamic arguments are not
enough to explain the cosmological constant problem due to the calculation of
the associated vacuum energy density requires first the knowing of the
underlying microscopic physics of vacuum.
