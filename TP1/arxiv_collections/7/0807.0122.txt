Self-arrangement of individuals into spatial patterns often accompanies and
promotes species diversity in ecological systems. Here, we investigate pattern
formation arising from cyclic dominance of three species, operating near a
bifurcation point. In its vicinity, an Eckhaus instability occurs, leading to
convectively unstable "blurred" patterns. At the bifurcation point, stochastic
effects dominate and induce counterintuitive effects on diversity: Large
patterns, emerging for medium values of individuals' mobility, lead to rapid
species extinction, while small patterns (low mobility) promote diversity, and
high mobilities render spatial structures irrelevant. We provide a quantitative
analysis of these phenomena, employing a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation.
