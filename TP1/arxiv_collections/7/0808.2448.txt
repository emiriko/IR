The transverse part of the three-point Green function of massless QED is
determined to the lowest order in position space. Taken together with the
evaluation of the longitudinal part in arXiv:0803.2630, this gives a relation
for QED which is analogous to the star-triangle relation. We relate our result
to conformal-invariant three-point functions.
