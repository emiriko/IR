Entanglement distillation is a procedure for extracting from one or more
pairs of entangled qubits a smaller number of pairs with a higher degree of
entanglement that is essential for many applications in quantum information
science. Schmidt projection is a unique distillation method that can be applied
to more than two pairs of entangled qubits at the same time with high
efficiency. We implement the Schmidt projection protocol by applying
single-photon two-qubit quantum logic to a partially hyperentangled four-qubit
input state. The basic elements of the procedure are characterized and we
confirm that the output of Schmidt projection is always maximally entangled
independent of the input entanglement quality and that the measured
distillation efficiency agrees with theoretical predictions. We show that our
implementation strategy can be applied to other quantum systems such as trapped
atoms and trapped ions.
