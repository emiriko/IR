The density of states of graphene has Van Hove singularities that can be
reached by chemical doping and have already been explored in photoemission
experiments. We show that in the presence of Coulomb interactions the system at
the Van Hove filling is likely to undergo a Pomeranchuk instability breaking
the lattice point group symmetry. In the presence of an on--site Hubbard
interaction the system is also unstable towards ferromagnetism. We explore the
competition of the two instabilities and build the phase diagram. We also
suggest that, for doping levels where the trigonal warping is noticeable, the
Fermi liquid state in graphene can be stable up to zero temperature avoiding
the Kohn--Luttinger mechanism and providing an example of two dimensional Fermi
liquid at zero temperature.
