The present status of double beta decay experiments (including the search for
$2\beta^{+}$, EC$\beta^{+}$ and ECEC processes) are reviewed. The results of
the most sensitive experiments are discussed. Average and recommended half-life
values for two-neutrino double beta decay are presented. Conservative upper
limits on effective Majorana neutrino mass and the coupling constant of the
Majoron to the neutrino are established as $<m_{\nu} > < 0.75$ eV and $<g_{ee}
> < 1.9 \cdot 10^{-4}$, respectively. Proposals for future double beta decay
experiments with a sensitivity for the $<m_{\nu}>$ at the level of (0.01-0.1)
eV are considered.
