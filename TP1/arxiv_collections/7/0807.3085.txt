The ground-state exciton binding energy for single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs) in vacuum calculated ignoring the screening of Coulomb interaction
appears to be much greater than the corresponding band gap. The most essential
contributions to the screening of electron-hole (e-h) interaction potential in
semiconducting SWCNTs, which return the ground-state exciton binding energy
into the energy gap, are considered. Our estimates on the screening effects and
exciton binding energies are in satisfactory agreement with the corresponding
experimental data for concrete nanotubes.
