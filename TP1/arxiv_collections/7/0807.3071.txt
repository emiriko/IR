In this paper we have studied, by means of high-resolution neutron powder
diffraction and magnetic susceptibility, the structural and magnetic features
of selected samples of the HoBaCo2O5+delta layered cobaltite in the low oxygen
content range (0.02<delta<0.22). The results shows a strong antiferromagnetic
contribution at room temperature coupled to an intermediate spin state of the
Co3+ ions.
