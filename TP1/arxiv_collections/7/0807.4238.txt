We study the evolution of both scalar and tensor cosmological perturbations
in a Randall-Sundrum braneworld having an arbitrary expansion history. We adopt
a four dimensional point of view where the degrees of freedom on the brane
constitute an open quantum system coupled to an environment composed of the
bulk gravitons. Due to the expansion of the universe, the brane degrees of
freedom and the bulk degrees of freedom interact as they propagate forward in
time. Brane excitations may decay through the emission of bulk gravitons which
may escape to future infinity, leading to a sort of dissipation from the four
dimensional point of view of an observer on the brane. Bulk gravitons may also
be reflected off of the curved bulk and reabsorbed by the brane, thereby
transformed into quanta on the brane, leading to a sort of nonlocality from the
four dimensional point of view. The dissipation and the nonlocality are encoded
into the retarded bulk propagator. We estimate the dissipation rates of the
bound state as well as of the matter degrees of freedom at different
cosmological epochs and for different sources of matter on the brane. We use a
near-brane limit of the bulk geometry for the study when purely nonlocal bulk
effects are encountered.
