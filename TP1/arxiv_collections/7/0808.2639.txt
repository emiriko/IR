We develop a theoretical model to study the Intensity-Intensity correlation
of polarization entangled photons emitted in a biexciton-exciton cascade. We
calculate the degree of correlation and show how polarization correlation are
affected by the presence of dephasing and energy level splitting of the
excitonic states. Our theoretical calculations are in agreement with the recent
observation of polarization dependent Intensity-Intensity correlations from a
single semiconductor quantum dot [R. M. Stevenson et. al., Nature 439, 179
(2006)] . Our model can be extended to study polarization entangled photon
emission in coupled quantum dot systems.
