It is usually assumed that the high-energy evolution of partons in QCD
remains local in coordinate space. In particular, fixed impact-parameter
scattering is thought to be in the universality class of one-dimensional
reaction-diffusion processes as if the evolutions at different points in the
transverse plane became uncorrelated through rapidity evolution. We check this
assumption by numerically comparing a toy model with QCD-like impact-parameter
dependence to its exact counterpart with uniform evolution in impact-parameter
space. We find quantitative differences, but which seem to amount to a mere
rescaling of the strong coupling constant. Since the rescaling factor does not
show any strong alpha_s-dependence, we conclude that locality is well verified,
up to subleading terms at small alpha_s.
