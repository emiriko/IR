We present realistic simulations of quantum confinement effects in ballistic
graphene quantum dots with linear dimensions of 10 to 40 nm. We determine
wavefunctions and energy level statistics in the presence of disorder resulting
from edge roughness, charge impurities, or short-ranged scatterers. Marked
deviations from a simple Dirac billiard for massless fermions are found. We
find a remarkably stable dependence of the nearest-neighbor level spacing on
edge roughness suggesting that the roughness of fabricated devices can be
potentially characterized by the distribution of measured Coulomb blockade
peaks.
