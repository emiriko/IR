We review the recently proposed elastic approach to glass transition. This
approach is based on a simple and a physically transparent idea of elastic
interactions between local relaxation events in a liquid. Central to this
picture is the range of this interaction. Its increase on lowering the
temperature explains several important open questions in the area of glass
transition, including universal relaxation laws and dynamic crossovers. In
particular, we show how the proposed theory explains (1) the physical origin of
cooperativity of relaxation; (2) the origin of the crossover from exponential
to non-exponential relaxation at $\tau=$1 ps, where $\tau$ is liquid relaxation
time; (3) the origin of the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann law; (4) the origin of
stretched-exponential relaxation; (5) the absence of divergence of $\tau$ at
the VFT temperature $T_0$ and the crossover to a more Arrhenius relaxation at
$\tau\approx 10^{-6}$ sec; (6) the origin of liquid ``fragility''; and (7) the
relationship between non-exponentiality of relaxation and relaxation time.
