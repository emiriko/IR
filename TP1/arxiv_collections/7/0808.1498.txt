An elliptic cylindrical wave expansion method by using Mathieu functions is
developed to obtain the scattering field for a two-dimensional elliptic
cylindrical invisibility cloak. The cloak material parameters are obtained from
the spatial transformation approach. A near-ideal model of the invisibility
cloak is set up to solve the boundary problem at the inner boundary in the
cloak shell. The proposed design provides a more practical cloak geometry when
compared to previous designs of elliptic cylindrical cloaks.
