We study the dynamics of fermions on graphene in presence of Coulomb
impurities and Aharonov-Bohm field. Special emphasis is given to the formation
of hydrino like states and its lifting of degeneracy due to the presence of AB
field. The flux of the AB field can be tuned to make the low angular momentum
hydrino states stable against decay. The zero limit physics of the two coupling
constants \alpha_G and \Phi involved in the system is discussed.
