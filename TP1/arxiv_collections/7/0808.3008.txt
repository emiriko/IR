The very large K-factor for Higgs-boson production at hadron colliders is
shown to result from enhanced perturbative corrections of the form
(C_A\pi\alpha_s)^n, which arise in the analytic continuation of the gluon form
factor to time-like momentum transfer. These terms are resummed to all orders
in perturbation theory using the renormalization group. After the resummation,
the K-factor for the production of a light Higgs boson at the LHC is reduced to
a value close to 1.3.
