To remove the linear infrared divergences in quenched approximation we
include the massive fermion loop to the photon spectral function.Spectral
function of fermion has no one particle singularity if we fix the anomalous
dimension to be unity.In the case of $N$ flavour,$N$ dependence of order
parameter is mild which may be due to screening effects.
