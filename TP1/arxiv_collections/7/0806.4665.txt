The energy-momentum tensor of a supersonic heavy quark jet moving through a
strongly-coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma is analyzed in terms of first-order
Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics. We focus on the near zone ``head'' region close to
the heavy quark where deviations from hydrodynamic behavior are expected to be
large. For realistic quark velocities, $v=0.99$, we find that the
non-hydrodynamical head region is confined at a narrow pancake surrounding the
jet with a width $\sim 1/T$ and transverse radius $\sim 3/T$. Outside this jet
head region, the jet induced stress is well approximated by Navier-Stokes
hydrodynamics.
