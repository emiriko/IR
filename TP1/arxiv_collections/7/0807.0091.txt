We have calculated the frequency-dependent exact exchange (EXX) kernel of
time-dependent (TD) density functional theory employing our recently proposed
computational method based on cubic splines. With this kernel we have
calculated the linear density response function and obtained static
polarizabilites, van der Waals coefficients and correlation energies for all
spherical spin compensated atoms up to Argon. Some discrete excitation energies
have also been calculated for Be and Ne. As might be expected, the results of
the TDEXX approximation are close to those of TD Hartree-Fock theory. In
addition, correlation energies obtained by integrating over the strength of the
Coulomb interaction turn out to be highly accurate.
