The computed $\alpha$ particle momentum distributions from the decay of
low-lying $^{12}$C resonances are shown. The wave function of the decaying
fragments is computed by means of the complex scaled hyperspherical adiabatic
expansion method. The large-distance part of the wave functions is crucial and
has to be accurately calculated. We discuss energy distributions, angular
distributions and Dalitz plots for the $4^+$, $1^+$ and $4^-$ states of
$^{12}$C.
