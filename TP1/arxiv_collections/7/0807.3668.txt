The most familiar formalism for the description of geometry applicable to
physics comprises operations among 4-component vectors and complex real
numbers; few people realize that this formalism has indeed 32 degrees of
freedom and can thus be called 32-dimensional. We will revise this formalism
and we will briefly show that it is best accommodated in the Clifford or
geometric algebra G(1,3) x C, the algebra of 4-dimensional spacetime over the
complex field. We will then explore other algebras isomorphic to that one,
namely G(2,3), G(4,1) and Q x Q x C, all of which have been used in the past by
PIRT participants to formulate their respective approaches to physics. G(2,3)is
the algebra of 3-space with two time dimensions, which John Carroll used
implicitely in his formulation of electromagnetism in 3 + 3 spacetime, G(4,1)
was and it still is used by myself in a tentative to unify the formulation of
physics and Q x Q x C is the choice of Peter Rowlands for his nilpotent
formulation of quantum mechanics. We will show how the equations can be
converted among isomorphic algebras and we also examine how the monogenic
functions that I use are equivalent in many ways to Peter Rowlands nilpotent
entities.
