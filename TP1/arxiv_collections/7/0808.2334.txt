We consider the group of smooth diffeomorphisms of the circle. We show that
any recurrent $f$ (in the sense that $\{f^n\}_{n \in Z}$ is not discrete) is in
fact a distortion element (in the sense that its iterates can be written as
short compositions involving finitely many smooth diffeomorphisms). Thus
rotations are distortion elements.
