The experiment performed with ultra-cold neutrons at the Laue-Langevin
Institute, Grenoble, is analyzed in view of the claim that ``neutron quantum
states in Earth gravitational field'' are observed. Our conclusion is that the
above claim is neither theoretically nor experimentally substantiated. We also
criticize the statement that ``observation of the gravitationally bound quantum
states of neutrons and the related experimental techniques provide a unique
tool for a broad range of investigations in fundamental physics of particles
and fields''.
