Recent experiments indicate that the tendency toward the formation of
unidirectional charge density waves ("stripes") is common to various underdoped
cuprates. We discuss momentum-resolved spectral properties of valence-bond
stripes, comparing the situations of ideal and short-range stripe order, the
latter being relevant for weak and/or disorder-pinned stripes. We find clear
signatures of ordered stripes, although matrix element effects suppress most
shadow band features. With decreasing stripe correlation length, stripe
signatures are quickly washed out, the only remaining effect being a broadening
of antinodal quasiparticles. This insensitivity of photoemission to short-range
stripe order may be employed to distinguish it from nematic order, e.g. in
underdoped YBCO.
