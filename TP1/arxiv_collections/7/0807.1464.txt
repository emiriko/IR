Based on the extended optical model with the double folding potential, in
which the polarization potential is decomposed into direct reaction (DR) and
fusion parts, simultaneous $\chi^{2}$ analyses are performed of elastic
scattering and fusion cross section data for the $^{9}$Be+$^{28}$Si,
$^{144}$Sm, and $^{208}$Pb systems at near-Coulomb-barrier energies. We find
that the real part of the resultant DR part of the polarization potential is
systematically repulsive for all the targets considered, which is consistent
with the results deduced from the Continuum Discretized Coupled Channel (CDCC)
calculations taking into account the polarization effects due to breakup.
Further, it is found that both DR and fusion parts of the extracted
polarization potentials satisfy the dispersion relation.
