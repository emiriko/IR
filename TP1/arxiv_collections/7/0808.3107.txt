Nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance and magnetization
measurements show that bulk Li$_x$ZnPc are strongly correlated one-dimensional
metals. The temperature dependence of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate
$1/T_1$ and of the static uniform susceptibility $\chi_S$ on approaching room
temperature are characteristic of a Fermi liquid. Moreover, while for $x\simeq
2$ the electrons are delocalized down to low temperature, for $x\to 4$ a
tendency towards localization is noticed upon cooling, yielding an increase
both in $1/T_1$ and $\chi_s$. The $x$-dependence of the effective density of
states at the Fermi level $D(E_F)$ displays a sharp enhancement for $x\simeq
2$, at the half filling of the ZnPc lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals. This
suggests that Li$_x$ZnPc is on the edge of a metal-insulator transition where
enhanced superconducting fluctuations could develop.
