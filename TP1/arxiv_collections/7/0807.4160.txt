Boltzmann's principle is used to select the "most probable" realization
(macrostate) of an isolated or closed thermodynamic system, containing a small
number of particles ($N \llsp \infty$), for both classical and quantum
statistics. The inferred probability distributions provide the means to define
intensive variables and construct thermodynamic relationships for small
microcanonical systems, which do not satisfy the thermodynamic limit. This is
of critical importance to nanoscience and quantum technology.
