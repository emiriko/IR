We present the zero-temperature superconducting (SC) ground states of the
two-orbital asymmetric $t-J$ model on a square lattice by means of the
auxiliary-boson approach. Besides the two-gap SC phase, we find an orbital
selective SC (OSSC) phase, which is simultaneously SC in one orbit and normal
in another orbit. The novel OSSC phase is stable only for sufficient asymmetric
degree in orbital space and doping concentration. The pairing symmetry of the
SC phase is s-wave-like in most doping regime, against the d-wave symmetry of
the single-orbital $t-J$ model in a square lattice. The implication of the
present scenario on multi-orbital heavy fermion and iron-based superconductors
is also discussed.
