In this paper, we discuss the equation of state for nonlinear spinor gases in
the context of cosmology. The mean energy momentum tensor is similar to that of
the prefect fluid, but an additional function of state $W$ is introduced to
describe the nonlinear potential. The equation of state $w(a)\lesssim -1$ in
the early universe is calculated, which provides a natural explanation for the
negative pressure of dark matter and dark energy. $W$ may be also the main
origin of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. So the nonlinear spinor gases
may be a candidate for dark matter and dark energy.
