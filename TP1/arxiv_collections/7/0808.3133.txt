We present the elements of the IR-improved DGLAP-CS theory as it relates to
the new MC friendly exponentiated scheme for precision calculation of higher
order corrections to LHC physics in which IR singularities from both QED and
QCD are canceled to all orders in alpha and in alpha_s simultaneously in the
presence of rigorous shower/ME matching. We present the first MC data comparing
the implied new showers themselves with the standard ones using the HERWIG6.5
MC event generator as a test case at LHC energies. As expected, the IR-improved
shower re-populates lower values of the energy fraction z and lower values of
the attendant p_T for the standard HERWIG6.5 input parameters. Possible
phenomenological implications are discussed.
