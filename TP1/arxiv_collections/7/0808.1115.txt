We use gauge-gravity duality to study a strongly-coupled non-Abelian gauge
theory with flavor fields, i.e. fields transforming in the fundamental
representation of the gauge group. We first study the thermodynamics of the
flavor fields. In the grand canonical ensemble at zero temperature, we find a
second-order transition when the mass of the flavor fields equals the chemical
potential. We then study the transport properties of the flavor fields at
finite temperature and density. We introduce external electric and magnetic
fields and compute the resulting current of flavor charge. From this current we
extract the conductivity, using Ohm's law. In addition, we compute the drag
force on the flavor fields at large mass, in the presence of a finite baryon
density and external electric and magnetic fields.
