We present a sequential Monte Carlo sampler variant of the partial rejection
control algorithm, and show that this variant can be considered as a sequential
Monte Carlo sampler with a modified mutation kernel. We prove that the new
sampler can reduce the variance of the incremental importance weights when
compared with standard sequential Monte Carlo samplers. We provide a study of
theoretical properties of the new algorithm, and make connections with some
existing algorithms. Finally, the sampler is adapted for application under the
challenging "likelihood free," approximate Bayesian computation modelling
framework, where we demonstrate superior performance over existing
likelihood-free samplers.
