In randomized experiments, treatment and control groups should be roughly the
same--balanced--in their distributions of pretreatment variables. But how
nearly so? Can descriptive comparisons meaningfully be paired with significance
tests? If so, should there be several such tests, one for each pretreatment
variable, or should there be a single, omnibus test? Could such a test be
engineered to give easily computed $p$-values that are reliable in samples of
moderate size, or would simulation be needed for reliable calibration? What new
concerns are introduced by random assignment of clusters? Which tests of
balance would be optimal? To address these questions, Fisher's randomization
inference is applied to the question of balance. Its application suggests the
reversal of published conclusions about two studies, one clinical and the other
a field experiment in political participation.
