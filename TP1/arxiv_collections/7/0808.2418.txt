In this paper we show that Ultradistributions of Exponential Type (UET) are
appropriate for the description in a consistent way superstring and superstring
field theories. A new Lagrangian for the closed superstring is given. We show
that the superstring field is a linear superposition of UET of compact support,
and give the notion of anti-superstring. We evaluate the propagator for the
superstring field, and calculate the convolution of two of them.
