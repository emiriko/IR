Recently, Huang, Wu and Florin posted a Comment (0806.4632v1) on our preprint
(0804.0730v1) describing nonequilibrium circulation of a colloidal sphere
trapped in a optical tweezer. The Comment suggests that evidence for toroidal
probability currents obtained from experiments and simulations in the original
posting should be considered inconclusive. The authors' concerns are based on
two claims: (1) that Brownian dynamics simulations of the trapped particle's
motions reveal no statistically significant circulation, and (2) that a
realistic description of the radiation pressure acting on the trapped sphere is
inconsistent with the motion we have described. In this Reply, we demonstrate
both of these claims to be incorrect, and thus the original results and
conclusions in 0804.0730v1 to be still valid.
