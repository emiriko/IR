We analyze the electronic transport through a quantum dot that contains a
magnetic impurity. The coherent transport of electrons is governed by the
quantum confinement inside the dot, but is also influenced by the exchange
interaction with the impurity. The interplay between the two gives raise to the
singlet-triplet splitting of the energy levels available for the tunneling
electron. In this paper, we focus on the charge fluctuations and, more
precisely, the height of the conductance peaks. We show that the conductance
peaks corresponding to the triplet levels are three times higher than those
corresponding to singlet levels, if electronic correlations are neglected (for
non-interacting dots, when an exact solution can be obtained). Next, we
consider the Coulomb repulsion and the many-body correlations. In this case,
the singlet/triplet peak height ratio has a complex behavior. Usually the
highest peak corresponds to the state that is lowest in energy (ground state),
regardless if it is singlet or triplet. In the end, we get an insight on the
Kondo regime for such a system, and show the formation of three Kondo peaks. We
use the equation of motion method with appropriate decoupling.
