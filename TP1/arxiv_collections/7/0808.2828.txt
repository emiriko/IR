We theoretically evaluate changes in the magnetic potential arising from the
magnetic field near superconducting thin films. An example of an atom chip
based on a three-wire configuration has been simulated in the superconducting
and the normal conducting state. Inhomogeneous current densities within the
superconducting wires were calculated using an energy-minimization routine
based on the London theory. The Meissner effect causes changes to both trap
position and oscillation frequencies at short distances from the
superconducting surface. Superconducting wires produce much shallower micro
traps than normal conducting wires. The results presented in this paper
demonstrate the importance of taking the Meissner effect into account when
designing and carrying out experiments on magnetically trapped neutral atoms
near superconducting surfaces.
