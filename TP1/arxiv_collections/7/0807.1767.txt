We report the discovery of an exact mapping from Galilean time and space
coordinates to Minkowski spacetime coordinates, showing that Lorentz covariance
and the spacetime construct are consistent with the existence of a dynamical
3-space, and "absolute motion". We illustrate this mapping first with the
standard theory of sound, as vibrations of a medium, which itself may be
undergoing fluid motion, and which is covariant under Galilean coordinate
transformations. By introducing a different non-physical class of space and
time coordinates it may be cast into a form that is covariant under "Lorentz
transformations" wherein the speed of sound is now the "invariant speed". If
this latter formalism were taken as fundamental and complete we would be lead
to the introduction of a pseudo-Riemannian "spacetime" description of sound,
with a metric characterised by an "invariant speed of sound". This analysis is
an allegory for the development of 20th century physics, but where the Lorentz
covariant Maxwell equations were constructed first, and the Galilean form was
later constructed by Hertz, but ignored. It is shown that the Lorentz
covariance of the Maxwell equations only occurs because of the use of
non-physical space and time coordinates. The use of this class of coordinates
has confounded 20th century physics, and resulted in the existence of a
"flowing" dynamical 3-space being overlooked. The discovery of the dynamics of
this 3-space has lead to the derivation of an extended gravity theory as a
quantum effect, and confirmed by numerous experiments and observations.
