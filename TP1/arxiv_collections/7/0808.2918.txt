We provide a description of the effects of fluxes on euclidean D-brane
instantons purely in terms of the 4d effective action. The effect corresponds
to the dressing of the effective non-perturbative 4d effective vertex with 4d
flux superpotential interactions, generated when the moduli fields made massive
by the flux are integrated out. The description in terms of effective field
theory allows a unified description of non-perturbative effects in all flux
compactifications of a given underlying fluxless model, globally in the moduli
space of the latter. It also allows us to describe explicitly the effects on
D-brane instantons of fluxes with no microscopic description, like
non-geometric fluxes. At the more formal level, the description has interesting
connections with the bulk-boundary map of open-closed two-dimensional
topological string theory, and with the $\NN=1$ special geometry.
