The characteristic polynomial for a chain of dipole-dipole coupled two-level
atoms with nearest-neighbour and next-nearest-neighbour interactions is
developed for the study of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for single-photon
excitations. We find the exact form of the polynomial in terms of the Chebyshev
polynomials of the second kind that is valid for an arbitrary number of atoms
and coupling strengths. We then propose a technique for expressing the roots of
the polynomial as a power series in the coupling constants. The general
properties of the solutions are also explored, to shed some light on the
general properties that the exact, analytic form of the energy eigenvalues
should have. A method for deriving the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian is also
outlined.
