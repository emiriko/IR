In this report it is approched the Contest dynamics as mathematical theory,
therefore applicable to all contest sports. Starting with the physical
definition of Athlete and Couple of Athlete systems and after singling out the
interaction basic parameter, there are analyzed the classes of possible
potentials describing the interaction. At the end there are specified the
physical bases of mutual interaction between athletes and the trajectories of
flight motion. All the matter will be connected to measurable quantities or
parameters useful for researchers and trainers.
