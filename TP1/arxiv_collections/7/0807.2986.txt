Fast thermalization and elliptic flow of QCD matter found at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) are understood as the consequence of perturbative QCD
(pQCD) interactions within a (3+1) dimensional parton cascade. The main
contributions stem from pQCD-inspired bremsstrahlung. We extract the shear
viscosity to entropy ratio, which is between 0.08 and 0.15.
