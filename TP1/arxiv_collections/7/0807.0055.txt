A monolithic pixel sensor in deep-submicron Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) CMOS
technology has been designed, manufactured and characterised. This technology
is of significant interest for applications in particle tracking and imaging.
The prototype chip features pixels of 10 micron pitch arrayed in two analog
sections and one digital section with a comparator and a latch integrated in
each pixel. The prototype response has been tested with infrared lasers and
with the 1.35 GeV electron beam extracted from the injection booster at the
LBNL Advanced Light Source. Results from irradiation tests with low energy
protons and neutrons performed at the LBNL 88-inch Cyclotron are also
presented.
