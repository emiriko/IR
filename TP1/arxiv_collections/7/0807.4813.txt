We consider reversible breaking of adhesion bonds or folding of proteins
under the influence of a constant external force. We discuss the stochastic
properties of the unbinding/rebinding events and analyze their mean number and
their variance in the framework of simple two-state models. In the
calculations, we exploit the analogy to single molecule fluorescence and
particularly between unbinding/rebinding and photon emission events.
Environmental fluctuation models are used to describe deviations from Markovian
behavior. The second moment of the event-number distribution is found to be
very sensitive to possible exchange processes and can thus be used to identify
temporal fluctuations of the transition rates.
