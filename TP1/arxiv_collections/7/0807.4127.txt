We review the use of Monte Carlo simulation to model backgrounds to top
signal at the Tevatron experiments, CDF and D0, as well as the relevant
measurements done by the experiments. We'll concentrate on the modeling of W
and Z boson production in association with jets, in particular heavy flavor
jets, and also comment on the Tevatron experience using matched Monte Carlo.
