We present the state of the art regarding the relation between the physics of
Quantum Black Holes and Noncommutative Geometry. We start with a review of
models proposed in the literature for describing deformations of General
Relativity in the presence of noncommutativity, seen as an effective theory of
Quantum Gravity. We study the resulting metrics, proposed to replace or at
least to improve the conventional black hole solutions of Einstein's equation.
In particular, we analyze noncommutative-inspired solutions obtained in terms
of quasi-classical noncommutative coordinates: indeed because of their
surprising new features, these solutions enable us to circumvent long standing
problems with Quantum Field Theory in Curved Space and to cure the singular
behavior of gravity at the centers of black holes. As a consequence, for the
first time, we get a complete description of what we may call the black hole
SCRAM, the shut down of the emission of thermal radiation from the black hole:
in place of the conventional scenario of runaway evaporation in the Planck
phase, we find a zero temperature final state, a stable black hole remnant,
whose size and mass are determined uniquely in terms of the noncommutative
parameter $\theta$. This result turns out to be of vital importance for the
physics of the forthcoming experiments at the LHC, where mini black hole
production is foreseen in extreme energy hadron collisions. Because of this, we
devote the final part of this review to higher dimensional solutions and their
phenomenological implications for TeV Gravity.
