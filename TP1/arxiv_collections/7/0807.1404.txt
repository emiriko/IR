The issue is the expediency of the QCD notions use in the low energy region
down to the confinement scale, and, in particular, the efficacy of the QCD
invariant coupling \bar{\alpha}_s(Q^2) with a minimal analytic modification in
this domain. To this goal, we overview a quite recent progress in application
of the ghost-free Analytic Perturbative Theory approach (with no adjustable
parameters) for QCD in the region below 1 GeV. Among them the Bethe--Salpeter
analysis of the meson spectra and spin-dependent (polarization) Bjorken sum
rule. The impression is that there is a chance for the theoretically consistent
and numerically correlated description of hadronic events from Z_0 till a few
hundred MeV scale by combination of analytic pQCD and some explicit
non-perturbative contribution in the spirit of duality. This is an invitation
to the practitioner community for a more courageous use of ghost-free QCD
coupling models for data analysis in the low energy region.
