The model is based on a mirror symmetry breaking second order phase
transition leading to a pairing between a free charge carriers and a free
mirror charge carriers. This approach gives a unified description of low and
high Tc superconductivity with a point of view differing from that of BCS
theory.The material's crystal structure symmetry is the key to understand the
mechanism of pairing by introducing a mirror plane polarization effect in
lattice as it is described below.
