We report an experimental demonstration of entanglement swapping over two
quantum stages. By successful realizations of two cascaded photonic
entanglement swapping processes, entanglement is generated and distributed
between two photons, that originate from independent sources and do not share
any common past. In the experiment we use three pairs of polarization entangled
photons and conduct two Bell-state measurements (BSMs) one between the first
and second pair, and one between the second and third pair. This results in
projecting the remaining two outgoing photons from pair 1 and 3 into an
entangled state, as characterized by an entanglement witness. The experiment
represents an important step towards a full quantum repeater where multiple
entanglement swapping is a key ingredient.
