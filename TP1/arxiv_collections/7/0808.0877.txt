We study the role of electronic correlation in a disordered two-dimensional
model by using a variational wave function that can interpolate between
Anderson and Mott insulators. Within this approach, the Anderson-Mott
transition can be described both in the paramagnetic and in the magnetic
sectors. In the latter case, we find evidence for the formation of local
magnetic moments that order before the Mott transition. The charge gap opening
in the Mott insulator is accompanied by the vanishing of the $\lim_{q\to 0}
\overline{< n_q>< n_{-q}>}$ (the bar denoting the impurity average), which is
related to the compressibility fluctuations. The role of a frustrating
(second-neighbor) hopping is also discussed, with a particular emphasis to the
formation of metastable spin-glass states.
