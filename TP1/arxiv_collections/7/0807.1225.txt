We apply the Hilbert transform to the physics of internal waves in
two-dimensional fluids. Using this demodulation technique, we can discriminate
internal waves propagating in different directions: this is very helpful in
answering several fundamental questions in the context of internal waves. We
focus more precisely in this paper on phenomena associated with dissipation,
diffraction and reflection of internal waves.
