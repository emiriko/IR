We calculate the static critical behavior of systems of $O(n_\|)\oplus
O(n_\perp)$ symmetry by renormalization group method within the minimal
subtraction scheme in two loop order. Summation methods lead to fixed points
describing multicritical behavior. Their stability boarder lines in the space
of order parameter components $n_\|$ and $n_\perp$ and spatial dimension $d$
are calculated. The essential features obtained already in two loop order for
the interesting case of an antiferromagnet in a magnetic field ($n_\|=1$,
$n_\perp=2$) are the stability of the biconical fixed point and the
neighborhood of the stability border lines to the other fixed points leading to
very small transient exponents. We are also able to calculate the flow of
static couplings, which allows to consider the attraction region. Depending on
the nonuniversal background parameters the existence of different multicritical
behavior (bicritical or tetracritical) is possible including a triple point.
