The MUNU detector has been designed to study antineutrino-electron elastic
scattering at low energy. The central tracking detector is a 1 m3 Time
Projection Chamber surrounded by an anti-Compton detector. In this paper the
results from final analysis of the data recorded at 3-bar and 1-bar pressure
are presented. At 3-bar a new upper limit on the neutrino magnetic moment < 9 x
10-11 (7 x 10-11) mu_B at 90 (68%) C.L. is derived. At 1-bar pressure electron
tracks down to 80 keV are measured in the TPC. A 137Cs photopeak is
reconstructed by measuring both the energy and direction of the Compton
electrons in the TPC.
