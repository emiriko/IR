We present a measurement of the CKM matrix element |V_cb| and the form-factor
slope rho^2 for Bbar -> D l^- nubar_l decays based on 417 fb-1 of data
collected at the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the BaBar detector. The
semileptonic decays are selected in BBar events in which the hadronic decay of
the second B meson is fully reconstructed. From the measured differential decay
rate of the signal decay we determine G(1) |V_cb|= (43.0 +/- 1.9 +/- 1.4) x
10^-3, rho^2 = 1.20 +/- 0.09 +/- 0.04, where G(1) is the hadronic form factor
at the point of zero recoil. Using a lattice calculation for G(1) we extract
|V_cb|= (39.8 +/- 1.8 +/- 1.3 +/- 0.9) x 10^-3, where the stated errors refer
to the statistical, systematic, and form factor uncertainties. We also present
a measurement of the exclusive branching fractions, BF(B^- -> D^0 l^- nubar_l)
= (2.31 +/- 0.08 +/- 0.07)% and BF (B0bar -> D^+ l^- nubar_l)=(2.23 +/- 0.11
+/- 0.08)%.
