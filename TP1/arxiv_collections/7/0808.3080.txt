We have analyzed quasiparticle transitions in an Al charge-phase qubit
inducing a dynamic change of the qubit states. The time-averaged mixed state is
related to the strong coupling of the qubit to an ensemble of non-equilibrium
quasiparticles in the leads. Such quasiparticles tunnel stochastically on and
off the island and can excite the qubit. Continuous monitoring of the qubit
impedance at a frequency of 80 MHz shows the admixture of the excited state. We
present a numerical description of these cyclic transitions and compare it with
our experimental data.
