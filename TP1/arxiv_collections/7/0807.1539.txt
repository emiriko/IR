We show convergence of solutions to equilibria for quasilinear parabolic
evolution equations in situations where the set of equilibria is non-discrete,
but forms a finite-dimensional $C^1$-manifold which is normally hyperbolic. Our
results do not depend on the presence of an appropriate Lyapunov functional as
in the \L ojasiewicz-Simon approach, but are of local nature.
