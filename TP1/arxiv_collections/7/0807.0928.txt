A Bloom filter is a space efficient structure for storing static sets, where
the space efficiency is gained at the expense of a small probability of
false-positives. A Bloomier filter generalizes a Bloom filter to compactly
store a function with a static support. In this article we give a simple
construction of a Bloomier filter. The construction is linear in space and
requires constant time to evaluate. The creation of our Bloomier filter takes
linear time which is faster than the existing construction. We show how one can
improve the space utilization further at the cost of increasing the time for
creating the data structure.
