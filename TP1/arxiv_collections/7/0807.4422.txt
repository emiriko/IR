Ultra-thin magnetic tunnel junctions with low resistive MgO tunnel barriers
are prepared to examine their stability under large current stress. The devices
show magnetoresistance ratios of up to 110 % and an area resistance product of
down to 4.4 ohm micrometer squared. If a large current is applied, a reversible
resistance change is observed, which can be attributed to two different
processes during stressing and one relaxation process afterwards. Here, we
analyze the time dependence of the resistance and use a simple model to explain
the observed behavior. The explanation is further supported by numerical fits
to the data in order to quantify the timescales of the involved phenomena.
