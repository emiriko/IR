We report a novel quantum random number generator based on the
photon-number$-$path entangled state which is prepared via two-photon quantum
interference at a beam splitter. The randomness in our scheme is of truly
quantum mechanical origin as it comes from the projection measurement of the
entangled two-photon state. The generated bit sequences satisfy the standard
randomness test.
