We search for a light scalar particle produced in single-photon decays of the
Upsilon(3S) resonance through the process Upsilon(3S) -> gamma A0, A0 ->
invisible. Such an object appears in Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric extensions
of the Standard Model, where a light CP-odd Higgs boson naturally couples
strongly to b-quarks. If, in addition, there exists a light, stable neutralino,
decays of A0 could be preferentially to an invisible final state. We search for
events with a single high-energy photon and a large missing mass, consistent
with a 2-body decay of Upsilon(3S). We find no evidence for such processes in a
sample of 122*10^6 Upsilon(3S) decays collected by the BABAR collaboration at
the PEP-II B-factory, and set 90% C.L. upper limits on the branching fraction
B(Upsilon(3S) -> gamma A0)*B(A0 -> invisible) at (0.7-31)*10^{-6} in the mass
range m(A0)<=7.8 GeV. The results are preliminary.
