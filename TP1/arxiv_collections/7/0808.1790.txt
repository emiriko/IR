The current distribution and the AC loss in a composite superconducting tape
containing a layer from magnetic material is calculated and compared with
experiments, showing a very good agreement. The situations of an alternating
uniform applied field or a transport current are studied. The newly developed
numerical model is an approximation to the critical state model, adapted for
the applicability to commercial finite elements codes that solve the vector
potential. Substantial feature of this procedure is that it can be carried out
in the case when the critical current density in superconductor depends on the
magnetic field and the magnetic layer material is non- linear. Additionally,
the hysteresis loss in the magnetic material is estimated, based on its
measured magnetization loops. Measurements on Bi-2223 multifilamentary tapes
covered on edges by nickel confirmed our predictions, showing a substantial ac
loss reduction in both the investigated regimes.
