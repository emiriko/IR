In Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling considerable thought goes into
constructing random transitions. But those transitions are almost always driven
by a simulated IID sequence. Recently it has been shown that replacing an IID
sequence by a weakly completely uniformly distributed (WCUD) sequence leads to
consistent estimation in finite state spaces. Unfortunately, few WCUD sequences
are known. This paper gives general methods for proving that a sequence is
WCUD, shows that some specific sequences are WCUD, and shows that certain
operations on WCUD sequences yield new WCUD sequences. A numerical example on a
42 dimensional continuous Gibbs sampler found that some WCUD inputs sequences
produced variance reductions ranging from tens to hundreds for posterior means
of the parameters, compared to IID inputs.
