XML has emerged as the leading language for representing and exchanging data
not only on the Web, but also in general in the enterprise. XQuery is emerging
as the standard query language for XML. Thus, tools are required to mediate
between XML queries and heterogeneous data sources to integrate data in XML.
This paper presents the XMedia mediator, a unique tool for integrating and
querying disparate heterogeneous information as unified XML views. It describes
the mediator architecture and focuses on the unique distributed query
processing technology implemented in this component. Query evaluation is based
on an original XML algebra simply extending classical operators to process
tuples of tree elements. Further, we present a set of performance evaluation on
a relational benchmark, which leads to discuss possible performance
enhancements.
