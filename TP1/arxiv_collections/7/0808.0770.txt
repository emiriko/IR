Applying a likelihood analysis to the next-to-minimal supergravity-motivated
model, we identify parameter space regions preferred by present experimental
limits from collider, astrophysical, and low energy measurements. We then show
that favored regions are amenable to detection by a combination of the CERN
Large Hadron Collider and an upgraded Cryogenic Dark Matter Search, provided
that the more than three sigma discrepancy in the difference of the
experimental and the standard theoretical values of the anomalous magnetic
moment of the muon prevails in the future.
