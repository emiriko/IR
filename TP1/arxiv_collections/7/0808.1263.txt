We demonstrate that the addition of a single carbon impurity leads to
significant changes in the thermodynamic properties of Ni clusters consisting
of more than a hundred atoms. The magnitude of the change induced is dependent
upon the parameters of the Ni-C interaction. Hence, thermodynamic properties of
Ni clusters can be effectively tuned by the addition of an impurity of a
particular type. We also show that the presence of a carbon impurity
considerably changes the mobility and diffusion of atoms in the Ni cluster at
temperatures close to its melting point. The calculated diffusion coefficients
of the carbon impurity in the Ni cluster can be used for a reliable estimate of
the growth rate of carbon nanotubes.
