We report results from a study of the charmed double strange baryons
\Omega_c^0 and \Omega_c^{*0} at Belle. The \Omega_c^0 is reconstructed using
the \Omega_c^0 --> \Omega^- \pi^+ decay mode, and its mass is measured to be
(2693.6 \pm 0.3 {+1.8 \atop -1.5}) MeV/c^2. The \Omega_c^{*0} baryon is
reconstructed in the \Omega_c^0 \gamma mode. The mass difference
M_{\Omega_c^{*0}} - M_{\Omega_c^0} is measured to be (70.7 \pm 0.9 {+0.1 \atop
-0.9}) MeV/c^2. The analysis is performed using 673 fb^{-1} of data on and near
the \Upsilon(4S) collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB
asymmetric-energy e^+e^- collider.
