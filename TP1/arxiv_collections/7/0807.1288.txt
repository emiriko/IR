The flow curves, viz. the curves of stationary stress under steady shearing,
are obtained close to the glass transition in dense colloidal dispersions using
asymptotic expansions in a schematic model of mode coupling theory. The shear
thinning of the viscosity in fluid states and the yielding of glassy states is
discussed. At the transition between fluid and shear-molten glass, simple and
generalized Herschel-Bulkley laws are derived with power law exponents that can
be computed for different particle interactions from the equilibrium structure
factor.
