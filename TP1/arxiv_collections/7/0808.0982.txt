We present an asymmetric $q$-Painlev\'e equation. We will derive this using
$q$-orthogonal polynomials with respect to generalized Freud weights: their
recurrence coefficients will obey this $q$-Painlev\'e equation (up to a simple
transformation). We will show a stable method of computing a special solution
which gives the recurrence coefficients. We establish a connection with
$\alpha-q-P_V$.
