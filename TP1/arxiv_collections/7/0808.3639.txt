We investigate the quark-gluon mixed condensate based on an AdS/QCD model.
Introducing a holographic field dual to the operator for the quark-gluon mixed
condensate, we obtain the corresponding classical equation of motion. Taking
the mixed condensate as an additional free parameter, we show that the present
scheme reproduces very well experimental data. A fixed value of the mixed
condensate is in good agreement with that of the QCD sum rules.
