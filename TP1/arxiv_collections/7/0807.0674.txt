By extending the nonequilibrium potential refinement algorithm and lattice
switch method to the semigrand ensemble, the semigrand potentials of the fcc
and hcp structures of polydisperse hard-sphere crystals are calculated with the
bias sampling scheme. The result shows that the fcc structure is more stable
than the hcp structure for polydisperse hard-sphere crystals below the terminal
polydispersity.
