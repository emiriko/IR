I present a study of the equation of state in quenched QCD, discussing some
systematic effects related to the lattice geometry. In particular, I comment on
the modification of the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a gas of free gluons in a
finite system, and study the impact it might have on numerical results at high
temperatures, for the typical parameters of current lattice simulations.
Finally, I apply the results of this study to the analysis of data obtained
from simulations of SU(N) gauge theories with N>3 colors, in a temperature
range up to 3T_c, where infrared effects appear to be under control.
Preliminary results for various thermodynamic observables for SU(4), SU(5) and
SU(6) gauge theories are found to be close to each other and to those for
SU(3), in agreement with other similar studies. This may be relevant for the
theoretical description of the QCD plasma.
