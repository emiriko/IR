There are two alternative methods used in literature to calculate the
incoherent part of the spectrum of light scattered by an atomic system. In the
first, one calculates the spectrum of the total light scattered by the system
and obtains the incoherent part by subtracting the coherent part. In the second
method, one introduces the fluctuation operators and obtains the incoherent
part of the spectrum by taking the Fourier transform of the two time
correlation function of the fluctuation operators. These two methods have been
recognized for years as two completely equivalent for evaluating the incoherent
part of the spectrum. In a recent paper Qing Xu et al. [Phys. Rev. A 78, 013407
(2008)] have shown that there are discrepancies between the incoherent parts of
the stationary spectrum of a three-level Lambda-type system calculated with
these two methods. The predicted discrepancies can be severe that over a wide
rage of the Rabi frequencies and atomic decay rates, the spectrum calculated
with the variance method can have negative values. This is obviously unphysical
result since the fluorescence spectrum is a positively defined quantity. It
represents the frequency distribution of light incoherently scattered by the
atomic system. Therefore, the calculated spectrum should be positive for all
frequencies independent of values of the Rabi frequencies and the damping
rates. In this comment, we show that there are no discrepancies between these
two methods. The equivalence of these two alternative methods leads to the same
incoherent spectra that are positive for all frequencies independent of values
of the parameters involved. The analytical analysis is supported by simple
numerical calculations.
