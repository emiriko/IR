A critical study of the wave mechanics of a particle trapped in a 1-D box
having infinite potential walls and small flexibility in its size reveals its
several important and hither to unknown aspects which could be relevant for
better understanding of systems like quantum -dot/wire/well. Since most of
these aspects arise from the zero-point force coming into operation when the
particle occupies its ground state in the box, they are expected to have great
significance at low temperatures. To demonstrate this we briefly analyze some
important aspects of an electron bubble in liquid helium and its nano-droplets.
