We have examined the effect of a c(2x2) overlayer of CO on the surface
phonons of the substrate, Cu(001), by applying the density functional
perturbation theory with both the local (LDA) and the generalized-gradient
(GGA) density approximations, through the Hedin-Lundqvist and the
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functionals, respectively. Our results (GGA) trace the
Rayleigh wave softening detected by helium atom scattering (HAS) experiments to
changes in the force constants between the substrate surface atoms brought
about by CO chemisorption, resolving an ongoing debate on the subject. The
calculated surface phonon dispersion curves document the changes in the
polarization of some modes and show those of the modes originally along the
$\bar{Y}$ direction of the clean surface Brillouin zone (SBZ) which are
back-folded along the $\bar{\Delta}$ direction of the chemisorbed SBZ, to be
particularly consequential. The vertical and shear horizontal section of $S_1$
in the SBZ of the clean surface, for example, is back-folded as a
longitudinal-vertical mode, indicating thereby that $S_1$ $-$ predicted a long
time back along $\bar{\Delta}$ for the clean surface $-$ may be indirectly
assessed at $\bar{X}$ upon CO adsorption by standard planar scattering
techniques. These findings further suggest that some of the energy losses
detected by HAS along $\bar{\Delta}$, which were associated to multiphonon
excitations of the adlayer frustrated translation mode, may actually correspond
to the back-folded substrate surface modes.
