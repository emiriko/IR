Let $K[x,y]$ be the polynomial algebra in two variables over an algebraically
closed field $K$. We generalize to the case of any characteristic the result of
Furter that over a field of characteristic zero the set of automorphisms
$(f,g)$ of $K[x,y]$ such that $\max\{\text{deg}(f),\text{deg}(g)\}=n\geq 2$ is
constructible with dimension $n+6$. The same result holds for the automorphisms
of the free associative algebra $K< x,y>$. We have also obtained analogues for
free algebras with two generators in Nielsen -- Schreier varieties of algebras.
