By modifying the method in [KNO], certain affine geometric crystals are
realized in affinization of the fundamental representation $W(\varpi_1)_l$ and
the tropical R maps for the affine geometric crystals are described explicitly.
We also define prehomogeneous geometric crystals and show that for a positive
geometric crystal, the connectedness of the corresponding ultra-discretized
crystal is the sufficient condition for prehomogeneity of the positive
geometric crystal. Moreover, the uniqueness of tropical R maps is discussed.
