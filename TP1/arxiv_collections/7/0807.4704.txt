Let G be a finitely presented group, and G' its commutator subgroup. Let C be
the Cayley graph of G' with all commutators in G as generators. Then C is large
scale simply connected. Furthermore, if G is a torsion-free nonelementary
word-hyperbolic group, C is one-ended. Hence (in this case), the asymptotic
dimension of C is at least 2.
