Spin correlations in LSCO have been studied by neutron scattering. The
commensurate antiferromagnetic order of the parent compound persists on a very
short range up to a Sr content of x=0.3, whereas small amounts of Sr suppress
commensurate antiferromagnetism in cuprates and in nickelates. For x>0.3 we
find incommensurate spin ordering with the modulation closely following the
amount of doping. These incommensurate phases strongly resemble the stripe
phases observed in cuprates and nickelates, but incommensurate magnetic
ordering appears only at larger Sr content in the cobaltates due to a reduced
charge mobility.
