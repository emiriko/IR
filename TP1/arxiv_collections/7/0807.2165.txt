The energy gap of optimally doped Bi2(Sr,R)2CuOy (R=La and Eu) was probed by
angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) using a vacuum ultraviolet
laser (photon energy 6.994 eV) or He I resonance line (21.218 eV) as photon
source. The results show that the gap around the node at sufficiently low
temperatures can be well described by a monotonic d-wave gap function for both
samples and the gap of the R=La sample is larger reflecting the higher Tc.
However, an abrupt deviation from the d-wave gap function and an opposite R
dependence for the gap size were observed around the antinode, which represent
a clear disentanglement between the antinodal pseudogap and the nodal
superconducting gap.
