An overview of the prospects of top quark physics at the LHC is presented.
The ATLAS and the CMS detectors are about to produce a large amount of data
with high top quark contents from the LHC proton-proton collisions. A wide
variet y of physics analyses is planned in both experiments, and a number of
useful insights have already been obtained regarding their detector performance
and physics potential. This summary is based on the talk presented at the
Hadron C ollider Physics Symposium 2008, Galena, Illinois, May 27-31, 2008.
