Visual perception of Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction is known to be
theoretically impossible, and this can be demonstrated pedagogically with the
aid of simple spacetime diagrams of one spatial dimension. Such diagrams also
demonstrate, simply and directly, that the apparent length of a moving meter
stick changes as it passes by and can even look elongated. In addition,
measurement of a moving meter stick with instruments, as opposed to visual
perception, must be inherently ambiguous, as the length measured depends on
clock synchronization, which is widely considered to be conventional. In fact,
for some synchronization choices, a moving meter stick would be measured as
greater than one meter. Thus, the well known Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction
factor $\sqrt {1-v^2/c^2} $ would generally not be seen visually, and would
only be measured in a system employing one particular (Einstein)
synchronization convention.
