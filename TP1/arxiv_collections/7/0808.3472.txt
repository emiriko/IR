The effects of several nonlinear regularization techniques are discussed in
the framework of 3D seismic tomography. Traditional, linear, $\ell_2$ penalties
are compared to so-called sparsity promoting $\ell_1$ and $\ell_0$ penalties,
and a total variation penalty. Which of these algorithms is judged optimal
depends on the specific requirements of the scientific experiment. If the
correct reproduction of model amplitudes is important, classical damping
towards a smooth model using an $\ell_2$ norm works almost as well as
minimizing the total variation but is much more efficient. If gradients (edges
of anomalies) should be resolved with a minimum of distortion, we prefer
$\ell_1$ damping of Daubechies-4 wavelet coefficients. It has the additional
advantage of yielding a noiseless reconstruction, contrary to simple $\ell_2$
minimization (`Tikhonov regularization') which should be avoided. In some of
our examples, the $\ell_0$ method produced notable artifacts. In addition we
show how nonlinear $\ell_1$ methods for finding sparse models can be
competitive in speed with the widely used $\ell_2$ methods, certainly under
noisy conditions, so that there is no need to shun $\ell_1$ penalizations.
