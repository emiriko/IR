We demonstrate that hydrodynamic reductions of dispersionless integrable
systems in 2+1 dimensions, such as the dispersionless Kadomtsev-Petviashvili
(dKP) and dispersionless Toda lattice (dTl) equations, can be deformed into
reductions of the corresponding dispersive counterparts. Modulo the Miura
group, such deformations are unique. The requirement that any hydrodynamic
reduction possesses a deformation of this kind imposes strong constraints on
the structure of dispersive terms, suggesting an alternative approach to the
integrability in 2+1 dimensions.
