In this paper we study the geodesic structure of the Schwarzschild black hole
in rainbow gravity analyzing the behavior of null and time-like geodesic. We
find that the structure of the geodesics essentially does not change when the
semi-classical effects are included. However, we can distinguish different
scenarios if we take into account the effects of rainbow gravity. Depending on
the type of rainbow functions under consideration, inertial and external
observers see very different situations in radial and non radial motion of a
test particles.
