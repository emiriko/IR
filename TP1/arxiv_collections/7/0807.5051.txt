We consider a four site Higgsless model based on the $SU(2)_L\times
SU(2)_1\times SU(2)_2\times U(1)_Y$ gauge symmetry, which predicts two neutral
and four charged extra gauge bosons, $Z_{1,2}$ and $W^\pm_{1,2}$. We compute
the properties of the new particles, and derive indirect and direct limits on
their masses and couplings from LEP and Tevatron data. In contrast to other
Higgsless models, characterized by fermiophobic extra gauge bosons, here
sizeable fermion-boson couplings are allowed by the electroweak precision data.
The prospects of detecting the new predicted particles in the favoured
Drell-Yan channel at the LHC are thus investigated. The outcome is that all six
extra gauge bosons could be discovered in the early stage of the LHC
low-luminosity run.
