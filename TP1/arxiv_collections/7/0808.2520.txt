We study the vacuum structure of the U(N) gauge model with partially broken
N=2 supersymmetry. From the analysis of the classical vacua of this model, we
point out that in addition to the ordinary N=1 supersymmetric vacua, there are
vacua with negative gauge coupling constants, which preserve another N=1
supersymmetry. These latter vacua can be analyzed by using SUSY/non-SUSY
duality which is recently proposed by Aganagic, Beem, Seo and Vafa. A dual
description of these in UV is U(N) gauge theory where the supersymmetry is
broken by spurion superfields. Following them, we see that there are
supersymmetry preserving vacua as well as supersymmetry breaking vacua of low
energy effective theory.
