We report an experimental study of the large-scale circulation (LSC) in a
turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection cell with aspect ratio unity. The
temperature-extremum-extraction (TEE) method for obtaining the dynamic
information of the LSC is presented. With this method, the azimuthal angular
positions of the hot ascending and cold descending flows along the sidewall are
identified from the measured instantaneous azimuthal temperature profile. The
motion of the LSC is then decomposed into two different modes: the azimuthal
mode and the translational or off-center mode. Comparing to the previous
sinusoidal-fitting (SF) method, it is found that both methods give the same
information about the azimuthal motion of the LSC, but the TEE method in
addition can provide information about the off-center motion of the LSC, which
is found to oscillate time-periodically around the cell's central vertical axis
with an amplitude being nearly independent of the turbulent intensity. It is
further found that the azimuthal angular positions of the hot ascending flow
near the bottom plate and the cold descending flow near the top plate oscillate
periodically out of phase by $\pi$, leading to the torsional mode of the LSC.
These oscillations are then propagated vertically along the sidewall by the hot
ascending and cold descending fluids. When they reach the mid-height plane, the
azimuthal positions of the hottest and coldest fluids again oscillate out of
phase by $\pi$. It is this out-of-phase horizontal positional oscillation of
the hottest and coldest fluids at the same horizontal plane that produces the
off-center oscillation of the LSC. A direct velocity measurement further
confirms the existence of the bulk off-center mode of the flow field near cell
center.
