Embedded germanium nanocrystals (NCs) in a silica host matrix are
theoretically analyzed to identify their third-order bound-state
nonlinearities. A rigorous atomistic pseudopotential approach is used for
determining the electronic structure and the nonlinear optical
susceptibilities. This study characterizing the two-photon absorption,
nonlinear refractive index, and optical switching parameters reveals the full
wavelength dependence from static up to the ultraviolet spectrum and the size
dependence up to a diameter of 3.5 nm. Similar to Si NCs, the
intensity-dependent refractive index increases with decreasing NC diameter. On
the other hand, Ge NCs possess about an order of magnitude smaller nonlinear
susceptibility compared to Si NCs of the same size. It is observed that the
two-photon absorption threshold extends beyond the half band-gap value. This
enables nonlinear refractive index tunability over a much wider wavelength
range free from two-photon absorption.
