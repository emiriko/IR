The effects of final state interactions (FSI) in hadronic B-decays are
investigated. The model for FSI, based on Regge phenomenology of high-energy
hadronic interactions is proposed. It is shown that this model explains the
pattern of phases in matrix elements of $B\to\pi\pi$ and $B\to\rho\rho$ decays.
These phases play an important role for CP-violation in B-decays. The most
precise determination of the unitarity triangle angle $\alpha$ from $B_d\to
\rho\pi$ decays is performed. The relation between CP-asymmetries in $B\to
K\pi$ decays is discussed. It is emphasized that the large distance FSI can
explain the structure of polarizations of the vector mesons in B-decays and
other puzzles like a very large branching ratio of the B-decay to
$\bar\Xi_c\Lambda_c$.
