We give a direct tensor decomposition for any density matrix into Hermitian
operators. Based upon the decomposition we study when the mixed states are
separable and generalize the separability indicators to multi-partite states
and show that a density operator is separable if and only if the separable
indicator is non-negative. We then derive two bounds for the separable
indicator in terms of the spectrum of the factor operators in the tensor
summands.
