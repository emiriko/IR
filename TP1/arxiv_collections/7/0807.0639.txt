We consider spin-boson models composed by a single bosonic mode and an
ensemble of $N$ identical two-level atoms. The situation where the coupling
between the bosonic mode and the atoms generates real and virtual processes is
studied, where the whole system is in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at
temperature $\beta^{-1}$. Phase transitions from ordinary fluorescence to
superradiant phase in three different models is investigated. First a model
where the coupling between the bosonic mode and the $j-th$ atom is via the
pseudo-spin operator $\sigma^{,z}_{(j)}$ is studied. Second, we investigate the
generalized Dicke model, introducing different coupling constants between the
single mode bosonic field and the environment, $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$ for rotating
and counter-rotating terms, respectively. Finally it is considered a modified
version of the generalized Dicke model with intensity-dependent coupling in the
rotating terms. In the first model the zero mode contributes to render the
canonical entropy a negative quantity for low temperatures. The last two models
presents phase transitions, even when only Hamiltonian terms which generates
virtual processes are considered.
