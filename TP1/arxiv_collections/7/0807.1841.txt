Focussing on null fields as simple models of laser beams we discuss the
classical relativistic motion of charges in strong electromagnetic fields. We
suggest a universal, Lorentz and gauge invariant measure of laser intensity and
explicitly calculate and interpret it for crossed field, plane wave and vortex
models.
