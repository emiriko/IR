Recent research shows that Hawking radiation can be treated as a quantum
tunnelling process, and Hawking temperature of Dirac particles across the
horizon of a black hole can be correctly recovered via fermions tunnelling
method. In this paper, motivated by fermions tunnelling method, we attempt to
apply the analysis to derive Hawking radiation of Dirac particles via
tunnelling from black ring solutions of 5-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton
gravity theory. Finally, it is interesting to find as in black hole cases,
fermions tunnelling can also result in correct Hawking temperatures for the
rotating neutral, dipole and charged black rings.
