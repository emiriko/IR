The ground state phase diagram of the frustrated ferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain
is investigated using the exact diagonalization technique. It is shown that
there is a jump in the spontaneous magnetization and the ground state of the
system undergos to a phase transition from a ferromagnetic phase to a phase
with dimer ordering between next-nearest-neighbor spins. Near the quantum
transition point, the critical behavior of the ground state energy is analyzed
numerically. Using a practical finite-size scaling approach, the critical
exponent of the ground state energy is computed. Our numerical results are in
good agreement with the results obtained by other theoretical approaches.
