Relativistic effects in the breakup of weakly-bound nuclei at intermediate
energies are studied by means of the continuum-discretized coupled-channels
method with eikonal approximation. Nuclear coupling potentials with Lorentz
contraction are newly included and those effects on breakup cross sections are
investigated. We show that relativistic corrections lead to larger breakup
cross sections. Coupled-channel effects on the breakup cross sections are also
discussed.
