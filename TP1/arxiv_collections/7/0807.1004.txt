Within the framework of unified approach we study the Casimir-Lifshitz
interaction, the van der Waals friction force and the radiative heat transfer
at nonequilibrium conditions, when the interacting bodies are at different
temperatures, and they move relative to each other with the arbitrary velocity
$V$. The analysis is focused on the surface-surface and surface-particle
configuration. Our approach is based on the exact solution of electromagnetic
problem about the determination of the fluctuating electromagnetic field in the
vacuum gap between two flat parallel surfaces moving relative to each other
with the arbitrary velocity $V$. The velocity dependence of the considered
phenomena is determined by Doppler shift and can be strong for resonant photon
tunneling between surface modes.
  We show that relativistic effects give rise to a mixing of the contributions
from the electromagnetic waves with different polarization to the heat transfer
and the interaction forces. We find that these effects are of the order
$(V/c)^2$. The limiting case when one of the bodies is sufficiently rarefied
gives the heat transfer and the interaction forces between a moving small
particle and a surface.
  We also calculate the friction force acting on a particle moving with an
arbitrary velocity relative to the black body radiation.
