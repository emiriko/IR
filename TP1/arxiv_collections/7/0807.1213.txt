In this paper we introduce efficient Monte Carlo estimators for the valuation
of high-dimensional derivatives and their sensitivities (''Greeks''). These
estimators are based on an analytical, usually approximative representation of
the underlying density. We study approximative densities obtained by the WKB
method. The results are applied in the context of a Libor market model.
