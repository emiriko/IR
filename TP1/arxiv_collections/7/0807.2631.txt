We present magnetic and transport measurements on La5/8-yPryCa3/8MnO3 with y
= 0.3, a manganite compound exhibiting intrinsic multiphase coexistence of
sub-micrometric ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic charge ordered regions.
Time relaxation effects between 60 and 120K, and the obtained magnetic and
resistive viscosities, unveils the dynamic nature of the phase separated state.
An experimental procedure based on the derivative of the time relaxation after
the application and removal of a magnetic field enables the determination of
the otherwise unreachable equilibrium state of the phase separated system. With
this procedure the equilibrium phase fraction for zero field as a function of
temperature is obtained. The presented results allow a correlation between the
distance of the system to the equilibrium state and its relaxation behavior.
