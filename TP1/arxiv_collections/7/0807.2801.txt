In this paper we discuss opportunities for a neutrino program at the
Spallation Neutrons Source (SNS) being commissioning at ORNL. Possible
investigations can include study of neutrino-nuclear cross sections in the
energy rage important for supernova dynamics and neutrino nucleosynthesis,
search for neutrino-nucleus coherent scattering, and various tests of the
standard model of electro-weak interactions.
