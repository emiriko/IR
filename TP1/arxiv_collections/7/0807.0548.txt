We discuss the recent derivation of the two loop virtual QCD corrections to
the W boson pair production in the quark-anti-quark-annihilation channel in the
limit where all kinematical invariants are large compared to the mass of the W
boson. In particular, we describe the use of the PSLQ algorithm on an example
integral.
