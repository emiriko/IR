We investigate experimentally the influence of current flow through two
independent quantum point contacts to a nearby double quantum dot realized in a
GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructure. The observed current through the double quantum
dot can be explained in terms of coupling to a bosonic bath. The temperature of
the bath depends on the power generated by the current flow through the quantum
point contact. We identify the dominant absorption and emission mechanisms in a
double quantum dot as an interaction with acoustic phonons. The experiment
excludes coupling of a double quantum dot to shot noise generated by quantum
point contact as the dominant mechanism.
