We revisit the earlier determination of alpha_s(M_Z) via perturbative
analyses of short-distance-sensitive lattice observables, incorporating new
lattice data and performing a modified version of the original analysis. We
focus on two high-intrinsic-scale observables, log(W_11) and log(W_12), and one
lower-intrinsic scale observable, log(W_{12}/u_0^6), finding improved
consistency among the values extracted using the different observables and a
final result, alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1192(11), 2 sigma higher than the earlier result,
in excellent agreement with recent non-lattice determinations and, in addition,
in good agreement with the results of a similar, but not identical, re-analysis
by the HPQCD Collaboration. A discussion of the relation between the two
re-analyses is given, focussing on the complementary aspects of the two
approaches.
