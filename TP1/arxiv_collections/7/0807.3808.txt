A neutrino mass matrix model M_\nu with M_\nu^T =M_\nu and a model with its
inverse matrix form \widetilde{M}_\nu = m_0^2 (M_\nu^*)^{-1} can be
diagonalized by the same mixing matrix U_\nu. It is investigated whether a
scenario which provides a matrix model M_\nu with normal mass hierarchy can
also give a model with an inverted mass hierarchy by considering a model with
an inverse form of M_\nu.
