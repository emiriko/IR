We present the design, fabrication, and characterization of a metamaterial
absorber which is resonant at terahertz frequencies. We experimentally
demonstrate an absorptivity of 0.97 at 1.6 terahertz. Importantly, this
free-standing absorber is only 16 microns thick resulting in a highly flexible
material that, further, operates over a wide range of angles of incidence for
both transverse electric and transverse magnetic radiation.
