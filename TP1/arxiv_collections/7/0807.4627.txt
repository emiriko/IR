A Bose-Einstein condensate produced by a Hamiltonian which is rotationally or
translationally symmetric is fragmented as a direct result of these symmetries.
A corresponding mean-field unfragmented state, with an identical energy to
leading order in the number of particles, can generally be constructed. As a
consequence, vanishingly weak symmetry-breaking perturbations destabilize the
fragmented state, which would thus be extremely difficult to realize
experimentally, and lead to an unfragmented condensate.
