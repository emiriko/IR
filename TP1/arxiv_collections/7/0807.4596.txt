We provide a prescription of real feasible sources that supply fuel to
construct a traversable wormhole. A class of exact solutions for
Einstein-Maxwell field equations describing wormhole with an anisotropic matter
distribution has been presented. The anisotropy plays a crucial role for the
existence of the spacetime comprising wormhole geometry.
