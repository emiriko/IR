We use the Stokes photon of a biphoton pair to set the time origin for
electro-optic modulation of the wave function of the anti-Stokes photon thereby
allowing arbitrary phase and amplitude modulation. We demonstrate conditional
single-photon wave functions composed of several pulses, or instead, having
gaussian or exponential shapes.
