A comprehensive and detailed analysis of hadronic abundances measured in
Au-Au collisions at RHIC at sqrt(s)_NN = 130 and 200 GeV is presented. The
rapidity densities measured in the central rapidity region have been fitted to
the statistical hadronization model and the chemical freeze-out parameters
determined as a function of centrality, using data from experiments BRAHMS,
PHENIX and STAR. The chemical freeze-out temperature turns out to be
independent of centrality to a few percent accuracy, whereas the strangeness
under-saturation parameter gamma_S decreases from almost unity in central
collisions to a significantly lower value in peripheral collisions. Our results
are in essential agreement with previous analyses, with the exception that fit
quality at sqrt(s)_NN = 200 GeV is not as good as previously found. From the
comparison of the two different energies, we conclude that the difference in
fit quality, as described by chi2 values, is owing to the improved resolution
of measurements which has probably exceeded the intrinsic accuracy of the
simplified theoretical formula used in the fits.
