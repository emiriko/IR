We present a theory of hypoellipticity and unique ergodicity for semilinear
parabolic stochastic PDEs with "polynomial" nonlinearities and additive noise,
considered as abstract evolution equations in some Hilbert space. It is shown
that if Hormander's bracket condition holds at every point of this Hilbert
space, then a lower bound on the Malliavin covariance operator $M_t$ can be
obtained. Informally, this bound can be read as "Fix any finite-dimensional
projection $\Pi$ on a subspace of sufficiently regular functions. Then the
eigenfunctions of $M_t$ with small eigenvalues have only a very small component
in the image of $\Pi$".
  We also show how to use a priori bounds on the solutions to the equation to
obtain good control on the dependency of the bounds on the Malliavin matrix on
the initial condition. These bounds are sufficient in many cases to obtain the
asymptotic strong Feller property introduced in [HairerMattingly06].
  One of the main novel technical tools is an almost sure bound from below on
the size of "Wiener polynomials", where the coefficients are possibly
non-adapted stochastic processes satisfying a Lipschitz condition. By
exploiting the polynomial structure of the equations, this result can be used
to replace Norris' lemma, which is unavailable in the present context.
  We conclude by showing that the two-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes
equations and a large class of reaction-diffusion equations fit the framework
of our theory.
