We propose a research strategy for creating and deploying prescriptive
recommendations for spreadsheet practice. Empirical data on usage can be used
to create a taxonomy of spreadsheet classes. Within each class, existing
practices and ideal practices can he combined into proposed best practices for
deployment. As a first step we propose a scoping survey to gather non-anecdotal
data on spreadsheet usage. The scoping survey will interview people who develop
spreadsheets. We will investigate the determinants of spreadsheet importance,
identify current industry practices, and document existing standards for
creation and use of spreadsheets. The survey will provide insight into user
attributes, spreadsheet importance, and current practices. Results will be
valuable in themselves, and will guide future empirical research.
