The analysis of eight molecular datasets involving human and teleost examples
along with morphological samples from several groups of Neotropical electric
fish (Order: Gymnotiformes) were used in this thesis to test the dynamics of
both intraspecific variation and interspecific diversity. In terms of
investigating molecular interspecific diversity among humans, two experimental
exercises were performed. A cladistic exchange experiment tested for the extent
of discontinuity and interbreeding between H. sapiens and neanderthal
populations. As part of the same question, another experimental exercise tested
the amount of molecular variance resulting from simulations which treated
neanderthals as being either a local population of modern humans or as a
distinct subspecies. Finally, comparisons of hominid populations over time with
fish species helped to define what constitutes taxonomically relevant
differences between morphological populations as expressed among both trait
size ranges and through growth patterns that begin during ontogeny. Compared to
the subdivision found within selected teleost species, H. sapiens molecular
data exhibited little variation and discontinuity between geographical regions.
Results of the two experimental exercises concluded that neanderthals exhibit
taxonomic distance from modern H. sapiens. However, this distance was not so
great as to exclude the possibility of interbreeding between the two
subspecific groups. Finally, a series of characters were analyzed among species
of Neotropical electric fish. These analyses were compared with hominid
examples to determine what constituted taxonomically relevant differences
between populations as expressed among specific morphometric traits that
develop during the juvenile phase.
