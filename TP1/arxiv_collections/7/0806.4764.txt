We estimate the effect of leptonic CP violating phases in the minimal seesaw
model with two heavy neutrinos $N$ by imposing the approximately $\mu-\tau$
symmetry on the model. For $N$ subject to the $\mu-\tau$ symmetry, we find that
neutrinos show the normal mass hierarchy and obtain the general phase structure
that contains only two phases which arise from $\mu-\tau$ symmetry breaking
terms. To perform similar consideration for $N$ blind to the $\mu-\tau$
symmetry necessarily giving the inverted mass hierarchy, we assume the same
phase structure. Our phases consist of six phases that need to take care of
generic phases of flavor neutrino masses, from which one can obtain one Dirac
phase and one Majorana phase as observable phases (because one neutrino is
massless). The Dirac CP violating phase $\delta_{CP}(=\delta+\rho)$ depends on
the $\nu_e-\nu_{\tau}$ ($\nu_e-\nu_{\mu}$) mixing phase $\delta$ ($\rho$). The
Majorana CP violating phase is suppressed because it depend on $\rho$, which is
found to be associated with almost real quantity.
