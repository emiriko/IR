We construct a simplex for multipartite qubit states of even number n of
qubits, which has the same geometry concerning separability, mixedness, kind of
entanglement, amount of entanglement and nonlocality as the bipartite qubit
states. We derive the entanglement of the class of states which can be
described by only three real parameters with the help of a multipartite measure
for all discrete systems. We prove that the bounds on this measure are optimal
for the whole class of states and that it reveals that the states possess only
n-partite entanglement and not e.g. bipartite entanglement. We then show that
this n-partite entanglement can be increased by stochastic local operations and
classical communication to the purest maximal entangled states. However, pure
n-partite entanglement cannot be distilled, consequently all entangled states
in the simplex are n-partite bound entangled. We study also Bell inequalities
and find the same geometry as for bipartite qubits. Moreover, we show how the
(hidden) nonlocality for all n-partite bound entangled states can be revealed.
