We study the Hawking radiation of (4+n)-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole
imbedded in the space-time with positive cosmological constant. The greybody
and energy emission rates of scalars, fermions, bosons, and gravitons are
calculated in the full range of energy. The valuable information on the
dimensions and curvature of space-time is revealed. Furthermore, we investigate
the entropy radiated and lost by black hole. We find their ratio near unit in
favor of the Bekenstein's conjecture.
