Two major themes in the physics of condensed matter are quantum critical
phenomena and unconventional superconductivity. These usually occur in the
context of competing interactions in systems of strongly-correlated electrons.
All this interesting physics comes together in the behavior of the recently
discovered iron pnictide compounds that have generated enormous interest
because of their moderately high-temperature superconductivity. The ubiquity of
antiferromagnetic ordering in their phase diagrams naturally raises the
question of the relevance of magnetic quantum criticality, but the answer
remains uncertain both theoretically and experimentally. Here we show that the
undoped iron pnictides feature a novel type of magnetic quantum critical point,
which results from a competition between electronic localization and
itinerancy. Our theory provides a mechanism to understand the
experimentally-observed variation of the ordered moment among the undoped iron
pnictides. We suggest P substitution for As in the undoped iron pnictides as a
means to access this new example of magnetic quantum criticality in an unmasked
fashion. Our findings point to the iron pnictides as a much-needed new setting
for quantum criticality, one that offers a new set of control parameters.
