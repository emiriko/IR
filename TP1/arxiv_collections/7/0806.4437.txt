A new realist interpretation of quantum mechanics is introduced. Quantum
systems are shown to have two kinds of properties: the usual ones described by
values of quantum observables, which are called extrinsic, and those that can
be attributed to individual quantum systems without violating standard quantum
mechanics, which are called intrinsic. The intrinsic properties are classified
into structural and conditional. A systematic and self-consistent account is
given. Much more statements become meaningful than any version of Copenhagen
interpretation would allow. A new approach to classical properties, quantum
cosmology and measurement problem is suggested. A quantum definition of
classical states is proposed.
