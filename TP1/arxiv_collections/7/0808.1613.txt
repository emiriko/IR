Electrons in isolated graphene layers are a two-dimensional gas of massless
Dirac Fermions. In realistic devices, however, the electronic properties are
modified by elastic deformations, interlayer coupling and substrate
interaction. Here we unravel the electronic structure of doped graphene,
revisiting the stage one graphite intercalation compound KC$_8$ using
angle--resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ab--initio calculations. The
full experimental dispersion is in excellent agreement to calculations of doped
graphene once electron correlations are included on the $GW$ level. This
highlights that KC$_8$ has negligible interlayer coupling. Therefore Dirac
Fermion behaviour is preserved and we directly determine the full experimental
Dirac cone of doped graphene. In addition we prove that superconductivity in
KC$_8$ is mediated by electron--phonon coupling to an iTO phonon, yielding a
strong kink in the quasiparticle dispersion at 166 meV. These results are key
for understanding, both, the unique electronic properties of graphene and
superconductivity in KC$_8$.
