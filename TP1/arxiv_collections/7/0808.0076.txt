We study effects of turbulent mixing on the critical behaviour of a
nonequilibrium system near its second-order phase transition between the
absorbing and fluctuating states. The model describes the spreading of an agent
(e.g., infectious disease) in a reaction-diffusion system and belongs to the
universality class of the directed bond percolation process, also known as
simple epidemic process, and is equivalent to the Reggeon field theory. The
turbulent advecting velocity field is modelled by the Obukhov--Kraichnan's
rapid-change ensemble: Gaussian statistics with the correlation function < vv>
\propto \delta(t-t') k^{-d-\xi}, where k is the wave number and 0<\xi<2 is a
free parameter. Using the field theoretic renormalization group we show that,
depending on the relation between the exponent \xi and the space dimensionality
d, the system reveals different types of large-scale asymptotic behaviour,
associated with four possible fixed points of the renormalization group
equations. In addition to known regimes (ordinary diffusion, ordinary directed
percolation process, and passively advected scalar field), existence of a new
nonequilibrium universality class is established, and the corresponding
critical dimensions are calculated to first order of the double expansion in
\xi and \varepsilon=4-d (one-loop approximation). It turns out, however, that
the most realistic values \xi=4/3 (Kolmogorov's fully developed turbulence) and
d=2 or 3 correspond to the case of passive scalar field, when the nonlinearity
of the Reggeon model is irrelevant and the spreading of the agent is completely
determined by the turbulent transfer.
