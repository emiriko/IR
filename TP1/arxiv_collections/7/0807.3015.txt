In a recent article, we have advanced a semiclassical theory of quantum
circuits with discrete charge and electrical resistance. In this work, we
present a few elementary applications of this theory. For the zero resistance,
inductive circuit, we obtain the Stark ladder energies in yet another way; and
generalize earlier results by Chandia et. al, for the circuit driven by a
combination d.c. plus a.c. electromotive force (emf). As a second application,
we investigate the effect of electrical resistance, together with charge
discreteness, in the current amplitude, and resonance conditions of a general
$RLC$ quantum circuit, including nonlinear effects up to third order on the
external sinusoidal emf.
