In these notes we present a selection of topics, each section approximately
amounting to one lecture. We begin with a brief recapitulation of General
Relativity, and the Standard Model of Cosmology. This is followed by lectures
on important signatures of the remote past. These include : (i) inflation, (ii)
density perturbations leading to galaxy formation, (iii) study of hot and cold
relics decoupled from the remaining constituents, some of which can be
candidates for Dark Matter, (iv) baryon asymmetry of the Universe.
