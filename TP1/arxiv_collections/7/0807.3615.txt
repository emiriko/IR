We analyze a model of spinless fermions on a triangular lattice at
half-filling interacting via strong nearest-neighbor repulsive interactions, V,
using the variational Monte Carlo simulation technique. The existence of
three-sublattice long-range order is confirmed by the finite-size scaling
analysis of the charge structural factor at V_c/t > 12. This ordered phase
shows characteristics expected for a so called "pinball liquid" state, which
has the spontaneous separation of fermionic degrees of freedom into coexisting
Wigner crystal-like charge order (pin) and a metal (ball). The pins are fixed
in order to maximize the kinetic energy gain of balls which move almost freely.
The Fermi surface is reconstructed at V=V_c and remains towards the strong
coupling limit. These features reminiscent of the strong correlation together
with the large value of V_c/t distinguishes the pinball liquid from the
conventional charge-density-wave.
