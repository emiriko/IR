We study time-dependent quantum transport in a correlated model system by
means of time-propagation of the Kadanoff-Baym equations for the nonequilibrium
many-body Green function. We consider an initially contacted equilibrium system
of a correlated central region coupled to tight-binding leads. Subsequently a
time-dependent bias is switched on after which we follow in detail the
time-evolution of the system. Important features of the Kadanoff-Baym approach
are 1) the possibility of studying the ultrafast dynamics of transients and
other time-dependent regimes and 2) the inclusion of exchange and correlation
effects in a conserving approximation scheme. We find that initial correlation
and memory terms due to many-body interactions have a large effect on the
transient currents. Furthermore the value of the steady state current is found
to be strongly dependent on the approximation used to treat the electronic
interactions.
