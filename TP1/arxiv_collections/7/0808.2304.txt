For all systolic groups we construct boundaries which are EZ--structures.
This implies the Novikov conjecture for torsion--free systolic groups. The
boundary is constructed via a system of distinguished geodesics in a systolic
complex, which we prove to have coarsely similar properties to geodesics in
CAT(0) spaces.
