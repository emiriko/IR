We study the analogy between buckled colloidal monolayers and the
triangular-lattice Ising antiferromagnet. We calculate free volume-induced
Ising interactions, show how lattice deformations favor zigzag stripes that
partially remove the Ising model ground-state degeneracy, and identify the
Martensitic mechanism prohibiting perfect stripes. Slowly inflating the spheres
yields jamming as well as logarithmically slow relaxation reminiscent of the
glassy dynamics observed experimentally.
