Idempotent states on a compact quantum group are shown to yield group-like
projections in the multiplier algebra of the dual discrete quantum group. This
allows to deduce that every idempotent state on a finite quantum group arises
in a canonical way as the Haar state on a finite quantum hypergroup. A natural
order structure on the set of idempotent states is also studied and some
examples discussed.
