In DC and AC practical applications of MgB2 superconducting wires an
important role is represented by the material sheath which has to provide,
among other things, a suitable electrical and thermal stabilization. A way to
obtain a large enough amount of low resistivity material in to the conductor
architecture is to use it as external sheath. In this paper we study ex-situ
multifilamentary MgB2 wires using oxide-dispersion-strengthened copper
(GlidCop) as external sheath in order to reach a good compromise between
critical current density and thermal properties. We prepared three GlidCop
samples differing by the content of dispersed sub-microscopic Al2O3 particles.
We characterized the superconducting and thermal properties and we showed that
the good thermal conductivity together the good mechanical properties and a
reasonable critical current density make of GlidCop composite wire a useful
conductor for applications where high thermal conductivity is request at
temperature above 30K, such as Superconducting-FCL.
