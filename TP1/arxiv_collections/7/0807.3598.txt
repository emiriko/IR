High energy resolution photoelectron spectroscopy of conduction electrons in
the vicinity of the Fermi-edge in Al and Au at the excitation energy of 880 and
7940 eV was carried out using synchrotron radiation. For the excitation energy
of 7940 eV, the observed Fermi energy of Al shows a remarkable shift to higher
binding energy as compared with that of Au, with accompanying broadening. This
is due to the recoil effect of the emitted photoelectrons. The observed spectra
are well reproduced by a simple model of Bloch electrons based on the isotropic
Debye model.
