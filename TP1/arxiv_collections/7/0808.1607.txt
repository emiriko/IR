We study experimentally the Goos-Hanchen effect observed at the reflection of
a self-collimated beam from the surface of a two-dimensional photonic crystal
and describe a method for controlling the beam reflection through surface
engineering. The microwave photonic crystal, fabricated from alumina rods,
allows control of the output position of a reflected beam undergoing an
internal Goos-Hanchen shift by changing the rod diameter at the reflection
surface. The experimental data is in good agreement with the results of the
finite-difference time-domain numerical calculations.
