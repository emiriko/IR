In these lecture notes we review some prospect for the upcoming LHC
experiments in view of the exploration of the Standard Model (SM) or its
minimal Supersymmetric extension (MSSM). We focus on some theoretical aspects
concerning the Higgs sector of the two models. We give results for the
precision observables M_W and m_t and their impact on the indirect
determination of the Higgs sector. We furthermore review some prospects for the
direct measurements in the SM and MSSM Higgs sector.
