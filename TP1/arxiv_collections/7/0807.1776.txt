In this work we have studied the possibility of obtaining cosmic acceleration
in Brans-Dicke theory with varying or constant $\omega$ (Brans- Dicke
parameter) and with or without self-interacting potential, the background fluid
being barotropic fluid or Generalized Chaplygin Gas. Here we take the power law
form of the scale factor and the scalar field. We show that accelerated
expansion can also be achieved for high values of $\omega$ for closed Universe.
