We propose a perturbation method for determining the (largest) group of
invariance of a toric ideal defined in Aoki and Takemura [2008a]. In the
perturbation method, we investigate how a generic element in the row space of
the configuration defining a toric ideal is mapped by a permutation of the
indeterminates. Compared to the proof in Aoki and Takemura [2008a] which was
based on stabilizers of a subset of indeterminates, the perturbation method
gives a much simpler proof of the group of invariance. In particular, we
determine the group of invariance for a general hierarchical model of
contingency tables in statistics, under the assumption that the numbers of the
levels of the factors are generic. We prove that it is a wreath product indexed
by a poset related to the intersection poset of the maximal interaction effects
of the model.
