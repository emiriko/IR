We investigate the photoconductance of single-walled carbon
nanotube-nanocrystalhybrids. The nanocrystals are bound to the nanotubes via
molecular recognition. We find that the photoconductance of the hybrids can be
adjusted by the absorption characteristics of the nanocrystals. In addition,
the photoconductance of the hybrids surprisingly exhibits a slow time constant
of about 1 ms after excitation of the nanocrystals. The data are consistent
with a bolometrically induced current increase in the nanotubes caused by
photon absorption in the nanocrystals.
