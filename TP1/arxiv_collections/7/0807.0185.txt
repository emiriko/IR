We calculate numerically the density of states n(S) for SU(2) lattice gauge
theory on $L^4$ lattices. Small volume dependence are resolved for small values
of S. We compare $ln(n(S))$ with weak and strong coupling expansions.
Intermediate order expansions show a good overlap for values of S corresponding
to the crossover. We relate the convergence of these expansions to those of the
average plaquette. We show that when known logarithmic singularities are
subtracted from $ln(n(S))$, expansions in Legendre polynomials appear to
converge and could be suitable to determine the Fisher's zeros of the partition
function.
