A series of phenomena pertaining to economics, quantum physics, language,
literary criticism, and especially architecture is studied from the standpoint
of synergetics (the study of self-organizing complex systems). It turns out
that a whole series of concrete formulas describing these phenomena is
identical in these different situations. This is the case of formulas relating
to the Bose-Einstein distribution of particles and the distribution of words
from a frequency dictionary. This also allows to apply a "quantized" from of
the Zipf law to the problem of the authorship of 'Quiet Flows the Don' and to
the"blending in" of new architectural structures in an existing environment.
