Substantial control of the interlayer spacing in Bi-based high temperature
superconductors has been achieved through the intercalation of guest molecules
between the superconducting layers. Measurements using implanted muons reveal
that the penetration depth increases with increasing layer separation while T_c
does not vary appreciably, demonstrating that the bulk superfluid density is
not the determining factor controlling T_c. Our results strongly suggest that
the superfluid density appearing in the Uemura scaling relation n_s/m* \propto
T_c should be interpreted as the two dimensional density within the
superconducting layers, which we find to be constant for each class of system
investigated.
