Recently, Hawking radiation from a $4-$dimensional linear dilaton black hole
solution to Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory, via a method of computing
exactly the semi-classical radiation, has been derived by Cl\U{e9}ment, et al.
Their results show that, whenever solution is available to the massless scalar
wave equation, an exact computation of the radiation spectrum leads to the
Hawking temperature $T_{H}$. We apply the same method to derive Hawking
radiation spectrum for higher dimensional linear dilaton black holes in the
Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dilaton (EYMD) and Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theories.
Our results show that the radiation with high frequencies for these massive
black holes reveal some remarkable information about the $T_{H}$.
