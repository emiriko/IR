Regular and chaotic test particle motion in gravitational fields due to
stellar bodies with quadrupolar and octupolar deformation are studied using
Poincare surfaces of section. In first instance, we analyze the purely
Newtonian case and we find that the octupolar term induces a distortion in the
KAM curves corresponding to regular trajectories as well as an increase in
chaoticity, even in the case corresponding to oblate deformation. Then we
examine the effect of the first general relativistic corrections, provided by
the post Newtonian approach. For typical values of the post Newtonian
multipoles we find that the phase-space structure practically remains the same
as in the classical case, whereas that for certain larger values of these
multipoles the chaoticity vanishes. This important fact provides an interesting
example of a situation where a non-integrable dynamical system becomes
integrable through the introduction of a large perturbation.
