We show how a straightforward Bayesian updating procedure allows one to
detect and quantify entanglement from any finite set of measurement results.
The measurements do not have to be tomographically complete, and may consist of
POVMs rather than von Neumann measurements. One obtains a probability that
one's state is entangled and an estimate of any desired entanglement measure,
including their error bars. As an example we consider (tomographically
incomplete) spin correlation measurements on both 2-qubit and 3-qubit states.
As byproducts we obtain estimates of the volume of entangled states vs. states
that violate a given Bell inequality for both pure and mixed states, and an
inequality that relates the expectation value of the Bell operator to the
negativity.
