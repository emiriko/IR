We study screening of optical singularities in random optical fields with two
widely different length scales. We call the speckle patterns generated by such
fields speckled speckle, because the major speckle spots in the pattern are
themselves highly speckled. We study combinations of fields whose components
exhibit short- and long-range correlations, and find unusual forms of
screening.
