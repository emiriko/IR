Decoherence in Markovian systems can result indirectly from the action of a
system Hamiltonian which is usually fixed and unavoidable. Here, we show that
in general in Markovian systems, because of the system Hamiltonian, quantum
information decoheres. We give conditions for the system Hamiltonian that must
be satisfied if coherence is to be preserved. Finally, we show how to construct
robust subspaces for quantum information processing.
