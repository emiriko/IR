In a granular gas of rough particles the spin of a grain is correlated with
its linear velocity. We develop an analytical theory to account for these
correlations and compare its predictions to numerical simulations, using Direct
Simulation Monte Carlo as well as Molecular Dynamics. The system is shown to
relax from an arbitrary initial state to a quasi-stationary state, which is
characterized by time-independent, finite correlations of spin and linear
velocity. The latter are analysed systematically for a wide range of system
parameters, including the coefficients of tangential and normal restitution as
well as the moment of inertia of the particles. For most parameter values the
axis of rotation and the direction of linear momentum are perpendicular like in
a sliced tennis ball, while parallel orientation, like in a rifled bullet,
occurs only for a small range of parameters. The limit of smooth spheres is
singular: any arbitrarily small roughness unavoidably causes significant
translation-rotation correlations, whereas for perfectly smooth spheres the
rotational degrees of freedom are completely decoupled from the dynamic
evolution of the gas.
