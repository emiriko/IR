We present several new ideas on how to search for weakly interacting sub-eV
particles in laboratory experiments. The first experiment is sensitive to
minicharged particles. It exploits that in strong electric fields particle -
antiparticle pairs are produced by the Schwinger mechanism. The charged
particles move along the lines of the electric field and generate a current
that can be measured. The other two experiments are designed to search for
hidden-sector photons. They are based on photon - hidden photon oscillations
and resemble classic light shining through a wall experiments. One uses
(nearly) constant magnetic fields instead of the laser light. Photon - hidden
photon mixing would allow these magnetic fields to leak through superconducting
shielding which would ordinarily eliminate all magnetic fields. The other one
replaces the laser light with microwaves inside cavities. The latter can
achieve much higher quality factors than optical cavities increasing the
sensitivity.
