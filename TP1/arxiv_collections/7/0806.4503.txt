We investigate the emergence of single spin asymmetries (SSA) in hard
processes using transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distribution and
fragmentation functions. Specifically, the description of SSA involves time
reversal-odd functions. Process-dependence (non-universality) in measurements
of SSA can be attributed to the non-trivial gauge link structure in the TMD
correlator. Finding the appropriate gauge links, however, also enables us to
characterize the non-universality
