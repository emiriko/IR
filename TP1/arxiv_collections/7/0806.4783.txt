Bottom baryon masses are calculated based on a 2+1 flavor dynamical lattice
QCD simulation. The gauge field configurations were computed by the CP-PACS and
JLQCD collaborations using an improved clover action. The bottom quark is
described using lattice NRQCD. Results are presented for single and double-b
baryons at one lattice spacing. Comparison with experimental values is
discussed.
