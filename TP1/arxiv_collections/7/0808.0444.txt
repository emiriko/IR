Hadron electromagnetic form factors of hadrons in the time-like region at the
boundary of the physical region is considered. The energy behaviour of the form
factor is shown to be dominantely determined by the strong hadron-antihadron
interaction. The scattering length imaginary part for $p-\bar{p}$,
$\Lambda-\bar{\Lambda}$, $\Sigma^0-\bar{\Sigma^0}$ are evaluated. We propose
experiments to extract the information on the nearthreshold baryon-antibaryon
interaction by using of hadron form foctors.
