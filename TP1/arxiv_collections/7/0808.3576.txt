We study the model of a d-wave superconductor interacting with finite
concentration of Anderson impurities at zero temperature. The interaction
between impurity and conduction electrons is taken into account within the
large-$N$ approximation. We discuss the obtained phase diagram and its
dependence on the main energy scales.
