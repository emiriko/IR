We discuss the theoretical modelling of x-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD)
with hard x-ray excitation at up to 20 keV, using the dynamical theory of
electron diffraction to illustrate the characteristic aspects of diffraction
patterns resulting from such localized emission sources in a multi-layer
crystal.
  We show via dynamical calculations for diamond, Si, and Fe that the dynamical
theory well predicts available current data for lower energies around 1 keV,
and that the patterns for energies above about 1 keV are dominated by Kikuchi
bands which are created by the dynamical scattering of electrons from lattice
planes. The origin of the fine structure in such bands is discussed from the
point of view of atomic positions in the unit cell. The profiles and positions
of the element-specific photoelectron Kikuchi bands are found to be sensitive
to lattice distortions (e.g. a 1% tetragonal distortion) and the position of
impurities or dopants with respect to lattice sites. We also compare the
dynamical calculations to results from a cluster model that is more often used
to describe lower-energy XPD. We conclude that hard XPD (HXPD) should be
capable of providing unique bulk-sensitive structural information for a wide
variety of complex materials in future experiments.
