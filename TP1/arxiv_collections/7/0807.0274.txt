A basic feature of fluid mechanics concerns the frictionless phase-space
dynamics of particles in an incompressible fluid. The issue, besides its
theoretical interest in turbulence theory, is important in many applications,
such as the pollutant dynamics in the atmosphere, a problem relevant for civil
protection monitoring of air quality. Actually, both the numerical simulation
of the ABL (atmospheric boundary layer) portion of the atmosphere and that of
pollutant dynamics may generally require the correct definition of the
Lagrangian dynamics which characterizes arbitrary fluid elements of
incompressible thermofluids. We claim that particularly important for
applications would be to consider these trajectories as phase-space
trajectories. This involves, however, the unfolding of a fundamental
theoretical problem up to now substantially unsolved: {\it namely the
determination of the exact frictionless dynamics of tracer particles in an
incompressible fluid, treated either as a deterministic or a turbulent (i.e.,
stochastic) continuum.} In this paper we intend to formulate the necessary
theoretical framework to construct such a type of description. This is based on
a phase-space inverse kinetic theory (IKT) approach recently developed for
incompressible fluids (Ellero \textit{et al.}, 2004-2008). {\it Our claim is
that the conditional frictionless dynamics of a tracer particles - which
corresponds to a prescribed velocity probability density and an arbitrary
choice of the relevant fluid fields - can be exactly specified}.
