This is the second of two papers on a continuum version of the Potts model,
where particles are points in $\mathbb R^d$, $d\ge 2$, with a spin which may
take $S\ge 3$ possible values. Particles with different spins repel each other
via a Kac pair potential of range $\ga^{-1}$, $\ga>0$. In this paper we prove
phase transition, namely we prove that if the scaling parameter of the Kac
potential is suitably small, given any temperature there is a value of the
chemical potential such that at the given temperature and chemical potential
there exist $S+1$ mutually distinct DLR measures.
