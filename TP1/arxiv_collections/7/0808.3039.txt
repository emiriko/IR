The electron tunneling is experimentally studied between two-dimensional
electron gases (2DEGs) formed in a single-doped-barrier heterostructure in the
magnetic fields directed perpendicular to the 2DEGs planes. It is well known
that the quantizing magnetic field induces the Coulomb pseudogap suppressing
the electron tunneling at Fermi level. In this paper we firstly present the
experimental results revealing the pseudogap in the electron tunneling assisted
by elastic electron scattering on disorder.
