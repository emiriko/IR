This paper presents the design and the implementation of an interface
software component between OLE for Process Control (OPC) formatted data and the
Global Sensor Network (GSN) framework for management of data from sensors. This
interface, named wrapper in the GSN context, communicates in Data Access mode
with an OPC server and converts the received data to the internal GSN format,
according to several temporal modes. This work is realized in the context of a
Ph.D. Thesis about the control of distributed information fusion systems. The
developed component allows the injection of OPC data, like measurements or
industrial processes states information, into a distributed information fusion
system deployed in a GSN framework. The component behaves as a client of the
OPC server. Developed in Java and based on the Opensaca Utgard, it can be
deployed on any computation node supporting a Java virtual machine. The
experiments show the component conformity according to the Data Access 2.05a
specification of the OPC standard and to the temporal modes.
