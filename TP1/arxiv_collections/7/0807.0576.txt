One of the objectives of the vast physics programme of the recently
comissioned WASA-at-COSY facility is the study of fundamental symmetries via
the measurements of the eta and eta-prime mesons decays. Especially interesting
are isospin violating hadronic precesses of these mesons into 3pi systems
driven by the term of QCD Lagrangian which depends on the mass difference of
the u and d quarks. When an eta or an eta-prime meson is created in the
hadronic reaction signals from such decays may be significantly obscured by the
prompt production of pi mesons. In this thesis we present the estimation of the
upper limit of the background due to prompt pion production for the eta-prime
->3pi0 and eta-prime->pi+pi-pi decays. Using the data from proton-proton
collisions measured by the COSY-11 group we have extracted differential cross
sections for the multimeson production with the invariant mass corresponding to
the mass of the eta-prime meson. Based on these results and on parametrizations
of the total cross sections for the eta-prime meson as well as parametrization
of the upper limit for the prompt pi+pi-pi0 production in the collisions of
protons we discuss in details the feasibility of a measurement of the eta-prime
meson decay into 3pi channels with the WASA-at-COSY facility. Based on the
chiral unitary approach the value of the branching ratio
BR(eta-prime->pi+pi-pi0) was recently predicted to be about 1%. We show that
the WASA-at-COSY has a potential to verify this result empirically.
