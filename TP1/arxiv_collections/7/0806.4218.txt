We investigate experimentally the absorptive and dispersive properties of
triple-resonant optical parametric amplifier OPA for the degenerate subharmonic
field. In the experiment, the subharmonic field is utilized as the probe field
and the harmonic wave as the pump field. We demonstrate that EIT-like effect
can be simulated in the triple-resonant OPA when the cavity line-width for the
harmonic wave is narrower than that for the subharmonic field. However, this
phenomenon can not be observed in a double-resonant OPA. The narrow
transparency window appears in the reflected field. Especially, in the measured
dispersive spectra of triple-resonant OPA, a very steep variation of the
dispersive profile of the subharmonic field is observed, which can result in a
slow light as that observed in atomic EIT medium.
