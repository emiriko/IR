Superconducting excitations -- Bogoliubov quasiparticles -- are the quantum
mechanical mixture of negatively charged electron (-e) and positively charged
hole (+e). We propose a new observable for Angular Resolved Photoemission
Spectroscopy (ARPES) studies that is the manifestation of the particle-hole
entanglement of the superconducting quasiparticles. We call this observable a
{\em Bogoliubov angle}. This angle measures the relative weight of particle and
hole amplitude in the superconducting (Bogoliubov) quasiparticle. We show how
this quantity can be measured by comparing the ratio of spectral intensities at
positive and negative energies.
