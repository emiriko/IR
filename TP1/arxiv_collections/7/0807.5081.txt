We present an integrability-preserving recursion relation for the explicit
construction of long-range spin chain Hamiltonians. These chains are
generalizations of the Haldane-Shastry and Inozemtsev models and they play an
important role in recent advances in string/gauge duality. The method is based
on arbitrary nearest-neighbour integrable spin chains and it sheds light on the
moduli space of deformation parameters. We also derive the closed chain
asymptotic Bethe equations.
