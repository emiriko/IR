We apply an analytical model for anisotropic, colliding Bose-Einstein
condensates in a spontaneous four wave mixing geometry to evaluate the second
order correlation function of the field of scattered atoms. Our approach uses
quantized scattering modes and the equivalent of a classical, undepleted pump
approximation. Results to lowest order in perturbation theory are compared with
a recent experiment and with other theoretical approaches.
