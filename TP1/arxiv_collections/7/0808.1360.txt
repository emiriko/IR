The differential cross section for the dilepton production is calculated
including Fermi motion of hadron constituents as well as emission from the
ladders in the formalism of unintegrated parton distributions. We use
unintegrated parton distributions which fulfil Kwieci\'nski evolution
equations. Both zeroth- and first-order (for matrix element) contributions are
included. We calculate azimuthal angular correlations between charged leptons
and deviations from the $p_t(l^+) = p_t(l^-)$ relation. We concentrate on the
distribution in dilepton-pair transverse momentum. We find incident energy and
virtuality dependence of the distribution in transverse momentum of the lepton
pair. We study also azimuthal correlations between jet and dilepton pair and
correlation in the $(p_{1t}(jet),p_{2t}(l^+ l^-))$ space. The results are
compared with experimental data of the R209 and UA1 collaborations.
