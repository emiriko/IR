We simulate the growth of a dual species Bose-Einstein condensate using a
Gross-Pitaevskii equation with an additional gain term giving rise to the
growth. Such growth occurs during simultaneous evaporative cooling of a mixture
of two gases. The ground state of a dual condensate is normally either a
miscible mixture, or an immiscible phase with two spatially separated
components. In a cigar trap the ground state typically consists of one
component in the center, and the other component flanking it. Our simulations
show that when the condensates are formed in a cigar trap and the mixture is
phase separated, then the final state upon the end of the growth is generally
far from the true ground state of the system. Instead it consists of multiple,
interleaved bubbles of the two species. Such a pattern was observed recently in
an experiment by Wieman's group at JILA, and our simulations are in good
qualitative agreement with the experiment. We explain the pattern formation as
due to the onset of modulation instability during growth, and study the
dependence of the final state pattern on various parameters of the system.
