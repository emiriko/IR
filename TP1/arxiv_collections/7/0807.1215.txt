Three CLEO-c results related to flavour-physics are presented: the
determination of the strong-phase difference between D0->K+pi- and D0->K-pi+,
delta, the measurement of the coherence parameter and average strong-phase
difference between D0->K+pi-pi-pi+ and D0 -> K-pi+pi+pi- and measurements of
the variation of strong-phase difference between D0 and D0bar decays to
K0Spi+pi- over phase space. All measurements are important for determining the
unitarity triangle angle gamma from B->D(*)K(*) decays. Furthermore, the
measurement of delta is important for interpreting D0-D0bar mixing.
