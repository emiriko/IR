Coulomb corrections for quasi-elastic scattering of electrons by nuclei are
calculated using eikonal distorted waves. Corrections to the lowest-order
eikonal approximation are included in order to obtain accurate results.
Spin-dependent eikonal phase shifts are evaluated and they yield very small
corrections to the longitudinal and transverse cross sections at electron
energies of 500 MeV or higher. Because of this the Rosenbluth procedure is
accurate for separation of the longitudinal and transverse response functions.
The effective-momentum approximation is also found to be accurate with regard
to removal of the remaining Coulomb effects from the distorted waves.
Calculations are presented for electron scattering from Pb and Fe nuclei at
energies of 500 MeV and 800 MeV and momentum transfers q = 550 MeV/c and 900
MeV/c.
