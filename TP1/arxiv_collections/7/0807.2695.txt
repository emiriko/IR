In this Letter we describe a search for lepton flavor violation (LFV) in the
bottomonium system. We search for leptonic decays of Upsilon(nS)(n=1,2, and 3)
into muon and tau using the data collected with the CLEO III detector. We
identify the tau lepton using its leptonic decay into electron and utilize
multidimensional likelihood fitting with PDF shapes measured from independent
data samples. We report our estimates of 95% CL upper limits on LFV branching
fractions of Upsilon mesons. We interpret our results in terms of the exclusion
plot for the energy scale of a hypothetical new interaction versus its
effective LFV coupling in the framework of effective field theory.
