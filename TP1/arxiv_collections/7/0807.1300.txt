This contribution tries to highlight the importance of Minkowski's ``Raum und
Zeit'' lecture in a ``negative'' way, where {\it negative} is taken in the
photographic sense of reversing lights and shades. Indeed, we focus on the
``shades'' of Minkowski's text, i.e. what is missing, or misunderstood. In
particular, we focus on two issues: (i) why are Poincar\'e's pioneering
contributions to four-dimensional geometry not quoted by Minkowski (while he
abundantly quoted them a few months before the Cologne lecture)?, and (ii) did
Minkowski fully grasp the physical (and existential) meaning of ``time'' within
spacetime? We think that this ``negative'' approach (and the contrast between
Poincar\'e's and Minkowski's attitudes towards physics) allows one to better
grasp the boldness of the {\it revolutionary} step taken by Minkowski in his
Cologne lecture.
