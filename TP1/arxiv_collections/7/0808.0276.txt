We use the extended Barabasi model without the rewired process and show that
the degree distribution for the corresponding networks is the Tsallis
distribution. We offer an analysis of the novel "The Sound and the Fury" by W.
Faulkner in English and in Russian, and show that the degree distributions of
the relevant word networks are described with the Tsallis distribution. We have
constructed degree distributions for each of the relevant word networks and
defined the value of the nonextensivity parameter with the maximum likelihood
method. For the novel text in English qB = 1.57; qK = 1.49; qJ = 1.53; qA =
1.47; qT = 1.54, and for the translation into Russian qB = 1.50; qK = 1.42; qD
= 1.46; qA = 1.40; qT = 1.47. Therefore, if the translation of the novel is
regarded as mapping, the nonextensivity parameters ordering qB > qT > qD > qK >
qA is an invariant of this mapping.
