A formalism to evaluate the Sivers function, developed for calculations in
constituent quark models, is applied to the Isgur-Karl model. A non-vanishing
Sivers asymmetry, with opposite signs for the u and d flavor, is found; the
Burkardt sum rule is fulfilled up to 2 %. Nuclear effects in the extraction of
neutron single spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering off
3He are also evaluated. In the kinematics of JLab, it is found that the nuclear
effects described by an Impulse Approximation approach are under control.
