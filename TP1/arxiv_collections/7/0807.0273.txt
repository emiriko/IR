In this letter, we compute the corrections to the Cardy-Verlinde formula of
$4-$dimensional Kerr black hole. These corrections are considered within the
context of KKW analysis and arise as a result of the self-gravitational effect.
Then we show, one can taking into account the semiclassical corrections of the
Cardy-Verlinde entropy formula by just redefining the Virasoro operator $L_0$
and the central charge $c$.
