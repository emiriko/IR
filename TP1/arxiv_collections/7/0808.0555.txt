A "pairing function" J associates a unique natural number z to any two
natural numbers x,y such that for two "unpairing functions" K and L, the
equalities K(J(x,y))=x, L(J(x,y))=y and J(K(z),L(z))=z hold. Using pairing
functions on natural number representations of truth tables, we derive an
encoding for Binary Decision Diagrams with the unique property that its boolean
evaluation faithfully mimics its structural conversion to a a natural number
through recursive application of a matching pairing function. We then use this
result to derive {\em ranking} and {\em unranking} functions for BDDs and
reduced BDDs. The paper is organized as a self-contained literate Prolog
program, available at http://logic.csci.unt.edu/tarau/research/2008/pBDD.zip
