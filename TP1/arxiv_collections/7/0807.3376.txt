We consider the claim that decoherence explains the emergence of classicality
in quantum systems, and conclude that it does not. We show that, given a
randomly chosen universe composed of a variety of subsystems, some of which are
macroscopic and subject to decoherence-inducing interactions, and some of which
are microscopic, the macroscopic subsystems will not display any distinctively
classical behavior. Therefore, a universe in which macroscopic and microscopic
do display distinct behavior must be in a very special, highly nongeneric
quantum state.
