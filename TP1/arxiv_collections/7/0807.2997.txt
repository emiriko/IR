A new MS Excel application has been developed which seeks to reduce the risks
associated with the development, operation and auditing of Excel spreadsheets.
FormulaDataSleuth provides a means of checking spreadsheet formulas and data as
they are developed or used, enabling the users to identify actual or potential
errors quickly and thereby halt their propagation. In this paper, we will
describe, with examples, how the application works and how it can be applied to
reduce the risks associated with Excel spreadsheets.
