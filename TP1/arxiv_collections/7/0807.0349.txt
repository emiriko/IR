We demonstrate a 10-GHz bandwidth digitizer with 7-effective bits of
resolution and 52dB SFDR, using photonic time stretch technique. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the highest resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
of the same bandwidth, with at least an order of magnitude higher SNR than
previously achieved. This is made possible by correction of distortion due to
time warps, and non-linearities due to wavelength dependent bias variation in
the Mach-Zehnder modulator. We also demonstrate concatenation of 30 wavelength
interleaved time segments with high fidelity on the path to achieving
continuous time operation.
