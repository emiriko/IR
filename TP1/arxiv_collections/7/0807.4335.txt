We demonstrate a diode-laser-pumped system for generation of quadrature
squeezing and polarization squeezing. Due to their excess phase noise, diode
lasers are challenging to use in phase-sensitive quantum optics experiments
such as quadrature squeezing. The system we present overcomes the phase noise
of the diode laser through a combination of active stabilization and
appropriate delays in the local oscillator beam. The generated light is
resonant to the rubidium D1 transition at 795nm and thus can be readily used
for quantum memory experiments.
