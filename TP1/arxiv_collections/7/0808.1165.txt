We report on a calculation of higher electromagnetic multipole moments of
baryons in a non-covariant quark model approach. The employed method is based
on the underlying spin-flavor symmetry of the strong interaction and its
breaking.We present results on magnetic octupole moments of decuplet baryons
and discuss their implications.
