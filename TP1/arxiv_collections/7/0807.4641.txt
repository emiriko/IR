We study the counting statistics for electrons and photons being emitted from
a driven two level quantum dot. Our technique allows us to calculate their
mutual correlations as well. We study different transport configurations by
tuning the chemical potential of one of the leads to find that the electronic
and photonic fluctuations can be externally manipulated by tuning the AC and
transport parameters. We also propose special configurations where
electron-photon correlation is maximal meaning that spontaneous emission of
photons with a well defined energy is regulated by single electron tunneling.
Interesting features are also obtained for energy dependent tunneling.
