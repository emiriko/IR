This paper studies the kinematic geometry of general 3-RPR planar parallel
robots with actuated base joints. These robots, while largely overlooked, have
simple direct kinematics and large singularity-free workspace. Furthermore,
their kinematic geometry is the same as that of a newly developed parallel
robot with SCARA-type motions. Starting from the direct and inverse kinematic
model, the expressions for the singularity loci of 3-RPR planar parallel robots
are determined. Then, the global behaviour at all singularities is
geometrically described by studying the degeneracy of the direct kinematic
model. Special cases of self-motions are then examined and the degree of
freedom gained in such special configurations is kinematically interpreted.
Finally, a practical example is discussed and experimental validations
performed on an actual robot prototype are presented.
