In this paper we (re)consider the problem of electromagnetic interactions for
massless spin 2 particles and show that in $(A)dS$ spaces with non-zero
cosmological constant it is indeed possible (at least in linear approximation)
to switch on minimal electromagnetic interactions supplemented by third
derivative non-minimal ones which are necessary to restore gauge invariance.
