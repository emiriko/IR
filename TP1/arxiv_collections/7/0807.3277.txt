We consider the enciphering of a data stream while being compressed by a LZ
algorithm. This has to be compared to the classical encryption after
compression methods used in security protocols. Actually, most cryptanalysis
techniques exploit patterns found in the plaintext to crack the cipher;
compression techniques reduce these attacks. Our scheme is based on a LZ
compression in which a Vernam cipher has been added. We make some security
remarks by trying to measure its randomness with statistical tests. Such a
scheme could be employed to increase the speed of security protocols and to
decrease the computing power for mobile devices.
