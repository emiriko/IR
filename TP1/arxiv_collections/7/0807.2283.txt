In the context of many leptogenesis and baryogenesis scenarios, B-L (baryon
minus the lepton number) is converted into B (baryon number) by
non-perturbative B+L violating operators in the SU(2)_L sector. We correct a
common misconversion of B-L to B in the literature in the context of
supersymmetry. More specifically, kinematic effects associated with the
sparticle masses can be generically important (typically a factor of 2/3
correction in mSUGRA scenarios), and in some cases, it may even flip the sign
between B-L and B. We give explicit formulae for converting B-L to B for
temperatures approaching the electroweak phase transition temperature from
above. Enhancements of B are also possible, leading to a mild relaxation of the
reheating temperature bounds coming from gravitino constraints.
