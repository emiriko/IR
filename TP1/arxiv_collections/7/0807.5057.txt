We consider a model inspired by a metal break-junction hypothetically caught
at its breaking point, where the non-adiabatic center-of-mass motion of the
bridging atom can be treated as a two-level system. By means of Numerical
Renormalization Group (NRG) we calculate the influence of the two level system
on the ballistic conductance across the bridge atom. The results are shown to
be fully consistent with a conformal field theory treatment. We find that the
conductance, calculated by coupling Fermi liquid theory to our NRG is always
finite and fractional at zero temperature, but drops quite fast as the
temperature increases.
