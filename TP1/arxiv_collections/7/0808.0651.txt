Imagine a task in which a group of separated players aim to simulate a
statistic that violates a Bell inequality. Given measurement choices the
players shall announce an output based solely on the results of local
operations -- which they can discuss before the separation -- on shared random
data and shared copies of a so-called unit correlation. In the first part of
this article we show that in such a setting the simulation of any bipartite
correlation, not containing the possibility of signaling, can be made
arbitrarily accurate by increasing the number of shared Popescu-Rohrlich (PR)
boxes. This establishes the PR box as a simple asymptotic unit of bipartite
nonlocality. In the second part we study whether this property extends to the
multipartite case. More generally, we ask if it is possible for separated
players to asymptotically reproduce any nonsignaling statistic by local
operations on bipartite unit correlations. We find that non-adaptive strategies
are limited by a constant accuracy and that arbitrary strategies on n resource
correlations make a mistake with a probability greater or equal to c/n, for
some constant c.
