Recently, the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration has repeated and reinforced their
claim to have detected an annual modulation in their signal rate, and have
interpreted this observation as evidence for dark-matter particles at the 8.2
sigma confidence level. Furthermore, it has also been noted that the effects of
channeling may enable a WIMP that scatters elastically via spin-independent
interactions from nuclei to produce the signal observed by DAMA/LIBRA without
exceeding the limits placed by CDMS, XENON, CRESST, CoGeNT and other
direct-detection experiments. To accommodate this signal, however, the mass of
the responsible dark-matter particle must be relatively light, m_{DM} \lsim 10
GeV. Such dark-matter particles will become captured by and annihilate in the
Sun at very high rates, leading to a potentially large flux of GeV-scale
neutrinos. We calculate the neutrino spectrum resulting from WIMP annihilations
in the Sun and show that existing limits from Super-Kamiokande can be used to
close a significant portion of the DAMA region, especially if the dark-matter
particles produce tau leptons or neutrinos in a sizable fraction of their
annihilations. We also determine the spin-dependent WIMP-nuclei
elastic-scattering parameter space consistent with DAMA. The constraints from
Super-Kamiokande on the spin-dependent scenario are even more severe--they
exclude any self-annihilating WIMP in the DAMA region that annihilates 1% of
the time or more to any combination of neutrinos, tau leptons, or charm or
bottom quarks.
