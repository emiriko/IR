Optical field fluctuations in self-defocusing media can be described in terms
of sound waves in a 2D photon-fluid. It is shown that, while the background
fluid couples with the usual flat metric, sound-like waves experience an
effective curved spacetime determined by the physical properties of the flow.
In an optical cavity configuration, the background spacetime can be suitably
controlled by the driving beam allowing the formation of acoustic ergoregions
and event horizons. An experiment simulating the main features of the rotating
black hole geometry is proposed.
