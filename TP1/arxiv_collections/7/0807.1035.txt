This paper is the second of two which construct coherent states for spin
networks with planar symmetry. Paper 1 constructs set of coherent states peaked
at specific values of holonomy and triad. These operators acting on the
coherent state give back the coherent state plus small correction (SC) states.
The present paper proves that these SC states form a complete subset of the
overcomplete set of coherent states. The subset is used to construct a
perturbation expansion of the inverse of the volume operator. Appendices
calculate the standard deviations of the angles occurring in the holonomies,
demonstrate that standard deviations are given by matrix elements of the SC
states, and estimate the rate of spreading of a coherent state wave packet.
