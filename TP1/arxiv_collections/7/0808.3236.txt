We consider a N=1 supersymmetric E(8) gauge theory, defined in ten dimensions
and we determine all four-dimensional gauge theories resulting from the
generalized dimensional reduction a la Forgacs-Manton over coset spaces,
followed by a subsequent application of the Wilson flux spontaneous symmetry
breaking mechanism. Our investigation is constrained only by the requirements
that (i) the dimensional reduction leads to the potentially phenomenologically
interesting, anomaly free, four-dimensional E(6), SO(10) and SU(5) GUTs and
(ii) the Wilson flux mechanism makes use only of the freely acting discrete
symmetries of all possible six-dimensional coset spaces.
