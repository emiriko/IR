The equations of in-medium gluodynamics are proposed. Their classical lowest
order solution is explicitly shown for a color charge moving with constant
speed. For nuclear permittivity larger than 1 it describes the shock wave
induced by emission of Cherenkov gluons. Specific effects at LHC energies are
described and compared with Mach wave predictions.
