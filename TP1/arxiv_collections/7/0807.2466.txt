The Grateful Dead were an American band that was born out of the San
Francisco, California psychedelic movement of the 1960s. The band played music
together from 1965 to 1995 and is well known for concert performances
containing extended improvisations and long and unique set lists. This article
presents a comparative analysis between 1,590 of the Grateful Dead's concert
set lists from 1972 to 1995 and 2,616,990 last.fm Grateful Dead listening
events from August 2005 to October 2007. While there is a strong correlation
between how songs were played in concert and how they are listened to by
last.fm members, the outlying songs in this trend identify interesting aspects
of the band and their fans 10 years after the band's dissolution.
