The Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials $y_{n}(t)$, which are defined by a second
order bilinear differential-difference equation, provide rational solutions of
the Toda lattice. They are also polynomial tau-functions for the rational
solutions of the second Painlev\'{e} equation ($P_{II}$). Here we define
two-variable polynomials $Y_{n}(t,h)$ on a lattice with spacing $h$, by
considering rational solutions of the discrete time Toda lattice as introduced
by Suris. These polynomials are shown to have many properties that are
analogous to those of the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials, to which they reduce
when $h=0$. They also provide rational solutions for a particular
discretisation of $P_{II}$, namely the so called {\it alternate discrete}
$P_{II}$, and this connection leads to an expression in terms of the Umemura
polynomials for the third Painlev\'{e} equation ($P_{III}$). It is shown that
B\"{a}cklund transformation for the alternate discrete Painlev\'{e} equation is
a symplectic map, and the shift in time is also symplectic. Finally we present
a Lax pair for the alternate discrete $P_{II}$, which recovers Jimbo and Miwa's
Lax pair for $P_{II}$ in the continuum limit $h\to 0$.
