Neutron diffraction and magnetization measurements of the magneto refrigerant
Mn1+yFe1-yP1-xGex reveal that the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases
correspond to two very distinct crystal structures, with the magnetic entropy
change as a function of magnetic field or temperature being directly controlled
by the phase fraction of this first-order transition. By tuning the physical
properties of this system we have achieved a maximum magnetic entropy change
exceeding 74 J/Kg K for both increasing and decreasing field, more than twice
the value of the previous record.
