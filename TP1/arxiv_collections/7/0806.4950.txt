With U-spin symmetry, b->s and b->d penguin decays could be a subtle probe of
CP violating new physics contributions. We show that, for B->PP (P stands for a
pseudoscalar meson), the U-spin relation is expected to be violated for only
one decay pair by assuming that new physics affects only b->s transition
processes. We also very shortly discuss the polarizations of two types of
U-spin pairs for B->VV (V stands for a vector meson).
