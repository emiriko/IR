Motivated by recent interest in the spectrum of the Laplacian of incomplete
surfaces with isolated conical singularities, we consider more general
incomplete m-dimensional manifolds with singularities on sets of codimension at
least 2. With certain restrictions on the metric, we establish that the
spectrum is discrete and satisfies Weyl's asymptotic formula.
