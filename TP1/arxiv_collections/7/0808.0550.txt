We study the time evolution of two electron spin states in a double
quantum-dot system, which includes a nearby quantum point contact (QPC) as a
measurement device. We obtain that the QPC measurement induced decoherence is
in time scales of microsecond. We also find that the enhanced QPC measurement
will trap the system in its initial spin states, which is consistent with
quantum Zeno effect.
