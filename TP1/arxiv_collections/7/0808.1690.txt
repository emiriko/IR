Statistical properties of a laser based on a one-dimensional disordered
superlattice open at one side are studied numerically. The passive normal modes
of the system are determined using the Feshbach projection technique. It is
found that the mode competition due to the spacial hole burning leads to a
saturation of the number of lasing modes with increasing pump rate. It is also
responsible for nonmonotonic dependence of intensities of lasing modes as
functions of pumping. Computed distributions of spectral spacing and intensity
statistics are in qualitative agreement with experimental results.
