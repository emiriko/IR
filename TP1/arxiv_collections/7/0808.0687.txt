Particles that interact via a square-shoulder potential, consisting of an
impenetrable hard core with an adjacent, repulsive, step-like corona, are able
to self-organize in a surprisingly rich variety of rather unconventional
ordered structures. Using optimization strategies that are based on ideas of
genetic algorithms we encounter, as we systematically increase the pressure,
the following archetypes of aggregates: low-symmetry cluster and columnar
phases, followed by lamellar particle arrangements, until at high pressure
values compact, high-symmetry lattices emerge. These structures are
characterized in the NPT ensemble as configurations of minimum Gibbs free
energy. Based on simple considerations, i.e., basically minimizing the number
of overlapping coronae while maximizing at the same time the density, the
sequence of emerging structures can easily be understood.
