The inclusion of plasma magnetization in the equations of stationary
equilibrium is derived, and its effect on the determination of axisymmetric
equilibrium calculated. A factor of 2 on the pressure gradient arises in the
equilibrium equation from the force felt by the dipole moment density. The
algebraic and differential equation formulations are compared both with and
without consideration of magnetization, revealing the effects of both
magnetization and magnetic field variation on the equilibrium, which become
more pronounced for high pressures in a weak external field. The equivalence of
the magnetized equilibrium equation with the standard equilibrium equation in
the limit of vanishing magnetization is demonstrated.
