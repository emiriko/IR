We have performed zero-field $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance study of
SmFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ (x=0, 0.07) polycrystals in a wide frequency range at
various temperatures. $^{75}$As resonance line was found at around 265 MHz
revealing the formation of the intermetallic FeAs clusters in the new layered
superconductors. We have also demonstrated that NMR is a sensitive tool for
probing the quality of these materials.
