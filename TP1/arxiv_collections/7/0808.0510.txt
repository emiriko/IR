Cubelike graphs are the Cayley graphs of the elementary abelian group (Z_2)^n
(e.g., the hypercube is a cubelike graph). We give conditions for perfect state
transfer between two particles in quantum networks modeled by a large class of
cubelike graphs. This generalizes results of Christandl et al. [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 92, 187902 (2004)] and Facer et al. [Phys. Rev. A 92, 187902 (2008)].
