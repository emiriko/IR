We study a spinless hardcore boson model on checkerboard lattices by Green
function Monte Carlo method. At half filling, the ground state energy is
obtained up to $28\times 28$ lattice and extrapolated to infinite size, the
staggered pseudospin magnetization is found to vanish in the thermodynamic
limit. Thus the $(\pi,\pi)$ charge order is absent in this system. Away from
half filling, two defects induced by each hole (particle) may carry fractional
charge ($\pm e/2$). For one hole case, we study how the defect-defect
correlation changes with $t/J$, which is the ratio between the hopping integral
and cyclic exchange, equals to $V/2t$ when $V\gg t$. Moreover, we argue that
these fractional defects may propagate independently when the concentration of
holes (or defects) is large enough.
