We introduce the concept of {\em information compressibility}, $K_I$, which
measures the relative change of number of available microstates of an open
system in response to an energy variation. We then prove that at the time in
which the system reaches a steady state, the second and third time derivatives
of the information entropy are proportional to the corresponding time
derivatives of the energy, the proportionality constant being $K_I$. We argue
that if two steady states with different but same-sign $K_I$ are dynamically
connected in a non-adiabatic way it takes a longer time to reach the state with
compressibility closer to zero than the reverse. This concept, that applies to
both classical and quantum open systems, thus provides insight into the
properties of non-equilibrium steady states.
