We investigate the behavior in $N$ of the $N$--particle entropy functional
for Kac's stochastic model of Boltzmann dynamics, and its relation to the
entropy function for solutions of Kac's one dimensional nonlinear model
Boltzmann equation. We prove a number of results that bring together the notion
of propagation of chaos, which Kac introduced in the context of this model,
with the problem of estimating the rate of equilibration in the model in
entropic terms, and obtain a bound showing that the entropic rate of
convergence can be arbitrarily slow. Results proved here show that one can in
fact use entropy production bounds in Kac's stochastic model to obtain entropic
convergence bounds for his non linear model Boltzmann equation, though the
problem of obtaining optimal lower bounds of this sort for the original Kac
model remains open, and the upper bounds obtained here show that this problem
is somewhat subtle.
