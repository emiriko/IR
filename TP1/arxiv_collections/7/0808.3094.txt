In grand unified theories (GUT), non-universal boundary conditions for the
gaugino masses may arise at the unification scale, and affect the observability
of the neutral MSSM Higgs bosons (h/H/A) at the LHC. The implications of such
non-universal gaugino masses are investigated for the Higgs boson production in
the SUSY cascade decay chain gluino --> squark quark, squark --> neutralino_2
quark, neutralino_2 --> neutralino_1 h/H/A, h/H/A --> b b-bar produced in pp
interactions. In the singlet representation with universal gaugino masses only
the light Higgs boson can be produced in this cascade with the parameter region
of interest for us, while with non-universal gaugino masses heavy neutral MSSM
Higgs boson production may dominate. The allowed parameter space in the light
of the WMAP constraints on the cold dark matter relic density is investigated
in the above scenarios for gaugino mass parameters. We also demonstrate that
combination of representations can give the required amount of dark matter in
any point of the parameter space. In the non-universal case we show that heavy
Higgs bosons can be detected in the studied cascade in parameter regions with
the WMAP preferred neutralino relic density.
