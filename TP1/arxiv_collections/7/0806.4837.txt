A new measurement of the neutron EDM, using Ramsey's method of separated
oscillatory fields, is in preparation at the new high intensity source of
ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) at the Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland
(PSI). The existence of a non-zero nEDM would violate both parity and time
reversal symmetry and, given the CPT theorem, might lead to a discovery of new
CP violating mechanisms. Already the current upper limit for the nEDM
(|d_n|<2.9E-26 e.cm) constrains some extensions of the Standard Model.
  The new experiment aims at a two orders of magnitude reduction of the
experimental uncertainty, to be achieved mainly by (1) the higher UCN flux
provided by the new PSI source, (2) better magnetic field control with improved
magnetometry and (3) a double chamber configuration with opposite electric
field directions.
  The first stage of the experiment will use an upgrade of the RAL/Sussex/ILL
group's apparatus (which has produced the current best result) moved from
Institut Laue-Langevin to PSI. The final accuracy will be achieved in a further
step with a new spectrometer, presently in the design phase.
