The Large Hadron Collider will commence operations in the latter half of
2008. The plans of the LHC experiments ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb are
described. The scenario for progression of luminosity and the strategies of
these 4 experiments to use the initial data are detailed. There are significant
measurements possible with integrated luminosities of 1, 10 and 100 pb^-1.
These measurements will provide essential calibration and tests of the
detectors, understanding of the Standard Model backgrounds and a first
oportunity to look for new physics.
