We study quantum games with correlated noise through a generalized
quantization scheme. We investigate the effects of memory on quantum games,
such as Prisoner's Dilemma, Battle of the Sexes and Chicken, through three
prototype quantum-correlated channels. It is shown that the quantum player
enjoys an advantage over the classical player for all nine cases considered in
this paper for the maximally entangled case. However, the quantum player can
also outperform the classical player for subsequent cases that can be noted in
the case of the Battle of the Sexes game. It can be seen that the Nash
equilibria do not change for all the three games under the effect of memory.
