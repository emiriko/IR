The interaction cutoff contribution to the ruggedness of protein-protein
energy landscape (the artificial ruggedness) is studied in terms of relative
energy fluctuations for 1/r^n potentials based on a simplistic model of a
protein complex. Contradicting the principle of minimal frustration, the
artificial ruggedness exists for short cutoffs and gradually disappears with
the cutoff increase. The critical values of the cutoff were calculated for each
of eleven popular power-type potentials with n=0-9, 12 and for two thresholds
of 5% and 10%. The artificial ruggedness decreases to tolerable thresholds for
cutoffs longer than the critical ones. The results showed that for both
thresholds the critical cutoff is a non-monotonic function of the potential
power n. The functions reach the maximum at n=3-4 and then decrease with the
increase of the potential power. The difference between two cutoffs for 5% and
10% artificial ruggedness becomes negligible for potentials decreasing faster
than 1/r^12. The results suggest that cutoffs longer than critical ones can be
recommended for protein-protein potentials.
