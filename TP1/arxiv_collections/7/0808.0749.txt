A triangulated fixed connectivity surface model is investigated by using the
Monte Carlo simulation technique. In order to have the macroscopic surface
tension \tau, the vertices on the one-dimensional boundaries are fixed as the
edges (=circles) of the tubular surface in the simulations. The size of the
tubular surface is chosen such that the projected area becomes the regular
square of area A. An intrinsic curvature energy with a microscopic bending
rigidity b is included in the Hamiltonian. We found that the model undergoes a
first-order transition of surface fluctuations at finite b, where the surface
tension \tau discontinuously changes. The gap of \tau remains constant at the
transition point in a certain range of values A/N^\prime at sufficiently large
N^\prime, which is the total number of vertices excluding the fixed vertices on
the boundaries. The value of \tau remains almost zero in the wrinkled phase at
the transition point while \tau remains negative finite in the smooth phase in
that range of A/N^\prime.
