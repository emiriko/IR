Gamow-Teller transitions from 24Mg to 24Na were studied via the (t,3He)
reaction at 115 AMeV using a secondary triton beam produced via fast
fragmentation of 150 AMeV 16O ions. Compared to previous (t,3He) experiments at
this energy that employed a primary alpha beam, the secondary beam intensity is
improved by about a factor of five. Despite the large emittance of the
secondary beam, an excitation-energy resolution of ~200 keV is achieved. A good
correspondence is found between the extracted Gamow-Teller strength
distribution and those available from other charge-exchange probes. Theoretical
calculations using the newly developed USDA and USDB sd-shell model
interactions reproduce the data well.
