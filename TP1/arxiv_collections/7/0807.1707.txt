Backward waves and negative refraction are shown to exist in plasmonic
crystals whose lattice cell size is a very small fraction of the vacuum
wavelength (less than 1/40th in an illustrative example). Such
``quasi-homogeneity'' is important, in particular, for high-resolution imaging.
Real and complex Bloch bands are computed using the recently developed
finite-difference calculus of ``Flexible Local Approximation MEthods'' (FLAME)
that produces linear eigenproblems, as opposed to quadratic or nonlinear ones
typical for other techniques. FLAME dramatically improves the accuracy by
incorporating local analytical approximations of the solution into the
numerical scheme.
