In this contribution, we discuss the possibility of meta-stable supersymmetry
(SUSY) breaking vacua in a perturbed Seiberg-Witten theory with
Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term. We found meta-stable SUSY breaking vacua at the
degenerated dyon and monopole singular points in the moduli space at the
nonperturbative level.
