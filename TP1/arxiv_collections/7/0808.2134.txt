Results of Fe K-, As K-, and La L3-edge x-ray absorption near edge structure
(XANES) measurements on LaO1-xFxFeAs compounds are presented. The Fe K- edge
exhibits a chemical shift to lower energy, near edge feature modifications, and
pre-edge feature suppression as a result of F substitution for O. The former
two changes provide evidence of electron charge transfer to the Fe sites and
the latter directly supports the delivery of this charge into the Fe-3d
orbitals. The As K- edge measurements show spectral structures typical of
compounds with planes of transition-metal tetrahedrally coordinated to p-block
elements as is illustrated by comparison to other such materials. The
insensitivity of the As-K edge to doping, along with the strong Fe-K doping
response, is consistent with band structure calculations showing essentially
pure Fe-d character near the Fermi energy in these materials. The energy of the
continuum resonance feature above the La-L3 edge is shown to be quantitatively
consistent with the reported La-O inter-atomic separation and with other oxide
compounds containing rare earth elements.
