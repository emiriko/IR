After a brief review of the theoretical description of nuclei based on
nonrelativistic many-body theory and realistic hamiltonians, these lectures
focus on its application to the analysis of the electroweak response. Special
emphasis is given to electron-nucleus scattering, whose experimental study has
provided a wealth of information on nuclear structure and dynamics, exposing
the limitations of the shell model. The extension of the formalism to the case
of neutrino-nucleus interactions, whose quantitative understanding is required
to reduce the systematic uncertainty of neutrino oscillation experiments, is
also discussed.
