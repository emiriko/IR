In this paper the model for the p-p accretion process in HI reactions is
described. The mediation by X boson (MX ~ 1014 GeV) is outlined. The Heaviside
equation for the thermal processes in HI scattering is obtained and solved. The
possibility of the detection of the collective excitation in HI generated by
RHIC and LHC
