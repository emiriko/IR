Einstein's objection against both the completeness claim of the orthodox
version and the Bohmian interpretation of quantum theory, using the example of
a 'particle in a box', is reiterated and resolved. This is done by proving that
the corresponding quantum mechanical states exactly match classical analogues.
The latter are shown to result from the recently elaborated physics of
diffusion waves.
