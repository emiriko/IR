We construct effective 2- and 3-body Hamiltonians for the p-shell by
performing 12\hbar\Omega ab initio no-core shell model (NCSM) calculations for
A=6 and 7 nuclei and explicitly projecting the many-body Hamiltonians onto the
0\hbar\Omega space. We then separate these effective Hamiltonians into 0-, 1-
and 2-body contributions (also 3-body for A=7) and analyze the systematic
behavior of these different parts as a function of the mass number A and size
of the NCSM basis space. The role of effective 3- and higher-body interactions
for A>6 is investigated and discussed.
