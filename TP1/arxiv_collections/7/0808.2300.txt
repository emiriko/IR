A simple schematic model anchored on the notion of hadronic freedom inferred
from hidden local symmetry in the vector manifestation, the infinite tower of
vector mesons in holographic QCD and "stickiness" of $\pi\pi$ interactions
inferred from dispersion relations is used to describe the dileptons produced
in relativistic heavy ion collisions at PHENIX/RHIC. It is shown that due to
the near "blindness" of dileptons to Brown-Rho scaling, those dileptons with
invariant mass less than $m_\rho=770$ MeV come mostly from pion-composites that
we interpret as "transient $\rho$'s."
