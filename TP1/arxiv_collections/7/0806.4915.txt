We study nonlinear stability of spatially homogeneous oscillations in
reaction-diffusion systems. Assuming absence of unstable linear modes and
linear diffusive behavior for the neutral phase, we prove that spatially
localized perturbations decay algebraically with the diffusive rate t^{-n/2} in
space dimension n. We also compute the leading order term in the asymptotic
expansion of the solution, and show that it corresponds to a spatially
localized modulation of the phase. Our approach is based on a normal form
transformation in the kinetics ODE which partially decouples the phase
equation, at the expense of making the whole system quasilinear. Stability is
then obtained by a global fixed point argument in temporally weighted Sobolev
spaces.
