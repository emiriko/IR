In this work we use an inelastic scattering process of particles to propose a
model able to reproduce the salient features of the wealth distribution in an
economy by including taxes to each trading process and redistributing that
collected among the population according to a given criterion. Additionally, we
show that different optimal levels of taxes may exist depending on the
redistribution criterion.
