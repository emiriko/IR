Based on a spatiotemporal analysis of POLAR UVI images, we show that the
auroral emission events that initiate equatorward of the isotropic boundary
(IB) obtained from a time-dependent empirical model, have systematically
steeper power-law slopes of energy, power, area and lifetime probability
distributions compared to the events that initiate poleward of the IB. The
low-latitude group of events contains a distinct subpopulation of
substorm-scale disturbances violating the power-law behavior, while the high
latitude group is described by nearly perfect power-law statistics over the
entire range of scales studied. The results obtained indicate that the inner
and outer portions of the plasma sheet are characterized by substantially
different scaling regimes of bursty energy dissipation suggestive of different
physics in these regions.
