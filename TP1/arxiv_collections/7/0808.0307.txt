We present a physical- and link-level design for the creation of entangled
pairs to be used in quantum repeater applications where one can control the
noise level of the initially distributed pairs. The system can tune
dynamically, trading initial fidelity for success probability, from high
fidelity pairs (F=0.98 or above) to moderate fidelity pairs. The same physical
resources that create the long-distance entanglement are used to implement the
local gates required for entanglement purification and swapping, creating a
homogeneous repeater architecture. Optimizing the noise properties of the
initially distributed pairs significantly improves the rate of generating
long-distance Bell pairs. Finally, we discuss the performance trade-off between
spatial and temporal resources.
