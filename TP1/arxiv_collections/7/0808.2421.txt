We investigate theoretically vortex-antivortex (v-av) matter moving in thin
superconducting films with a regular array of in-plane magnetic dipoles. Our
model considers v-av pair creation induced by the local current density
generated by the magnetic texture and the transport current and simulates the
dynamics of vortices and antivortices by numerical integration of the Langevin
equation of motion. Calculations of the transport properties at zero applied
field show a strong dependence of the v-av dynamics on the current intensity
and direction. The dynamics of the v-av matter is characterized by a series of
creation and annihilation processes, which reflect on the time dependence of
the electrical field, and by guided motion, resulting in a zero-field
transverse resistance.
