We study the statistics of the work done on a quantum critical system by
quenching a control parameter in the Hamiltonian. We elucidate the relation
between the probability distribution of the work and the Loschmidt echo, a
quantity emerging usually in the context of dephasing. Using this connection we
characterize the statistics of the work done on a quantum Ising chain by
quenching locally or globally the transverse field. We show that for local
quenches starting at criticality the probability distribution of the work
displays an interesting edge singularity.
