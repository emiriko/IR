We consider the effective theories governing the sensitivity to the plasma of
certain high-energy observables in supersymmetric plasmas, and point out that
they preserve supersymmetry. Our findings generalize previous observations on
symptotic thermal masses in weakly coupled plasmas, to both the real and
imaginary parts of self-energies, on the light cone and away from it, in weakly
and strongly interacting theories. All observed supersymmetry violations due to
thermal effects vanish faster than $E^{-2}$ in the high energy limit.
