Here we investigate the accuracy of the overlap criterion when applied to a
simple near-integrable model in both its 2D and 3D version. To this end, we
consider respectively, two and three quartic oscillators as the unperturbed
system, and couple the degrees of freedom by a cubic, non-integrable
perturbation. For both systems we compute the unperturbed resonances up to
order O(\epsilon^2), and model each resonance by means of the pendulum
approximation in order to estimate the theoretical critical value of the
perturbation parameter for a global transition to chaos. We perform several
surface of sections for the bidimensional case to derive an empirical value to
be compared to our theoretical estimation, being both in good agreement. Also
for the 3D case a numerical estimate is attained that we observe matches the
critical value resulting from theoretical means. This confirms once again that
reckoning resonances up to O(\epsilon^2) suffices in order the overlap
criterion to work out.
