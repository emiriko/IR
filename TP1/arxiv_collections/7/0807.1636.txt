We report on a theoretical analysis of the suitability of the 7s 2S1/2 <-> 6d
2D3/2 transition in singly ionized radium to measure parity nonconservation, in
the light of an experiment planned at the KVI of the University of Groningen.
Relativistic coupled-cluster theory has been employed to perform an ab initio
calculation of the parity nonconserving electric dipole amplitude of this
transition, including single, double, and leading triple excitations. We
discuss the prospects for a sub-1% precision test of the electroweak theory of
particle physics.
