We have carried out a systematic study of the PbO-type compound
FeSe_{1-x}Te_x (x = 0~1), where Te substitution effect on superconductivity is
investigated. It is found that superconducting transition temperature reaches a
maximum of Tc=15.2K at about 50% Te substitution. The pressure-enhanced Tc of
FeSe0.5Te0.5 is more than 10 times larger than that of FeSe. Interestingly,
FeTe is no longer superconducting. A low temperature structural distortion
changes FeTe from triclinic symmetry to orthorhombic symmetry. We believe that
this structural change breaks the magnetic symmetry and suppresses
superconductivity in FeTe.
