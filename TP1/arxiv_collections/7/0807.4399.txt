Quantum cosmology describes universe as a relativistic object with an
evolution defined by an equation for the energy density corresponding to the
least action principle: (Taganov, 2008). In quantum cosmology this equation
plays the same role as the Planck equation does in quantum physics. Universe
evolution consists of not only the space expansion but also a deceleration of
the course of physical time. Durations of all processes, measured by
decelerating physical time, are always longer, than corresponding durations,
measured by a scale of the invariable uniform Newtonian time. Quantum
interpretation of the redshift phenomenon enables to estimate the Hubble
parameter by means of fundamental physical constants. In the course of
evolution, the universe retains the self-similarity defined by the constancy of
the characteristic scale relations for micro- and mega worlds with an average
fractal dimension of the typical cosmic large-scale structures D=2. Quantum
cosmology advances new relations for the microwave background parameters,
apparent stellar magnitudes and redshifts; formulae for the cosmological
increase of the macroscopic space- and time- characteristics and evaluation of
quasar redshifts and luminosities.
