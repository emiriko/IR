The techniques of laser cooling combined with atom interferometry make
possible the realization of very sensitive and accurate inertial sensors like
gyroscopes or accelerometers. Besides earth-based developments, the use of
these techniques in space should provide extremely high sensitivity for
research in fundamental physics, Earth's observation and exploration of the
solar system.
