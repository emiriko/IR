Entropic dynamics, a program that aims at deriving the laws of physics from
standard probabilistic and entropic rules for processing information, is
developed further. We calculate the probability for an arbitrary path followed
by a system as it moves from given initial to final states. For an
appropriately chosen configuration space the path of maximum probability
reproduces Newtonian dynamics.
