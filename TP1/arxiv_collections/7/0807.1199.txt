In this paper the local differential calculus over Fedosov algebra is
constructed using the trivialization isomorphism. The explicit formulas for
deformed derivations are given. The resulting calculus can be used as a
"building block" for a theory of Seiberg-Witten map with Fedosov type of
noncommutativity.
