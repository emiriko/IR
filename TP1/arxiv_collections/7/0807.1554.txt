Epitaxial graphene films have been formed on the C-face of semi-insulating
4H-SiC substrates by a high temperature sublimation process. Nano-scale square
antidot arrays have been fabricated on these graphene films. At low
temperatures, magneto-conductance in these films exhibits pronounced
Aharonov-Bohm oscillations with the period corresponding to magnetic flux
quanta added to the area of a single antidot. At low fields, weak localization
is observed and its visibility is enhanced by intravalley scattering on antidot
edges. At high fields, we observe two distinctive minima in magnetoconductance
which can be attributed to commensurability oscillations between classical
cyclotron orbits and antidot array. All mesoscopic features, surviving up to 70
K, reveal the unique electronic properties of graphene.
