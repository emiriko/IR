We address surface soliton complexes formed at the edge of annular guiding
structures containing several concentric rings. Such soliton complexes feature
a -phase difference between neighboring spots. It is shown that the
multipole-mode solitons can rotate steadily upon propagation, and the existence
domain is strongly affected by the rotation frequency. The rotation may enhance
the stabilization of surface multipole-mode solitons.
