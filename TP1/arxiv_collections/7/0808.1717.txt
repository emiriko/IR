We consider coherent and cohesive sheaves of $\cO$--modules over open sets
$\Omega\subset\bC^n$. We prove that coherent sheaves, and certain other sheaves
derived from them, are cohesive; and conversely, certain sheaves derived from
cohesive sheaves are coherent. An important tool in all this, also proved here,
is that the sheaf of Banach space valued holomorphic germs is flat.
