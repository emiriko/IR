The magnetic and transport behaviors of cerium substituted iron oxy-arsenide
superconductor with x = 0.1 to 0.4 fluoride (F) doping have been investigated
in this report. Temperature dependent susceptibility and resistivity
measurements showed the 0.1 F-doped sample (CeFeAsO0.9F0.1) has a
superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of around 30 K. With increasing
doping beyond x = 0.2 Tc saturates to around 40 K. Temperature dependent
susceptibility measured in different magnetic fields for the under-doped sample
showed Meissner effect in low field and the diamagnetism is still visible up to
1 Tesla, with an obvious magnetic transition below 5 K, perhaps originating
from magnetic ordering of the rare earth cerium. The corresponding field
dependent resistance versus temperature measurements indicated a broadening of
less than 3 K for Tc at mid-point by increasing the field to 5 Tesla indicating
rather low anisotropy. An estimated upper critical field of more than 48 Tesla
and accordingly an estimated maximum coherence length of 2.6 nm were obtained
confirming the high upper critical field with a short coherence length for this
superconductor.
