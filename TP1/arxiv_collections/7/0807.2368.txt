During the past decade, the experimental development of being able to create
ever larger and heavier quantum superpositions has brought the discussion of
the connection between microscopic quantum mechanics and macroscopic classical
physics back to the forefront of physical research. Under equilibrium
conditions this connection is in fact well understood in terms of the mechanism
of spontaneous symmetry breaking, while the emergence of classical dynamics can
be described within an ensemble averaged description in terms of decoherence.
The remaining realm of individual-state quantum dynamics in the thermodynamic
limit was addressed in a recent paper proposing that the unitarity of quantum
mechanical time evolution in macroscopic objects may be susceptible to a
spontaneous breakdown. Here we will discuss the implications of this theory of
spontaneous unitarity breaking for the modern experiments involving truly
macroscopic Schrodinger cat states.
