We study the frictional drag in high mobility, strongly interacting GaAs
bilayer hole systems in the vicinity of the filling factor $\nu=1$ quantum Hall
state (QHS), at the same fillings where the bilayer resistivity displays a
reentrant insulating phase. Our measurements reveal a very large longitudinal
drag resistivity ($\rho^{D}_{xx}$) in this regime, exceeding 15 k$\Omega/\Box$
at filling factor $\nu=1.15$. $\rho^{D}_{xx}$ shows a weak temperature
dependence and appears to saturate at a finite, large value at the lowest
temperatures. Our observations are consistent with theoretical models positing
a phase separation, e.g. puddles of $\nu=1$ QHS embedded in a different state,
when the system makes a transition from the coherent $\nu=1$ QHS to the weakly
coupled $\nu=2$ QHS.
