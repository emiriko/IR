A new principle of subwavelength imaging based on frequency scanning is
considered. It is shown that it is possible to reconstruct the spatial profile
of an external field exciting an array (or coupled arrays) of
subwavelength-sized resonant particles with a frequency scan over the whole
band of resonating array modes. During the scan it is enough to measure and
store the values of the near field at one or at most two points. After the scan
the distribution of the near field can be reconstructed with simple
post-processing. The proposed near-field microscope has no moving parts.
