Dynamical Coherent-Potential Approximation (CPA) to correlated electrons has
been extended to a system with realistic Hamiltonian which consists of the
first-principles tight-binding Linear Muffintin Orbital (LMTO) bands and
intraatomic Coulomb interactions. Thermodynamic potential and self-consistent
equations for Green function are obtained on the basis of the functional
integral method and the harmonic approximation which neglects the mode-mode
couplings between the dynamical potentials with different frequency. Numerical
calculations have been performed for Fe and Ni within the 2nd-order dynamical
corrections to the static approximation. The band narrowing of the
quasiparticle states and the 6 eV satellite are obtained for Ni at finite
temperatures. The theory leads to the Curie-Weiss law for both Fe and Ni.
Calculated effective Bohr magneton numbers are 3.0 $\mu_{\rm B}$ for Fe and 1.2
$\mu_{\rm B}$ for Ni, explaining the experimental data. But calculated Curie
temperatures are 2020 K for Fe and 1260 K for Ni, being still overestimated by
a factor of two as compared with the experimental ones. Dynamical effects on
electronic and magnetic properties are discussed by comparing with those in the
static approximations.
