The rapid development of experimental techniques to produce ultracold alkali
molecules opens the ways to manipulate them and to control their dynamics using
external electric fields. A prerequisite quantity for such studies is the
knowledge of their static dipole polarizabilities. In this paper, we computed
the variations with internuclear distance and with vibrational index of the
static dipole polarizability components of all homonuclear alkali dimers
including Fr$_2$, and of all heteronuclear alkali dimers involving Li to Cs, in
their electronic ground state and in their lowest triplet state. We use the
same quantum chemistry approach than in our work on dipole moments (M. Aymar
and O. Dulieu, J. Chem. Phys. 122, 204302 (2005)), based on pseudopotentials
for atomic core representation, Gaussian basis sets, and effective potentials
for core polarization. Polarizabilities are extracted from electronic energies
using the finite-field method. For the heaviest species Rb$_2$, Cs$_2$ and
Fr$_2$ and for all heteronuclear alkali dimers, such results are presented for
the first time. The accuracy of our results on atomic and molecular static
dipole polarizabilities is discussed by comparing our values with the few
available experimental data and elaborate calculations. We found that for all
alkali pairs, the parallel and perpendicular components of the ground state
polarizabilities at the equilibrium distance $R_e$ scale as $(R_e)^3$, which
can be related to a simple electrostatic model of an ellipsoidal charge
distribution. Prospects for possible alignment and orientation effects with
these molecules in forthcoming experiments are discussed.
