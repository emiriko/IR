We demonstrate electronic cooling of a suspended AuPd island using
superconductor-insulator-normal metal tunnel junctions. This was achieved by
developing a simple fabrication method for reliably releasing narrow submicron
sized metal beams. The process is based on reactive ion etching and uses a
conducting substrate to avoid charge-up damage and is compatible with e.g.
conventional e-beam lithography, shadow-angle metal deposition and oxide tunnel
junctions. The devices function well and exhibit clear cooling; up to factor of
two at sub-kelvin temperatures.
