We report on infrared spectroscopy of bilayer graphene integrated in gated
structures. We observed a significant asymmetry in the optical conductivity
upon electrostatic doping of electrons and holes. We show that this finding
arises from a marked asymmetry between the valence and conduction bands, which
is mainly due to the inequivalence of the two sublattices within the graphene
layer. From the conductivity data, the energy difference of the two sublattices
is determined.
