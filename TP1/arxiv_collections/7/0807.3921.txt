We study the generic NMSSM with the coupling \lambda S H_1 H_2 at the limit
of perturbativity, \lambda~0.7-0.8, and a moderate stop mass, m_{\tilde{t}} <
300 GeV. Respecting the LEP2 bounds and insisting on naturalness, we delimit
the allowed region of parameter space and we study the spectrum and
phenomenology of the relatively light new particles.
