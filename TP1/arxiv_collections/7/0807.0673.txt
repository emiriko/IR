Perturbation experiments are carried out by contact process and its
mean-field version. Here, the mortality rate is increased or decreased
suddenly. It is known that the fluctuation enhancement (FE) occurs after the
perturbation, where FE means a population uncertainty. In the present paper, we
develop a new theory of stochastic differential equation. The agreement between
the theory and the mean-field simulation is almost perfect. This theory enables
us to find much stronger FE than reported previously. We discuss the population
uncertainty in the recovering process of endangered species.
