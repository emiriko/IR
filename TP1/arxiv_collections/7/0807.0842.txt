It was observed that the spatiotemporal chaos in lattices of coupled chaotic
maps was suppressed to a spatiotemporal fixed point when some fraction of the
regular coupling connections were replaced by random links. Here we investigate
the effects of different kinds of parametric fluctuations on the robustness of
this spatiotemporal fixed point regime. In particular we study the
spatiotemporal dynamics of the network with noisy interaction parameters,
namely fluctuating fraction of random links and fluctuating coupling strengths.
We consider three types of fluctuations: (i) noisy in time, but homogeneous in
space; (ii) noisy in space, but fixed in time; (iii) noisy in both space and
time. We find that the effect of different kinds of parameteric noise on the
dy- namics is quite distinct: quenched spatial fluctuations are the most
detrimental to spatiotemporal regularity; spatiotemporal fluctuations yield
phenomena similar to that observed when parameters are held constant at the
mean-value; and interestingly, spatiotemporal regularity is most robust under
spatially uniform temporal fluctuations, which in fact yields a larger fixed
point range than that obtained under constant mean-value parameters.
