Measurements of meson mixing and CP violation parameters obtained by the CDF
and D0 experiments at the Fermilab Tevatron are presented. These include
results on $B_s$ and $D$ meson mixing, and searches for CP violation in the
decay $B^+ \to J/\psi K^+$, in mixing through semileptonic $B_s$ meson decays,
and in the interference between mixing and decay in the process $B_s \to J/\psi
\phi$.
