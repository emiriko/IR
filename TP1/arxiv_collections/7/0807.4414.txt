Hardy's non-locality theorem for multiple two-level systems is explored in
the context of generalized nonlocal theory. We find nonlocal but non-signaling
probabilities, providing Hardy's nonlocal argument, which are higher than those
in Quantum Mechanics. Maximum probability of success of Hardy's argument is
obtained for three two-level systems in quantum as well as in a more
generalized theory. Interestingly, the maximum in the nonlocal generalized
theory for both the cases turns out to be same.
