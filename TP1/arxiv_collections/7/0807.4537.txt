Using the recent empirical information on the deuteron electromagnetic form
factors we map out the transverse charge density in the deuteron as viewed from
a light front moving towards the deuteron. The charge densities for a
transversely polarized deuteron are characterized by monopole, dipole and
quadrupole patterns.
