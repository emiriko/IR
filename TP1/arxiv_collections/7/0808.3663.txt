The HERA ep collider and the experiments H1 and ZEUS operated from 1994-2007.
A total integrated luminosity of almost 1 fb^-1 was collected at centre-of-mass
energies up to 320 GeV. Results from searches for leptoquarks and squarks,
final states with an isolated lepton and missing transverse momentum and final
states with multi-leptons are presented. The leptoquark limits are interpreted
in terms of limits on squark production in SUSY models with R-parity violating
couplings.
