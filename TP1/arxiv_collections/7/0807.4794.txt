We investigate the relation between the canonical model of quantum optics,
the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian and Dirac fermions in quantizing magnetic
field. We demonstrate that Rabi oscillations are observable in the optical
response of graphene, providing us with a transparent picture about the
structure of optical transitions. While the longitudinal conductivity reveals
chaotic Rabi oscillations, the Hall component measures coherent ones. This
opens up the possibility of investigating a microscopic model of a few quantum
objects in a macroscopic experiment with tunable parameters.
