We report experiments that demonstrate the quantization of the conductance of
photonic crystal waveguides. To obtain a diffusive wave, we have added all the
transmitted channels for all the incident angles. The conductance steps have
equal height and a width of one half the wavelength used. Detailed numerical
results agree very well with the novel experimental results.
