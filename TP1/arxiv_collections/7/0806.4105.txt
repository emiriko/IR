Discrete quantum phase space formalism is used to discuss some basic aspects
of the spin tunneling occurring in Fe8 magnetic cluster by means of Wigner
functions as well as Husimi distributions. Those functions were obtained for
sharp angle states and symmetric combinations of the lowest energy doublet with
the application of an external magnetic field. The time evolution of those
functions carried out numerically allows one to extract valuable information
about the dynamics of the states under consideration, in particular, the
coherent oscillations associated with the spin tunneling. It is also shown that
an entropy functional constructed out of the discrete Husimi distribution
function allows to characterize the spin tunneling.
