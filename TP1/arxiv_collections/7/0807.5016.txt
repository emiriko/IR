We write down M2-branes on the resolved $C_4/Z_4$ orbifold space. The
resolved spatial geometry is such that it interpolates between $R^2\times CP_3$
near the branes and $C_4/Z_4$ asymptotically. The near horizon geometry of
these branes is a deformation of $AdS_4\times S^7/Z_4$. An interesting aspect
is that for $k=4$ Chern-Simons theory coupling becomes vanishing near the IR
cutoff leading to spontaneous compactification to type IIA.
