We observe an obvious anomalous line-shape of the $e^+e^- \to {\rm hadrons}$
total cross sections in the energy region between 3.700 and 3.872 GeV from the
data samples taken with the BES-II detector at the BEPC Collider. Re-analysis
of the data shows that it is inconsistent with the explanation for only one
simple $\psi(3770)$ resonance with a statistical significance of $7\sigma$. The
anomalous line-shape may be explained by two possible enhancements of the
inclusive hadron production near the center-of-mass energies of 3.764 GeV and
3.779 GeV, indicating that either there is likely a new structure in addition
to the $\psi(3770)$ resonance around 3.773 GeV, or there are some physics
effects reflecting the $D\bar D$ production dynamics.
