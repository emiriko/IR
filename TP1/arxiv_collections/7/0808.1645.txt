Within the resonance chiral theory, we have studied the process of a tau
lepton decaying into a vector resonance plus a pseudo-Goldstone meson and a tau
neutrino. Two kinds of processes are discussed: (a) tau- --> (rho pi-,omega
pi-, phi pi-, K*0 K-) nu(tau), belonging to Delta S=0 processes and (b) Delta S
= 1 processes, such as tau- --> (rho K-, omega K-,phi K-,\bar{K*0} pi-)
nu(tau). To fit the tau- --> omega pi- nu(tau) spectral function and the decay
distribution of tau- --> omega K- nu(tau) to get unknown resonance couplings,
we then make a prediction for branching ratios of all channels.
