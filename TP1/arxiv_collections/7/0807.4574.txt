The entropy bound conjecture concerning black hole dynamical horizons is
proved. The conjecture states, if a dynamical horizon, $D_H$, is bounded by two
surfaces with areas of $A_B$ and $\abp$ ($\abp>A_B$), then the entropy, $S_D$,
that crosses $D_H$ must satisfy $S_D\leq {1/4}(\abp-A_B)$. We show that this
conjecture is implied by the generalized Bousso bound. Consequently, the
generalized second law holds for dynamical horizons. Finally, we show that the
lightlike bousso bound and its spacelike counterpart can be unified as one
bound.
