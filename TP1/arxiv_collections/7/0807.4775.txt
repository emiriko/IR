We report our study of the evolution of superconductivity and the phase
diagram of the ternary Fe(Se1-xTex)0.82 (0<=x<=1.0) system. We discovered a new
superconducting phase with Tc,max = 14 K in the 0.3 < x < 1.0 range. This
superconducting phase is suppressed when the sample composition approaches the
end member FeTe0.82, which exhibits an incommensurate antiferromagnetic order.
We discuss the relationship between the superconductivity and magnetism of this
material system in terms of recent results from neutron scattering
measurements. Our results and analyses suggest that superconductivity in this
new class of Fe-based compounds is associated with magnetic fluctuations, and
therefore may be unconventional in nature.
