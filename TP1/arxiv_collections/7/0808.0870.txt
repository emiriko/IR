Unlike the case of surfaces of topologically finite type, there are several
different Teichm\"uller spaces that are associated to a surface of topological
infinite type. These Teichm\"uller spaces first depend (set-theoretically) on
whether we work in the hyperbolic category or in the conformal category. They
also depend, given the choice of a point of view (hyperbolic or conformal), on
the choice of a distance function on Teichm\"uller space. Examples of distance
functions that appear naturally in the hyperbolic setting are the length
spectrum distance and the bi-Lipschitz distance, and there are other useful
distance functions. The Teichm\"uller spaces also depend on the choice of a
basepoint. The aim of this paper is to present some examples, results and
questions on the Teichm\"uller theory of surfaces of infinite topological type
that do not appear in the setting the Teichm\"uller theory of surfaces of
finite type. In particular, we point out relations and differences between the
various Teichm\"uller spaces associated to a given surface of topological
infinite type.
