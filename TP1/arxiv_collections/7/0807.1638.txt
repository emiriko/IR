A universal and self-consistent set of equations is developed utilizing the
principle empirical parameters of Superconductivity which are the coherent
condensation temperature, the Debye temperature, the coherent condensation
energy gap at critical temperature equals zero degrees Kelvin and the electron
phonon coupling constant. Empirical data from both crystalline elements and
amorphous compounds is shown to produce the same self consistent relationships
which are critical temperature equals Debye energy/2 exp(-2/electron phonon
coupling constant), coherent condensation temperature equals the Debye energy
exp (-2/electron phonon coupling constant) and the ratio of coherent
condensation temperature/critical temperature equals 2.0 i.e. coherent
condensation temperature equals coherent energy gap and is found to be constant
for all superconductors. We also find that electron phonon coupling constant is
related exponentially related to the zero point energy where the zero point
energy equals the Debye energy/2 and is the zero point energy of a quantum
mechanical oscillator. These relationships are derived exclusively from
electron phonon mediated superconductor data and are also shown to encompass
cuprate superconductors with ease. [Abridged]
