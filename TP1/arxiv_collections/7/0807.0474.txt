This paper considers two-dimensional stratified water waves propagating under
the force of gravity over an impermeable flat bed and with a free surface. We
prove the existence of a global continuum of classical solutions that are
periodic and traveling. These waves, moreover, can exhibit large density
variation, speed and amplitude.
