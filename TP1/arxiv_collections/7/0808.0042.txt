We present two efficient quantum key distribution schemes over two different
collective-noise channels. The accepted hypothesis of collective noise is that
photons travel inside a time window small compared to the variation of noise.
Noiseless subspaces are made up of two Bell states and the spatial degree of
freedom is introduced to form two nonorthogonal bases. Although these protocols
resort to entangled states for encoding the key bit, the receiver is only
required to perform single-particle product measurements and there is no basis
mismatch. Moreover, the detection is passive as the receiver does not switch
his measurements between two conjugate measurement bases to get the key.
