Quantum state propagation over binary tree configurations is studied in the
context of quantum spin networks. For binary tree of order two a simple
protocol is presented which allows to achieve arbitrary high transfer fidelity.
It does not require fine tuning of local fields and two-nodes coupling of the
intermediate spins. Instead it assumes simple local operations on the intended
receiving node: their role is to brake the transverse symmetry of the network
that induces an effective refocusing of the propagating signals. Some ideas on
how to scale up these effect to binary tree of arbitrary order are discussed.
