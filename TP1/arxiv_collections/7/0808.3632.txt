Froggatt, Nielsen et al suggested that the Higgs boson exchange between top
quarks produces enough attraction to generate their multiple bound states.
Furthermore they claimed that the system of 6 top and 6 anti-top quarks is
bound so strongly that the binding energy nearly compensates the masses of
t-quarks, making it very light. We calculated the energy of such states more
accurately, variationally and by self-consistent mean field approximation, and
found that these state are weakly bound for massless Higgs boson and unbound
with the account for its mass.
