We study 12 parameter families of two qubit density matrices, arising from a
special class of two-fermion systems with four single particle states or
alternatively from a four-qubit state with amplitudes arranged in an
antisymmetric matrix. We calculate the Wooters concurrences and the
negativities in a closed form and study their behavior. We use these results to
show that the relevant entanglement measures satisfy the generalized
Coffman-Kundu-Wootters formula of distributed entanglement. An explicit formula
for the residual tangle is also given. The geometry of such density matrices is
elaborated in some detail. In particular an explicit form for the Bures metric
is given.
