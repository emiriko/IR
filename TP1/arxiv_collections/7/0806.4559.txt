Starting from a minimal physical model of self propelled hard rods on a
substrate in two dimensions, we derive a modified Smoluchowski equation for the
system. Self -propulsion enhances longitudinal diffusion and modifies the mean
field excluded volume interaction. From the Smoluchowski equation we obtain
hydrodynamic equations for rod concentration, polarization and nematic order
parameter. New results at large scales are a lowering of the density of the
isotropic-nematic transition and a strong enhancement of boundary effects in
confined self-propelled systems.
