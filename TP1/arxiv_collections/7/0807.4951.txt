We calculate the upper critical field, Hc2(T), due to the orbital pair
breaking in disordered superconductors without inversion symmetry. Differences
from the usual centrosymmetric case are highlighted. The linearized gap
equations in magnetic field, with the singlet and triplet pairing channels
mixed by impurity scattering, are solved exactly for a cubic crystal.
