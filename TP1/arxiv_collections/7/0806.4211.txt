We present an analysis of squeezed single photon states as a resource for
teleportation of coherent state qubits and propose proof-of-principle
experiments for the demonstration of coherent state teleportation and
entanglement swapping. We include an analysis of the squeezed vacuum as a
simpler approximation to small-amplitude cat states. We also investigate the
effects of imperfect sources and inefficient detection on the proposed
experiments.
