We describe a set-up for studying adsorption of helium in silica aerogels,
where the adsorbed amount is easily and precisely controlled by varying the
temperature of a gas reservoir between 80 K and 180 K. We present validation
experiments and a first application to aerogels. This device is well adapted to
study hysteresis, relaxation, and metastable states in the adsorption and
desorption of fluids in porous media.
