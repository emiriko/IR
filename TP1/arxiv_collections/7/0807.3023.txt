The results of high precision weak neutral current (WNC), Z-pole, and high
energy collider electroweak experiments have been the primary prediction and
test of electroweak unification. The electroweak program is briefly reviewed
from a historical perspective. The current status and the implications for the
standard model and beyond are discussed.
