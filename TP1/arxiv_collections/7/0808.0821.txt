The localized acoustic modes of single isolated polymethyl methacrylate
(PMMA) and polystyrene nanospheres have been studied by micro-Brillouin light
scattering. The measured mode frequencies are analyzed on the basis of the Lamb
theory formulated for a sphere under free boundary conditions. By measuring
light scattering from single isolated particles, placed atop a piece of
polished silicon wafer, the free-surface conditions are almost experimentally
realized. The observed spectral peaks are attributed to localized
eigenvibrations whose frequencies scale as inverse sphere diameter, in
accordance with Lamb's theory. The Young's moduli and Poisson ratios of the
polymer spheres studied have been evaluated from fits to the experimental data.
We have demonstrated that micro-Brillouin spectroscopy is a powerful technique
for probing the acoustic dynamics and mechanical properties of nanostructures.
