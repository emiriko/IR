As a step toward performing a complete coupled-channels analysis of the world
data of pi N, gamma^* N --> pi N, eta N, pi pi N reactions, the pi N --> pi pi
N reactions are investigated starting with the dynamical coupled-channels model
developed in Phys. Rev. C76, 065201 (2007). The channels included are pi N, eta
N, and pi pi N which has pi Delta, rho N, and sigma N resonant components. The
non-resonant amplitudes are generated from solving a set of coupled-channels
equations with the meson-baryon potentials defined by effective Lagrangians.
The resonant amplitudes are generated from 16 bare excited nucleon (N^*) states
which are dressed by the non-resonant interactions as constrained by the
unitarity condition. The data of total cross sections and pi N and pi pi
invariant mass distributions of pi^+ p --> pi^+ pi^+ n, pi^+ pi^0p and pi^- p
--> pi^+ pi^- n, pi^- pi^0 n, pi^0 pi^0 n reactions from threshold to the
invariant mass W = 2 GeV can be described to a very large extent. We show the
importance of the coupled-channels effects and the strong interference between
the contributions from the pi Delta, sigma N, and rho N channels. The large
interference between the resonant and non-resonant amplitudes is also
demonstrated. Possible future developements are discussed.
