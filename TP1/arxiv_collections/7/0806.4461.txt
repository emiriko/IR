To test the validity of replacing a composite fermion by an elementary
fermion, we here calculate the transition rate from a state made of one free
electron and one trion to a similar electron-trion pair, through the time
evolution of such a pair induced by Coulomb interaction between elementary
fermions. To do it in a convenient way, we describe the trion as one electron
interacting with one exciton, and we use the tools we have developed in the new
composite-exciton many-body theory. The trion-electron scattering contains a
direct channel in which ``in'' and ``out'' trions are made with the same
fermions, and an exchange channel in which the ``in'' free electron becomes one
of the ``out'' trion components. As expected, momenta are conserved in these
two channels. The direct scattering is found to read as the bare Coulomb
potential between elementary particles multiplied by a form factor which
depends on the ``in'' and ``out'' trion relative motion indices $\eta$ and
$\eta'$, this factor reducing to $\delta_{\eta\eta'}$ in the zero momentum
transfer limit: In this direct channel, the trion at large distance reacts as
an elementary particle, its composite nature showing up for large momentum
transfer. On the contrary, the fact that the trion is not elementary does
affect the exchange channel for all momentum transfers. We thus conclude that a
3-component fermion behaves as an elementary fermion for direct processes in
the small momentum transfer limit only.
