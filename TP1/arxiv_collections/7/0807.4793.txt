Single particle tracking of mRNA molecules and lipid granules in living cells
shows that the time averaged mean squared displacement $\overline{\delta^2}$ of
individual particles remains a random variable while indicating that the
particle motion is subdiffusive. We investigate this type of ergodicity
breaking within the continuous time random walk model and show that
$\overline{\delta^2}$ differs from the corresponding ensemble average. In
particular we derive the distribution for the fluctuations of the random
variable $\overline{\delta^2}$. Similarly we quantify the response to a
constant external field, revealing a generalization of the Einstein relation.
Consequences for the interpretation of single molecule tracking data are
discussed.
