We motivate and analyze the weak-field limit of a non-analytical Lagrangian
for the gravitational field. After investigating the parameter space of the
model, we impose constraints on the parameters characterizing this class of
theories imposed by Solar-System data, i.e. we establish the validity range
where this solution applies and refine the constraints by the comparison with
planetary orbits. As a result, we claim that this class of models is viable
within different astrophysical scales.
