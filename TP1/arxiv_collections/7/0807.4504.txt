We investigate the effect of interspecies interaction on a degenerate mixture
of bosonic 87Rb and fermionic 40K atoms in a three-dimensional optical lattice
potential. Using a Feshbach resonance, the 87Rb-40K interaction is tuned over a
wide range. Through an analysis of the 87Rb momentum distribution, we find a
pronounced asymmetry between strong repulsion and strong attraction. In the
latter case, the Bose-Hubbard parameters are renormalized due to self-trapping,
leading to a marked shift in the superfluid to Mott insulator transition with
increasing Bose-Fermi interaction.
