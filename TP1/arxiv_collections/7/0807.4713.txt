In a simplified renormalizable model where the neutrinos have PMNS
(Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata) mixings tan$^{2} \theta_{12} = {1/2},
\theta_{13}=0, \theta_{23} = \pi/4$ and with flavor symmetry $T^{'}$ there is a
corresponding prediction where the quarks have CKM (Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa)
mixings tan$2 \Theta_{12} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}, \Theta_{13}=0, \Theta_{23} =0$.
