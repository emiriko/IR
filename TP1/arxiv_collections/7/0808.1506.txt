We study the role played by the magnetic dipole interaction in an atomic
interferometer based on an alkali Bose-Einstein condensate with tunable
scattering length. We tune the s-wave interaction to zero using a magnetic
Feshbach resonance and measure the decoherence of the interferometer induced by
the weak residual interaction between the magnetic dipoles of the atoms. We
prove that with a proper choice of the scattering length it is possible to
compensate for the dipolar interaction and extend the coherence time of the
interferometer. We put in evidence the anisotropic character of the dipolar
interaction by working with two different experimental configurations for which
the minima of decoherence are achieved for a positive and a negative value of
the scattering length, respectively. Our results are supported by a theoretical
model we develop. This model indicates that the magnetic dipole interaction
should not represent a serious source of decoherence in atom interferometers
based on Bose-Einstein condensates.
