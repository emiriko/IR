We analyze the electromagnetic and strong decay properties of the light
scalars a0(980) and f0(980) within a hadronic molecule interpretation. Both
scalars are discussed within a covariant and gauge invariant model which also
allows for finite size effects due to their spatially extended structure in the
K Kbar-bound state picture. Allowing for f0-a0 mixing we also study its
influence on the radiative decays f0/a0 to gamma gamma, f0/a0 to gamma omega,
and f0/a0 to gamma rho as well as the phi production of the f0 and a0.
Furthermore, we apply our formalism to describe the strong f0 to pi pi and a0
to pi eta decay properties.
