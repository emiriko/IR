This document is on Geant4 visualization tools (drivers), evaluating pros and
cons of each option, including recommendations on which tools to support at
Fermilab for different applications{\cite{Daniel}}.
  Four visualization drivers are evaluated. They are OpenGL, HepRep, DAWN and
VRML. They all have good features, OpenGL provides graphic output with out an
intermediate file! HepRep provides menus to assist the user. DAWN provides high
quality plots and even for large files produces output quickly. VRML uses the
smallest disk space for intermediate files.
  Large experiments at Fermilab will want to write their own display. They
should proceed to make this display graphics independent. Medium experiment
will probably want to use HepRep because of it's menu support. Smaller scale
experiments will want to use OpenGL in the spirit of having immediate response,
good quality output and keeping things simple.
