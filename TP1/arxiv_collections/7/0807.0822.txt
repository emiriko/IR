We present a brief description of the recently developed Fortran code TERAD91
for semi-analytical calculations of the double differential cross sections of
NC and CC deep inelastic electron-proton scattering and of some related
observables. The code is mainly intended for the calculations at HERA or other
ep-colliders but may be also used for similar processes like muon-proton
scattering in fixed-target experiments.
