We presented results on azimuthal correlation of net-charge with high $p_T$
trigger particles. It is found that the net-charge correlation shape is similar
to that of total-charge. On the near-side, the net-charge and total-charge
$p_T$ spectra have similar shape and both are harder than the inclusives. On
the away-side, the correlated spectra are not much harder than the inclusives,
and the net-charge/total-charge ratio increases with $p_T$ and is similar to
the inclusive ratio.
