In this paper, our focus is on certain applications for mobile robotic
networks, where reconfiguration is driven by factors intrinsic to the network
rather than changes in the external environment. In particular, we study a
version of the coverage problem useful for surveillance applications, where the
objective is to position the robots in order to minimize the average distance
from a random point in a given environment to the closest robot. This problem
has been well-studied for omni-directional robots and it is shown that optimal
configuration for the network is a centroidal Voronoi configuration and that
the coverage cost belongs to $\Theta(m^{-1/2})$, where $m$ is the number of
robots in the network. In this paper, we study this problem for more realistic
models of robots, namely the double integrator (DI) model and the differential
drive (DD) model. We observe that the introduction of these motion constraints
in the algorithm design problem gives rise to an interesting behavior. For a
\emph{sparser} network, the optimal algorithm for these models of robots mimics
that for omni-directional robots. We propose novel algorithms whose
performances are within a constant factor of the optimal asymptotically (i.e.,
as $m \to +\infty$). In particular, we prove that the coverage cost for the DI
and DD models of robots is of order $m^{-1/3}$. Additionally, we show that, as
the network grows, these novel algorithms outperform the conventional
algorithm; hence necessitating a reconfiguration in the network in order to
maintain optimal quality of service.
