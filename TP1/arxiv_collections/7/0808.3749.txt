Cybersusy is a new mechanism for supersymmetry breaking in the standard
supersymmetric model (SSM). Here we note that the superpotential for the SSM
has a set of thirteen invariances, five of which are well known, and eight of
which are new. The eight new invariances generate a sort of supersymmetric
quark and lepton model, together with supersymmetry breaking that makes the
squarks and sleptons very heavy. This breaking regenerates the standard model
out of the supersymmetric standard model, except that the gauge particles are
not yet included in this reduction. In this paper, it is shown that, with some
continued effort, cybersusy will make some predictions for hadron masses that
may actually be wrong, so that it is a supersymmetry breaking theory that can
be proved wrong! This is the fifth paper in what was intended to be a series of
four papers on cybersusy.
