The isoscalar twist-two generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the pion
and the kaon are calculated in a Poincare covariant Bethe-Salpeter constituent
quark model. Results are presented for several values of the parameters xi and
t. The results satisfy the form factor constraints and the polynomiality
condition. For the pion GPD, also the isospin symmetry constraint is fulfilled.
The influence of kinematical variables and model parameters on the support of
the GPDs is investigated. To this end, the strength parameters and quark masses
of the constituent quark model are artificially varied.
