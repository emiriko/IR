Single donors in semiconductor nanostructures represent a key element to
develop spin related quantum functionalities in atomic scale devices. Quantum
transport through a single Arsenic donor in the channel of a Silicon nano-field
effect transistor under microwave irradiation is investigated. The device is
characterized at mK temperatures in the regime of Coulomb-blockade. Photon
assisted tunneling and microwave induced electron pumping regimes are revealed
respectively at low and high microwave power. At sufficiently high power, the
microwave irradiation induces tunneling through the first excited energy level
of the $D_0$ energy of the donor. Such microwave assisted transport at zero
bias enhances the resolution in the spectroscopy of the energy levels of the
donor.
