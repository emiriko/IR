We discuss the generation of entanglement between electronic states of two
atoms in a cavity using direct quantum feedback schemes. We compare the effects
of different control Hamiltonians and detection processes in the performance of
entanglement production and show that the quantum-jump-based feedback proposed
by us in Phys. Rev. A {\bf 76} 010301(R) (2007) can protect highly entangled
states against decoherence. We provide analytical results that explain the
robustness of jump feedback, and also analyse the perspectives of experimental
implementation by scrutinising the effects of imperfections and approximations
in our model.
