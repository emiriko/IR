Aberrantly regulated cell motility is a hallmark of cancer cells. A hybrid
agent-based model has been developed to investigate the synergistic and
antagonistic cell motility-impacting effects of three microenvironment
variables simultaneously: chemoattraction, haptotactic permission, and
biomechanical constraint or resistance. Reflecting distinct cell-specific
intracellular machinery, the cancer cells are modelled as processing a variety
of spatial search strategies that respond to these three influencing factors
with differential weights attached to each. While responding exclusively to
chemoattraction optimizes cell displacement effectiveness, incorporating
permission and resistance components becomes increasingly important with
greater distance to the chemoattractant source and/or after reducing the
ligand's effective diffusion coefficient. Extending this to a heterogeneous
population of cells shows that displacement effectiveness increases with clonal
diversity as characterized by the Shannon index. However, the resulting data
can be fit best to an exponential function, suggesting that there is a level of
population heterogeneity beyond which its added value to the cancer system
becomes minimal as directionality ceases to increase. Possible experimental
extensions and potential clinical implications are discussed.
