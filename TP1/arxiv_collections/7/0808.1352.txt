The effects of different contact geometries, bond dimerization, and gate
voltage on quantum transport through a C$_{60}$ molecule are studied by the
Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula based on the Green's function technique. It is
shown that the number of contact points between the device electrodes and the
molecule can play an important role in the electron conduction. The
transmission is due to the resonant tunneling when the electrodes are contacted
to one carbon atom of the molecule. In the case of multiple contacts, the
interference effects are responsible for the change of the transmission through
the C$_{60}$. The bond dimerization and a gate voltage shift the molecular
levels and by adjusting the related parameters the electron conduction can be
controlled.
