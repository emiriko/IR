We consider a stochastic control problem where the set of strict (classical)
controls is not necessarily convex, and the system is governed by a nonlinear
backward stochastic differential equation. By introducing a new approach, we
establish necessary as well as sufficient conditions of optimality for two
models. The first concerns the relaxed controls, who are measure-valued
processes. The second is a particular case of the first and relates to strict
control problems.
