The synchrony and variability have been discussed of the coupled Langevin
model subjected to spatially correlated additive and multiplicative noise. We
have employed numerical simulations and the analytical augmented-moment method
which is the second-order moment method for local and global variables [H.
Hasegawa, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 67}, 041903 (2003)]. It has been shown that the
synchrony of an ensemble is increased (decreased) by a positive (negative)
spatial correlation in both additive and multiplicative noise. Although the
variability for local fluctuations is almost insensitive to spatial
correlations, that for global fluctuations is increased (decreased) by positive
(negative) correlations. When a pulse input is applied, the synchrony is
increased for the correlated multiplicative noise, whereas it may be decreased
for correlated additive noise coexisting with uncorrelated multiplicative
noise. An application of our study to neuron ensembles has demonstrated the
possibility that information is conveyed by the variance and synchrony in input
signals, which accounts for some neuronal experiments.
