Method developed by Sandalov and coworkers [Int. J. Quant. Chem. 94, 113
(2003)] is applied to inelastic transport in the case of strong correlations on
the molecule, which is relatively weakly coupled to contacts. Ability of the
approach to deal with the transport in the language of many-body molecular
states as well as take into account charge-specific normal modes and
nonadiabatic couplings is stressed. We demonstrate capabilities of the
technique within simple model calculations, and compare it to previously
published approaches.
