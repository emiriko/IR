Rotational constraint representing a local external bias generally has
non-trivial effect on the critical behavior of lattice statistical models in
equilibrium critical phenomena. In order to study the effect of rotational bias
in a out of equilibrium situation like self-organized criticality, a new two
state ``quasi-deterministic'' rotational sandpile model is developed here
imposing rotational constraint on the flow of sand grains. An extended set of
new critical exponents are found to characterize the avalanche properties at
the non-equilibrium steady state of the model. The probability distribution
functions are found to obey usual finite size scaling supported by negative
time autocorrelation between the toppling waves. The model exhibits
characteristics of both deterministic and stochastic sandpile models.
