We give an alternative definition of quantum fidelity for two density
operators on qudits in terms of the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product between them
and their purity. It can be regarded as the well-defined operator fidelity for
the two operators and satisfies all Jozsa's four axioms up to a normalization
factor. One desire property is that it is not computationally demanding.
