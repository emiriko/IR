For any function that is real for real x, positivity of Tuck's function
Q(x)=D'^2(x)/(D'^2(x)-D"(x) D(x)) is a condition for the absence of the complex
zeros close to the real axis. Study of the probability distribution P(Q), for
D(x) with N zeros corresponding to eigenvalues of the Gaussian unitary ensemble
(GUE), supports Tuck's observation that large values of Q are very rare for the
Riemann zeros. P(Q) has singularities at Q=0, Q=1 and Q=N. The moments
(averages of Q^m) are much smaller for the GUE than for uncorrelated random
(Poisson-distributed) zeros. For the Poisson case, the large-N limit of P(Q)
can be expressed as an integral with infinitely many poles, whose accumulation,
requiring regularization with the Lerch transcendent, generates the singularity
at Q=1, while the large-Q decay is determined by the pole closest to the
origin. Determining the large-N limit of P(Q) for the GUE seems difficult.
