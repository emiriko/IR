Direct evidence of quantum coherence in a single-molecule magnet in frozen
solution is reported with coherence times as long as T2 = 630 ns. We can
strongly increase the coherence time by modifying the matrix in which the
single-molecule magnets are embedded. The electron spins are coupled to the
proton nuclear spins of both the molecule itself and interestingly, also to
those of the solvent. The clear observation of Rabi oscillations indicates that
we can manipulate the spin coherently, an essential prerequisite for performing
quantum computations.
