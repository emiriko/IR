We investigate the effects of disorder within the T=0 Brinkman-Rice (BR)
scenario for the Mott metal-insulator transition (MIT) in two dimensions (2d).
For sufficiently weak disorder the transition retains the Mott character, as
signaled by the vanishing of the local quasiparticles (QP) weights Z_{i} and
strong disorder screening at criticality. In contrast to the behavior in high
dimensions, here the local spatial fluctuations of QP parameters are strongly
enhanced in the critical regime, with a distribution function P(Z) ~
Z^{\alpha-1} and \alpha tends to zero at the transition. This behavior
indicates a robust emergence of an electronic Griffiths phase preceding the
MIT, in a fashion surprisingly reminiscent of the "Infinite Randomness Fixed
Point" scenario for disordered quantum magnets.
