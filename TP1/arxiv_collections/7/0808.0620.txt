Jerzy Neyman's life history and some of his contributions to applied
statistics are reviewed. In a 1960 article he wrote: ``Currently in the period
of dynamic indeterminism in science, there is hardly a serious piece of
research which, if treated realistically, does not involve operations on
stochastic processes. The time has arrived for the theory of stochastic
processes to become an item of usual equipment of every applied statistician.''
The emphasis in this article is on stochastic processes and on stochastic
process data analysis. A number of data sets and corresponding substantive
questions are addressed. The data sets concern sardine depletion, blowfly
dynamics, weather modification, elk movement and seal journeying. Three of the
examples are from Neyman's work and four from the author's joint work with
collaborators.
