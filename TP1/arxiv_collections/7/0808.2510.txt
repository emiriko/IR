The equations of the linearized first post-Newtonian approximation to general
relativity are often written in "gravitoelectromagnetic" Maxwell-like form,
since that facilitates physical intuition. Damour, Soffel and Xu (DSX) (as a
side issue in their complex but elegant papers on relativistic celestial
mechanics) have expressed the first post-Newtonian approximation, including all
nonlinearities, in Maxwell-like form. This paper summarizes that DSX
Maxwell-like formalism (which is not easily extracted from their celestial
mechanics papers), and then extends it to include the post-Newtonian
(Landau-Lifshitz-based) gravitational momentum density, momentum flux (i.e.
gravitational stress tensor) and law of momentum conservation in Maxwell-like
form. The authors and their colleagues have found these Maxwell-like momentum
tools useful for developing physical intuition into numerical-relativity
simulations of compact binaries with spin.
