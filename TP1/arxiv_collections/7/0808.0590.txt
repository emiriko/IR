We discuss a new mechanism for the electron capture in fast ion-atom
collisions. Similarly like in the radiative capture, where the electron
transfer occurs due to photon emission, within the mechanism under
consideration the electron capture takes place due to the emission of an
additional electron. This first order capture process leads to the so called
transfer-ionization and has a number of interesting features, in particular, in
the target frame it results in the electron emission mainly into the backward
semi-sphere.
