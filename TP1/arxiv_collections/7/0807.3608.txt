The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of plantar-flexor
muscles fatigue on postural control during quiet standing under normal, altered
and improved vestibular and neck somatosensory conditions. To address this
objective, young male university students were asked to stand upright as still
as possible with their eyes closed in two conditions of No Fatigue and Fatigue
of the plantar-flexor muscles. In Experiment 1 (n=15), the postural task was
executed in two Neutral head and Head tilted backward postures, recognized to
degrade vestibular and neck somatosensory information. In Experiment 2 (n=15),
the postural task was executed in two conditions of No tactile and Tactile
stimulation of the neck provided by the application of strips of adhesive
bandage to the skin over and around the neck. Centre of foot pressure
displacements were recorded using a force platform. Results showed that (1) the
Fatigue condition yielded increased CoP displacements relative to the No
Fatigue condition (Experiment 1 and Experiment 2), (2) this destabilizing
effect was more accentuated in the Head tilted backward posture than Neutral
head posture (Experiment 1) and (3) this destabilizing effect was less
accentuated in the condition of Tactile stimulation than that of No tactile
stimulation of the neck (Experiment 2). In the context of the multisensory
control of balance, these results suggest an increased reliance on vestibular
and neck somatosensory information for controlling posture during quiet
standing in condition of altered ankle neuromuscular function.
