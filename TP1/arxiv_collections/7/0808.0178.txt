We report generation of a new quantum interference effect in spontaneous
emission from a resonantly driven system of two identical two-level atoms due
to the spatial variation of the laser phase at the positions of the atoms. This
interference affects significantly the spectral features of the emitted
radiation and the quantum entanglement in the system. The interference leads to
dynamic coupling of the populations and coherences in a basis, determined by
the laser phase and represents a kind of vacuum mediated super-exchange between
the symmetric and antisymmetric states.
