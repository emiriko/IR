We study the formation of inhomogeneous magnetization texture in the vicinity
of a tunnel junction between two ferromagnetic wires nominally in the
antiparallel configuration and its influence on the magnetoresistance of such a
device. The texture, dependent on magnetization rigidity and crystalline
anisotropy energy in the ferromagnet, appears upon an increase of ferromagnetic
inter-wire coupling above a critical value and it varies with an external
magnetic field.
