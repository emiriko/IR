We report on experimental observation of localized structures in two mutually
coupled broad-areahttp://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/images/calendar.gif
semiconductor resonators. These structures coexist with a dark homogeneous
background and they have the same properties as cavity solitons without
requiring the presence of a driving beam into the system. They can be switched
individually on and off by means of a local addressing beam.
