We present an overview of the description of K and eta meson productions in
nucleon-nucleon collisions within an effective Lagrangian model where meson
production proceeds via excitation, propagation and subsequent decay of
intermediate baryonic resonant states. The $K$ meson contains a strange quark
($s$) or antiquark ($\bar s$) while the $\eta$ meson has hidden strangeness as
it contains some component of the $s{\bar s}$ pair. Strange meson production is
expected to provide information on the manifestation of quantum chromodynamics
in the non-perturbative regime of energies larger than that of the low energy
pion physics. We discuss specific examples where proper understanding of the
experimental data for these reactions is still lacking.
