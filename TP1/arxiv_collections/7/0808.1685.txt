Single wall carbon nanotubes grown entirely from 13-C form an ideal system to
study the effect of electron interaction on nuclear magnetism in one dimension.
If the electrons are in the metallic, Luttinger liquid regime, we show that
even a very weak hyperfine coupling to the 13-C nuclear spins has a striking
effect: The system is driven into an ordered phase, which combines electron and
nuclear degrees of freedom, and which persists up into the millikelvin range.
In this phase the conductance is reduced by a universal factor of 2, allowing
for detection by standard transport experiments.
