We study the Navier-Stokes steady states for a low density monodisperse hard
sphere granular gas (i.e, a hard sphere ideal monatomic gas with inelastic
interparticle collisions). We present a classification of the uniform steady
states that can arise from shear and temperature (or energy input) applied at
the boundaries (parallel walls). We consider both symmetric and asymmetric
boundary conditions and find steady states not previously reported, including
sheared states with linear temperature profiles. We provide explicit
expressions for the hydrodynamic profiles for all these steady states. Our
results are validated by the numerical solution of the Boltzmann kinetic
equation for the granular gas obtained by the direct simulation Monte Carlo
method, and by molecular dynamics simulations. We discuss the physical origin
of the new steady states and derive conditions for the validity of
Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics.
