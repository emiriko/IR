The oxidative stress response is characterized by various effects on a range
of biologic molecules. When examined at the protein level, both expression
levels and protein modifications are altered by oxidative stress. While these
effects have been studied in the past by classic biochemical methods, the
recent onset of proteomics methods has allowed the oxidative stress response to
be studied on a much wider scale. The input of proteomics in the study of
oxidative stress response and in the evidence of an oxidative stress component
in biologic phenomena is reviewed in this paper.
