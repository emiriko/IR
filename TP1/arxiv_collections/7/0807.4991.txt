These lecture notes in the De Rham-Hodge theory are designed for a 1-semester
undergraduate course (in mathematics, physics, engineering, chemistry or
biology). This landmark theory of the 20th Century mathematics gives a rigorous
foundation to modern field and gauge theories in physics, engineering and
physiology. The only necessary background for comprehensive reading of these
notes is Green's theorem from multivariable calculus.
