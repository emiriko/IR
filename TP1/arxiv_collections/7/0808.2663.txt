Electromagnetic dipole absorption cross-sections of transitional nuclei with
large-amplitude shape fluctuations are calculated in a microscopic way by
introducing the concept of Instantaneous Shape Sampling. The concept bases on
the slow shape dynamics as compared to the fast dipole vibrations. The
elctromagnetic dipole strength is calculated by means of RPA for the
instantaneous shapes, the probability of which is obtained by means of IBA.
Very good agreement with the experimental absorption cross sections near the
nucleon emission threshold is obtained.
