A group of non-uniform quantum lattice Hamiltonians in one dimension is
introduced, which is related to the hyperbolic $1 + 1$-dimensional space. The
Hamiltonians contain only nearest neighbor interactions whose strength is
proportional to $\cosh j \lambda$, where $j$ is the lattice index and where
$\lambda \ge 0$ is a deformation parameter. In the limit $\lambda \to 0$ the
Hamiltonians become uniform. Spacial translation of the deformed Hamiltonians
is induced by the corner Hamiltonians. As a simple example, we investigate the
ground state of the deformed $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg spin chain by use of the
density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. It is shown that the ground
state is dimerized when $\lambda$ is finite. Spin correlation function show
exponential decay, and the boundary effect decreases with increasing $\lambda$.
