The phase diagram in temperature and magnetic field of the metal-organic,
two-leg, spin-ladder compound (C5H12N)2CuBr4 is studied by measurements of the
specific heat and the magnetocaloric effect. We demonstrate the presence of an
extended spin Luttinger-liquid phase between two field-induced quantum critical
points and over a broad range of temperature. Based on an ideal spin-ladder
Hamiltonian, comprehensive numerical modelling of the ladder specific heat
yields excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental data across the
complete phase diagram.
