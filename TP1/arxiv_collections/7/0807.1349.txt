We consider how to take an orbifold reduction for the multiple M2-brane
theory recently proposed by Bagger and Lambert, and discuss its relation to
Chern-Simons theories. Starting from the infinite dimensional 3-algebra
realized as the Nambu bracket on a 3-torus, we first suggest an orbifolding
prescription for various fields. Then we introduce a second truncation, which
effectively reduces the internal space to a 2-torus. Eventually one obtains a
large-N limit of Chern-Simons gauge theories coupled to matter fields. We
consider an abelian orbifold C^4/Z_n, and illustrate how one can arrive at the
N=6 supersymmetric theories with gauge groups U(N) x U(N) and Chern-Simons
levels (k,-k), as recently constructed by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and
Maldacena.
