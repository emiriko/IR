We incorporate active and passive quantum error-correcting techniques to
protect a set of optical information modes of a continuous-variable quantum
information system. Our method uses ancilla modes, entangled modes, and gauge
modes (modes in a mixed state) to help correct errors on a set of information
modes. A linear-optical encoding circuit consisting of offline squeezers,
passive optical devices, feedforward control, conditional modulation, and
homodyne measurements performs the encoding. The result is that we extend the
entanglement-assisted operator stabilizer formalism for discrete variables to
continuous-variable quantum information processing.
