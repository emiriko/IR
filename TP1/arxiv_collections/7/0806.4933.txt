A unique new facility, capable of colliding beams of electrons with a wide
range of nuclei as well as polarized protons and light ions, has been proposed
to study the role of gluons in matter and perform precision mapping of the
structure of nucleons and nuclei. The physics prospects of the proposed
Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) are discussed.
