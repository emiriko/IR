The thermal Casimir effect in ideal metal rectangular boxes is considered
using the method of zeta functional regularization. The renormalization
procedure is suggested which provides the finite expression for the Casimir
free energy in any restricted quantization volume. This expression satisfies
the classical limit at high temperature and leads to zero thermal Casimir force
for systems with infinite characteristic dimensions. In the case of two
parallel ideal metal planes the results, as derived previously using thermal
quantum field theory in Matsubara formulation and other methods, are reproduced
starting from the obtained expression. It is shown that for rectangular boxes
the temperature-dependent contribution to the electromagnetic Casimir force can
be both positive and negative depending on side lengths. The numerical
computations of the scalar and electromagnetic Casimir free energy and force
are performed for cubes
