The contribution of photodissociation of molecular oxygen to the total volume
emission rate of greenline dayglow emission at 5577 A is modelled in the
present study. The Solar EUV radiation fluxes for the modelling are obtained
from the Solar2000 V 2.25 model. The modelling has been done in the altitude
range of 92 - 105 Km, where the photodissociation and the three body
recombination are the main contributing processes to the greenline dayglow
emission. The present results are discussed in the light of Wind Imaging
Interferometer (WINDII) observations of greenline dayglow emission in the
altitude range of 92 - 105 Km. It is found that the Solar2000 V2.25 flux model
gives better agreement with the WINDII observations especially in the 92 - 96
Km where the earlier models predicted a very low emission rate. In the
mesospheric emission peak region the present results are higher than the
measurements and this discrepancy may possibly be attributed due to higher
values of solar fluxes for those spectral lines which are main sources of the
production of greenline dayglow emission. The present study suggests the
reexamination of Solar2000 flux model at least for those spectral lines which
are the main sources of greenline dayglow emission in mesospheric emission peak
region.
