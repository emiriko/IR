The property that the polynomial cohomology with coefficients of a finitely
generated discrete group is canonically isomorphic to the group cohomology is
called the (weak) isocohomological property for the group. In the case when a
group is of type $HF^\infty$, i.e. that has a classifying space with the
homotopy type of a cellular complex with finitely many cells in each dimension,
we show that the isocohomological property is equivalent to the universal cover
of the classifying space satisfying polynomially bounded higher Dehn functions.
If a group is hyperbolic relative to a collection of subgroups, each of which
is polynomially combable (respectively $HF^\infty$ and isocohomological), then
we show that the group itself has these respective properties too. Combining
with the results of Connes-Moscovici and Dru{\c{t}}u-Sapir we conclude that a
group satisfies the Novikov conjecture if it is relatively hyperbolic to
subgroups that are of property RD, of type $HF^\infty$ and isocohomological.
