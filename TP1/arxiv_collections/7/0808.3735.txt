We derive a Kondo Lattice model with a correlated conduction band from a
two-band Hubbard Hamiltonian. This mapping allows us to describe the emergence
of a robust pairing mechanism in a model that only contains repulsive
interactions. The mechanism is due to topological confinement and results from
the interplay between antiferromagnetism and delocalization. By using
Density-Matrix-Renormalization-Group (DMRG), we demonstrate that this mechanism
leads to dominant superconducting correlations in a 1D-system.
