At HERA heavy quarks may contribute up to 30% of the structure function
$F_2$. The potential of including heavy-quark data in the ZEUS PDF fits is
explored, using $D^*$ double differential cross-sections as well as the
inclusive quantities $F_2^{c\bar{c}}$, $F_2^{c\bar{c}}$. The introduction of
heavy quarks requires an extension of the DGLAP formalism. The effect of using
different heavy flavour number schemes, and different approaches to the running
of $\alpha_s$, are compared.
