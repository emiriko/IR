The current accelerating phase of the evolution of the universe is considered
by constructing most economical cosmic models that use just general relativity
and some dominating quantum effects associated with the probabilistic
description of quantum physics. Two of such models are explicitly analyzed.
They are based on the existence of a sub-quantum potential and correspond to a
generalization of the spatially flat exponential model of de Sitter space. The
thermodynamics of these two cosmic solutions is discussed, using the second
principle as a guide to choose which among the two is more feasible. The paper
also discusses the relativistic physics on which the models are based, their
holographic description, some implications from the classical energy
conditions, and an interpretation of dark energy in terms of the entangled
energy of the universe.
