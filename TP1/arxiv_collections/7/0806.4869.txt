Given $p$ polynomials of $n$ variables over a field $k$ of characteristic 0
and a point $a \in k^n$, we propose an algorithm computing the local
Bernstein-Sato ideal at $a$. Moreover with the same algorithm we compute a
constructible stratification of $k^n$ such that the local Bernstein-Sato ideal
is constant along each stratum. Finally, we present non-trivial examples
computed with our algorithm.
