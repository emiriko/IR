In the light of recent developments in Dark Energy, we consider the electron
in a such a background field and show that at the Compton wavelength the
electron is stable, in that the Cassini inward pressure exactly counterbalances
the outward Coulomb repulsive pressure thus answering a problem of the earlier
electron theory.
