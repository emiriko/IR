We obtain the virial theorem within the context of a brane-world model
without mirror symmetry or any form of junction condition. Taking a constant
curvature bulk (neglecting non-local bulk effects), the local bulk effects
generate a geometrical mass, contributing to the gravitational energy which may
be used to explain the virial mass discrepancy in clusters of galaxies. We fix
the parameter of this model in agreement with observational data.
