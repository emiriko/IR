Recent transport properties on the stripe phase in
La$_{\text{1.875}}$Ba$_{\text{01.25}}$CuO$_{\text{4}}$ by Li \textit{et al.}
found 2-dimensional superconductivity over a wide temperature range including a
Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at a temperature T=16K, with
3-dimensional superconducting (SC) ordering only at T=4K. These results
contradict the long standing belief that the onset of superconductivity is
suppressed by stripe ordering and suggest coexistence of stripe and SC phases.
The lack of 3-D superconducting order above T=4K requires an antiphase ordering
in the SC state to suppress the interlayer Josephson coupling as proposed by
Berg \textit{et al.}. Here we use a renormalized mean field theory for a
generalized t-J model to examine in detail the energetics of the spin and
charge stripe ordered SC states including possible antiphase domains in the SC
order. We find that the energies of these modulated states are very close to
each other and that the anisotropy present in the low temperature tetragonal
crystal structure favors stripe resonating valence bond states. The stripe
antiphase SC states are found to have energies very close,but always above, the
ground state energy which suggests additional physical effects are responsible
for their stability.
