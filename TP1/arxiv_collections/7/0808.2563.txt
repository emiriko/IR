In our previous papers on ballistic quantum transport in nano-transistors [J.
Appl. Phys. 98, 84308 (2005)] it was demonstrated that under certain conditions
it is possible to reduce the three-dimensional transport problem to an
effectively one-dimensional one. We show that such an effectively
one-dimensional description can be cast in a scale-invariant form. We obtain
dimensionless variables for the characteristic channel length $l$ and width of
the transistor which determine the scale-invariant output characteristic. For
$l \gtrsim 10$, in the strong barrier regime, the output characteristics are
similar to that of a conventional MOSFET assuming an ideal form for $l \to
\infty$. In the weak barrier regime, $l \lesssim 10$, strong source-drain
currents lead to i-v characteristics that differ qualitatively from that of a
conventional transistor. Comparing with experimental data we find qualitative
agreement.
