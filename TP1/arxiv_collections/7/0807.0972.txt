A new representation for electrons is introduced, in which the electron
operators are written in terms of a spinless fermion and the Pauli operators.
This representation is canonical, invertible and constraint-free. Importantly,
it simplifies the Hubbard interaction. On a bipartite lattice, the Hubbard
model is reduced to a form in which the exchange interaction emerges simply by
decoupling the Pauli subsystem from the spinless fermion bath. This exchange
correctly reproduces the large $U$ superexchange. Also derived, for
$U=\pm\infty$, is the Hamiltonian to study Nagaoka ferromagnetism. In this
representation, the infinite-$U$ Hubbard problem becomes elegant and easier to
handle. Interestingly, the ferromagnetism in Hubbard model is found to be
related to the gauge invariance of the spinless fermions. Generalization of
this representation for the multicomponent fermions, a new representation for
bosons, the notion of a `soft-core' fermion, and some interesting unitary
transformations are introduced and discussed in the appendices.
