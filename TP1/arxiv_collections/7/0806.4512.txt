We analyze how decoherence appears in the I-V characteristics of a
voltage-biased single-Cooper-pair transistor. Especially the effect on resonant
single or several Cooper-pair tunneling is studied. We consider both a
symmetric and an asymmetric transistor. As a decoherence source we use a small
resistive impedance (Re[Z(w)]<<R_Q=h/4e^2) in series with the transistor, which
provides both thermal and quantum fluctuations of the voltage. Additional
decoherence sources are quasiparticle tunneling across the Josephson junctions
and quantum f-noise caused by spurious charge fluctuators nearby the island.
The analysis is based on a real-time diagrammatic technique which includes
Zeno-like effects in the charge transport, where the tunneling is slowed down
due to strong decoherence. As compared to the Pauli-master-equation treatment
of the problem, the present results are more consistent with experiments where
many of the predicted sharp resonant structures are missing or weakened due to
decoherence.
