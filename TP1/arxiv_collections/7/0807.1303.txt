We study ground-state properties of the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half
filling by improving variational Monte Carlo method and by implementing
quantum-number projection and multi-variable optimization. The improved
variational wave function enables a highly accurate description of the Mott
transition and strong fluctuations in metals. We clarify how anomalous metals
appear near the first-order Mott transition. The double occupancy stays nearly
constant as a function of the on-site Coulomb interaction in the metallic phase
near the Mott transition in agreement with the previous unbiased results. This
unconventional metal at half filling is stabilized by a formation of
``electron-like pockets'' coexisting with an arc structure, which leads to a
prominent differentiation of electrons in momentum space. An abrupt collapse of
the ``pocket'' and ``arc'' drives the first-order Mott transition.
