We discuss, and propose a solution for, a still unresolved problem regarding
the breaking from $\N=2$ super-QCD to $\N=1$ super-QCD. A mass term $W=\mu \Tr
\Phi^2 / 2$ for the adjoint field, which classically does the required breaking
perfectly, quantum mechanically leads to a relevant operator that, in the
infrared, makes the theory flow away from pure $\N=1$ SQCD. To avoid this
problem, we first need to extend the theory from $\SU (n_c)$ to $\U (n_c)$. We
then look for the quantum generalization of the condition $W^{\prime}(m)=0$,
that is, the coincidence between a root of the derivative of the superpotential
$W(\phi)$ and the mass $m$ of the quarks. There are $2n_c -n_f$ of such points
in the moduli space. We suggest that with an opportune choice of
superpotential, that selects one of these coincidence vacua in the moduli
space, it is possible to flow from $\N=2$ SQCD to $\N=1$ SQCD. Various
arguments support this claim. In particular, we shall determine the exact
location in the moduli space of these coincidence vacua and the precise
factorization of the SW curve.
