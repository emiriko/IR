Three-jet production in deep inelastic ep scattering and photoproduction was
investigated with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of
127 pb-1. Measurements of differential cross sections are presented as
functions of angular correlations between the three jets in the final state and
the proton-beam direction. These correlations provide a stringent test of
perturbative QCD and show sensitivity to the contributions from different
colour configurations. Fixed-order perturbative QCD calculations assuming the
values of the colour factors C_F, C_A and T_F as derived from a variety of
gauge groups were compared to the measurements to study the underlying gauge
group symmetry. The measured angular correlations in the deep inelastic ep
scattering and photoproduction regimes are consistent with the admixture of
colour configurations as predicted by SU(3) and disfavour other symmetry
groups, such as SU(N) in the limit of large N.
