The technique of obtaining of p+-n-type gallium phosphide diode epitaxial
structures from liquid phase was developed as well as pilot samples of diode
temperature sensors were fabricated based on them. Thermometric and
current-voltage characteristics of the test diodes were measured in the
temperature range of 80 / 520K and their basic technical characteristics were
determined. An availability of application of the structures developed as
sensing elements of high-temperature heat sensors was shown.
