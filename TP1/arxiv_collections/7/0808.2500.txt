High quality single crystals of a ferromagnetic superconductor URhGe were
successfully grown. The electrical resistivity was measured for the field along
b-axis in the orthorhombic crystal structure in order to study precisely its
field re-entrant superconductivity which occurs in the vicinity of the field
$H_{\rm R}$, where the easy magnetization switches from $c$ to b-axis. The
field re-entrant superconductivity of URhGe is analyzed with special focus on
its dependence with the value of residual resistivity $\rho_0$ and the
coefficient $A$ of $T^2$ term of the resistivity. The experimental results are
well explained by a crude model related with the field dependence of the
effective mass $m^\ast$, where the corresponding critical temperature
$T_{\mathrm{sc}}(m^\ast)$ and the upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$ are
strongly enhanced. Discussion is made on the interplay between magnetic and
superconducting phase diagram as well as the link between $T_{\mathrm{sc}}$ and
$A$ in other heavy fermion superconductors.
