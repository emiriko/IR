We construct in a systematic way the complete Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology
at form degree two, three and four for the Galilei and Poincare groups. The
corresponding non-trivial forms belong to certain representations of the
spatial rotation (Lorentz) group. In the case of two forms they give all
possible central and non-central extensions of the Galilei group (and all
non-central extensions of the Poincare group). The procedure developed in this
paper can be applied to any space-time symmetry group.
