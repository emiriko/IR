We find the exact solution for a finite size Giant Magnon in the $SU(2)\times
SU(2)$ sector of the string dual of the $\mathcal{N}=6$ superconformal
Chern-Simons theory recently constructed by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and
Maldacena. The finite size Giant Magnon solution consists of two magnons, one
in each $SU(2)$. In the infinite size limit this solution corresponds to the
Giant Magnon solution of arXiv:0806.4959. The magnon dispersion relation
exhibits finite-size exponential corrections with respect to the infinite size
limit solution.
