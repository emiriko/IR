Our previous theorems on exponential sums often did not apply or did not give
sharp results when certain powers of a variable appearing in the polynomial
were divisible by p. We remedy that defect in this paper by systematically
applying "p-power reduction," making it possible to strengthen and extend our
earlier results.
