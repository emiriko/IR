We discuss the phenomenology of a toy intersecting brane model where
supersymmetry is dynamically broken in an open string hidden sector and
gauge-mediated to the visible sector. Scalar masses ~ TeV are easily
realizable, and R-symmetry is broken. These ideas are easily generalizable to
other intersecting brane models.
