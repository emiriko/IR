We consider a novel mechanism for J/Psi production in nuclear collisions
arising due to the high density of gluons. We calculate the resulting J/Psi
production cross section as a function of rapidity and centrality. We evaluate
the nuclear modification factor and show that the rapidity distribution of the
produced J/Psi's is significantly more narrow in AA collisions due to the gluon
saturation effects. Our results indicate that gluon saturation in the colliding
nuclei is a significant source of J/Psi suppression that can be disentangled
from the quark-gluon plasma effects.
