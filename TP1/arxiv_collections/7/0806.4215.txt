The electrical resistivity and Hall coefficient of LaFeAsO0.95F0.05
polycrystalline samples were measured in pulsed magnetic fields up to m0H = 60
T from room temperature to 1.5 K. The resistance of the normal state shows a
negative temperature coefficient (dr/dT < 0) below 70 K for this composition,
indicating insulating ground state in underdoped LaFeAsO system in contrast to
heavily doped compound. The charge carrier density obtained from Hall effect
can be described as constant plus a thermally activated term with an energy gap
DE = 630 K. Upper critical field, Hc2, estimated from resistivity measurements,
exceeds 75 T with zero-field Tc = 26.3 K, suggesting an unconventional nature
for superconductivity.
