We present a complete scheme for quantum information processing using the
unique features of alkaline earth atoms. We show how two completely independent
lattices can be formed for the $^1$S$_0$ and $^3$P$_0$ states, with one used as
a storage lattice for qubits encoded on the nuclear spin, and the other as a
transport lattice to move qubits and perform gate operations. We discuss how
the $^3$P$_2$ level can be used for addressing of individual qubits, and how
collisional losses from metastable states can be used to perform gates via a
lossy blockade mechanism.
