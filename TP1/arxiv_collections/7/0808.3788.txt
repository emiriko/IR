We have studied the antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition of a 2D
Kondo-Heisenberg square lattice using the non-linear sigma model. A
renormalization group analysis of the competing Kondo -- RKKY interaction was
carried out to 1-loop order in the $\epsilon$ expansion, and a new quantum
critical point is found, dominated by Kondo fluctuations. In addition, the
spin-wave velocity scales logarithmically near the new QCP, i.e breakdown of
hydrodynamic behavior. The results allow us to propose a new phase diagram near
the AFM fixed point of this 2D Kondo lattice model.
