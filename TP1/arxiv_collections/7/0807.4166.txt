Using an exact numerical method for finite nonplanar objects, we demonstrate
a stable mechanical suspension of a silica cylinder within a metallic cylinder
separated by ethanol, via a repulsive Casimir force between the silica and the
metal. We investigate cylinders with both circular and square cross sections,
and show that the latter exhibit a stable orientation as well as a stable
position, via a method to compute Casimir torques for finite objects.
Furthermore, the stable orientation of the square cylinder is shown to undergo
an unusual 45 degrees transition as a function of the separation lengthscale,
which is explained as a consequence of material dispersion.
