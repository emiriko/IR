The gamma-decay associated with the warm rotation of the superdeformed (SD)
nuclei 151Tb and 196Pb has been measured with the EUROBALL IV array. Several
independent quantities provide a stringent test of the population and decay
dynamics in the SD well. A Monte Carlo simulation of the gamma-decay based on
microscopic calculations gives remarkable agreement with the data only assuming
a large enhancement of the B(E1) strength at low excitation energy, which may
be related to the evidence for octupole vibrations in both mass regions.
