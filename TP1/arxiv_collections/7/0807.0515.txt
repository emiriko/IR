We investigate radiative corrections to K --> 3 pi decays. In particular, we
extend the non-relativistic framework developed recently to include real and
virtual photons and show that, in a well-defined power counting scheme, the
results reproduce corrections obtained in the relativistic calculation. Real
photons are included exactly, beyond the soft-photon approximation, and we
compare the result with the latter. The singularities generated by pionium near
threshold are investigated, and a region is identified where standard
perturbation theory in the fine structure constant alpha may be applied. We
expect that the formulae provided allow one to extract S-wave pi pi scattering
lengths from the cusp effect in these decays with high precision.
