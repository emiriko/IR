Micropropagation of three genotypes of Indian mustard [\textit{Brassica
juncea} (L.) Czern.] using 7-days old seedling-derived transverse thin cell
layer (tTCL) explants was accomplished.
  The genotype, explant source and addition of silver nitrate to the medium
significantly influenced shoot bud induction. MS medium with 26.6 $\mu$M of
6-Benzylaminopurin (BAP) and 3.22 $\mu$M of 1-naphtaleneacetic acid (NAA) was
identical (in the case of cotyledon tTCLs whatever the organ) and superior for
the induction of buds (in the cases of petiole tTCL explants of genotypes 1 and
2 and hypocotyl tTCL explants of genotypes 1 and 3) than 53.3 $\mu$M of BAP and
3.22 $\mu$M of NAA. However, 53.3 $\mu$M of BAP was superior for the induction
of buds than 26.6 $\mu$M in the presence of the same concentration of NAA for
petiole tTCL explants of genotype 3 and hypocotyl tTCL explants of genotype 2.
  The addition of silver nitrate significantly enhanced the rate of shoot
induction in all genotypes. Cotyledon-derived tTCL explants exhibited the
highest shoot bud induction potential and was followed by petiole- and
hypocotyl-derived ones. Addition of 10 $\mu$M of silver nitrate to BAP and NAA
supplemented medium induced higher frequency shoot bud induction (up to 100 %)
with the highest means of 4.45 shoots per cotyledon-derived tTCL explants
obtained with the genotype 2. Shoot regenerated were rooted on MS basal medium
without PGRs which induced 99 % of roots per shoot. The plantlets established
in greenhouse conditions with 99 % survival, flowered normally and set seeds.
