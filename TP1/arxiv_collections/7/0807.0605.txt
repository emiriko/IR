In this talk we present recent next-to-leading order results relevant for LHC
phenomenology obtained with the GOLEM method. After reviewing the status of
this Feynman diagrammatic approach for multi-leg one-loop calculations we
discuss three applications: the loop-induced process gg -> Z^*Z^* and the
virtual corrections to the five and six point processes qq -> ZZg and u ubar ->
s sbar c cbar. We demonstrate that our method leads to representations of such
amplitudes which allow for efficient phase space integration. In this context
we propose a reweighting technique of the leading order unweighted events by
local K-factors.
