We observe remarkably strong room temperature ferromagnetism (~1.5 Bohr
Magneton/Mn) in optically transparent Mn(II)-doped indium tin oxide (ITO)
films. The nanocrystalline films with average grain size 10-22 nm and thickness
150-350 nm are prepared by sol-gel coating technique on sodalime silica glass
substrate. The ferromagnetic property is, of course, weak for films deposited
on pure silica glass substrate. The structural parameters of the films appear
to be governing the magnetic property strongly which vary appreciably depending
on the substrate. The observation of room temperature ferromagnetism in
transparent conducting ITO films may find a plethora of applications in the
area of magneto-optics.
