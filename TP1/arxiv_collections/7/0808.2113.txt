The weak decays of $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda l^{+} l^{-}$ ($l=e, \mu$) are
investigated in Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and also in
Supersymmetric (SUSY) SO(10) Grand Unified Models. In MSSM the special
attention is paid to the Neutral Higgs Bosons (NHBs) as they make quite a large
contribution in exclusive $B \to X_{s} l^{+} l^{-}$ decays at large
$\tan{\beta}$ regions of parameter space of SUSY models, since part of SUSY
contributions is proportional to $\tan^{3}{\beta}$. The analysis of decay rate,
forward-backward asymmetries, lepton polarization asymmetries and the
polarization asymmetries of $\Lambda $ baryon in $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda l^{+}
l^{-}$ show that the values of these physical observables are greatly modified
by the effects of NHBs. In SUSY SO(10) GUT model, the new physics contribution
comes from the operators which are induced by the NHBs penguins and also from
the operators having chirality opposite to that of the corresponding SM
operators. SUSY SO(10) effects show up only in the decay $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda
+\tau^{+} \tau^{-}$ where the longitudinal and transverse lepton polarization
asymmetries are deviate significantly from the SM value while the effects in
the decay rate, forward-backward asymmetries and polarization asymmetries of
final state $\Lambda$ baryon are very mild. The transverse lepton polarization
asymmetry in $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda +\tau^{+} \tau^{-}$ is almost zero in SM
and in MSSM model. However, it can reach to -0.1 in SUSY SO(10) GUT model and
could be seen at the future colliders; hence this asymmetry observable will
provide us useful information to probe new physics and discriminate between
different models.
