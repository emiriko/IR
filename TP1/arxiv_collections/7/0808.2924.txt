The capacitance of arrays of vertical wrapped-gate InAs nanowires are
analyzed. With the help of a Poisson-Schr"odinger solver, information about the
doping density can be obtained directly. Further features in the measured
capacitance-voltage characteristics can be attributed to the presence of
surface states as well as the coexistence of electrons and holes in the wire.
For both scenarios, quantitative estimates are provided. It is furthermore
shown that the difference between the actual capacitance and the geometrical
limit is quite large, and depends strongly on the nanowire material.
