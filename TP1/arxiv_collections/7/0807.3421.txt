The standard model of the electroweak interaction describes beta-decay in the
well-known V-A form. Nevertheless, the most general Hamiltonian of a beta-decay
includes also other possible interaction types, e.g. scalar (S) and tensor (T)
contributions, which are not fully ruled out yet experimentally. The WITCH
experiment aims to study a possible admixture of these exotic interaction types
in nuclear beta-decay by a precise measurement of the shape of the recoil ion
energy spectrum. The experimental set-up couples a double Penning trap system
and a retardation spectrometer. The set-up is installed in ISOLDE/CERN and was
recently shown to be fully operational. The current status of the experiment is
presented together with the data acquired during the 2006 campaign, showing the
first recoil ion energy spectrum obtained. The data taking procedure and
corresponding data acquisition system are described in more detail. Several
further technical improvements are briefly reviewed.
