The photonuclear production of vector mesons in ultraperipheral heavy ion
collisions is investigated within the collinear approach using different
parameterizations for the nuclear gluon distribution. The integrated cross
section and the rapidity distribution for the $AA \to V AA$ ($V = J/\Psi,
\Upsilon$) process are computed for energies of RHIC and LHC. A comparison with
the recent PHENIX data on coherent production of $J/\Psi$ mesons is also
presented. We demonstrate that the study of the exclusive quarkonium
photoproduction can be used to constrain the nuclear effects in the gluon
distribution.
