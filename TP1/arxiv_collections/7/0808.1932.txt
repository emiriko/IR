The subject of heavy flavour decays as probes for physics at and beyond the
TeV scale is covered from the experimental perspective. Emphasis is placed on
the more traditional Beyond the Standard Model topics that have potential for
impact in the early LHC era, and in anticipation of the B factory upgrade(s).
The aim is to explain the physics, without getting too involved in the details,
whether experimental or theoretical, to give the interested nonexpert a
perspective on the Flavour/TeV link. We cover the forefront topics of $CP$
violation in $b\to s$ transitions involving penguin and box diagrams, and
probes of charged Higgs, right-handed and scalar interactions. We touch briefly
on $\Upsilon$ decay, $D^0$ mixing, rare $K$ decays, and lepton flavor violating
probes in $\tau$ decay. Our own phemonenology work is often used for
illustration.
