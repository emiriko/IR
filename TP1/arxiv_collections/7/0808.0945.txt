We study the sensitivity for testing the anomalous triple gauge couplings
$ZZ\gamma$ and $Z\gamma\gamma$ via the process $e^+e^-\to \nu \bar\nu \gamma$
at high energy linear colliders. For integrated luminosities of 500 $fb^{-1}$
and center of mass energies between 0.5 and 1.5 $TeV$, we find that this
process can provide tests of the triple neutral gauge boson couplings of order
$10^{-4}$, one order of magnitude lower than the standard model prediction.
