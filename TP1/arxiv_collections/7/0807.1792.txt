We compare and contrast the computations that lead to the NMSGUT spectra and
Yukawa couplings that appeared\cite{nmsgut} in 2006 and a recent recalculation
of the same\cite{malinsky}. We argue that an explicit component based method of
computation jeopardizes the power of SO(10) and its sub-groups to organize, in
a unified and automatically phase correlated way, computations of dynamics
beyond the basic mass matrix computation. The correct (one line) prescription
for generating MSSM Yukawas from SO(10) ones was given in \cite{ag2} and
requires no computation beyond the identification of null vectors of the Higgs
doublet mass matrix and the Clebsches given in \cite{ag1,ag2}. It was already
used to derive all fermion Yukawas and Majorana masses in \cite{ag2,nmsgut}. We
thus urge the adoption of a uniform notation and methodology based on descent
from SO(10) to the SM through the Pati-Salam maximal subgroup of SO(10) to
avoid Babel in this rapidly developing and highly promising subject.
