Anomalies are an infrared effect, but are often realized in effective
theories in a non-trivial way. We study the chiral anomaly in Soft Collinear
Effective Theory (SCET), where the anomaly equation has terms contributing at
different orders in the power expansion. The chiral anomaly equations in SCET
are computed up to NNLO in the power counting with external collinear and/or
ultrasoft gluons. We do this by expanding the QCD anomaly equation, using the
tree level (LO in \alpha_s) relations between QCD and SCET fields. The validity
of this correspondence between the anomaly equations is confirmed by direct
computation of the one-loop diagrams in SCET.
