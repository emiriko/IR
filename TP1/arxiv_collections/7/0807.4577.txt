Recently, the measurement of the polar Kerr effect (PKE) in the quasi
two-dimensional superconductor Sr2RuO4, which is motivated to observe the
chirality of px + i py-wave pairing, has been reported. We clarify that the PKE
has intrinsic and extrinsic (disorder-induced) origins. The extrinsic
contribution would be dominant in the PKE experiment.
