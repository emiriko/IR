We address the process of generation of the photon-number entangled states of
light in the stimulated nonlinear parametric down conversion process and build
the simple model describing the generation, not involving the traditional
parametric approximation. The motion equations for the system of pumping and
two-mode outgoing field are solved for the case of the strong correlation
between two modes, the evolution of the state parameters of the generated modes
is obtained. The solution is briefly analyzed for particular types of
photon-number entangled states.
