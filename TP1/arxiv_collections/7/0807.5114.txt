Recently, some papers in the literature have shown that, from a bimetric
theory of gravity, it is possible to produce massive gravitational waves which
generate a longitudinal component in a particular polarization of the wave.
After a review of previous works, in this paper the longitudinal response
function of interferometers for this particular polarization of the wave is
computed in two different gauges, showing the gauge invariance, and in its full
frequency dependence, with specific application to the Virgo and LIGO
interferometers.
