A argument is described for how deformed or doubly special relativity may
arise in the semiclassical limit of a quantum theory of gravity. We consider a
generic quantum theory of gravity coupled to matter, from which we use only the
assumption that a Hamiltonian constraint is imposed. We study circumstances in
which Lambda, G and hbar all may be separately neglected, but there may arise
terms in the ratio of particle energies to the Planck mass which are small but
measurable. Such cases include probes of an energy dependent speed of light
such as are possible in experiments such as MAGIC and GLAST. We show that in
such cases the leading order effect of quantum gravity will, if certain scaling
relations are satisfied, be to deform the metric in the effective Hamiltonian
of the matter quantum field theory by terms linear in energies. As the
Hamiltonian constraint has been imposed there can be no preferred time
coordinate or frame of reference, hence this is a modification rather than a
breaking of special relativity.
