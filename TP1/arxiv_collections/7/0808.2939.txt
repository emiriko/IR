We present an algorithm for the derivation of Dyson-Schwinger equations of
general theories that is suitable for an implementation within a symbolic
programming language. Moreover, we introduce the Mathematica package DoDSE
which provides such an implementation. It derives the Dyson-Schwinger equations
graphically once the interactions of the theory are specified. A few examples
for the application of both the algorithm and the DoDSE package are provided.
The package can be obtained from physik.uni-graz.at/~mah/DoDSE.html.
