The pressure--temperature phase diagram of CeRhIn_5 has been studied under
high magnetic field by resistivity measurements. Clear signatures of a quantum
critical point has been found at a critical pressure of p_c = 2.5 GPa. The
field induced magnetic state in the superconducting state is stable up to the
highest field. At p_c the antiferromagnetic ground-state under high magnetic
field collapses very rapidly. Clear signatures of p_c are the strong
enhancement of the resistivity in the normal state and of the inelastic
scattering term. No clear T2 temperature dependence could be found for
pressures above T_c. From the analysis of the upper critical field within a
strong coupling model we present the pressure dependence of the coupling
parameter lambda and the gyromagnetic ratio g. No signatures of a spatially
modulated order parameter could be evidenced. A detailed comparison with the
magnetic field--temperature phase diagram of CeCoIn_5 is given. The comparison
between CeRhIn_5 and CeCoIn_5 points out the importance to take into account
the field dependence of the effective mass in the calculation of the
superconducting upper critical field H_c2. It suggests also that when the
magnetic critical field H_(0) becomes lower than H_c2 (0)$, the persistence of
a superconducting pseudo-gap may stick the antiferromagnetism to H_c2 (0).
