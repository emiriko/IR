The Cerenkov radiation of a neutral particle with magnetic moment is
considered, as well as the spin-dependent contribution to the Cerenkov
radiation of a charged spinning particle. The corresponding radiation intensity
is obtained for an arbitrary value of spin and for an arbitrary spin
orientation with respect to velocity.
