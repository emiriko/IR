In this paper we investigate the encoding of operator quantum error
correcting codes i.e. subsystem codes. We show that encoding of subsystem codes
can be reduced to encoding of a related stabilizer code making it possible to
use all the known results on encoding of stabilizer codes. Along the way we
also show how Clifford codes can be encoded. We also show that gauge qubits can
be exploited to reduce the encoding complexity.
