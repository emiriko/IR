We study defect production in a quantum system subjected to a nonlinear power
law quench which takes it either through a quantum critical or multicritical
point or along a quantum critical line. We elaborate on our earlier work [D.
Sen, K. Sengupta, S. Mondal, \prl 101, 016806 (2008)] and present a detailed
analysis of the scaling of the defect density $n$ with the quench rate $\tau$
and exponent $\al$ for each of the above-mentioned cases. We also compute the
correlation functions for defects generated in nonlinear quenches through a
quantum critical point and discuss the dependence of the amplitudes of such
correlation functions on the exponent $\al$. We discuss several experimental
systems where these theoretical predictions can be tested.
