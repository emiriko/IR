We have performed x-ray photoemission spectroscopy on the system of
noncentrosymmetric superconductor, Li$_2$(Pd$_x$Pt$_{1-x}$3)B. For
Li$_2$Pt$_3$B, we found 2 major peaks with 2 other weak components, and the
band calculations were in agreement with the observation. The assignment of
valence band features using the calculated partial density of states determined
that Pt 5d and B 2p contribute to the density of states at the Fermi level. The
effect of antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling on the band structure might have
been probed, and the analysis on the effect of Pt incorporation into the system
indicates the smooth evolution of electronic structures. We presented the
measurements of core levels (Pd 3d, Pt 4f, and B 1s) and discussed the chemical
bonding states and electronic structures from them.
