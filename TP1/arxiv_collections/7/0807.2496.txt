Search auctions have become a dominant source of revenue generation on the
Internet. Such auctions have typically used per-click bidding and pricing. We
propose the use of hybrid auctions where an advertiser can make a
per-impression as well as a per-click bid, and the auctioneer then chooses one
of the two as the pricing mechanism. We assume that the advertiser and the
auctioneer both have separate beliefs (called priors) on the click-probability
of an advertisement. We first prove that the hybrid auction is truthful,
assuming that the advertisers are risk-neutral. We then show that this auction
is superior to the existing per-click auction in multiple ways: 1) It takes
into account the risk characteristics of the advertisers. 2) For obscure
keywords, the auctioneer is unlikely to have a very sharp prior on the
click-probabilities. In such situations, the hybrid auction can result in
significantly higher revenue. 3) An advertiser who believes that its
click-probability is much higher than the auctioneer's estimate can use
per-impression bids to correct the auctioneer's prior without incurring any
extra cost. 4) The hybrid auction can allow the advertiser and auctioneer to
implement complex dynamic programming strategies. As Internet commerce matures,
we need more sophisticated pricing models to exploit all the information held
by each of the participants. We believe that hybrid auctions could be an
important step in this direction.
