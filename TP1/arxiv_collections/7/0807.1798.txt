We report a way of wave function estimation for the density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) method applied to quantum systems, which has
2-site modulation, when the system size extension is necessary in both the
finite and the infinite algorithms. The estimation is performed by
renormalization group (RG) transformation applied to the ground state wave
function, which is represented as the matrix product. This RG scheme is known
as the product wave function renormalization group (PWFRG) method. In order to
treat the 2-site modulation, the operation of the RG transformation is shifted
by amount of 2 lattice sites. It turns out that this 2-site shift algorithm
provides better wave function estimation in the thermodynamic limit, compared
with the previously known PWFRG algorithm.
