Tse and Zdancewic have formalized the notion of noninterference for Abadi et
al.'s DCC in terms of logical relations and given a proof of noninterference by
reduction to parametricity of System F. Unfortunately, their proof contains
errors in a key lemma that their translation from DCC to System F preserves the
logical relations defined for both calculi. In fact, we have found a
counterexample for it. In this article, instead of DCC, we prove
noninterference for sealing calculus, a new variant of DCC, by reduction to the
basic lemma of a logical relation for the simply typed lambda-calculus, using a
fully complete translation to the simply typed lambda-calculus. Full
completeness plays an important role in showing preservation of the two logical
relations through the translation. Also, we investigate relationship among
sealing calculus, DCC, and an extension of DCC by Tse and Zdancewic and show
that the first and the last of the three are equivalent.
