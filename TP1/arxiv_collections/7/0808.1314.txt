The superfluid density near the superconducting transition is investigated in
the presence of spatial inhomogeneity in the critical temperature. Disorder is
accounted for by means of a random $T_c$ term in the conventional
Ginzburg-Landau action for the superconducting order parameter. Focusing on the
case where a low-density of randomly distributed planar defects are responsible
for the variation of $T_c$, we derive the lowest order correction to the
superfluid density in powers of the defect concentration. The correction is
calculated assuming a broad Gaussian distribution for the strengths of the
defect potentials. Our results are in a qualitative agreement with the
superfluid density measurements in the underdoped regime of high-quality YBCO
crystals by Broun and co-workers.
