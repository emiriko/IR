Pion-nucleus bremsstrahlung offers a possibility of measuring the structure
functions of pion-Compton scattering from a study of the
small-momentum-transfer region where the bremsstrahlung reaction is dominated
by the single-photon-exchange mechanism. The corresponding cross-section
distribution is characterized by a sharp peak at small momentum transfers. But
there is also a hadronic contribution which is smooth and constitutes an
undesired background. In this communication the modification of the
single-photon exchange amplitude by multiple-Coulomb scattering is investigated
as well as the Coulomb-nuclear interference term.
