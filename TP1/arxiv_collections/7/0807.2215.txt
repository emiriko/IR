We summarize recent progress in the theoretical description of
heavy-flavored-hadron inclusive production at next-to-leading order in the
general-mass variable-flavor-number scheme. Specifically, we discuss the
influence of finite-mass effects on the determination D-meson fragmentation
functions from a global fit to e^+e^- annihilation data and on the
transverse-momentum distribution of B-meson hadroproduction. We also
demonstrate that the fixed-flavor-number scheme, implemented with up-to-date
parton density functions and strong-coupling constant, provides a surprisingly
good description of B-meson data from run II at the Fermilab Tevatron.
