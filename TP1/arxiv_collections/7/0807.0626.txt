This paper deals with asymptotic expressions of the Mean Time To Failure
(MTTF) and higher moments for large, recursive, and non-repairable systems in
the context of two-terminal reliability. Our aim is to extend the well-known
results of the series and parallel cases. We first consider several exactly
solvable configurations of identical components with exponential failure-time
distribution functions to illustrate different (logarithmic or power-law)
behaviors as the size of the system, indexed by an integer n, increases. The
general case is then addressed: it provides a simple interpretation of the
origin of the power-law exponent and an efficient asymptotic expression for the
total reliability of large, recursive systems. Finally, we assess the influence
of the non-exponential character of the component reliability on the
n-dependence of the MTTF.
