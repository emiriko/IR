Bulk magnetization in Pr_{0.6}Ca_{0.4}MnO_3 thin films with tensile (SrTiO_3)
and compressive (LaAlO_3) substrate-induced strain is compared to the
magnetooptical Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements. In the absence of an external
magnetic field, in both films, a stable ferromagnetic insulating majority phase
coexists with an antiferromagnetic insulating phase below ~120K. MOKE
measurements indicate that at 5K a metastable ferromagnetic metallic (FM) phase
is formed at the surface of the stretched film in a magnetic field below 1.1T
already, while in the bulk the FM phase starts to form in the field above ~4T
in both films.
