We briefly review the concept and properties of the Thick GEM (THGEM); it is
a robust, high-gain gaseous electron multiplier, manufactured economically by
standard printed-circuit drilling and etching technology. Its operation and
structure resemble that of GEMs but with 5 to 20-fold expanded dimensions. The
millimeter-scale hole-size results in good electron transport and in large
avalanche-multiplication factors, e.g. reaching 10^7 in double-THGEM cascaded
single-photoelectron detectors. The multiplier's material, parameters and shape
can be application-tailored; it can operate practically in any counting gas,
including noble gases, over a pressure range spanning from 1 mbar to several
bars; its operation at cryogenic (LAr) conditions was recently demonstrated.
The high gain, sub-millimeter spatial resolution, high counting-rate
capability, good timing properties and the possibility of industrial production
capability of large-area robust detectors, pave ways towards a broad spectrum
of potential applications; some are discussed here in brief.
