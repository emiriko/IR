We study the g-factor of discrete electron states in InAs nanowire based
quantum dots. The g values are determined from the magnetic field splitting of
the zero bias anomaly due to the spin 1/2-Kondo effect. Unlike to previous
studies based on 2DEG quantum dots, the g-factors of neighboring electron
states show a surprisingly large fluctuation: g can scatter between 2 and 18.
Furthermore electric gate tunability of the g-factor is demonstrated.
