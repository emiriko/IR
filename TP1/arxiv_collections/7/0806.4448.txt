The purpose of this paper is to develop a synthesis theory for linear
dynamical quantum stochastic systems that are encountered in linear quantum
optics and in phenomenological models of linear quantum circuits. In
particular, such a theory will enable the systematic realization of
coherent/fully quantum linear stochastic controllers for quantum control,
amongst other potential applications. We show how general linear dynamical
quantum stochastic systems can be constructed by assembling an appropriate
interconnection of one degree of freedom open quantum harmonic oscillators and,
in the quantum optics setting, discuss how such a network of oscillators can be
approximately synthesized or implemented in a systematic way from some linear
and non-linear quantum optical elements. An example is also provided to
illustrate the theory.
