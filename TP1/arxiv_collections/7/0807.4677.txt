We report a temperature-dependent Raman scattering investigation of thin film
rare earth nickelates SmNiO3, NdNiO3 and Sm0.60Nd0.40NiO3, which present a
metal-to-insulator (MI) transition at TMI and an antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic
Neel transition at TN. Our results provide evidence that all investigated
samples present a structural phase transition at TMI but the Raman signature
across TMI is significantly different for NdNiO3 (TMI = TN) compared to SmNiO3
and Sm0.60Nd0.40NiO3 (TMI =/ TN). It is namely observed that the
paramagnetic-insulator phase (TN < T < TMI) in SmNiO3 and Sm0.60Nd0.40NiO3 is
characterized by a pronounced softening of one particular phonon band around
420 cm-1. This signature is unusual and points to an important and continuous
change in the distortion of NiO6 octahedra (thus the Ni-O bonding) which
stabilizes upon cooling at the magnetic transition. The observed behaviour
might well be a general feature for all rare earth nickelates with TMI =/ TN
and illustrates intriguing coupling mechanism in the TMI > T > TN regime.
