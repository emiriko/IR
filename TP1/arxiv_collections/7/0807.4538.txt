We report a comprehensive analysis of the ground state properties of
axisymmetric toroidal crystals based on the elastic theory of defects on curved
substrates. The ground state is analyzed as a function of the aspect ratio of
the torus, which provides a non-local measure of the underlying Gaussian
curvature, and the ratio of the defect core-energy to the Young modulus.
Several structural features are discussed,including a spectacular example of
curvature-driven amorphization in the limit of the aspect ratio approaching
one. The outcome of the elastic theory is then compared with the results of a
numerical study of a system of point-like particles constrained on the surface
of a torus and interacting via a short range potential.
