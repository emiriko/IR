Recently, it has been shown that large stacks of intrinsic Josephson
junctions in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 emit synchronous THz radiation, the synchronization
presumably triggered by a cavity resonance. To investigate this effect we use
Low Temperature Scanning Laser Microscopy to image electric field
distributions. Apart from verifying the appearance of cavity modes at low bias
we find that, in a high input power regime, standing-wave patterns are created
through interactions with a hot spot, possibly pointing to a new mode of
generating synchronized radiation in intrinsic Josephson junction stacks.
