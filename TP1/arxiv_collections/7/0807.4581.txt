Traditional sampling theories consider the problem of reconstructing an
unknown signal $x$ from a series of samples. A prevalent assumption which often
guarantees recovery from the given measurements is that $x$ lies in a known
subspace. Recently, there has been growing interest in nonlinear but structured
signal models, in which $x$ lies in a union of subspaces. In this paper we
develop a general framework for robust and efficient recovery of such signals
from a given set of samples. More specifically, we treat the case in which $x$
lies in a sum of $k$ subspaces, chosen from a larger set of $m$ possibilities.
The samples are modelled as inner products with an arbitrary set of sampling
functions. To derive an efficient and robust recovery algorithm, we show that
our problem can be formulated as that of recovering a block-sparse vector whose
non-zero elements appear in fixed blocks. We then propose a mixed
$\ell_2/\ell_1$ program for block sparse recovery. Our main result is an
equivalence condition under which the proposed convex algorithm is guaranteed
to recover the original signal. This result relies on the notion of block
restricted isometry property (RIP), which is a generalization of the standard
RIP used extensively in the context of compressed sensing. Based on RIP we also
prove stability of our approach in the presence of noise and modelling errors.
  A special case of our framework is that of recovering multiple measurement
vectors (MMV) that share a joint sparsity pattern. Adapting our results to this
context leads to new MMV recovery methods as well as equivalence conditions
under which the entire set can be determined efficiently.
