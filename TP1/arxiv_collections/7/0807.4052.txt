Two natural and widely used representations for the community structure of
networks are clusterings, which partition the vertex set into disjoint subsets,
and layouts, which assign the vertices to positions in a metric space. This
paper unifies prominent characterizations of layout quality and clustering
quality, by showing that energy models of pairwise attraction and repulsion
subsume Newman and Girvan's modularity measure. Layouts with optimal energy are
relaxations of, and are thus consistent with, clusterings with optimal
modularity, which is of practical relevance because both representations are
complementary and often used together.
