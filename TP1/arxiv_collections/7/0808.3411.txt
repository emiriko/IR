Galileo determined distances to stars based on the assumption that stars were
suns, the apparent sizes of stars as seen through his telescope, and basic
geometry. However, the apparent sizes that he measured were the result of
diffraction and not related to the actual sizes of the stars. Galileo's methods
and observations were good, but since he was unknowingly observing diffraction
artifacts and not the physical bodies of stars he greatly underestimated the
distances to the stars.
