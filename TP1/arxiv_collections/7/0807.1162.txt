ENUM is a DNS-based protocol standard for mapping E.164 telephone numbers to
Internet Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). It places unique requirements on
the existing DNS infrastructure, such as data scalability, query throughput,
response time, and database update rates. This paper measures and evaluates the
performance of existing name server implementation as ENUM servers. We compared
PowerDNS (PDNS), BIND and Navitas. Results show that BIND is not suitable for
ENUM due to its poor scaling property. Both PDNS and Navitas can serve ENUM.
However, Navitas turns out to be highly optimized and clearly outperforms PDNS
in all aspects we have tested. We also instrumented the PDNS server to identify
its performance bottleneck and investigated ways to improve it.
