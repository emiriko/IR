An unstable particle in quantum mechanics can be stabilized by frequent
measurements, known as the quantum Zeno effect. A soliton with dissipation
behaves like an unstable particle. Similar to the quantum Zeno effect, here we
show that the soliton can be stabilized by modulating periodically dispersion,
nonlinearity, or the external harmonic potential available in BEC. This can be
obtained by analyzing a Painleve integrability condition, which results from
the rigorous Painleve analysis of the generalized nonautonomous nonlinear
Schrodinger equation. The result has a profound implication to the optical
soliton transmission and the matter-wave soliton dynamics.
