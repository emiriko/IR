We use inelastic neutron scattering to measure the magnetic excitations in
the underdoped superconductor La2-xSrxCuO4 (x=0.085, Tc=22 K) over energy and
temperatures ranges 5 < E < 200 meV and 5 < T < 300 K respectively. At high
temperature (T = 300 K), we observe strongly damped excitations with a
characteristic energy scale of approximately 50 meV. As the temperature is
lowered to T = 30 K, and we move into the pseudogap state, the magnetic
excitations become highly structured in energy and momentum below about 60 meV.
This change appears to be associated with the development of the pseudogap in
the electronic excitations.
