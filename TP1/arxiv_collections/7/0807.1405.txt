We study the Andreev bound states in a Josephson junction between a singlet
and a triplet superconductors. Because of the mismatch in the spin symmetries
of pairing, the energies of the spin up and down quasiparticles are generally
different. This results in imbalance of spin populations and net spin
accumulation at the junction in equilibrium. This effect can be detected using
probes of local magnetic field, such as the scanning SQUID, Hall, and Kerr
probes. It may help to identify potential triplet pairing in $\rm(TMTSF)_2X$,
$\rm Sr_2RuO_4$, and oxypnictides.
