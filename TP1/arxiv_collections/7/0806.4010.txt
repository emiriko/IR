There is a natural sequence of CY manifolds that are double covers of the
projective g dimensional spaces ramified over 2g+2 hyperplanes. We observe that
some of them are obtained as quotient of the action of the semi-direct product
of g-1 copies of cyclic Z/2Z groups with the symmetric g group on the product
of g-copies of hyper-elliptic curves of genus g. The quotient is a double cover
of the projective g space ramified over 2g+2 hyperplanes. This construction
generalizes the construction of a Kummer surface. The Kodaira-Spencer classes
on the Jacobian are invariant under the action of the group. Thus they form a
basis of Kodaira-Spencer classes on the CY manifold. Since the bracket of any
Kodaira-Spencer classes on the Jacobian are zero, then they will be zero on the
CY manifold. This implies that the moduli space of those CY manifolds is a
locally symmetric space.
