In the last few years a number of works reported the appearance of thick
branes with internal structure, induced by the parameter which controls the
interaction between two scalar fields coupled to gravity in (4,1) dimensions in
warped space-time with one extra dimension. Here we show that one can implement
the control over the brane thickness without needing to change the potential
parameter. On the contrary, this is going to be done by means of the variation
of a parameter associated to the domain wall degeneracy. We also report the
existence of novel and qualitatively different solutions for a critical value
of the degeneracy parameter, which could be called critical Bloch branes.
