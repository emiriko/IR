A simple method for differentiating two similar accelerator-based black hole
creation mechanisms -- compactified extra dimensions and unparticle-enhanced
gravity -- is discussed, in light of several properties of black hole
thermodynamics. The real-valued scaling dimension $\du$ will induce
interactions that mimic those in a universe with $(2\du-2)$-extra spatial
dimensions, and thus provides an alternative mechanism for black hole creation
at the LHC within the confines of standard 4D general relativity. This results
in mass-dependent Hawking temperature profiles that depend primarily on $\du$,
yielding an evaporation signature unique to the framework. Specifically, a
precision reconstruction of the Hawking temperature spectrum morphology for
black holes of mass $\Mbh$ yields conclusive evidence of one mechanism over the
other, due to the presence of additional adjustable parameters in the
unparticle sector.
