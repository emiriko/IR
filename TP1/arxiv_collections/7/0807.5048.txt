Observation of surface-plasmon phenomena that are dependent upon the
handedness of the circularly polarized incident light (spin) is presented. The
polarization-dependent near-field intensity distribution obtained in our
experiment is attributed to the presence of a geometric phase arising from the
interaction of light with an anisotropic and inhomogeneous nanoscale structure.
A near-field vortex surface mode with a spin-dependent topological charge was
obtained in a plasmonic microcavity. The remarkable phenomenon of
polarization-sensitive focusing in a plasmonic structure was also demonstrated.
