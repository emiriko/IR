We consider random systems of equations over the reals, with $m$ equations
and $m$ unknowns $P_i(t)+X_i(t)=0$, $t\in\mathbb{R}^m$, $i=1,...,m$, where the
$P_i$'s are non-random polynomials having degrees $d_i$'s (the "signal") and
the $X_i$'s (the "noise") are independent real-valued Gaussian centered random
polynomial fields defined on $\mathbb{R}^m$, with a probability law satisfying
some invariance properties. For each $i$, $P_i$ and $X_i$ have degree $d_i$.
The problem is the behavior of the number of roots for large $m$. We prove that
under specified conditions on the relation signal over noise, which imply that
in a certain sense this relation is neither too large nor too small, it follows
that the quotient between the expected value of the number of roots of the
perturbed system and the expected value corresponding to the centered system
(i.e., $P_i$ identically zero for all $i=1,...,m$), tends to zero geometrically
fast as $m$ tends to infinity. In particular, this means that the behavior of
this expected value is governed by the noise part.
