A simple, non-invasive method using Raman spectroscopy for the estimation of
the thickness of graphene layers grown epitaxially on silicon carbide (SiC) is
presented, enabling simultaneous determination of thickness, grain size and
disorder using the spectra. The attenuation of the substrate Raman signal due
to the graphene overlayer is found to be dependent on the graphene film
thickness deduced from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission
electron microscopy of the surfaces. We explain this dependence using an
absorbing overlayer model. This method can be used for mapping graphene
thickness over a region and is capable of estimating thickness of multilayer
graphene films beyond that possible by XPS and Auger electron spectroscopy
(AES).
