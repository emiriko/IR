Experimental and theoretical studies of all-optical spin pump and probe of
resident electrons in CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te semiconductor quantum wells are reported.
A two-color Hanle-MOKE technique (based on continuous-wave excitation) and
time-resolved Kerr rotation in the regime of resonant spin amplification (based
on pulsed excitation) provide a complementary measure of electron spin
relaxation time. Influence of electron localization on long-lived spin
coherence is examined by means of spectral and temperature dependencies.
Various scenarios of spin polarization generation (via the trion and exciton
states) are analyzed and difference between continuous-wave and pulsed
excitations is considered. Effects related to inhomogeneous distribution of
$g$-factor and anisotropic spin relaxation time on measured quantities are
discussed.
