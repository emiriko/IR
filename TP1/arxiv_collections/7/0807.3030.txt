We consider an unusual singular position=dependent-mass particle in an
infinite potential well. The corresponding Hamiltonian is mapped through a
point-canonical-transformation and an explicit correspondence between the
target Hamiltonian and a Poschl-Teller type reference Hamiltonian is obtained.
New ordering ambiguity parametric setting are suggested.
