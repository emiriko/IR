We report on a search for CP asymmetry in the singly Cabibbo-suppressed decay
D+ -> K+ K- pi+ using a data sample of 818 pb-1 accumulated with the CLEO-c
detector on the psi(3770) resonance. A Dalitz-plot analysis is used to
determine the amplitudes of the intermediate states. We find no evidence for CP
violation either in specific two-body amplitudes or integrated over the entire
phase space. The CP asymmetry in the latter case is measured to be
(-0.03+-0.84+-0.29)%.
