We show that the classical de Finetti theorem has a canonical noncommutative
counterpart if we strengthen `exchangeability' (i.e., invariance of the joint
distribution of the random variables under the action of the permutation group)
to invariance under the action of the quantum permutation group. More
precisely, for an infinite sequence of noncommutative random variables, we
prove that invariance of their joint distribution under quantum permutations is
equivalent to the fact that the random variables are identically distributed
and free with respect to the conditional expectation onto their tail algebra.
