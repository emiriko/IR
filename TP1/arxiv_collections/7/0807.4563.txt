We determine the phase-diagram of a one-dimensional system of hard-core
lattice bosons interacting via repulsive three-body interactions by analytic
methods and extensive quantum Monte-Carlo simulations. Such three-body
interactions can be derived from a microscopic theory for polar molecules
trapped in an optical lattice. Depending on the strength of the interactions
and the particle density, we find superfluid and solid phases, the latter
appearing at an unconventional filling of the lattice and displaying a
coexistence of charge-density-wave and bond orders.
