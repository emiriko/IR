The interactions and even the number of the Higgs scalar fields are not fixed
in the SU(2)U(1) standard model of the electro-weak interactions and the
intrinsically chiral nature of the weak interactions is not explained.
Embedding SU(2)U(1) into the Lie super-algebra SU(2/1) fills these gaps. The 2
smallest representations of SU(2/1) adequately describe the electron, neutrino,
up and down quarks and correlate their chiralities with their U(1) charges, and
the Higgs fields have the quantum numbers of the odd generators. But so far,
there was an apparent conflict with unitarity, because the quark representation
is not Hermitian and the super-Killing metric is not positive definite. We
solve this paradox by assuming the existence of 2 complex Higgs doublets
minimally coupled to the Fermions via the chiral projections of the odd
generators of SU(2/1). We find that Lagrangian induced by the Fermion loops is
unitary, thanks to the balance between the leptons and the quarks needed to
cancel the triangle anomaly and that the super-Jacobi identity guarantees that
the photon remains massless after symmetry breaking. In addition, the
Lagrangian has a classical geometric interpretation in terms of the curvature
of the corresponding Hermitian algebra. Assuming that the relative strength of
the scalar and vector couplings does not depend on the number of families
constrains the mass of the Higgs to $M^2_{H^0_1} + M^2_{H^0_2} = 32/9 M^2_W = 2
(107.2 GeV)^2$. Contrary to grand-unified or Wess-Zumino super-symmetric
models, the SU(2/1) internal super-unification does not predict any unobserved
particle besides the 2 Higgs doublets.
