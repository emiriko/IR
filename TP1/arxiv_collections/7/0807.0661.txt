Due to the stochastic nature of departure operations, working at full
capacity makes major US airports very sensitive to uncertainties. Consequently,
airport ground operations face critically congested taxiways and long runway
queues. In this report, we show how improved management of departure operations
from the ready-to-push-back time to the wheels-off time can potentially yield
significant benefits to airlines and air traffic services. We develop a
Collaborative Virtual Queue to enable better optimization capabilities during
congested situations while taking into account the laissez-faire competitive
environment. Results are evaluated using a departure system model, validated
using current statistics and previous studies. First, the Collaborative Virtual
Queue enables keeping aircraft away from runway queues, which increases
wheels-off time predictability. Second, holding aircraft enables last-minute
intra-airline flight switching. This creates new optimization capabilities for
airlines i.e. it gives airlines the flexibility to prioritize their flight
sequence in real-time. These capabilities are illustrated by the trade-off
between minimizing the average passenger waiting time and minimizing the level
of unfairness between aircraft of the same airline. For instance, airlines
could choose to decrease by up to 15% their average passenger waiting time by
prioritizing heavy planes over small planes when the taxiway system is
congested.
