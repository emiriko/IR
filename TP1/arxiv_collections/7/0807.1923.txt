We present the phase diagram of the frustrated ferromagnetic S=1/2 Heisenberg
J_1-J_2 chain in a magnetic field, obtained by large scale exact
diagonalizations and density matrix renormalization group simulations. A vector
chirally ordered state, metamagnetic behavior and a sequence of spin-multipolar
Luttinger liquid phases up to hexadecupolar kind are found. We provide
numerical evidence for a locking mechanism, which can drive spiral states
towards spin-multipolar phases, such as quadrupolar or octupolar phases. Our
results also shed light on previously discovered spin-multipolar phases in
two-dimensional $S=1/2$ quantum magnets in a magnetic field.
