We explore the energy spectrum of a non-relativistic particle bound in a
linear finite range, attractive potential, envisaged as a quark-confining
potential. The intricate transcendental eigenvalue equation is solved
numerically to obtain the explicit eigen-energies. The linear potential, which
resembles the triangular well, has potential significance in particle physics
and exciting applications in electronics.
