Electron's tunneling through potential barrier in monolayer and bilayer
graphene lattices is investigated by using full tight-binding model. Emphasis
is placed on the resonance tunneling feature and inter-valley scattering
probability. It is shown that normal incidence transmission probabilities for
monolayer and bilayer graphene exhibit different properties. Our calculation
indicates that valleytronics in graphene systems may be detected, generated and
controlled by changing the structure parameters of the external electric
potential.
