We study the holographic dark energy model in a generalized scalar tensor
theory. In a universe filled with cold dark matter and dark energy, the effect
of potential of the scalar field is investigated in the equation of state
parameter. We show that for a various types of potentials, the equation of
state parameter is negative and transition from deceleration to acceleration
expansion of the universe is possible.
