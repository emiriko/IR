In this work we investigate the contribution to B(d,s) mixing from both
scalar and vector unparticles in a number of scenarios. The emphasis of this
work is to show the impact of the recently discovered 3 sigma evidence for new
physics found in the CP phase of B(s) mixing. Here we show that the inclusion
of the CP phase constraints for both B(d) and B(s) mixing improves the bounds
set on the unparticle couplings by a factor of 2~4, and one particular scenario
of scalar unparticles is found to be excluded by the 3 sigma measurement of
phi(s).
