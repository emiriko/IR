In this paper, I present almost my works performed during my time at VNU. I
was interested in the composite Skyrme model proposed by H. Y. Cheung and F.
Gursey. The expanding for this model based on results obtained from the
original Skyrme model given by T. H. R. Skyrme in 1961 was general and
interesting.
