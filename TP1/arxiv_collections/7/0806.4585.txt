We examine CP violation in the Delta S=0 decays tau -> omega pi nu_tau and
tau -> a_1 pi nu_tau and the Delta S=1 decay tau -> K pi pi nu_tau. We assume
that the new physics is a charged Higgs. We show that sizeable CP-violating
effects are possible in tau -> a_1 pi nu_tau (polarization-dependent rate
asymmetry) and tau -> omega pi nu_ tau (triple-product asymmetry). The Delta
S=1 decay tau -> K pi pi nu_tau can proceed via several resonances. We
construct two modified rate asymmetries and a triple product asymmetry for this
decay and discuss the potential sensitivities of these asymmetries.
