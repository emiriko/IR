We derive a Hamiltonian for a two-leg ladder which includes an arbitrary
number of charge and spin interactions. To illustrate this Hamiltonian we
consider two examples and use a renormalization group technique to evaluate the
ground state phases. The first example is a two-leg ladder with zigzagged legs.
We find that increasing the number of interactions in such a two-leg ladder may
result in a richer phase diagram, particularly at half-filling where a few
exotic phases are possible when the number of interactions are large and the
angle of the zigzag is small. In the second example we determine under which
conditions a two-leg ladder at quarter-filling is able to support a
Tomanaga-Luttinger liquid phase. We show that this is only possible when the
spin interactions across the rungs are ferromagnetic. In both examples we focus
on lithium purple bronze, a two-leg ladder with zigzagged legs which is though
to support a Tomanaga-Luttinger liquid phase.
