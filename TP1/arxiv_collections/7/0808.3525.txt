In this paper, we present a new formulation of Lorentz transformations using
a metric that quantifies the space expansion. As a consequence, we sort out
that the limiting velocity of moving bodies is decreasing together with the
space expansion. A new adjustment of relativistic laws is added to incorporate
the non static nature of space-time. The conservation of the physical laws at
each step of the quantified expansion allows the obtaining of new formalisms
for the physical laws, in particular when an object starts moving under any
force, its total energy, momentum and mass are directly affected by the
expansion of the space. An example of inelastic collision is studied and
several conclusions derived, specially the example of fission of atoms leads to
clear correlation between liberated energy and universe expansion, it turns out
that the liberated energy is increasing together with the universe expansion.
