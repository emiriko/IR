In the context of A_4 symmetry, neutrino tribimaximal mixing is achieved
through the breaking of A_4 to Z_3 (Z_2) in the charged-lepton (neutrino)
sector respectively. The implied vacuum misalignment of the (1,1,1) and (1,0,0)
directions in A_4 space is a difficult technical problem, and cannot be treated
without many auxiliary fields and symmetries (and perhaps extra dimensions). It
is pointed out here that an alternative scenario exists with A_4 alone and no
redundant fields, if neutrino masses are "scotogenic", i.e. radiatively induced
by dark scalar doublets as recently proposed.
