We report on a study of neutron-rich nuclei around doubly magic 132Sn in
terms of the shell model employing a realistic effective interaction derived
from the CD-Bonn nucleon-nucleon potential. The short-range repulsion of the
bare potential is renormalized by constructing a low-momentum potential,
V-low-k, that is used directly as input for the calculation of the effective
interaction. We present results for the four nuclei beyond the N=82 shell
closure 134Sn, 134Sb, 136Sb, and 136Te. Comparison shows that our results are
in very good agreement with the experimental data presently available for these
exotic nuclei. We also present our predictions of the hitherto unknown spectrum
of 136Sn.
