We investigate theoretically transport properties of one- and two-dimensional
regular Josephson junction arrays (JJAs) in an insulating state. We derive the
low-temperature current-voltage characteristics for the current mediated by the
Cooper pair transfer across the system. In the case where the screening length
associated with the capacitance of the islands to the ground is much larger
than the island's size, we find that transport is governed by the macroscopic
Coulomb blockade effect with the gap well exceeding a single island charging
energy. In the limit when the screening length is much larger than the linear
size of the array, the gap establishes the dependence on the array size,
namely, the Coulomb gap grows linearly with the system size in 1D and grows as
logarithm of the system size in the two-dimensional array. We find two
transport regimes: At moderate temperatures, above the BKT-like charge
binding-unbinding transition the low bias transport is thermally activated, the
activation energy being equal to the Coulomb blockade energy. At low
temperatures, below the binding-unbinding transition, a JJA falls into a
superinsulating state with the resistance exhibiting a double-exponential
temperature dependence.
