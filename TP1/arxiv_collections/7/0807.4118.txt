We report the properties of the prompt dipole radiation, produced via a
collective bremsstrahlung mechanism, in fusion reactions with exotic beams. We
show that the gamma yield is sensitive to the density dependence of the
symmetry energy below/around saturation. Moreover we find that the angular
distribution of the emitted photons from such fast collective mode can
represent a sensitive probe of its excitation mechanism and of fusion dynamics
in the entrance channel.
