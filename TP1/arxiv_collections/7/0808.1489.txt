Experimental results on microwave-induced magnetoresistance oscillation in
two-dimensional electron systems show a similar behavior of these systems
regarding temperature and microwave frequency. It is found that these
oscillations tend to quench when frequency or temperature increase, approaching
magnetoresistance to the response of the dark system. In this work we show that
this experimental behavior can be addressed on the same theoretical basis.
Microwave radiation forces the electron orbits to move back and forth being
damped by interaction with the lattice. We show that this damping depends
dramatically on microwave frequency and also on temperature. An increase in
frequency or temperature gives rise to an increase in the lattice damping
producing eventually a quenching effect in the magnetoresistance oscillations.
