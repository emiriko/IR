The asymptotic behaviour of the work probability distribution in driven
non-equilibrium systems is determined using the method of optimal fluctuations.
For systems described by Langevin dynamics the corresponding Euler-Lagrange
equation together with the appropriate boundary conditions and an equation for
the leading pre-exponential factor are derived. The method is applied to three
representative examples and the results are used to improve the accuracy of
free energy estimates based on the application of the Jarzynski equation.
