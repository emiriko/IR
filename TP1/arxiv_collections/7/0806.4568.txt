We suggest a method of entangling significantly the distant ends of a spin
chain using minimal control. This entanglement between distant individual spins
is brought about solely by exploiting the dynamics of an initial mixed state
with Neel order if the lattice features nearest-neighbor XXZ interaction. There
is no need to control single spins or to have engineered couplings or to pulse
globally. The method only requires an initial nonadiabatic switch (a quench)
between two Hamiltonians followed by an evolution under the second Hamiltonian.
The scheme is robust to randomness of the couplings as well as the finiteness
of an appropriate quench and could potentially be implemented in various
experimental setups, ranging from atoms in optical lattices to
Josephson-junction arrays.
