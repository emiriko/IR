The laser alignment system of the ZEUS microvertex detector is described. The
detector was installed in 2001 as part of an upgrade programme in preparation
for the second phase of electron-proton physics at the HERA collider. The
alignment system monitors the position of the vertex detector support structure
with respect to the central tracking detector using semi-transparent
amorphous-silicon sensors and diode lasers. The system is fully integrated into
the general environmental monitoring of the ZEUS detector and data has been
collected over a period of 5 years. The primary aim of defining periods of
stability for track-based alignment has been achieved and the system is able to
measure movements of the support structure to a precision around $10 \mu$m.
