We theoretically investigate the effect of an anisotropic trap on the
instability of the polar $(m_F=0)$ phase of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate.
By considering rigorously the spatial quantization, we show that the growth of
the nascent ferromagnetic phase at short times becomes anisotropic with
stronger oscillations in the magnetization correlation function along the
unconfined direction.
