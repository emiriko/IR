By assuming a more realistic nucleation and polarization reversal scenario we
build a new statistical switching model for ferroelectrics, which is different
from either the Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi (KAI) model or the
Nucleation-Limited-Switching (NLS) model. After incorporating a time-dependent
depolarization field this model gives a good description about the retardation
behavior in polycrystalline thin films at medium or low fields, which can not
be described by the traditional KAI model. This model predicts correctly n=1
for polycrystalline thin films at high Eappl or ceramic bulks in the ideal
case.
