A new analytically and numerically manageable model collision operator is
developed specifically for turbulence simulations. The like-particle collision
operator includes both pitch-angle scattering and energy diffusion and
satisfies the physical constraints required for collision operators: it
conserves particles, momentum and energy, obeys Boltzmann's H-theorem
(collisions cannot decrease entropy), vanishes on a Maxwellian, and efficiently
dissipates small-scale structure in the velocity space. The process of
transforming this collision operator into the gyroaveraged form for use in
gyrokinetic simulations is detailed. The gyroaveraged model operator is shown
to have more suitable behavior at small scales in phase space than previously
suggested models. A model operator for electron-ion collisions is also
presented.
