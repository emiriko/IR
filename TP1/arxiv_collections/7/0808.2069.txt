We consider $d>4$-dimensional space-times which are asymptotically flat at
spatial infinity and show that, in the first order framework, the action
principle is well-defined \emph{without the need of infinite counter terms.} It
naturally leads to a covariant phase space in which the Hamiltonians generating
asymptotic symmetries provide the total energy-momentum and angular momentum of
the isolated system. This work runs parallel to our previous analysis in four
dimensions \cite{aes}. The higher dimensional analysis is in fact simpler
because of absence of logarithmic and super translation ambiguities.
