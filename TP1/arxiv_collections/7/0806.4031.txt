We provide a family of representations of GL(2n) over a p-adic field that
admit a non-vanishing linear functional invariant under the symplectic group
(i.e. representations that are Sp(2n)- distinguished). While our result
generalizes a result of M. Heumos and S. Rallis our methods, unlike their
purely local technique, re- lies on the theory of automorphic forms. The
results of this paper together with later works by the authors imply that the
family of representations studied in this paper contains all irreducible,
unitary representations of the general linear group that are distin- guished by
the symplectic group.
