We present the results of searches for non-standard model phenomena, with
focus on signature-based searches and searches driven by non-supersymmetry
(non-SUSY) models. The analyses use 1.0--2.5 fb-1 of data from ppbar collisions
at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV collected with the CDF and D0 detectors at the Fermilab
Tevatron. No significant excess in data has been observed. We report on the
event counts, kinematic distributions, and limits on selected model parameters.
