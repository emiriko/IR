In this paper it has been shown that a simple functional form of
$\omega(\phi)$ in a generalised scalar tensor theory can drive the present
cosmic acceleration without any quintessence field or the cosmological constant
$\Lambda$. Furthermore, it ensures a smooth transition from a decelerated to an
accelerated phase of expansion in the matter dominated regime.
