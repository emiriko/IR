Many physically interesting models show a quantum phase transition when a
single parameter is varied through a critical point, where the ground state and
the first excited state become degenerate. When this parameter appears as a
coupling constant, these models can be understood as straight-line
interpolations between different Hamiltonians $H_{\rm I}$ and $H_{\rm F}$. For
finite-size realizations however, there will usually be a finite energy gap
between ground and first excited state. By slowly changing the coupling
constant through the point with the minimum energy gap one thereby has an
adiabatic algorithm that prepares the ground state of $H_{\rm F}$ from the
ground state of $H_{\rm I}$. The adiabatic theorem implies that in order to
obtain a good preparation fidelity the runtime $\tau$ should scale with the
inverse energy gap and thereby also with the system size. In addition, for open
quantum systems not only non-adiabatic but also thermal excitations are likely
to occur. It is shown that -- using only local Hamiltonians -- for the 1d
quantum Ising model and the cluster model in a transverse field the
conventional straight line path can be replaced by a series of straight-line
interpolations, along which the fundamental energy gap is always greater than a
constant independent on the system size. The results are of interest for
adiabatic quantum computation since strong similarities between adiabatic
quantum algorithms and quantum phase transitions exist.
