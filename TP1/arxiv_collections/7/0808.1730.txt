In this work we propose a probabilistic method which allows an unambiguous
modification of two non-orthogonal quantum states. We experimentally implement
this protocol by using two-photon polarization states generated in the process
of spontaneous parametric down conversion. In the experiment, for codifying
initial quantum states, we consider single photon states and heralded
detection. We show that the application of this protocol to entangled states,
it allows a fine control of the amount of entanglement of the initial state.
