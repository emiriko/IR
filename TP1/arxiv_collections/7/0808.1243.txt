We study pion in the holographic model of Hirn and Sanz which contains two
Yang-Mills fields defined in the background of the sliced AdS space. The
infrared boundary conditions imposed on these fields generate the spontaneous
breaking of the chiral symmetry down to its vector subgroup. Within the
framework of this model, we get an analytic expression for the pion form factor
and a compact result for its radius. We also extend the holographic model to
include Chern-Simons term which is required to reproduce the appropriate axial
anomaly of QCD. As a result, we calculate the anomalous form factor of the pion
and predict its Q^2-slope for the kinematics when one of the photons is almost
on-shell. We also observe that the anomalous form factor with one real and one
virtual photon is given by the same analytic expression as the electromagnetic
form factor of a charged pion. One of the advantages of the present model is
that it does not require an infrared boundary counterterm to correctly
reproduce the anomaly of QCD.
