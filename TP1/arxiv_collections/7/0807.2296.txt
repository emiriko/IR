Sm{0.5-x}Pr{x}Sr{0.5}MnO{3} exhibits variety of ground states as x is varied
from 0 to 0.5. At an intermediate doping of x = 0.3 a charge-ordered CE type
antiferromagnetic insulating (AFI) ground state is seen. The transition to this
ground state is from a paramagnetic insulating (PMI) phase through a
ferromagnetic metallic phase (FMM). Local structures in PMI and AFI phases of x
= 0.3 sample have been investigated using Pr K-edge and Sm K-edge Extended
X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS). It can be seen that the tilting and
rotation of the MnO6 octahedra about the b-axis are responsible for the charge
ordered CE-type antiferromagnetic ground state at low temperatures. In addition
a shift in the position of the rare earth ion along the c-axis has to be
considered to account for observed distribution of bond distances around the
rare earth ion.
