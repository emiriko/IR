Barash has calculated the Casimir forces between parallel birefringent plates
with optical axes parallel to the plate boundaries [Izv. Vyssh. Uchebn.\
Zaved., Radiofiz., {\bf 12}, 1637 (1978)]. The interesting new feature of the
solution compared to the case of isotropic plates is the existence of a Casimir
torque which acts to line up the optical axes if they are not parallel or
perpendicular. The forces were found from a calculation of the Helmholtz free
energy of the electromagnetic field. Given the length of the calculations in
this problem and hopes of an experimental measurement of the torque, it is
important to check the results for the Casimir forces by a different method. We
provide this check by calculating the electromagnetic stress tensor between the
plates and showing that the resulting forces are in agreement with those found
by Barash.
