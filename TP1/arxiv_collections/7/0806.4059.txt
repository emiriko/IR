We have investigated the gravitational lensing by two wormholes, viz.,
Janis-Newman-Winnicour (JNW) wormhole and Ellis wormhole. The deflection angle
in the strong field limit is calculated and various lens parameters of two
wormholes are compared. It is shown that the JNW wormhole exhibits the
relativistic images, while the Ellis wormhole does not have any relativistic
images due to the absence of its photon sphere.
