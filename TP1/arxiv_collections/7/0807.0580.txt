We derive an one-parameter family of consistence conditions to braneworlds in
the Brans-Dicke gravity. The sum rules are constructed in a completely general
frame and they reproduce the conditions already obtained in General Relativity
theory just by using a right limit of the Brans-Dicke parameter.
