We shall prove here that conservation laws from Holst's Lagrangian, often
used in LQG, do not agree with the corresponding conservation laws in standard
GR. Nevertheless, these differences vanish on-shell, i.e. along solutions, so
that they eventually define the same classical conserved quantities.
Accordingly, they define in particular the same entropy of solutions, and the
standard law S=A/4 is reproduced for systems described by Holst's Lagragian.
This provides the classical support to the computation usually done in LQG for
the entropy of black holes which is in turn used to fix the Barbero-Immirzi
parameter.
