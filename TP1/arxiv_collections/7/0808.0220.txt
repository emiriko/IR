This is the first report, to our knowledge, on a systematic method for
constructing a large scale kinetic metabolic model with incomplete information
on kinetic parametersr, and its initial application to the modeling of central
metabolism of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, a methylotrophic and
environmental important bacterium, with all necessary constraints. Through a
systematic and consistent procedure of finding a set of parameters in the
physiological range we overcome an outstanding difficulty in large scale
kinetic modeling: the requirement for a massive number of enzymatic reaction
parameters. We are able to construct the kinetic model based on general
biological considerations and incomplete experimental kinetic parameters. The
success of our approach with incompletely input information is guaranteed by
two known principles in biology, the robustness of the system and the
cooperation among its various parts. (Will be pleased to be informed on other
methodologies dealing with same type of problems: aoping@u.washington.edu)
