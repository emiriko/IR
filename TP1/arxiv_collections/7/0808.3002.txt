A stress-induced stripe phase of submonolayer Pd on W(110) is observed by
low-energy electron microscopy. The temperature dependence of the pattern is
explained by the change both in the boundary free energy and elastic relaxation
energy due to the increasing boundary width. The stripes are shown to disorder
when the correlation length of the condensed phase becomes comparable to its
period, while the condensate to lattice-gas transition takes place at a higher
temperature, as revealed by low-energy electron diffraction.
