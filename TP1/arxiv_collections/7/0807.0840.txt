We investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of a lattice of coupled chaotic
maps whose coupling connections are dynamically rewired to random sites with
probability p, namely at any instance of time, with probability p a regular
link is switched to a random one. In a range of weak coupling, where
spatiotemporal chaos exists for regular lattices (i.e. for p = 0), we find that
p > 0 yields synchronized periodic orbits. Further we observe that this
regularity occurs over a window of p values, beyond which the basin of
attraction of the synchronized cycle shrinks to zero. Thus we have evidence of
an optimal range of randomness in coupling connections, where spatiotemporal
regularity is efficiently obtained. This is in contrast to the commonly
observed monotonic increase of synchronization with increasing p, as seen for
instance, in the strong coupling regime of the very same system.
