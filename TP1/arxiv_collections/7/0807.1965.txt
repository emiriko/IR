A cosmological model where a fermion field is non-minimally coupled with the
gravitational field is studied. By applying Noether symmetry the possible
functions for the potential density of the fermion field and for the coupling
are determined. Cosmological solutions are found showing that the non-minimally
coupled fermion field behaves as an inflaton describing an accelerated
inflationary scenario, whereas the minimally coupled fermion field describes a
decelerated period being identified as dark matter.
