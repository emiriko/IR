The recently developed linear combination of atomic potentials (LCAP)
approach [M.Wang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 128, 3228 (2006)] allows continuous
optimization in discrete chemical space and thus is quite useful in the design
of molecules for targeted properties. To address further challenges arising
from the rugged, continuous property surfaces in the LCAP approach, we develop
a gradient-directed Monte Carlo (GDMC) strategy as an augmentation to the
original LCAP optimization method. The GDMC method retains the power of
exploring molecular space by utilizing local gradient information computed from
the LCAP approach to jump between discrete molecular structures. It also allows
random Monte Carlo moves to overcome barriers between local optima on property
surfaces. The combined GDMC and LCAP approach is demonstrated here for
optimizing nonlinear optical (NLO) properties in a class of donor-acceptor
substituted benzene and porphyrin frameworks. Specifically, one molecule with
four nitrogen atoms in the porphyrin ring was found to have a larger first
hyperpolarizability than structures with the conventional porphyrin motif. 1
