The resonance production of new chiral spin-1 excited bosons, Z*, and their
detection through the Drell-Yan process in the first physical runs at the CERN
LHC are considered. The new neutral chiral bosons can be observed as a
Breit-Wigner resonance peaks in the invariant dilepton mass distribution in the
same way as the well-known hypothetical gauge bosons, Z'. However, unique new
signatures of the chiral bosons exist. These signatures could be very important
for the interpretation of the first LHC data. First, there is no Jacobian peak
in the lepton transverse momentum distribution at the kinematical endpoint of
the new resonance. Second, the lepton angular distribution in the Collins-Soper
frame for the high on-peak invariant masses of the lepton pairs has a peculiar
"swallowtail" shape.
