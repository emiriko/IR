We propose a scheme with dc-control of finite bandwidth to implement
two-qubit gate for superconducting flux qubits at the optimal point. We provide
a detailed non-perturbative analysis on the dynamic evolution of the qubits
interacting with a common quantum bus. An effective qubit-qubit coupling is
induced while decoupling the quantum bus with proposed pulse sequences. The
two-qubit gate is insensitive to the initial state of the quantum bus and
applicable to non-perturbative coupling regime which enables rapid two-qubit
operation. This scheme can be scaled up to multi-qubit coupling.
