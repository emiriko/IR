A cosmological model of an holographic dark energy interacting with dark
matter throughout a decaying term of the form $Q=3(\lambda_1\rho_{DE} +
\lambda_2\rho_m) H$ is investigated. General constraint on the parameters of
the model are found when accelerated expansion is imposed and we found a
phantom scenarios, without any reference to a specific equation of state for
the dark energy. The behavior of equation of stated for dark energy is also
discussed.
