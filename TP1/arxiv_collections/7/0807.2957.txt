We report a first principles analysis of electronic transport characteristics
for (n,n) carbon nanotube bundles. When n is not a multiple of 3, inter-tube
coupling causes universal conductance suppression near Fermi level regardless
of the rotational arrangement of individual tubes. However, when n is a
multiple of 3, the bundles exhibit a diversified conductance dependence on the
orientation details of the constituent tubes. The total energy of the bundle is
also sensitive to the orientation arrangement only when n is a multiple of 3.
All the transport properties and band structures can be well understood from
the symmetry consideration of whether the rotational symmetry of the individual
tubes is commensurate with that of the bundle.
