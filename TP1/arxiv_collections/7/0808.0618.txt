In this work we suggest a very simple, approximate formalism for description
of some basic (especially thermodynamical) characteristics of a rotating, very
thin black ring. (In fact, our formalism is not theoretically dubious, since,
at it is not hard to see, it can correspond to an extreme simplification of a
more accurate, Copeland-Lahiri string formalism for the black hole
description.) Even if suggested formalism is, generally speaking,
phenomenological and rough, obtained final results, unexpectedly, are
non-trivial. Concretely, given formalism reproduces exactly Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy, Bekenstein quantization of the entropy or horizon area and Hawking
temperature of a rotating, very thin black ring obtained earlier using more
accurate analysis by Reall, Emparan, Elvang, Virmani etc. (Conceptually it is
similar to situation in Bohr's atomic model where energy levels are determined
practically exactly even if electron motion is described roughly.) Our
formalism, according to suggestions in our previous works, is physically based
on the assumption that circumference of the horizon tube holds the natural
(integer) number of corresponding reduced Compton's wave length. (It is
conceptually similar to Bohr's quantization postulate in Bohr's atomic model
interpreted by de Broglie relation.) Also, we use, mathematically, practically
only simple algebraic equations (by determination of Hawking temperature we use
additionally only simple differentiation of Smarr relation).
