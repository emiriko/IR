Exclusive $\pi^o$ electroproduction is suggested for extracting both the
tensor charge and the transverse anomalous magnetic moment from experimental
data. A connection between partonic degrees of freedom, given in terms of
Generalized Parton Distributions, and Regge phenomenology is discussed.
Calculations are performed using a physically motivated parametrization that is
valid at values of the skewness, $\zeta \neq 0$. Our method makes use of
information from the nucleon form factor data, from deep inelastuc scattering
parton distribution functions, and from lattice results on the Mellin moments
of generalized parton distributions. It provides, therefore, a step towards a
model independent extraction of generalized distributions from the data,
alternative to other mathematical ansatze available in the literature.
