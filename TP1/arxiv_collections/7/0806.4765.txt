Variations in the electrostatic surface potential between the proof mass and
electrode housing in the space-based gravitational wave mission LISA is one of
the largest contributors of noise at frequencies below a few mHz. Torsion
balances provide an ideal testbed for investigating these effects in conditions
emulative of LISA. Our apparatus consists of a Au coated Cu plate brought near
a Au coated Si plate pendulum suspended from a thin W wire. We have measured a
white noise level of $30, \uVhz$ above approximately 0.1, mHz, rising at lower
frequencies, for the surface potential variations between these two closely
spaced metals.
