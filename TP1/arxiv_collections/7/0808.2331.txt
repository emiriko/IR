Na-based osmium oxide pyrochlore was synthesized for the first time by an
ion-exchange method. KOs2O6 was used as a host compound. Elelectron probe
micro-analysis, synchrotron x-ray diffraction analysis, and thermo-gravimetric
analysis confirmed its structure not as the beta-type but as the defect-type
pyrochlore. The composition was identified as Na1.4Os2O6.H2O. Electrical
resistivity, heat capacity, and magnetization measurements of the
polycrystalline Na1.4Os2O6.H2O clarified absence of superconductivity above 2
K, being in contrast to what were found for the beta-pyrochlore AOs2O6 (A = Cs,
Rb, K). Sommerfeld coefficient of 22 mJ K-2 mol-1 of Na1.4Os2O6.H2O was
smallest among those of AOs2O6. A magnetic anomaly at ~57 K and possible
associated magnetoresistance (+3.7 % at 2 K in 70 kOe) were found.
