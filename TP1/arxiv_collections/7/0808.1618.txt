We propose a scalable scheme to implement quantum computation in graphene
nanoribbon. It is shown that electron or hole can be naturally localized in
each zigzag region for a graphene nanoribbon with a sequence of Z-shaped
structure without exploiting any confined gate. An one-dimensional graphene
quantum dots chain is formed in such graphene nanoribbon, where electron or
hole spin can be encoded as qubits. The coupling interaction between
neighboring graphene quantum dots is found to be always-on Heisenberg type.
Applying the bang-bang control strategy and decoherence free subspaces encoding
method, universal quantum computation is argued to be realizable with the
present techniques.
