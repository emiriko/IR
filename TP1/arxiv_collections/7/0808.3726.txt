In this Letter, we introduce a modified collaborative filtering (MCF)
algorithm, which has remarkably higher accuracy than the standard collaborative
filtering. In the MCF, instead of the standard Pearson coefficient, the
user-user similarities are obtained by a diffusion process. Furthermore, by
considering the second order similarities, we design an effective algorithm
that depresses the influence of mainstream preferences. The corresponding
algorithmic accuracy, measured by the ranking score, is further improved by
24.9% in the optimal case. In addition, two significant criteria of algorithmic
performance, diversity and popularity, are also taken into account. Numerical
results show that the algorithm based on second order similarity can outperform
the MCF simultaneously in all three criteria.
