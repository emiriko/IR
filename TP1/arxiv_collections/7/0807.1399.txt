A method to determine masses, widths and coupling constants of vector mesons,
like phi(1020), omega(782) and rho0(770) recurrences is defined. Starting from
data on decay rates and cross sections for the processes: phi -> M_I gamma, phi
-> M_I e+e- and e+e- -> M_I phi, where M_I is a pseudoscalar or scalar meson
with isospin I=0,1, the time-like transition form factors, which describe the
vertex phi-gamma-M_I, are parametrized using a vector meson-propagators
description in the low energy region <3-4 GeV, the quark-counting rule
prescription for the high energy behavior, and the analyticity imposed by means
of the dispersion relations.
