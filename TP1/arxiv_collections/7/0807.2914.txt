How does the scattering cross section change when the colliding bound-state
fragments are allowed particle-emitting resonances? This question is explored
in the framework of a multi-channel algebraic scattering method of determining
nucleon-nucleus cross sections at low energies. Two cases are examined, the
first being a gedanken investigation in which n + carbon-12 scattering is
studied with the target states assigned artificial widths. The second is a
study of neutron scattering from beryllium-8; a nucleus that is particle
unstable. Resonance character of the target states markedly varies evaluated
cross sections from those obtained assuming stability in the target spectrum.
