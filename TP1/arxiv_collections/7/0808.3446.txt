Transmission probability of a domain wall through a magnetic nanowire is
investigated as a function of the external magnetic field. Very intriguing
phenomenon is found that the transmission probability shows a significant drop
after exceeding the threshold driving field, which contradicts our intuition
that a domain wall is more mobile in the higher magnetic field. The
micromagnetics simulation reveals that the domain wall motion in the wire with
finite roughness causes the dynamical pinning due to the Walker breakdown,
which semi-quantitatively explains our experimental results.
