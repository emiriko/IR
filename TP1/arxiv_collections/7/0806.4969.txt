It has been observed in B->phiK* and B^{0(+)}->rho^{0(+)}K^{*0} that the
fraction of transverse decays, fT, and the fraction of longitudinal decays, fL,
are roughly equal, in opposition to the naive expectation, fT/fL << 1. If one
requires a single explanation of all polarization puzzles, two possibilities
remain within the standard model (SM): penguin annihilation and rescattering.
We examine the predictions of these two explanations for fT/fL in b -> d
decays. We also study polarization observables in B -> V T decays (V is a
vector and T is a tensor meson) to probe whether the two SM explanations
account for the fT/fL ratio in this type of decays and to further investigate
the two new-physics scenarios which explain the data in B -> pi K and the
phi(rho) K* polarization measurements.
