We examine the spatial density within extended objects of the momentum
component $p^+$, and find relativistically exact connections to Fourier
transforms of gravitational form factors. We apply these results to obtain
semi-empirical momentum density distributions within nucleons, and similar
distributions for spin-1 objects based on theoretical results from the AdS/QCD
correspondence. We find that the momentum density in the transverse plane is
more compact than the charge density.
