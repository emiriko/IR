Chromosomal DNA is characterized by variation between individuals at the
level of entire chromosomes (e.g., aneuploidy in which the chromosome copy
number is altered), segmental changes (including insertions, deletions,
inversions, and translocations), and changes to small genomic regions
(including single nucleotide polymorphisms). A variety of alterations that
occur in chromosomal DNA, many of which can be detected using high density
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, are linked to normal
variation as well as disease and are therefore of particular interest. These
include changes in copy number (deletions and duplications) and genotype (e.g.,
the occurrence of regions of homozygosity). Hidden Markov models (HMM) are
particularly useful for detecting such alterations, modeling the spatial
dependence between neighboring SNPs. Here, we improve previous approaches that
utilize HMM frameworks for inference in high throughput SNP arrays by
integrating copy number, genotype calls, and the corresponding measures of
uncertainty when available. Using simulated and experimental data, we, in
particular, demonstrate how confidence scores control smoothing in a
probabilistic framework. Software for fitting HMMs to SNP array data is
available in the R package VanillaICE.
