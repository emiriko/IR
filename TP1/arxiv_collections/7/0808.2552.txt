We describe the development of a new toolkit for data analysis. The analysis
package is based on Bayes' Theorem, and is realized with the use of Markov
Chain Monte Carlo. This gives access to the full posterior probability
distribution. Parameter estimation, limit setting and uncertainty propagation
are implemented in a straightforward manner. A goodness-of-fit criterion is
presented which is intuitive and of great practical use.
