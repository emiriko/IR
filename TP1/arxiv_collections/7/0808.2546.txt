A Pixelized Photon Detector (PPD) is a generic name for the semiconductor
devices operated in the Geiger-mode, such as Silicon PhotoMultiplier and
Multi-Pixel Photon Counter, which has high photon counting capability. While
the internal mechanisms of the PPD have been intensively studied in recent
years, the existing models do not include the avalanche process. We have
simulated the multiplication and quenching of the avalanche process and have
succeeded in reproducing the output waveform of the PPD. Furthermore our model
predicts the existence of dead-time in the PPD which has never been numerically
predicted. For serching the dead-time, we also have developed waveform analysis
method using deconvolution which has the potential to distinguish neibouring
pulses precisely. In this paper, we discuss our improved model and waveform
analysis method.
