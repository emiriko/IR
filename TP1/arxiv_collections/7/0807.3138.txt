We study the effect of band gap on the ground-state properties of Dirac
electrons in a doped graphene within the random phase approximation at zero
temperature. Band gap dependence of the exchange, correlation and ground-state
energies and the compressibility are calculated. We additionally show that the
conductance in the gapped graphene is smaller than gapless one. We also
calculate the band gap dependence of charge compressibility and it decreases
with increasing the band gap values.
