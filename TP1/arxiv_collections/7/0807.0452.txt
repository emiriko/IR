Electric quadrupole moments of the metastable nd3/2 and nd5/2 states of Ca+,
Sr+, and Ba+ are calculated using the relativistic all-order method including
all single, double, and partial triple excitations of the Dirac-Hartree-Fock
wave function to provide recommended values for the cases where no experimental
data are available. The contributions of all non-linear single and double terms
are also calculated for the case of Ca+ for comparison of our approach with the
CCSD(T) results. The third-order many body perturbation theory is used to
evaluate contributions of high partial waves and the Breit interaction. The
remaining omitted correlation corrections are estimated as well. Extensive
study of the uncertainty of our calculations is carried out to establish
accuracy of our recommended values to be 0.5% - 1% depending on the particular
ion. Comprehensive comparison of our results with other theoretical values and
experiment is carried out. Our result for the quadrupole moment of the 3d5/2
state of Ca+ ion, 1.849(17)ea_0^2, is in agreement with the most precise recent
measurement 1.83(1)ea_0^2 by Roos et al. [Nature 443, 316 (2006)].
