We study the same-sign top pair production mediated by the first Kluza-Klein
(KK) excitation of the gluon in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model with flavor
violation at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), in which the nonuniversal
couplings between fermions and KK gauge bosons will lead to observable tree
level flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) effects. We find that the
same-sign top quarks produced in our case have property of high energy and high
transverse momentum, and lead to an observable signal in the same-sign dilepton
channel even when the mass of the KK gluon reach up to 3 TeV. We further
investigate the potential of the LHC to probe the flavor violating parameters
and find that the LHC can probe their values down to 0.06.
