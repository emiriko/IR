Quasiparticle spin (in the spacetime sense) couples to curvature of space.
Here this fact is used to calculate the spin of quasiholes in trial quantum
Hall states by adiabatically dragging them around on a sphere, for trial states
given by conformal blocks in some conformal field theory. The spin is found to
agree with the conformal weight of the corresponding field. The result
completes a recent argument that constructions using blocks from non-unitary
theories that contain negative quantum dimensions produce contradictions that
prevent them from describing topological (gapped) phases of matter.
