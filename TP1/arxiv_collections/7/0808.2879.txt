We investigate the critical temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation of
$K^-$ mesons in neutron star matter. This is studied within the framework of
relativistic field theoretical models at finite temperature where
nucleon-nucleon and (anti)kaon-nucleon interactions are mediated by the
exchange of mesons. The melting of the antikaon condensate is studied for
different values of antikaon optical potential depths. We find that the
critical temperature of antikaon condensation increases with baryon number
density. Further it is noted that the critical temperature is lowered as
antikaon optical potential becomes less attractive. We also construct the phase
diagram of neutron star matter with $K^-$ condensate.
