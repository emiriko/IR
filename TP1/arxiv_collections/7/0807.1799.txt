Scalable quantum networks require the capability to create, store and
distribute entanglement among distant nodes (atoms, trapped ions, charge and
spin qubits built on quantum dots, etc.) by means of photonic channels. We show
how the entanglement between qubits and electromagnetic field modes allows
generation of entangled states of remotely located qubits. We present
analytical calculations of linear entropy and the density matrix for the
entangled qubits for the system described by the Jaynes-Cummings model. We also
discuss the influence of decoherence. The presented scheme is able to drive an
initially separable state of two qubits into an highly entangled state suitable
for quantum information processing.
