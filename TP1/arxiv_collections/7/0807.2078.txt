Although cumulative family name distributions in many countries exhibit
power-law forms, there also exist counterexamples. The origin of different
family name distributions across countries is discussed analytically in the
framework of a population dynamics model. Combined with empirical observations
made, it is suggested that those differences in distributions are closely
related with the rate of appearance of new family names.
