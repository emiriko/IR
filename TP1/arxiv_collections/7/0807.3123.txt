More than 30 years after the discovery of the J/psi, its production mechanism
is still poorly understood. With the LHC data it will be possible to study
quarkonia up to very high transverse momenta and with high statistics. In this
note we discuss experimental aspects of J/psi and Upsilon(1S) production at the
LHC. In particular, we investigate the sensitivity of a general purpose LHC
detector to observables, which are complementary to the cross section and
polarisation measurement. These observables would be sensitive to the radiation
produced in association with the quarkonium.
