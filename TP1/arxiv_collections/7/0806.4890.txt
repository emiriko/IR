We discuss selected topics in the forthcoming MSTW 2008 determination of
parton distributions by global analysis. The tolerance parameter controlling
the uncertainties on the parton distributions is now determined by a new
dynamic procedure for each eigenvector of the covariance matrix. New data sets
fitted include Tevatron Run II data on inclusive jet production, the lepton
charge asymmetry from W decays and the Z rapidity distribution. Predictions are
given for the total W and Z cross sections at the Tevatron and LHC.
