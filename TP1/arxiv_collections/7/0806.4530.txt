A fundamental aspect of turbulence theory is related to the identification of
realizable phase-space statistical descriptions able to reproduce in some
suitable sense the stochastic fluid equations of a turbulent fluid. In
particular, a major open issue is whether a purely Markovian statistical
description of hydrodynamic turbulence actually can be achieved. Based on the
formulation of a \textit{deterministic inverse kinetic theory} (IKT) for the 3D
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, here we claim that such a
\textit{Markovian statistical description actually exists}. The approach, which
involves the introduction of the \textit{local velocity probability density}
for the fluid (local pdf) - rather than the velocity-difference pdf adopted in
customary approaches to homogeneous turbulence - relies exclusively on first
principles. These include - in particular - the exact validity of the
stochastic Navier-Stokes equations, the principle of entropy maximization and a
constant H-theorem for the Shannon statistical entropy. As a result, the new
approach affords an exact equivalence between Lagrangian and Eulerian
formulations which permit local pdf's which are generally non-Maxwellian (i.e.,
non-Gaussian). The theory developed is quite general and applies in principle
even to turbulence regimes which are non-stationary and non-uniform in a
statistical sense.
