We report density functional calculations of the electronic structure, Fermi
surface, phonon spectrum, magnetism and electron-phonon coupling for the
superconducting phase FeSe, as well as the related compounds FeS and FeTe. We
find that the Fermi surface structure of these compounds is very similar to
that of the Fe-As based superconductors, with cylindrical electron sections at
the zone corner, cylindrical hole surface sections, and depending on the
compound, other small hole sections at the zone center. As in the Fe-As based
materials, these surfaces are separated by a 2D nesting vector at
($\pi$,$\pi$). The density of states, nesting and Fermi surface size increase
going from FeSe to FeTe. Both FeSe and FeTe show spin density wave ground
states, while FeS is close to an instability. In a scenario where
superconductivity is mediated by spin fluctuations at the SDW nesting vector,
the strongest superconductor in this series would be doped FeTe.
