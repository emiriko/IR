We present experiments on weakly-pinned vortices, which exhibit a large
critical transverse depinning force. These results are obtained in the
superconducting metallic glasses Fe$_{x}$Ni$_{1-x}$Zr$_{2}$ using crossed ac
and dc driving currents. We study the vortex depinning force due to the
transverse ac drive as a function of a longitudinal dc drive; the ac/dc
combination permits the separation of the transverse drive from the
longitudinal one. We show that the force required for depinning in the
transverse direction is greatly enhanced by the longitudinal drive, which
demonstrates the existence of a large transverse critical force. The
measurements are performed as a function of magnetic field and temperature and
show that the transverse critical force exists in a large portion of the phase
diagram. Hysteresis observed at the transverse depinning threshold is
consistent with a first-order transverse depinning transition.
