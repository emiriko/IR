The mean parity (the Wigner function at the origin) of excited binomial
states, excited coherent states and excited thermal states in thermal channel
is investigated in details. It is found that the single-photon excited binomial
state and the single-photon excited coherent state exhibit certain similarity
in the aspect of their mean parity in the thermal channel. We show the negative
mean parity can be regarded as an indicator of nonclassicality of single-photon
excitation of optical fields with a little coherence, especially for the
single-photon excited thermal states.
