We suggest a new scheme for the introduction of formfactors for the SU(4)
chiral meson Lagrangian approach to the J/psi breakup cross sections by pion
and rho meson impact. This mesonic formfactor scheme respects the fact that on
the quark level of description the contact and the meson exchange diagrams are
constructed by so-called box and triangle diagrams which contain a different
number of vertex functions for the quark-meson coupling. We present a model
calculation for Gaussian vertex functions within the meson formfactor scheme
and compare the results with those of the usual global formfactor model. We
calibrate the new meson formfactor model with results for the pion impact
processes from a relativistic quark model calculation by Ivanov et al. and
present predictions for the rho-meson induced processes. We provide a fit
formula for the resulting energy-dependent cross sections.
