An effect of the dynamic gain saturation on chirped-pulse oscillator was
investigated. It was found, that the dynamic gain saturation causes strong
perturbations of the pulse front that destabilizes an oscillator. As a result,
the chirped-pulse exists only within some limited range of dispersions and
there is a limit of energy growth for a given resonator period.
