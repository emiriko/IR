We show that a fourth family of quarks with $m_{t'}$ in the range of (400 -
600) GeV provides a rather simple explanation for the several indications of
new physics that have been observed involving CP asymmetries of the b-quark.
The built-in hierarchy of the 4$\times$4 mixing matrix is such that the $t'$
readily provides a needed {\it perturbation} ($\approx 15%$) to $\sin 2 \beta$
as measured in $B \to \psi K_s$ and simultaneously is the dominant source of CP
asymmetry in $B_s \to \psi \phi$. The correlation between CP asymmetries in
$B_s \to\psi \phi$ and $B_d\to\phi K_s$ suggests $m_{t'} \approx$ (400 - 600)
GeV. Such heavy masses point to the tantalizing possibility that the 4th family
plays an important role in the electroweak symmetry breaking.
