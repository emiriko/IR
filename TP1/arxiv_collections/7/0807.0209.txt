We report on a Monte Carlo method that generates one-dimensional trajectories
for Bohm's formulation of quantum mechanics that doesn't involve
differentiation or integration of any equations of motion. At each time,
t=n\delta t (n=1,2,3,...), N particle positions are randomly sampled from the
quantum probability density. Trajectories are built from the sorted N sampled
positions at each time. These trajectories become the exact Bohm solutions in
the limits N->\infty and \delta t -> 0. Higher dimensional problems can be
solved by this method for separable wave functions. Several examples are given,
including the two-slit experiment.
