We investigate whether an interpretation of water's thermodynamics [Science,
319, 582 (2008)] by using analogy with the binary metal alloys lambda-type
ordering transition or buckminsterfullerene's orientational-ordering transition
has merit. On examining the heat capacity data used for the nanoconfined water,
the construction of the heat capacity peak, and the number of water molecules
in nanoconfinement, we find that (i) the peak had been obtained by joining the
data for emulsified water with that of the nanoconfined water and (ii) only
three water molecules can be fitted across the 1.1 nm diameter pores used in
the study, two of which form a cylindrical shell that is hydrogen bonded to
silica. The remaining connectedness of one water molecule would not produce a
metal alloy-like lambda-transition, or cooperative motions. Therefore, there is
no basis for considering such an ordering in supercooled water.
