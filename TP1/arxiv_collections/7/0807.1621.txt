We estimate the potential energy for a system of three static gluons in
Lattice QCD. This is relevant for the different models of three-body glueballs
have been proposed in the literature, either for gluons with a constituent
mass, or for massless ones. A Wilson loop adequate to the static hybrid
three-body system is developed. We study different spacial geometries, to
compare the starfish model with the triangle model, for the three-gluon
potential. We also study two different colour structures, symmetric and
antisymmetric, and compare the respective static potentials. A first simulation
is performed in a $24^3 \times 48$ periodic Lattice, with $\beta=6.2$ and $a
\sim 0.072$ fm.
