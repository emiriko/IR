It is proved that every doubly stochastic quantum channel that is properly
averaged with the completely depolarizing channel can be written as a convex
combination of unitary channels. As a consequence, we find that the collection
of channels expressible as convex combinations of unitary channels has non-zero
Borel measure within the space of doubly stochastic channels.
