We have studied the feasibility of electron conduction in azulene molecule
and compared with that in its isomer naphthalene. We have used non-equilibrium
Green's function formalism to measure the current in our systems as a response
of the external electric field. Parallely we have performed the Gaussian
calculations with electric field in the same bias window to observe the impact
of external bias on the wave functions of the systems. We have found that, the
conduction of azulene is higher than that of naphthalene inspite of its
intrinsic donor-acceptor property, which leads a system to more insulating
state. Due to stabilization through charge transfer the azulene system can be
fabricated as a very effective molecular wire. Our calculations shows the
possibility of huge device application of azulene in nano-scale instruments.
