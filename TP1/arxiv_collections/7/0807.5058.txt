The outcome statistics of an informationally complete quantum measurement for
a system in a given state can be used to evaluate the ensemble expectation of
any linear operator in the same state, by averaging a function of the outcomes
that depends on the specific operator. Here we introduce two novel
data-processing strategies, non-linear in the frequencies, which lead to faster
convergence to theoretical expectations.
