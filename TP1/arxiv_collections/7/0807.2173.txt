It is shown how many-body correlations involving the symmetry potential
naturally arise in the molecular dynamics CoMD-II model. The effect of these
correlations on the collision dynamics at the Fermi energies is discussed.
Small level of correlations for systems of moderate asymmetry are able to
produce large effects also in simple observables like the charge distributions.
The comparison with predictions based on Equation Of State static calculations
is also discussed.
