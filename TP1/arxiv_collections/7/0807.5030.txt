We present an alternative method to filter a distribution, that is strictly
confined within a sphere of given radius $r_c$, so that its Fourier transform
is optimally confined within another sphere of radius $k_c$.
  In electronic structure methods, it can be used to generate optimized
pseudopotentials, pseudocore charge distributions, and pseudo atomic orbital
basis sets.
