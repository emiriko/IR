Influence of volume capture on a process of volume reflection of
ultrarelativistic particles moving in bent single crystals was considered
analytically. Relations describing various distributions of particles involving
in the process, the probability of volume capture and behavior of channeling
and dechanneling fractions of a beam were obtained. Results of study will be
useful at creation of multicrystal devices for collimation and extraction of
beams on modern and future accelerators.
