We are in the middle of a remarkable paradigm shift in particle physics, a
shift of opinion that occurred so slowly that some even try to deny that they
changed their minds at all. It concerns a very basic question: can we expect to
derive the laws of particle physics from a fundamental theory? The Standard
Model of particle physics as well as the 1984 string theory revolution provided
ample food for thought about this. The reason this was ignored for so long can
be traced back to an old fallacy: a misguided idea about our own importance.
