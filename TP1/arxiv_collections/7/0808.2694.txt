Mutual information and swap operation in the two-qubit Heisenberg model with
the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) anisotropic antisymmetric interaction are
investigated. It is found that the mutual information I of such a quantum
channel is sensitive to the initial conditions and declines with the increase
of the temperature. The DM interaction can lead to a higher mutual information,
especially for the ferromagnetic case. The entanglement quality of input states
cannot enhance the mutual information of the quantum channel. When the DM
interaction is large, the mutual information will be the maximum value 2 for a
non-entangled input state, but it is 1 for a maximally entangled input one. It
is also shown that the swap operation can be implemented for some kinds of DM
coupling. The conditions of the DM coupling under which the swap operation is
feasible are established.
