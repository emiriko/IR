A general prescription for the treatment of constrained quantum motion is
outlined. We consider in particular constraints defined by algebraic
submanifolds of the quantum state space. The resulting formalism is applied to
obtain solutions to the constrained dynamics of systems of multiple spin-1/2
particles. When the motion is constrained to a certain product space containing
all of the energy eigenstates, the dynamics thus obtained are quasi-unitary in
the sense that the equations of motion take a form identical to that of unitary
motion, but with different boundary conditions. When the constrained subspace
is a product space of disentangled states, the associated motion is more
intricate. Nevertheless, the equations of motion satisfied by the dynamical
variables are obtained in closed form.
