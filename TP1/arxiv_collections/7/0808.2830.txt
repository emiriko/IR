In this article we study closed inflationary universe models by means of a
tachyonic field. We described a general treatment for created a universe with
$\Omega>1$ in patch cosmology, which is able to represent General Relativity,
Gauss-Bonnet or Randall-Sundrum patches. We use recent data from astronomical
observations to constrain the parameters appearing in our model.
