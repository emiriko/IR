The aim of this article is to describe families or representations of the
Yang-Mills algebras YM(n) (where n>1) defined by Connes and Dubois-Violette. We
first describe irreducible finite dimensional representations. Next, we provide
families of infinite dimensional representations of YM(n), big enough to
separate points of the algebra. In order to prove this result, we use that all
Weyl algebras Ar(k) are epimorphic images of YM(n).
