In this paper, we study entanglement dynamics of a two-qubit extended
Werner-like state locally interacting with independent noisy channels, i.e.,
amplitude damping, phase damping and depolarizing channels. We show that the
purity of initial entangled state has direct impacts on the entanglement
robustness in each noisy channel. That is, if the initial entangled state is
prepared in mixed instead of pure form, the state may exhibit entanglement
sudden death (ESD) and/or be decreased for the critical probability at which
the entanglement disappear.
