First principles constrained density functional theory scheme in Wannier
functions formalism has been used to calculate Coulomb repulsion U and Hund's
exchange J parameters for iron 3d electrons in LaFeAsO. Results strongly depend
on the basis set used in calculations: when O-2p, As-4p, and Fe-3d orbitals and
corresponding bands are included, computation results in U=3-4 eV, however,
with the basis set restricted to Fe-3d orbitals and bands only, computation
gives parameters corresponding to F^0=0.8 eV, J=0.5 eV. LDA+DMFT (the Local
Density Approximation combined with the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory)
calculation with this parameters results in weakly correlated electronic
structure that is in agreement with X-ray experimental spectra.
