Two qubits is the simplest system where the notions of separable and
entangled states and entanglement witnesses first appear. We give a three
dimensional geometric description of these notions. This description however
carries no quantitative information on the measure of entanglement. A four
dimensional description captures also the entanglement measure. We give a neat
formula for the Bell states which leads to a slick proof of the fundamental
teleportation identity. We describe optimal distillation of two qubits
geometrically and present a simple geometric proof of the Peres-Horodecki
separability criterion.
