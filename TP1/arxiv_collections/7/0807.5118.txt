This is a brief review of some of the basic concepts of perturbative QCD,
including infrared safety and factorization, relating them to more familiar
ideas from quantum mechanics and relativity. It is intended to offer
perspective on methods and terms whose use is commonplace, but whose physical
origins are sometimes obscure.
