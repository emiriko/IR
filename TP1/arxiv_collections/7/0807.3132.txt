We present the results of searches for large extra dimensions in samples of
events with large missing transverse energy and either a photon or a jet
produced in p-pbar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV collected with the CDF II
detector. For gamma + missing Et and jet + missing Et candidate samples
corresponding to 2.0 fb^-1 and 1.1 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity respectively,
we observe good agreement with standard model expectations and obtain a
combined lower limit on the fundamental parameter of the large extra dimensions
model, Md, as a function of the number of extra dimensions in the model.
