We show that matrix models in Chern-Simons theory admit an interpretation as
1D exactly solvable models, paralleling the relationship between the Gaussian
matrix model and the Calogero model. We compute the corresponding Hamiltonians,
ground-state wavefunctions and ground-state energies and point out that the
models can be interpreted as quasi-1D Coulomb plasmas. We also study the
relationship between Chern-Simons theory on $S^3$ and a system of N
one-dimensional fermions at finite temperature with harmonic confinement. In
particular we show that the Chern-Simons partition function can be described by
the density matrix of the free fermions in a very particular, crystalline,
configuration. For this, we both use the Brownian motion and the matrix model
description of Chern-Simons theory and find several common features with c=1
theory at finite temperature. Finally, using the exactly solvable model result,
we show that the finite temperature effect can be described with a specific
two-body interaction term in the Hamiltonian, with 1D Coulombic behavior at
large separations.
