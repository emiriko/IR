In low temperature supercooled liquid, below the ideal mode coupling theory
transition temperature, hopping and continuous diffusion are seen to coexist.
We present a theory which incorporates interaction between the two processes
and shows that hopping can induce continuous diffusion in the otherwise frozen
liquid. Several universal features arise from nonlinear interactions between
the continuous diffusive dynamics (described here by the mode coupling theory
(MCT)) and the activated hopping (described here by the random first order
transition theory). We apply the theory to real systems (Salol) to show that
the theory correctly predicts the temperature dependence of the non-exponential
stretching parameter, $\beta$, and the primary $\alpha$ relaxation timescale,
$\tau$. The study explains why, even below the ergodic to non-ergodic
transition, the dynamics is well described by MCT. The non-linear coupling
between the two dynamical processes modifies the relaxation behavior of the
structural relaxation from what would be predicted by a theory with a complete
static Gaussian barrier distribution in a manner that may be described as a
facilitation effect. Furthermore, the theory explains the observed variation of
the stretching exponent $\beta$ with the fragility parameter, $D$.
