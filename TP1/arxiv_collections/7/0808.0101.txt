Modified Volterra lattice admits two vector generalizations. One of them is
studied for the first time. The zero curvature representations, B\"acklund
transformations, nonlinear superposition principle and the simplest explicit
solutions of soliton and breather type are presented for both vector lattices.
The relations with some other integrable equations are established.
