A search for single top production in ep collisions using the complete high
energy data from HERA is presented. This search is based on the analysis of
events containing isolated leptons (electrons or muons) and missing transverse
momentum PTmiss. In the absence of a signal, an upper limit on the top
production cross section sigma_ep -> etX < 0.16 pb is established at the 95%
confidence level, corresponding to an upper bound on the anomalous magnetic
coupling kappa_tug < 0.14. The search is complemented by a search for events
containing an isolated tau lepton and PTmiss and the measurement of W boson
polarisation fractions.
