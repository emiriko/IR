We study polarization variables in the photoproduction of omega-mesons with
subsequent omega to gamma pi^0 decay. Single and double polarization
observables are calculated as a function of different final-state angles.
Reaction models include pomeron (natural parity) and pi^0 (unnatural parity)
exchange in the t-channel. In addition, the contribution of s-channel
resonances is considered. The sensitivity of the polarization observables to
the reaction dynamics is discussed.
