The properties of an unconventional, single mode phonon bath coupled to a
quantum dot, are investigated within the rotating wave approximation. The
electron current through the dot induces an out of equilibrium bath, with a
phonon distribution qualitatively different from the thermal one. In selected
transport regimes, such a distribution is characterized by a peculiar selective
population of few phonon modes and can exhibit a sub-Poissonian behavior. It is
shown that such a sub-Poissonian behavior is favored by a double occupancy of
the dot. The crossover from a unequilibrated to a conventional thermal bath is
explored, and the limitations of the rotating wave approximation are discussed.
