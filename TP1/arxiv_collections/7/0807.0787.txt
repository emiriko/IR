We analyze the limits that quantum mechanics imposes on the accuracy to which
$(4+n)$-dimensional spacetime geometry can be measured. Using physics of
computation and light sheet concept we derive explicit expressions for quantum
fluctuations and explore their cumulative effects for various spacetime foam
models.
