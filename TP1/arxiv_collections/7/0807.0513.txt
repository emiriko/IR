Non-relativistic conformal (''Schr\"odinger'') symmetry is derived in a
Kaluza-Klein type framework. Lightlike reduction of the massless Dirac equation
from 5D Minkowski space yields L\'evy-Leblond's non-relativistic equation for a
spin 1/2 particle. Combining with the osp(1,1) SUSY found before provides us
with a super-Schr\"odinger symmetry.
