Based on a recent classification of subalgebras of the symmetry algebra of
the Zabolotskaya-Khokhlov equation, all similarity reductions of this equation
into ordinary differential equations are obtained. Large classes of
group-invariant solutions of the equation are also determined, and some
properties of the reduced equations and exact solutions are discussed.
