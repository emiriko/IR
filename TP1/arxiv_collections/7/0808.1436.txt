Here we describe the form of the Asymmetric Superfluid Local Density
Approximation (ASLDA), a Density Functional Theory (DFT) used to model the
two-component unitary Fermi gas. We give the rational behind the functional,
and describe explicitly how we determine the form of the DFT from the to the
available numerical and experimental data.
