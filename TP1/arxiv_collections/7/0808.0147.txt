The results on the direct measurements of the W-boson mass and width, based
on the data collected by the Tevatron experiments CDF and D0 at Fermilab are
summarised and combined. The CDF Run-0 (1988-1889) and Run-I (1992-1995)
results have been re-averaged using the BLUE method and combined with Run-I D0
results and the latest published results from CDF taken from the first period
of Run-II (2001-2004). The results are corrected to have consistency between
the parton distribution functions and electroweak parameters. The resulting
Tevatron averages for the mass and total decay width of the W boson are: Mw =
80432 +/- 39 MeV and Gamma_W = 2056 +/- 62 MeV. The inclusion of a preliminary
Run-II measurement of Gamma_W from D0 gives Gamma_W = 2050 +/- 58 MeV.
