The Dirac equation is solved approximately for the Hulthen potential with the
pseudospin symmetry for any spin-orbit quantum number $\kappa$ in the
position-dependent mass background. Solutions are obtained reducing the Dirac
equation into a Schr\"{o}dinger-like differential equation by using an
appropriate coordinate transformation. The Nikiforov-Uvarov method is used in
the calculations to get energy eigenvalues and the corresponding wave
functions.
