We consider Linear Programming (LP) decoding of a fixed Low-Density
Parity-Check (LDPC) code over the Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). The LP
decoder fails when it outputs a pseudo-codeword which is not a codeword. We
design an efficient algorithm termed the Instanton Search Algorithm (ISA)
which, given a random input, generates a set of flips called the BSC-instanton.
We prove that: (a) the LP decoder fails for any set of flips with support
vector including an instanton; (b) for any input, the algorithm outputs an
instanton in the number of steps upper-bounded by twice the number of flips in
the input. Repeated sufficient number of times, the ISA outcomes the number of
unique instantons of different sizes.
