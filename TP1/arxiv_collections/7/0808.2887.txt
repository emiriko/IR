Thin layers of GaMnAs ferromagnetic semiconductor grown by molecular beam
epitaxy on GaAs(001) substrates were studied. To improve their magnetic
properties the post-growth annealing procedures were applied, using the surface
passivation layers of amorphous arsenic. This post growth treatment effectively
increases the ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic phase transition temperature in
GaMnAs, and provides surface-rich MnAs layer which can be used for formation of
low dimensional structures such as superlattices. If the surface rich MnAs
layer consists of MnAs dots, then it is possible to grow Mn-doped GaAs
