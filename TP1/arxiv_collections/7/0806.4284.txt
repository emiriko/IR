We study the dynamics of meromorphic maps for a compact Kaehler manifold X.
More precisely, we give a simple criterion that allows us to produce a measure
of maximal entropy. We can apply this result to bound the Lyapunov exponents.
  Then, we study the particular case of a family of generic birational maps of
P^k for which we construct the Green currents and the equilibrium measure. We
use for that the theory of super-potentials. We show that the measure is mixing
and gives no mass to pluripolar sets. Using the criterion we get that the
measure is of maximal entropy. It implies finally that the measure is
hyperbolic.
