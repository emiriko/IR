Many natural phenomena can be described by power-laws. A closer look at
various experimental data reveals more or less significant deviations from a
1/f spectrum. We exemplify such cases with phenomena offered by molecular
biology, cell biophysics, and cognitive psychology. Some of these cases can be
described by first order autoregressive (AR) models or by higher order AR
models which are short range correlation models. The calculations are checked
against astrophysical data which were fitted to a an AR model by a different
method. We found that our fitting method of the data give similar results for
the astrhophysical data and therefore applied the method for examples mentioned
above. Our results show that such phenomena can be described by first or higher
order of AR models. Therefore such examples are described by short range
correlation properties while they can be easily confounded with long range
correlation phenomena.
