The power spectrum of local field potentials (LFPs) has been reported to
scale as the inverse of the frequency, but the origin of this "1/f noise" is at
present unclear. Macroscopic measurements in cortical tissue demonstrated that
electric conductivity (as well as permittivity) is frequency dependent, while
other measurements failed to evidence any dependence on frequency. In the
present paper, we propose a model of the genesis of LFPs which accounts for the
above data and contradictions. Starting from first principles (Maxwell
equations), we introduce a macroscopic formalism in which macroscopic
measurements are naturally incorporated, and also examine different physical
causes for the frequency dependence. We suggest that ionic diffusion primes
over electric field effects, and is responsible for the frequency dependence.
This explains the contradictory observations, and also reproduces the 1/f power
spectral structure of LFPs, as well as more complex frequency scaling. Finally,
we suggest a measurement method to reveal the frequency dependence of current
propagation in biological tissue, and which could be used to directly test the
predictions of the present formalism.
