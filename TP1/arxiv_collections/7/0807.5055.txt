We study the convergence of the series expansions sometimes used in the
analysis of the nuclear effects in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) proccesses
induced by leptons. The recent advances in statistics and quality of the data,
in particular for neutrinos calls for a good control of the theoretical
uncertainties of the models used in the analysis. Using realistic nuclear
spectral functions which include nucleon correlations, we find that the
convergence of the derivative expansions to the full results is poor except at
very low values of $x$.
