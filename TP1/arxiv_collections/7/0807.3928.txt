We report theoretical and experimental studies of the longitudinal electron
spin and orbital relaxation time of interstitial Li donors in $^{28}$Si. We
predict that despite the near-degeneracy of the ground-state manifold the spin
relaxation times are extremely long for the temperatures below 0.3 K. This
prediction is based on a new finding of the chiral symmetry of the donor
states, which presists in the presence of random strains and magnetic fields
parallel to one of the cubic axes. Experimentally observed kinetics of
magnetization reversal at 2.1 K and 4.5 K are in a very close agreement with
the theory. To explain these kinetics we introduced a new mechanism of spin
decoherence based on a combination of a small off-site displacement of the Li
atom and an umklapp phonon process. Both these factors weakly break chiral
symmetry and enable the long-term spin relaxation.
