The electric and magnetic fields of a pole-dipole singularity attributed to a
point-electron-singularity in the Maxwell field are expressed in a Colombeau
algebra of generalized functions. This enables one to calculate dynamical
quantities quadratic in the fields which are otherwise mathematically
ill-defined: The self-energy (i.e., `mass'), the self-angular momentum (i.e.,
`spin'), the self-momentum (i.e., `hidden momentum'), and the self-force. While
the total self-force and self-momentum are zero, therefore insuring that the
electron-singularity is stable, the mass and the spin are diverging integrals
of delta-squared-functions. Yet, after renormalization according to standard
prescriptions, the expressions for mass and spin are consistent with quantum
theory, including the requirement of a gyromagnetic ratio greater than one. The
most striking result, however, is that the electric and magnetic fields differ
from the classical monopolar and dipolar fields by delta-function terms which
are usually considered as insignificant, while in a Colombeau algebra these
terms are precisely the sources of the mechanical mass and spin of the
electron-singularity.
