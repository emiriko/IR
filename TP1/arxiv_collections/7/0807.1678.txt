We present an atomistic 3D simulation study of the performance of graphene
nanoribbon (GNR) Schottky barrier (SB) FETs and transistors with doped
reservoirs (MOSFETs) by means of the self-consistent solution of the Poisson
and Schrodinger equations within the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF)
formalism. Ideal MOSFETs show slightly better electrical performance, for both
digital and THz applications. The impact of non-idealities on device
performance has been investigated, taking into account the presence of single
vacancy, edge roughness and ionized impurities along the channel. In general,
MOSFETs show more robust characteristics than SBFETs. Edge roughness and single
vacancy defect largely affect performance of both device types.
