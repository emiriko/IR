We examine the reduction process of a system of second-order ordinary
differential equations which is invariant under a Lie group action. With the
aid of connection theory, we explain why the associated vector field decomposes
in three parts and we show how the integral curves of the original system can
be reconstructed from the reduced dynamics. An illustrative example confirms
the results.
