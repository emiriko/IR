We report on the most recent applications of the Auxiliary Field Diffusion
Monte Carlo (AFDMC) method. The equation of state (EOS) for pure neutron matter
in both normal and BCS phase and the superfluid gap in the low--density regime
are computed, using a realistic Hamiltonian containing the Argonne AV8' plus
Urbana IX three--nucleon interaction. Preliminary results for the EOS of
isospin--asymmetric nuclear matter are also presented.
