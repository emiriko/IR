We calculate the energy and heat capacity of a liquid on the basis of its
elastic properties and vibrational states. The experimental decrease of liquid
heat capacity with temperature is attributed to the increasing loss of two
transverse modes with frequency $\omega<1/\tau$, where $\tau$ is liquid
relaxation time. In a simple model, liquid heat capacity is related to
viscosity and is compared with the experimental data of mercury. We also
calculate the vibrational energy of a quantum liquid, and show that transverse
phonons can not be excited in the low-temperature limit. Finally, we discuss
the implications of the proposed approach to liquids for the problem of glass
transition.
