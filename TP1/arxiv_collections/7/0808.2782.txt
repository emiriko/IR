We analyze the effects of charged lepton corrections and renormalization
group (RG) running on the low energy predictions of theories which accurately
predict tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing at the high energy scale. In particular
we focus on GUT inspired see-saw models with accurate tri-bimaximal neutrino
mixing at the GUT scale, in which the charged lepton corrections are
Cabibbo-like and give rise to sum rules valid at the GUT scale. We study
numerically the RG corrections to a variety of such neutrino mixing sum rules
in order to assess their accuracy and reliability when comparing them to future
low energy neutrino oscillation experiments. Our results indicate that the RG
corrections to neutrino mixing sum rules are typically small (less than one
degree), at least in the examples studied with hierarchical neutrinos.
