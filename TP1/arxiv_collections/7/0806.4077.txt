Our main results concern complete intersections of three real quadrics. We
prove that the maximal number $B^0_2(N)$ of connected components that a regular
complete intersection of three real quadrics in $\Bbb{P}^N$ can have differs at
most by one from the maximal number of ovals of the submaximal depth
$[(N-1)/2]$ of a real plane projective curve of degree $d=N+1$. As a
consequence, we obtain a lower bound \smash{$\frac14 N^2+O(N)$} and an upper
bound \smash{$\frac38 N^2+O(N)$} for $B^0_2(N)$.
