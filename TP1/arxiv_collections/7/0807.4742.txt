We perform density functional calculations of the equilibrium 57Fe/54Fe
ratios for ferrous iron dissolved in periclase and MgSiO3 perovskite at the
pressures and temperatures of the Earth's mantle. Pressure increases the
partitioning of 57Fe into both phases by a factor of three from the Earth's
surface to the core-mantle boundary. In ferropericlase, a large contribution to
this increase comes from the electronic transition from high-spin to low-spin
iron. Our calculations demonstrate that pressure-induced fractionation can play
a major role in determining planetary iron-isotope composition.
