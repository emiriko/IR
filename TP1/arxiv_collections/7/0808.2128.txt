We present the implementation of the dipole subtraction formalism for the
real radiation contributions to any next-to-leading order QCD process in the
MadGraph/MadEvent framework. Both massless and massive dipoles are considered.
Starting from a specific (n+1)-particle process the package provides a Fortran
code for all possible dipoles to all Born processes that constitute the
subtraction term to the (n+1)-particle process. The output files are given in
the usual "MadGraph StandAlone" style using helicity amplitudes.
