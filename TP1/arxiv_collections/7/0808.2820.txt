Black hole radiation of gravitinos is investigated as the classically
forbidden tunneling of spin-3/2 fermions through an event horizon. We show that
all four spin states of the gravitino yield the same emission temperature, and
retrieve the Unruh temperature in a Rindler spacetime as well as the Hawking
temperature for a Kerr-Newman charged rotating black hole.
