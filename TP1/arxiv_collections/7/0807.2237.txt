Here we report bulk superconductivity in BaFe1.8Co0.2As2 single crystals
below Tc = 22 K, as demonstrated by resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and
specific heat data. Hall data indicate that the dominant carriers are
electrons, as expected from simple chemical reasoning. This is the first
example of superconductivity induced by electron doping in this family of
materials. In contrast to the cuprates, the BaFe2As2 system appears to tolerate
considerable disorder in the FeAs planes. First principles calculations for
BaFe1.8Co0.2As2 indicate the inter-band scattering due to Co is weak.
