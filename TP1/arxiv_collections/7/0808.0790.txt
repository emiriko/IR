The low-energy structure of 231Ac has been investigated by means of gamma ray
spectroscopy following the beta-decay of 231Ra. Multipolarities of 28
transitions have been established by measuring conversion electrons with a
mini-orange electron spectrometer. The decay scheme of 231Ra --> 231Ac has been
constructed for the first time. The Advanced Time Delayed beta-gamma-gamma(t)
method has been used to measure the half-lives of five levels. The moderately
fast B(E1) transition rates derived suggest that the octupole effects, albeit
weak, are still present in this exotic nucleus.
