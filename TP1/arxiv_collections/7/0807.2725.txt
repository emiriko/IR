Risken's matrix continued fraction method is used to solve the Fokker-Planck
equation to calculate particle current in an inertial symmetric (sinusoidal)
periodic potential under the action of a constant force. The particle moves in
a medium with friction coefficient also varying periodically in space as the
potential but with a finite phase difference $\phi (\ne n\pi, n=0,1,2, ...)$.
The algebraic sum of current with applied forces $\pm|F|$ gives the ratchet
current in the adiabatic limit. Even though, the effect of frictional
inhomogeneity is weak, the ratchet current shows very rich qualitative
characteristics. The effects of variation of $F$, the temperature $T$, and the
average friction coefficient $\gamma_0$ on the performance characteristics of
the ratchet are presented.
