We present a dynamic learning paradigm for "programming" a general quantum
computer. A learning algorithm is used to find the control parameters for a
coupled qubit system, such that the system at an initial time evolves to a
state in which a given measurement corresponds to the desired operation. This
can be thought of as a quantum neural network. We first apply the method to a
system of two coupled superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs),
and demonstrate learning of both the classical gates XOR and XNOR. Training of
the phase produces a gate congruent to the CNOT modulo a phase shift. Striking
out for somewhat more interesting territory, we attempt learning of an
entanglement witness for a two qubit system. Simulation shows a reasonably
successful mapping of the entanglement at the initial time onto the correlation
function at the final time for both pure and mixed states. For pure states this
mapping requires knowledge of the phase relation between the two parts;
however, given that knowledge, this method can be used to measure the
entanglement of an otherwise unknown state. The method is easily extended to
multiple qubits or to quNits.
