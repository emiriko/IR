A new class of cylindrically symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological models for
perfect fluid distribution with electromagnetic field is obtained in the
context of Lyra's geometry. We have obtained two types of solutions by
considering the uniform as well as time dependent displacement field. The
source of the magnetic field is due to an electric current produced along the
z-axis. Only $F_{12}$ is a non-vanishing component of electromagnetic field
tensor. To get the deterministic solution, it has been assumed that the
expansion $\theta$ in the model is proportional to the shear $\sigma$. It has
been found that the solutions are consistent with the recent observations of
type Ia supernovae and the displacement vector $\beta(t)$ affects entropy.
Physical and geometric aspects of the models are also discussed in presence and
absence of magnetic field.
