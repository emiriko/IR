We combine results from CDF and DO searches for a standard model Higgs boson
in ppbar collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron, at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV. With 3.0
fb-1 of data analyzed at CDF, and at DO, the 95% C.L. upper limits on Higgs
boson production are a factor of 1.2, 1.0 and 1.3 higher than the SM cross
section for a Higgs boson mass of m_{H}=$165, 170 and 175 GeV, respectively. We
exclude at 95% C.L. a standard model Higgs boson of m_H=170 GeV. Based on
simulation, the ratios of the corresponding median expected upper limit to the
Standard Model cross section are 1.2, 1.4 and 1.7. Compared to the previous
Higgs Tevatron combination, more data and refined analysis techniques have been
used. These results extend significantly the individual limits of each
experiment and provide new knowledge on the mass of the standard model Higgs
boson beyond the LEP direct searches.
