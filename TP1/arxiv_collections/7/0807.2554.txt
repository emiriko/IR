A severe case of scientific misconduct was discovered in a paper from 2005
allegedly showing harmful effects (DNA breakage) of non-thermal mobile phone
electromagnetic field exposure on human and rat cells. Here we describe the way
how the fraudulent data were identified. The low variations of the reported
biological data are shown to be below theoretical lower limits (multinomial
distributions). Another reason for doubts was highly significant non-equal
distributions of last digits, a known hint towards data fabrication. The
Medical University Vienna, where the research was conducted, was informed about
these findings and came to the conclusion that the data in this and another,
related paper by the same group were fabricated, and that both papers should be
retracted.
