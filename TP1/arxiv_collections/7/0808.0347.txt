Building of tools--from simple prototypes to industrial-strength
applications--is a pervasive activity in academic research. When proposing a
new technique for software maintenance, effective tool support is typically
required to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.
However, even though tool building is both pervasive and requiring significant
time and effort, it is still pursued in an ad hoc manner. In this paper, we
address these issues by proposing a dedicated development process for tool
building that takes the unique characteristics of an academic research
environment into account. We first identify process requirements based on a
review of the literature and our extensive tool building experience in the
domain of maintenance tools. We then outline a process framework based on work
products that accommodates the requirements while providing needed flexibility
for tailoring the process to account for specific tool building approaches and
project constraints. The work products are concrete milestones of the process,
tracking progress, rationalizing (design) decisions, and documenting the
current state of the tool building project. Thus, the work products provide
important input for strategic project decisions and rapid initiation of new
team members. Leveraging a dedicated tool building process promises tools that
are designed, build, and maintained in a more disciplined, predictable and
efficient manner.
