We uncover a strong coupling between nonlinearity and diffraction in a
photonic crystal at the supercollimation point. We show this is modeled by a
nonlinear diffraction term in a nonlinear schroedinger type equation, in which
the properties of solitons are investigated. Linear stability analysis shows
solitons are stable in an existence domain that obeys the Vakhitov-Kolokolov
criterium. In addition, we investigate the influence of the nonlinear
diffraction on soliton collision scenarios.
