In this paper we study two kinds of tau decays: (a) tau- --> (rho pi-,omega
pi-, phi pi-, K*0 K-) nu(tau), which belong to Delta S=0 processes and (b)
Delta S = 1 processes, like tau- --> (rho K-, omega K-, phi K-, \bar{K*0} pi-)
nu(tau), in the framework of resonance chiral theory. We fit the tau- --> omega
pi- nu(tau) spectral function and the invariant mass distribution of omega K in
the process of tau- --> omega K- nu(tau) to get the values of unknown resonance
couplings. Then we make a prediction for branching ratios of all channels.
