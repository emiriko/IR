Current prescriptions for spreadsheet style specify modular separation of
data, calcu1ation and output, based on the notion that writing a spreadsheet is
like writing a computer program. Instead of a computer programming style, this
article examines rules of style for text, graphics, and mathematics. Much
'common wisdom' in spreadsheets contradicts rules for these well-developed
arts. A case is made here for a new style for spreadsheets that emphasises
readability. The new style is described in detail with an example, and
contrasted with the programming style.
