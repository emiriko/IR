In this paper, we present the preliminary optical design of PANIC (PAnoramic
Near Infrared camera for Calar Alto), a wide-field infrared imager for the
Calar Alto 2.2 m telescope. The camera optical design is a folded single
optical train that images the sky onto the focal plane with a plate scale of
0.45 arcsec per 18 micron pixel. A mosaic of four Hawaii 2RG of 2k x 2k made by
Teledyne is used as detector and will give a field of view of 31.9 arcmin x
31.9 arcmin. This cryogenic instrument has been optimized for the Y, J, H and K
bands. Special care has been taken in the selection of the standard IR
materials used for the optics in order to maximize the instrument throughput
and to include the z band. The main challenges of this design are: to produce a
well defined internal pupil which allows reducing the thermal background by a
cryogenic pupil stop; the correction of off-axis aberrations due to the large
field available; the correction of chromatic aberration because of the wide
spectral coverage; and the capability of introduction of narrow band filters
(~1%) in the system minimizing the degradation in the filter passband without a
collimated stage in the camera. We show the optomechanical error budget and
compensation strategy that allows our as built design to met the performances
from an optical point of view. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of the
design showing the performances of PANIC at the CAHA 3.5m telescope.
