The crystal structure of solid oxygen at low temperatures and at pressures up
to 7 GPa is studied by theoretical calculations. In the calculations, the
adiabatic potential of the crystal is approximated by a superposition of
pair-potentials between oxygen molecules calculated by an ab-initio method. The
monoclinic alpha structure is stable up to 6 GPa and calculated lattice
parameters agree well with experiments. The origin of a distortion and that of
an anisotropic lattice compressibility of the basal plane of alpha-O2 are
clearly demonstrated. In the pressure range from 6 to 7 GPa, two kinds of
structures are proposed by X-ray diffraction experiments: the alpha and
orthorhombic delta structures. It is found that the energy difference between
these structures becomes very small in this pressure range. The relation
between this trend and the incompatible results of X-ray diffraction
experiments is discussed.
