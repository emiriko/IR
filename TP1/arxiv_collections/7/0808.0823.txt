The Kroll-Lee-Zumino renormalizable Abelian quantum field theory of pions and
a massive rho-meson is used to calculate the scalar radius of the pion at next
to leading (one loop) order in perturbation theory. Due to renormalizability,
this determination involves no free parameters. The result is $<r^2_\pi>_s =
0.40 {fm}^2$. This value gives for $\bar{\ell}_4$, the low energy constant of
chiral perturbation theory, $\bar{\ell}_4 = 3.4$, and $F_\pi/F = 1.05$, where F
is the pion decay constant in the chiral limit. Given the level of accuracy in
the masses and the $\rho\pi\pi$ coupling, the only sizable uncertainty in this
result is due to the (uncalculated) NNLO contribution.
