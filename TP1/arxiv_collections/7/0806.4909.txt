We review the status of Monte Carlo generators presently used for simulations
of the large-angle Bhabha process at electron-positron colliders of moderately
high energy (flavour factories), operating at centre-of-mass energies between
about 1 GeV and 10 GeV. It is shown how the theoretical accuracy reached by
present Bhabha programs for physics at flavour factories is at the level of
0.1% and, therefore, comparable with that reached about a decade ago for
luminosity monitoring through small-angle Bhabha scattering at LEP.
