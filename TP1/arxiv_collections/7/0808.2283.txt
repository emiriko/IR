We determine the stability, the geometry, the electronic and magnetic
structure of hydrogen-terminated graphene-nanoribbons edges as a function of
the hydrogen content of the environment by means of density functional theory.
Antiferromagnetic zigzag ribbons are stable only at extremely-low ultra-vacuum
pressures. Under more standard conditions, the most stable structures are the
mono- and di-hydrogenated armchair edges and a zigzag edge reconstruction with
one di- and two mono-hydrogenated sites. At high hydrogen-concentration
``bulk'' graphene is not stable and spontaneously breaks to form ribbons, in
analogy to the spontaneous breaking of graphene into small-width nanoribbons
observed experimentally in solution. The stability and the existence of exotic
edge electronic-states and/or magnetism is rationalized in terms of simple
concepts from organic chemistry (Clar's rule)
