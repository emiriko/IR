The book argues ICT are part of the set of goods and services that determine
quality of life, social inequality and the chances for economic development.
Therefore understanding the digital divide demands a broader discussion of the
place of ICT within each society and in the international system. The author
argues against the perspectives that either isolates ICT from other basic
social goods (in particular education and employment) as well as those that
argue that new technologies are luxury of a consumer society. Though the author
accepts that new technologies are not a panacea for the problems of inequality,
access to them become a condition of full integration of social life. Using
examples mainly from Latin America, the work presents some general policy
proposals on the fight against the digital divide which take in consideration
other dimensions of social inequality and access to public goods.
