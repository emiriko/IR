The free energy of a Quark-Gluon Plasma fireball in the hadronic medium is
calculated in the Ramanathan et al. statistical model including the effect of
curvature. The result with this curvature is found to produce significant
improvement from earlier results in all the parameters we calculated. The
surface tension with this curvature effect is found to be $ 0.17 T_{c}^{3}$,
which is two times the earlier value of surface tension which is $ 0.078
T_{c}^{3} $, and it is nearly close to the lattice value $0.24 T_{c}^{3} $. The
speed of sound calculated with curvature correction is still found to be
smaller in comparision with the standard speed of sound in the QGP droplet.
