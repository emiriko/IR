In this work we have proposed a scheme for generating $N$ qubit entangled
states which can teleport an unknown state perfectly. By switching on the
exchange interaction ($J$) between the qubits one can get the desired states
periodically. A multi electron quantum dot can be a possible realization for
generating such $N$ qubit states with high fidelity. In the limit of $N \to
\infty$, there exists a unique time $t=\frac{1}{J}\cos^{-1}(-1/8)$ where the
Hamiltonian dynamics gives the $N$ qubit state that can assist perfect
teleportation. We have also discussed the effect of the nuclear spin
environment on the fidelity of teleportation for a general $N$ qubit entangled
channel.
