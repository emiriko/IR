The physics of the "Pi" phase shift in ferromagnetic Josephson junctions
enables a range of applications for spin-electronic devices and quantum
computing. In this respect our research is devoted to the evaluation of the
best materials for the development and the realization of the quantum devices
based on superconductors and at the same point towards the reduction of the
size of the employed heterostructures towards and below nano-scale. In this
chapter we report our investigation of transitions from "0" to "Pi" states in
Nb Josephson junctions with strongly ferromagnetic barriers of Co, Ni,
Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) and Fe. We show that it is possible to fabricate
nanostructured Nb/ Ni(Co, Py, Fe)/Nb $\pi$-junctions with a nano-scale magnetic
dead layer and with a high level of control over the ferromagnetic barrier
thickness variation. In agreement with the theoretical model we estimate, from
the oscillations of the critical current as function of the ferromagnetic
barrier thickness, the exchange energy of the ferromagnetic material and we
obtain that it is close to bulk ferromagnetic materials implying that the
ferromagnet is clean and S/F roughness is minimal. We conclude that S/F/S
Josephson junctions are viable structures in the development of
superconductor-based quantum electronic devices; in particular Nb/Co/Nb and
Nb/Fe/Nb multilayers with their low value of the magnetic dead layer and high
value of the exchange energy can readily be used in controllable two-level
quantum information systems. In this respect, we discuss applications of our
nano-junctions to engineering magnetoresistive devices such as programmable
pseudo-spin-valve Josephson structures.
