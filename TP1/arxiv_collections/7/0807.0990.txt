A new model is suggested and used to mimic various spatial or temporal
designs in biological or non biological formations where the focus is on the
normal or irregular electrical signals coming from human heart (ECG) or brain
(EEG). The electrical activities in several muscles (EMG) or neurons or other
organs of human or various animals, such as lobster pyloric neuron, guinea pig
inferior olivary neuron, sepia giant axon and mouse neocortical pyramidal
neuron and some spatial formations are also considered (in Appendix). In the
biological applications, several elements (cells or tissues) in an organ are
taken as various entries in a representative lattice (mesh) where the entries
are connected to each other in terms of some molecular diffusions or electrical
potential differences. The biological elements evolve in time (with the given
tissue or organ) in terms of the mentioned connections (interactions) besides
some individual feedings. The anatomical diversity of the species (or organs)
is handled in terms of various combinations of the assumptions and parameters
for the initial conditions, the connections and the feeding terms and so on. A
small number of (iterative) secular equations (coupled map) are solved for the
results with few parameters for each case. The same equations may be used for
simulation if random parameters are involved. The model, with simple
mathematics and easy software, may be followed besides or instead of the known
theoretical approaches. The basic aim of the present contribution is to mimic
various empirical data for some electrical activities of human heart or brain
(or various animals). The mentioned empirical data are available in various
experimental literatures (which are cited or the open access data are borrowed)
and the model results may be considered as in good agreement with them.
