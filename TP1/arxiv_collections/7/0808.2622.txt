We report on the first observation of the photofragmentation dynamics of
SF$_2^+$. With the aid of state-of-the-art ab initio calculations on the
low-lying excited cationic states of SF$_2^+$ performed by Lee et al. [J. Chem.
Phys. 125, 104304 (2006)], a predissociation channel of SF$_2^+$ is evidenced
by means of resonance-enhanced multilphoton ionization spectroscopy. This work
represents a second experimental investigation on the low-lying excited
cationic states of SF$_2^+$. [The first one is the He I photoelectron spectrum
of SF$_2^+$ reported by de Leeuw et al. three decades ago, see Chem. Phys. 34,
287 (1978).]
