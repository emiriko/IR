We study accelerating Universes with power-law scale-factors. We include
shear and vorticity, a cosmological "constant" term, and spin from torsion, as
in Einstein-Cartan's theory when a scalar-field of Brans-Dicke type acts in the
model. We find a "no-hair" result, for shear and vorticity; we also make
contact with the alternative Machian picture of the Universe. Keywords:
