Single top quark processes are interesting as direct probes of the $Wtb$
vertex, and are also an important background in searches of the Higgs boson and
beyond the standard model physics. Both ATLAS and CMS have performed studies
with simulated data to estimate the expected uncertainty on the production
cross section measurements of the three single top processes ($t$-channel,
s-channel, $tW$ production) in the first years of LHC operations. Results in
the different channels and for the two experiments are reported.
