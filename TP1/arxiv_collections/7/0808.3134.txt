The current status of B -> Xs gamma decay rate calculations is summarized.
Missing ingredients at the NNLO level are listed. The global normalization
factor and non-perturbative effects are discussed. Arguments are presented that
results for the cutoff-enhanced perturbative corrections have been misused in
Ref. [15] by applying them in the region E_gamma \in [1.0, 1.6] GeV, which
means that the corresponding numerical effect on BR(B -> Xs gamma, E_gamma >
1.6 GeV) is unreliable.
