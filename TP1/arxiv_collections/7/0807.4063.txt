We demonstrate a technique that allows to fully control the bandwidth of
entangled photons independently of the frequency band of interest and of the
nonlinear crystal. We show that this technique allows to generate nearly
transform-limited biphotons with almost one octave of bandwidth (hundreds of
THz) which corresponds to correlation times of just a few femtoseconds. The
presented method becomes an enabling tool for attosecond entangled-photons
quantum optics. The technique can also be used to generate paired photons with
a very high degree of entanglement.
