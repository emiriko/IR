A celebrated theorem of Klein implies that any hypergeometric differential
equation with algebraic solutions is a pull-back of one of the few standard
hypergeometric equations with algebraic solutions. The most interesting cases
are hypergeometric equations with tetrahedral, octahedral or icosahedral
monodromy groups. We give an algorithm for computing Klein's pull-back
coverings in these cases, based on certain explicit expressions (Darboux
evaluations) of algebraic hypergeometric functions. The explicit expressions
can be computed using contiguous relations and a data base of simplest Darboux
evaluations (covering the Schwarz table). Klein's pull-back transformations
also induce algebraic transformations between hypergeometric solutions and a
standard hypergeometric function with the same finite monodromy group.
