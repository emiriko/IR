A general expression for a relative invariant of a linear ordinary
differential equations is given in terms of the fundamental semi-invariant and
an absolute invariant. This result is used to established a number of
properties of relative invariants, and it is explicitly shown how to generate
fundamental sets of relative and absolute invariants of all orders for the
general linear equation. Explicit constructions are made for the linear ODE of
order five. The approach used for the explicit determination of invariants is
based on an infinitesimal method.
