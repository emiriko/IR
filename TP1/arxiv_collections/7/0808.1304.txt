We study the stability of the paired fermionic p-wave superfluid made out of
identical atoms all in the same hyperfine state close to a p-wave Feshbach
resonance. First we reproduce known results concerning the lifetime of a 3D
superfluid, in particular, we show that it decays at the same rate as its
interaction energy, thus precluding its equilibration before it decays. Then we
proceed to study its stability in case when the superfluid is confined to 2D by
means of an optical harmonic potential. We find that the relative stability is
somewhat improved in 2D in the BCS regime, such that the decay rate is now
slower than the appropriate interaction energy scale. The improvement in
stability, however, is not dramatic and one probably needs to look for other
mechanisms to suppress decay to create a long lived 2D p-wave fermionic
superfluid.
