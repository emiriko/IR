Quark-gluon plasmas formed in heavy ion collisions at high energies are well
described by ideal classical fluid equations with nearly zero viscosity. It is
believed that a similar fluid permeated the entire universe at about three
microseconds after the big bang. The estimated Reynolds number for this
quark-gluon plasma at 3 microseconds is approximately 10^19. The possibility
that quantum mechanics may be an emergent property of a turbulent proto-fluid
is tentatively explored. A simple relativistic fluid equation which is
consistent with general relativity and is based on a cosmic dust model is
studied. A proper time transformation transforms it into an inviscid Burgers
equation. This is analyzed numerically using a spectral method. Soliton-like
solutions are demonstrated for this system, and these interact with the known
ergodic behavior of the fluid to yield a stochastic and chaotic system which is
time reversible. Various similarities to quantum mechanics are explored.
