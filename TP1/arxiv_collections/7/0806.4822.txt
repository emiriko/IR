In 1998 the Adapted Ordering Method was developed for the study of the
representation theory of the superconformal algebras in two dimensions. It
allows: to determine the maximal dimension for a given type of space of
singular vectors, to identify all singular vectors by only a few coefficients,
to spot subsingular vectors and to set the basis for constructing embedding
diagrams. In this talk I introduce the present version of the Adapted Ordering
Method, published in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 41 (2008) 045201, which can be
applied to general Lie algebras and superalgebras and their generalizations,
provided they can be triangulated.
