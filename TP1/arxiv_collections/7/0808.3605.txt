The early stages of epitaxial graphene layer growth on the Si-terminated
6H-SiC(0001) are investigated by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and
depolarized Raman spectroscopy. The selection of the depolarized component of
the scattered light results in a significant increase in the C-C bond signal
over the second order SiC Raman signal, which allows to resolve submonolayer
growth, including individual, localized C=C dimers in a diamond-like carbon
matrix for AES C/Si ratio of $\sim$3, and a strained graphene layer with
delocalized electrons and Dirac single-band dispersion for AES C/Si ratio $>$6.
The linear strain, measured at room temperature, is found to be compressive,
which can be attributed to the large difference between the coefficients of
thermal expansion of graphene and SiC. The magnitude of the compressive strain
can be varied by adjusting the growth time at fixed annealing temperature.
