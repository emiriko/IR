The possibility that disorder may stabilize a superfluid phase of
para-hydrogen in two dimensions is investigated theoretically by means of
Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We model disorder using a random distribution
of scatterers, and study the thermodynamic behavior of the system as a function
of the scatterer density. Disorder gives rise to equilibrium glassy phases with
no superfluid properties. Indeed, the propensity for quantum exchanges of
hydrogen molecules is reduced even with respect to what is observed if the
scatterers are arranged as a regular crystal, a physical setting that also
yields no superfluidity.
