In this review, we discuss some interesting issues in charm physics which is
full with puzzles and challenges. So far in the field there exist many problems
which have not obtained satisfactory answers yet and more unexpected phenomena
have been observed at the present facilities of high energy physics. Charm
physics may become an ideal place for searching new resonances and studying
non-perturbative QCD effects, moreover probably is an area to explore new
physics beyond the Standard Model. More data will be available at BESIII,
B-factories, LHC and even future ILC which may open a wide window to a better
understanding of the nature.
