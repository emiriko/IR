We propose a definition of center of mass for asymptotically flat manifolds
satisfying Regge-Teitelboim condition at infinity. This definition has a
coordinate-free expression and natural properties. Furthermore, we prove that
our definition is consistent both with the one proposed by Corvino and Schoen
and another by Huisken and Yau. The main tool is a new density theorem for data
satisfying the Regge-Teitelboim condition.
