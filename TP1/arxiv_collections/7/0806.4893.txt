Using the Crank-Nicholson method, we study the evolution of a Bose-Einstein
condensate in an optical lattice and harmonic trap. The condensate is excited
by displacing it from the center of the harmonic trap. The mean field plays an
important role in the Bloch-like oscillations that occur after sufficiently
large initial displacement. We find that a moderate mean field significantly
suppresses the dispersion of the condensate in momentum space. When the mean
field becomes large, soliton and vortex structures appear in the condensate
wavefunction.
