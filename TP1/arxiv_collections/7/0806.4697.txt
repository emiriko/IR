Withdrawn due to a likely error with the homeomorphism at line (4).
  Old abstract: In the monograph 'Limit Operators and their Applications in
Operator Theory', the authors define the operator spectrum of a band-dominated
operator T and prove that T is Fredholm if and only if all of the operators in
its operator spectrum are invertible with uniformly bounded inverses. They also
ask whether the uniform boundedness condition can in fact be dispensed with. In
this note we answer this question affirmatively.
