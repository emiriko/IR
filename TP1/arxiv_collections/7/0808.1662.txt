We consider a three dimensional, generalized version of the original SPP
model for collective motion. By extending the factors influencing the ordering,
we investigate the case when the movement of the self-propelled particles
(SPP-s) depends on both the velocity and the acceleration of the neighboring
particles, instead of being determined solely by the former one. By changing
the value of a weight parameter s determining the relative influence of the
velocity and the acceleration terms, the system undergoes a kinetic phase
transition as a function of a behavioral pattern. Below a critical value of s
the system exhibits disordered motion, while above it the dynamics resembles
that of the SPP model. We argue that in nature evolutionary processes can drive
the strategy variable s towards the critical point, where information exchange
between the units of a system is maximal.
