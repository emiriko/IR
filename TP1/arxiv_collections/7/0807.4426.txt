A non-Hermitian form of QED is presented which describes interacting Dirac
monopoles. The theory is related by a canonical transformation to a model
proposed by Milton. As in Hermitian QED an abelian gauge potential is coupled
to a four-component fermion. Under proper Lorentz transformations and
time-reversal the fermion field transforms like a Dirac spinor but has a
non-standard parity transformation. This implements the property that magnetic
charge, unlike electric charge, is parity-odd. A consequence of the
non-Hermiticity is that there is an attractive force between identical charged
particles, at least in the weakly coupled regime. This effect can be understood
even at the classical level; a simple calculation of the force between
classical Dirac monopoles is presented which shows that like charge monopoles
attract and opposite charges repel.
