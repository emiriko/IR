The great enumerator Germain Kreweras empirically discovered this intriguing
fact, and then needed lots of pages[K], and lots of human ingenuity, to prove
it. Other great enumerators, for example, Heinrich Niederhausen[N], Ira
Gessel[G1], and Mireille Bousquet-M\'elou[B], found other ingenious,
``simpler'' proofs. Yet none of them is as simple as ours! Our proof (with the
generous help of our faithful computers) is ``ugly'' in the traditional sense,
since it would be painful for a lowly human to follow all the steps. But
according to our humble aesthetic taste, this proof is much more elegant, since
it is (conceptually) one-line. So what if that line is rather long (a huge
partial-recurrence equation satisfied by the general counting function), it
occupies less storage than a very low-resolution photograph.
