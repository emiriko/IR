We construct infinite sequences of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms without fixed
points and leaving invariant a sequence of orientable measured foliations on
the same topological surface and the same stratum of the space of abelian
differentials. The existence of such sequences show that all pseudo-Anosov
homeomorphisms fixing orientable measured foliations cannot be obtained by the
Rauzy-Veech induction strategy.
