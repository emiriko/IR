One of the main advantages of proposed by P. Raimondi "Crab Waist" collision
scheme is a strong suppression of betatron resonances excited by beam-beam
interaction. Some qualitative explanations with numerical examples, describing
beam-beam resonances for different collision schemes, were given in
arXiv:physics/0702033. This paper can be considered as an "appendix"
(additional illustration) to that one. We performed a number of full 2D
betatron tune scans (beam-beam simulations) for different collision schemes, so
one can easily see how the beam-beam resonances appear and disappear, depending
on the colliding conditions.
