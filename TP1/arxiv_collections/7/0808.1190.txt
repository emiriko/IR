We present an energy expression for restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham theory
for N unpaired electrons and single-electron operators for all multiplets
formed from up to five unpaired electrons. It is shown that it is possible to
derive an explicit energy expression for all low-spin multiplets of systems
that exhibit neither radial nor cylindrical symmetry.
