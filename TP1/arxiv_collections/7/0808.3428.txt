Assuming that initial velocity and initial vorticity are bounded in the
plane, we show that on a sufficiently short time interval the unique solutions
of the Navier-Stokes equations converge uniformly to the unique solution of the
Euler equations as viscosity approaches zero. We also establish a rate of
convergence.
