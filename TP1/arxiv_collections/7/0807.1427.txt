We search for a non-SM-like CP-odd Higgs boson (a0_1) with m(a0_1)< 2m(b) in
radiative decays of the Upsilon(1S), using 21.5M Upsilon(1S) mesons directly
produced in e+e- annihilation. We investigate a0_1 --> tau+tau- and a0_1 -->
mu+mu- decay channels. No significant signal is found. We obtain upper limits
on the product of B(Upsilon(1S)-->gamma a0_1) and B(a0_1-->tau+tau-) or
B(a0_1-->mu+mu-). Our tau+tau- results are almost two orders of magnitude more
stringent than previous upper limits. Our data provide no evidence for a Higgs
state with a mass of 214 MeV decaying to mu+mu-. Existence of such a state was
previously proposed as an explanation for 3 Sigma+ --> p mu+mu- events, having
mu+mu- masses just above the kinematic threshold, observed by the HyperCP
experiment. Our results constrain NMSSM models.
