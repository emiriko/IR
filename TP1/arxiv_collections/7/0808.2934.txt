The search for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics is one of the major
tasks of the LHC, CERN. In these proceedings, I review the status of searches
for Supersymmetry by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. The efforts in both the
hadronic and leptonic search channels are presented. A special focus is placed
on the treatment of approximately one inverse femtobarn of early LHC data, and
examples of background estimation techniques in such a dataset are given.
Phenomenologically, besides "typical" mSUGRA scenarios, signatures based on
prompt and non-pointing photons, as well as long-lived leptons and hadrons
(R-hadrons) are covered.
