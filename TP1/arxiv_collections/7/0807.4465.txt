We solve the Percus-Yevick equation in even dimensions by reducing it to a
set of simple integro-differential equations. This work generalizes an approach
we developed previously for hard discs. We numerically obtain both the pair
correlation function and the virial coefficients for a fluid of hyper-spheres
in dimensions $d=4,6$ and 8, and find good agreement with available exact
results and Monte-Carlo simulations. This paper confirms the alternating
character of the virial series for $d \ge 6$, and provides the first evidence
for an alternating character for $d=4$. Moreover, we show that this sign
alternation is due to the existence of a branch point on the negative real
axis. It is this branch point that determines the radius of convergence of the
virial series, whose value we determine explicitly for $d=4,6,8$. Our results
complement, and are consistent with, a recent study in odd dimensions [R.D.
