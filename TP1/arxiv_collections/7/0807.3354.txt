In a long wavelength regime, the effective properties of particulate
composites, including nanocomposites, may be estimated using one of various
homogenization formalisms, such as the Bruggeman and Maxwell Garnett
formalisms, and the approach of the strong--property--fluctuation theory
(SPFT). In the conventional implementations of these formalisms, the
constituent particles are treated as point--like scattering centres. However,
extended formalisms have been established--which involve integral
formulations--that take account of the spatial extent of the constituent
particles. In particular, the extended second--order SPFT takes account of both
the size of the constituent particles and their statistical distributions. We
derive explicit representations of the extended second--order SPFT appropriate
to isotropic chiral and uniaxial dielectric homogenized composite mediums.
These results may also be employed in extended versions of the Bruggeman and
Maxwell Garnett formalisms.
