We report the characterization of layered, 2H-type CuxTaS2, for x between 0
and 0.12. The charge density wave (CDW), at 70 K for TaS2, is destabilized with
Cu doping. The sub-1K superconducting transition in undoped 2H-TaS2 jumps
quickly to 2.5 K at low x, increases to 4.5 K at the optimal composition
Cu0.04TaS2, and then decreases at higher x. The electronic contribution to the
specific heat, first increasing and then decreasing as a function of Cu
content, is 12 mJ mol-1 K-2 at Cu0.04TaS2. Electron diffraction studies show
that the CDW remains present at the optimal superconducting composition, but
with both a changed q vector and decreased coherence length. We present an
electronic phase diagram for the system.
