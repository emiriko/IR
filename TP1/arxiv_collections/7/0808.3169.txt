Using the representation of the isometries as 2x2 invertible matrices over
the division algebra $\H$ of quaternions, we give an algebraic characterization
of the dynamical types of the orientation-preserving isometries of the
hyperbolic 5-space. We also determine the conjugacy classes and the conjugacy
classes of centralizers or the z-classes in $GL(2, \H)$.
