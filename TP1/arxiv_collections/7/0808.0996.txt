The ground state properties of CeCoPO, a homologue of the new high
temperature superconductors RFePnO1-xFx, were studied by means of
susceptibility, specific heat, and resistivity measurements on polycrystals.
The observation of a well defined Curie-Weiss behavior above 230K with
mu_eff=2.9mu_B and a ferromagnetic ordering below T_C=75K is similar to what
was observed in LaCoPO and points to magnetism of the Co-3d electrons. However,
the Ce-ions are on the border to magnetism with a Kondo scale of T_K~40K and
show an enhanced Sommerfeld-coefficient of \gamma~200mJ/molK^2.
