The electronic Raman scattering of bulk graphite at zero magnetic field
reveals a structureless signal characteristic of a metal. For T<~100 K and B >
2 T, several peaks at energies scaling linearly with magnetic field were
observed and ascribed to transitions from the lowest energy Landau level(s)
(LL) to excited states belonging to the same ladder. The LLs are equally
(unequally) spaced for high (low) quantum numbers, being surprisingly
consistent with the LL sequence from massive Dirac Fermions (m* = 0.033(2) m_e)
with Berry's phase 2\pi found in graphene bilayers. These results provide
spectroscopic evidence that much of the unconventional physics recently
revealed by graphene multilayers is also shared by bulk graphite.
