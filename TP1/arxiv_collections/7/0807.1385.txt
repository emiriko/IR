We study the electron wave packet moving through a bent channel. We
demonstrate that the packet transmission probability becomes an uneven function
of the magnetic field when the electron packet is capacitively coupled to a
metal plate. The coupling occurs through a non-linear potential which
translates a different kinetics of the transport for opposite magnetic field
orientations into a different potential felt by the scattered electron.
