We define a positive operator valued measure $E$ on $[0,2\pi]\times R$
describing the measurement of randomly sampled quadratures in quantum homodyne
tomography, and we study its probabilistic properties. Moreover, we give a
mathematical analysis of the relation between the description of a state in
terms of $E$ and the description provided by its Wigner transform.
