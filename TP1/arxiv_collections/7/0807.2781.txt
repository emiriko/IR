We show that a 3-spherical building in which each rank 2 residue is connected
far away from a chamber, and each rank 3 residue is simply 2-connected far away
from a chamber, admits a twinning (i.e., is one half of a twin building) as
soon as it admits a codistance, i.e., a twinning with a single chamber.
