A particular discrete rhombohedral lattice consisting of four symmetrically
interlaced cuboctahedral point lattices is described that is interesting
because of the high degree of symmetry it exhibits. The four constituent
cuboctahedral lattices are denoted by four colours and the composite lattice is
referred to as a 4-colour rhombohedral lattice. Each point of the 4-colour
lattice can be referenced by an integer 4-tuple containing only the positive
non-zero integers (the counting numbers). The relationship between the discrete
rhombohedral lattice and a discrete Cartesian lattice is explained. Some
interesting aspects of the lattice and of the counting-number 4-tuple
coordinate system are pointed out.
