Optics-less cutaneous (skin) vision is not rare among living organisms,
though its mechanisms and capabilities have not been thoroughly investigated.
This paper demonstrates, using methods from statistical parameter estimation
theory and numerical simulations, that an array of bare sensors with a natural
cosine-law angular sensitivity arranged on a flat or curved surface has the
ability to perform imaging tasks without any optics at all. The working
principle of this type of optics-less sensor and the model developed here for
determining sensor performance may be used to shed light upon possible
mechanisms and capabilities of cutaneous vision in nature.
