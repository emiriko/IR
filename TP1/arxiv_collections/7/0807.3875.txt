A new structural model for the Si(331)-(12x1) reconstruction is proposed.
Based on scanning tunneling microscopy images of unprecedented resolution,
low-energy electron diffraction data, and first-principles total-energy
calculations, we demonstrate that the reconstructed Si(331) surface shares the
same elementary building blocks as the Si(110)-(16x2) surface, establishing the
pentamer as a universal building block for complex silicon surface
reconstructions.
