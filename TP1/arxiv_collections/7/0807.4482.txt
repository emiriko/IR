It is shown that the Schrodinger equation can be cast in the form of two
coupled real conservation equations, in Euclidean spacetime in the free case
and in a five-dimensional Eisenhart geometry in the presence of an external
potential. This implies a novel two-phase quantum hydrodynamic model whose
Lagrangian picture provides an exact scheme to calculate the time-dependent
wavefunction from a continuum of deterministic trajectories where two points
are linked by at most two orbits. Properties of the model are examined,
including the appearance of entangled trajectories in separable states.
Wavefunction constructions employing alternative two-phase models are proposed.
