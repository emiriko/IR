We have investigated the electrical transport properties of Dirac electrons
in a monolayer graphene sheet in the presence of both electric and magnetic
modulations. The effects of the modulations on quantum transport when they are
in phase and out of phase are considered. We present the energy spectrum and
the bandwidth of the Dirac electrons in the presence of both the modulations.
We determine the $\sigma_{yy}$ component of the magnetoconductivity tensor for
this system which is shown to exhibit Weiss oscillations.Asymptotic expressions
for $\sigma_{yy}$ are also calculated to better illustrate the effects of
in-phase and out-of-phase modulations.We find that the position of the
oscillations in magnetoconductivity depends on the relative strength of the two
modulations. When the two modulations are out-of-phase there is complete
suppression of Weiss oscillations for particular relative strength of the
modulations.
