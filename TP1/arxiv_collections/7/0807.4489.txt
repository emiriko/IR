We present a detailed powder and single crystal neutron diffraction study of
the spin chain compound Ca3Co2O6. Below 25 K, the system orders magnetically
with a modulated partially disordered antiferromagnetic structure. We give a
description of the magnetic interactions in the system which is consistent with
this magnetic structure. Our study also reveals that the long-range magnetic
order co-exists with a shorter range order with a correlation length scale of
180 A in the ab plane. Remarkably, on cooling, the volume of material
exhibiting short range order increases at the expense of the long-range order.
