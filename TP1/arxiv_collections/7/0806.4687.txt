We give two results for computing doubly-twisted conjugacy relations in free
groups with respect to homomorphisms $\phi$ and $\psi$ such that certain
remnant words from $\phi$ are longer than the images of generators under
$\psi$.
  Our first result is a remnant inequality condition which implies that two
words $u$ and $v$ are not doubly-twisted conjugate. Further we show that if
$\psi$ is given and $\phi$, $u$, and $v$ are chosen at random, then the
probability that $u$ and $v$ are not doubly-twisted conjugate is 1. In the
particular case of singly-twisted conjugacy, this means that if $\phi$, $u$,
and $v$ are chosen at random, then $u$ and $v$ are not in the same
singly-twisted conjugacy class with probability 1.
  Our second result generalizes Kim's "bounded solution length". We give an
algorithm for deciding doubly-twisted conjugacy relations in the case where
$\phi$ and $\psi$ satisfy a similar remnant inequality. In the particular case
of singly-twisted conjugacy, our algorithm suffices to decide any twisted
conjugacy relation if $\phi$ has remnant words of length at least 2.
  As a consequence of our generic properties we give an elementary proof of a
recent result of Martino, Turner, and Ventura, that computes the densities of
injective and surjective homomorphisms from one free group to another. We
further compute the expected value of the density of the image of a
homomorphism.
