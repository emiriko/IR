This paper summarizes a new approach to supersymmetry breaking in the
supersymmetric standard model (SSM). The approach arises from some remarkable
features of the BRS cohomology for composite operators in the SSM, and the
behaviour of those operators when gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken. A new
realization of supersymmetry arises for these operators. This realization is
equivalent to the generation of supersymmetry anomalies, though they are not
present in the usual sense. The consequences are worked out in detail for the
electron and neutrino flavour triplets, by using the appropriate effective
action to analyze the new anomalous realization of supersymmetry. This
effective action generates a mass spectrum for leptons that is consistent with
present experimental data. There is no vacuum energy problem, and no annoying
mass sum rules are present.
