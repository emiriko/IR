We study the physical consequences of two diffferent but closely related
perturbation schemes applied to the Einstein-Maxwell equations. In one case the
starting space-time is flat while in the other case it is Schwarzschild. In
both cases the perturbation is due to a combined electric and magnetic dipole
field. We can see, within the Einstein-Maxwell equations a variety of physical
consequences. They range from induced gravitational energy-momentum loss, to a
well defined spin angular momentum with its loss and a center-of-mass with its
equations of motion.
