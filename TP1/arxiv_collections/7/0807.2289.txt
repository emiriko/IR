We report on the first real-time implementation of a quantum key distribution
(QKD) system using entangled photon pairs that are sent over two free-space
optical telescope links. The entangled photon pairs are produced with a type-II
spontaneous parametric down-conversion source placed in a central, potentially
untrusted, location. The two free-space links cover a distance of 435 m and
1,325 m respectively, producing a total separation of 1,575 m. The system
relies on passive polarization analysis units, GPS timing receivers for
synchronization, and custom written software to perform the complete QKD
protocol including error correction and privacy amplification. Over 6.5 hours
during the night, we observed an average raw key generation rate of 565 bits/s,
an average quantum bit error rate (QBER) of 4.92%, and an average secure key
generation rate of 85 bits/s.
