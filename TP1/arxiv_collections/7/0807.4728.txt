In this paper we study the dynamics of self gravitating spherically symmetric
thin shells of counter rotating particles. We consider all possible velocity
distributions for the particles, and show that the equations of motion by
themselves do not constrain this distribution. We therefore consider the
dynamical stability of the resulting configurations under several possible
processes. This include the stability of static configurations as a whole,
where we find a lower bound for the compactness of the shells. We analyze also
the stability of the single particle orbits, and find conditions for "single
particle evaporation". Finally, in the case of a shell with particles whose
angular momenta are restricted to two values, we consider the conditions for
stability under splitting into two separate shells. This analysis leads to the
conclusion that under certain conditions, that are given explicitly, an
evolving shell may split into one or more separate shells. We provide explicit
examples to illustrate this phenomenon. We also include a derivation of the
thick to thin shell limit for an Einstein shell that shows that the limiting
distribution of angular momenta is unique, covering continuously a finite range
of values.
