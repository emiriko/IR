The possibility of the composition control of the GaAs1-xPx solid solution on
the GaAs substrate at liquid phase electroepitaxy from the Ga-As-P
solution-melt is theoretically considered. By the simulation it was determined,
that under steady-state conditions specifying such parameters of the process as
the temperature and/or the thickness of the growth space it is possible to
obtain graded bandgap layers of the GaAs1-xPx solid solution with increasing of
the content of P towards the surface of the layer that possess the composition
gradient from 0.5x10-4 mole fraction/nm to 2.0x10-3 mole fraction/nm. It was
also shown that control of the composition of ternary solid solutions at liquid
phase electroepitaxy can be realized by use of unsteady state electric field.
