We present a systematic pressure study of poly- and single crystalline
SrFe2As2 by electrical resistivity and X-ray diffraction measurements. SrFe2As2
exhibits a structural phase transition from a tetragonal to an orthorhombic
phase at T0=205 K. The structural phase transition is intimately linked to a
spin-density-wave transition taking place at the same temperature. Our pressure
experiments show that T0 shifts to lower temperatures with increasing pressure.
We can estimate a critical pressure of 4 to 5 GPa for the suppression of T0 to
zero temperature. At pressures above 2.5 GPa the resistivity decreases
significantly below Tx=40 K hinting at the emergence of superconductivity but
no zero-resistance state is observed up to 3 GPa.
