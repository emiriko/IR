The Mann-Marolf surface term is a specific candidate for the "reference
background term" that is to be subtracted from the Gibbons-Hawking surface term
in order make the total gravitational action of asymptotically flat spacetimes
finite. That is, the total gravitational action is taken to be:
  (Einstein-Hilbert bulk term) + (Gibbons-Hawking surface term) - (Mann-Marolf
surface term).
  As presented by Mann and Marolf, their surface term is specified implicitly
in terms of the Ricci tensor of the boundary. Herein I demonstrate that for the
physically interesting case of a (3+1) dimensional bulk spacetime, the
Mann-Marolf surface term can be specified explicitly in terms of the Einstein
tensor of the (2+1) dimensional boundary.
