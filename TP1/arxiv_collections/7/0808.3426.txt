Clozel and Labesse proved the base change fundamental lemma for spherical
Hecke algebras attached to an unramified group over a p-adic field. This paper
proves an analogous fundamental lemma for centers of parahoric Hecke algebras
attached to the same class of groups. This provides an ingredient needed for
the author's program to study Shimura varieties with parahoric level structure
at p.
