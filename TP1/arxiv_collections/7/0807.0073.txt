It is proved that the ground state under the supreme single-site
approximation (S^3A), the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), or the dynamical
coherent potential approximation (DCPA) is the normal Fermi liquid in the
presence of an infinitesimally weak hybridization with an electron reservoir,
except for the just half filling of electrons and the infinite on-site
repulsion. In the strong-coupling regime, in particular, the Fermi liquid is
stabilized under S^3A, DMFT, or DCPA by the Kondo effect, which stabilizes a
local singlet on each unit cell, and is further stabilized beyond it by the
Fock-type term of the superexchange interaction or a resonating valence bond
(RVB) mechanism, which stabilizes a local singlet on each pair of nearest
neighbors. The Fermi liquid is a relevant normal state to study possible
lower-temperature phases or the true ground state. It is proposed that the
Fermi liquid stabilized by the Kondo effect and the RVB mechanism is the normal
state of cuprate high-temperature superconductors.
