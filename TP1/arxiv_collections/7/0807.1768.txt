We carefully examine the negative refractive index slab perfect lens theory
by Pendry and point out an inconsistency that can be resolved. As a result, we
find negative index slabs do not amplify or enhance evanescent waves and
therefore they do not make a perfect lens in the sense that was originally
suggested.
