Quantum field theory has been shown recently renormalizable on flat Moyal
space and better behaved than on ordinary space-time. Some models at least
should be completely finite, even beyond perturbation theory. In this paper a
first step is taken to extend such theories to non-flat backgrounds such as
solvable symmetric spaces.
