The Stark deceleration of OH radicals in both low-field-seeking and
high-field-seeking levels of the rovibronic ${}^2\Pi_{3/2},v=0,J=3/2$ ground
state is demonstrated using a single experimental setup. Applying
alternating-gradient focusing, OH radicals in their low-field-seeking
${}^2\Pi_{3/2},v=0,J=3/2,f$ state have been decelerated from 345 m/s to 239
m/s, removing 50 % of the kinetic energy using only 27 deceleration stages. The
alternating-gradient decelerator allows to independently control longitudinal
and transverse manipulation of the molecules. Optimized high-voltage switching
sequences for the alternating-gradient deceleration are applied, in order to
adjust the dynamic focusing strength in every deceleration stage to the
changing velocity over the deceleration process. In addition we have also
decelerated OH radicals in their high-field-seeking ${}^2\Pi_{3/2},v=0,J=3/2,e$
state from 355 m/s to 316 m/s. For the states involved, a real crossing of
hyperfine levels occurs at 640 V/cm, which is examined by varying a bias
voltage applied to the electrodes.
