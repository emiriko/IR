Phase transition in fullerenes C60 and C240 are investigated by means of
constant-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. In the phase transition
region, the assembly (and fragmentation) of the C60 cage from (and to) the
gaseous state is demonstrated via the dynamical coexistence of two phases. In
this critical region, the fullerene system is seen to continuously oscillate
between the carbon cage (the solid phase) and the state of carbon dimers and
short chains (the gas phase). These oscillations correspond to consecutive
disintegration and formation of the fullerene. Furthermore, the
temperature-dependent heat capacity of the fullerene features a prominent peak,
signifying the finite system analogue of a first-order phase transition. The
simulations were conducted for 500 ns using a topologically-constrained
pairwise forcefield which was developed for this work. Results of the
simulations were supplemented by a statistical mechanics analysis to account
for entropy and pressure corrections, corresponding to experimental conditions.
These corrections lead to a phase transition temperature of 3800-4200 K for
pressure 10-100 kPa, in good agreement with available experimental values.
