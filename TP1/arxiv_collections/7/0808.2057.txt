Quantum computation in the one-way model requires the preparation of certain
resource states known as cluster states. We describe how the construction of
continuous-variable cluster states for optical quantum computing relate to the
existence of certain families of matrices. The relevant matrices are known as
weighing matrices, with a few additional constraints. We prove some results
regarding the structure of these matrices, and their associated graphs.
