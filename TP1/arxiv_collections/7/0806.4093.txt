Hochschild two-cocycles play an important role in the deformation \`a la
Gerstenhaber of associative algebras. The aim of this paper is to introduce the
category of Hoch-algebras whose objects are associative algebras equipped with
an extra magmatic operation \succ verifying the Hochschild two-cocycle
relation:
  (x \succ y)*z+ (x*y)\succ z= x\succ (y*z)+ x*(y\succ z).
  The free Hoch-algebra over a K-vector space is given in terms of planar
rooted trees and the triples of operads (As,Hoch, Mag^\infty) endowed with the
infinitesimal relations are shown to be good. We then obtain an equivalence of
categories between connected infinitesimal Hoch-bialgebras and
Mag^\infty-algebras.
