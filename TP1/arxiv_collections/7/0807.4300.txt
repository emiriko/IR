A mixed Ising-Heisenberg spin system consisting of triangular XXZ-Heisenberg
spin clusters assembled into a chain by alternating with Ising spins
interacting to all three spins in the triangle is considered. The exact
solution of the model is given in terms of the generalized
decoration--iteration map and within the transfer-matrix technique. Exact
expressions for thermodynamic functions are derived. Ground state phase
diagrams, thermodynamic and magnetic properties of the system are examined.
