Simple supersymmetric SO(10) GUT in five dimensions is proposed, in which the
fifth dimension is compactified on the $S^1/(Z_2\times Z_2^\prime)$ orbifold
with two inequivalent branes at the orbifold fixed points. In this model, all
matter and Higgs multiplets reside on one brane (PS brane) where the Pati-Salam
(PS) symmetry is manifest, while only the SO(10) gauge multiplet resides on the
bulk. The supersymmetry breaking on the other brane (SO(10) brane) is
transmitted to the PS brane through the gaugino mediation with the bulk gauge
multiplet. We examine sparticle mass spectrum in this setup and show that the
neutralino LSP as the dark matter candidate can be realized when the
compactification scale of the fifth dimension is higher than the PS symmetry
breaking scale, keeping the successful gauge coupling unification after
incorporating threshold corrections of Kaluza-Klein modes of the bulk gauge
multiplets.
