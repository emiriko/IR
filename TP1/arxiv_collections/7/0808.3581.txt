When locally exciting a quantum lattice model, the excitation will propagate
through the lattice. The effect is responsible for a wealth of non-equilibrium
phenomena, and has been exploited to transmit quantum information through spin
chains. It is a commonly expressed belief that for local Hamiltonians, any such
propagation happens at a finite "speed of sound". Indeed, the Lieb-Robinson
theorem states that in spin models, all effects caused by a perturbation are
limited to a causal cone defined by a constant speed, up to exponentially small
corrections. In this work we show that for translationally invariant bosonic
models with nearest-neighbor interactions, this belief is incorrect: We prove
that one can encounter excitations which accelerate under the natural dynamics
of the lattice and allow for reliable transmission of information faster than
any finite speed of sound. The effect is only limited by the model's range of
validity (eventually by relativity). It also implies that in non-equilibrium
dynamics of strongly correlated bosonic models far-away regions may become
quickly entangled, suggesting that their simulation may be much harder than
that of spin chains even in the low energy sector.
