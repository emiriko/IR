We present the result of a full direct component calculation for the planar
four-loop anomalous dimension of the Konishi operator in N =4 Supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory. Our result confirms the results obtained from superfield
(arXiv:0712.3522, arXiv:0806.2095) and superstring (arXiv:0807.0399)
computations, which take into account finite size corrections to the all-loop
asymptotic Bethe ansatz for the integrable models describing the spectrum of
the anomalous dimensions of the gauge-invariant operators and the spectrum of
the string states in the framework of the gauge/string duality.
