Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Fourier Transform STM (FT-STM),
we have studied a point defect in an epitaxial graphene sample grown on silicon
carbide substrate. This analysis allows us to extract the quasiparticle energy
dispersion, and to give a first experimental proof of the validity of Fermi
liquid theory in graphene for a wide range of energies from -800 meV to +800
meV. We also find evidence of a strong threefold anisotropy in the standing
waves generated by the defect. We discuss possible relations between this
anisotropy, the chirality of the electrons, and the asymmetry between
graphene's two sublattices. All experimental measurements are compared and
related to theoretical T-matrix calculations.
