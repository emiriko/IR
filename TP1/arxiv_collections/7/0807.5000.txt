Strange quark contributions to the neutrino (antineutrino) scattering are
investigated on the elastic neutrino-nucleon scattering and the
neutrino-nucleus scattering for 12C target in the quasi-elastic region on the
incident energy of 500 MeV, within the framework of a relativistic single
particle model. For the neutrino-nucleus scattering, the effects of final state
interaction for the knocked-out nucleon are included by a relativistic optical
potential. In the cross sections we found some cancellations of the strange
quark contributions between the knocked-out protons and neutrons. Consequently,
the asymmetries between the incident neutrino and antineutrino which is the
ratio of neutral current to charged current, and the difference between the
asymmetries are shown to be able to yield more feasible quantities for the
strangeness effects. In order to explicitly display importance of the
cancellations, results of the exclusive reaction 16O(\nu, \nu' p) are
additionally presented for detecting the strangeness effects.
