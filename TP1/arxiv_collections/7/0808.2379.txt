In this work, I have considered that the universe is filled with normal
matter and phantom field (or tachyonic field). If the universe is filled with
scalar field, Ellis et al have shown that emergent scenario is possible only
for $k=+1$ i.e. for closed universe and here I have shown that the emergent
scenario is possible for closed universe if the universe contains normal
tachyonic field. But for phantom field (or tachyonic field), the negative
kinetic term can generate the emergent scenario for all values of $k ~(=0,\pm
1)$. From recently developed statefinder parameters, the behaviour of different
stages of the evolution of the emergent universe have been studied. The static
Einstein universe and the stability analysis have been briefly discussed for
both phantom and tachyon models.
