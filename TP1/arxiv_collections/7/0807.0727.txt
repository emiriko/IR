It is theoretically shown that the excess liquid-liquid interfacial tension
between two electrolyte solutions as a function of the ionic strength I behaves
asymptotically as O(- I^0.5) for small I and as O(+- I) for large I. The former
regime is dominated by the electrostatic potential due to an unequal
partitioning of ions between the two liquids whereas the latter regime is
related to a finite interfacial thickness. The crossover between the two
asymptotic regimes depends sensitively on material parameters suggesting that,
depending on the actual system under investigation, the experimentally
accessible range of ionic strengths can correspond to either the small or the
large ionic strength regime. In the limiting case of a liquid-gas surface where
ion partitioning is absent, the image chage interaction can dominate the
surface tension for small ionic strength I such that an Onsager-Samaras
limiting law O(- I ln(I)) is expected. The proposed picture is consistent with
more elaborate models and published measurements.
