We discuss transport properties of dynamical fluid composed of
quasi-particles whose masses depend on temperature and charge chemical
potentials. Based on the relativistic kinetic theory formulated under the
relaxation time approximation, we derive a general expression for the bulk
viscosity in the quasi-particle medium. We show that dynamically generated
particle masses imply an essential modification of the fluid compressibility.
As an application of our results we consider a class of quasi-particle models
with the chiral phase transition belonging to O(4) and Z(2) universality class.
Based on the Ginzburg-Landau and the scaling theory we study the critical
properties of the bulk viscosity zeta near the phase transition. We show that
under the relaxation time approximation the zeta is not expected to show
singular behavior near the O(4) and Z(2) critical point through static critical
exponents.
