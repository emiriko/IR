In the paper compact multiplier operators on Banach spaces of analytic
functions on the unit disk with the range in Banach sequence lattices are
studied. If the domain space $X$ is such that $H_\infty\hookrightarrow
X\hookrightarrow H_1$, necessary and sufficient conditions for compactness are
presented. Moreover, the calculation of the Hausdorff measure of noncompactness
for diagonal operators between Banach sequence lattices is applied to obtaining
the characterization of compact multipliers in case the domain space $X$
satisfies $H_\infty\hookrightarrow X\hookrightarrow H_2$.
