Radiation damage induced by ion beams is traditionally treated at different
levels of theoretical approaches, for the different scales and mechanisms
involved.We present here details of a combined approach that, from a method at
a nanoscopic scale, attempts to merge with higher scales existing results, by
tuning the analytical method employed when extended to larger scale and so
yielding a consistent picture of the entire process. Results will show the
possibility to get a good agreement with macroscale methods and, on the other
hand, to produce a reliable electron energy spectra to be used for DNA damage
estimations.
