We present high resolution measurements of the displacement and strain fields
near the tip of a dynamic (Mode I) crack. The experiments are performed on
polyacrylamide gels, brittle elastomers whose fracture dynamics mirror those of
typical brittle amorphous materials. Over a wide range of propagation
velocities ($0.2-0.8c_s$), we compare linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM)
to the measured near-tip fields. We find that, sufficiently near the tip, the
measured stress intensity factor appears to be non-unique, the crack tip
significantly deviates from its predicted parabolic form, and the strains ahead
of the tip are more singular than the $r^{-1/2}$ divergence predicted by LEFM.
These results show how LEFM breaks down as the crack tip is approached.
