We consider the ESK theory, based on the principle for which the space is
filled with matter fields in such a way that Cartan torsion is spin; in the
geometry in which Cartan torsion tensor is completely antisymmetric, spin has
to be completely antisymmetric: we will show how the complete antisymmetry of
spin constraints the form of possible matter field theories as to allow the
special case of the simplest one solely, all other most general cases being
excluded.
