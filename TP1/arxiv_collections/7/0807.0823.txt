Here we report the synthesis and basic characterization of LaFe1-xCoxAsO for
several values of x. The parent phase LaFeAsO orders antiferromagnetically (TN
~ 145 K). Replacing Fe with Co is expected to both electron dope the system and
introduce disorder in the FeAs layer. For x = 0.05 antiferromagnetic order is
destroyed and superconductivity is observed at Tconset = 11.2 K. For x = 0.11
superconductivity is observed at Tc(onset) = 14.3 K, and for x = 0.15 Tc = 6.0
K. Superconductivity is not observed for x = 0.2 and 0.5, but for x = 1, the
material appears to be ferromagnetic (Tc ~ 56 K) as judged by magnetization
measurements. We conclude that Co is an effective dopant to induce
superconductivity. Somewhat surprisingly, the system appears to tolerate
considerable disorder in the FeAs planes.
