After making modifications to the Reactive Empirical Bond Order potential for
Molecular Dynamics (MD) of Brenner et al. in order to make the model behave in
a more conventional manner, we discover that the new model exhibits detonation
instability, a first for MD. The instability is analyzed in terms of the
accepted theory.
