I have proposed a\textit{non-Abelian}and stochastic self-organized
criticality model in which each avalanche contains one stochastic site and all
remaining sites in the avalanche are deterministic with a constant threshold
$E_{c}^{I}$. Studies of avalanche structures, waves and autocorrelations, size
moments and probability distribution functions of avalanche size, for the
thresholds $4\leq E_{c}^{I}\leq256$, were performed. The shell-like avalanche
structures, correlated waves within avalanches, complex size moments and
probability distribution functions show multifractal scaling like the
\textit{Abelian} and deterministic BTW model despite the fact that the model is
\textit{non-Abelian}and stochastic with unbalanced relaxation rules at each
stochastic site.
