We show that the correlations in stochastic outputs of time-distributed weak
measurements can be used to study the dynamics of an individual quantum object,
with a proof-of-principle setup based on small Faraday rotation caused by a
single spin in a quantum dot. In particular, the third order correlation can
reveal the "true" spin decoherence, which would otherwise be concealed by the
inhomogeneous broadening effect in the second order correlations. The viability
of such approaches lies in that (1) in weak measurement the state collapse
which would disturb the system dynamics occurs at a very low probability, and
(2) a shot of measurement projecting the quantum object to a known basis state
serves as a starter or stopper of the evolution without pumping or coherently
controlling the system as otherwise required in conventional spin echo.
