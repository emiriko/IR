A unified treatment is given of low-weight modular forms on \Gamma_0(N),
N=2,3,4, that have Eisenstein series representations. For each N, certain
weight-1 forms are shown to satisfy a coupled system of nonlinear differential
equations, which yields a single nonlinear third-order equation, called a
generalized Chazy equation. As byproducts, a table of divisor function and
theta identities is generated by means of q-expansions, and a transformation
law under \Gamma_0(4) for the second complete elliptic integral is derived.
More generally, it is shown how Picard-Fuchs equations of triangle subgroups of
PSL(2,R) which are hypergeometric equations, yield systems of nonlinear
equations for weight-1 forms, and generalized Chazy equations. Each triangle
group commensurable with \Gamma(1) is treated.
