The goal of this paper is to define fermionic fields on causal set. This is
done by the use of holonomies to define vierbines, and then defining spinor
fields by taking advantage of the leftover degrees of freedom of holonomies
plus additional scalar fields. Grassmann nature is being enforced by allowing
measure to take both positive and negative values, and also by introducing a
vector space to have both commutting dot product and anticommutting wedge
product.
