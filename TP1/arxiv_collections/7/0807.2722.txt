We propose a new parametrization of the $B\to\pi$ vector form factor,
$f_+(q^2)$, as an expansion in powers of a conformal mapping variable, which
satisfies unitarity, analyticity and perturbative QCD scaling. The unitarity
constraint is used also for defining the systematic error of the expansion. We
fit with the new parametrization the available experimental and theoretical
information on exclusive $B\to\pi l\nu$ decays, making a conservative estimate
of the effects of correlations in the systematic and statistical errors of the
lattice results. With four parameters to describe $f_+(q^2)$, the systematic
error is negligible in the whole semileptonic region. We also obtain
$|V_{ub}|=(3.54 \pm 0.30) \times 10^{-3}$ where, in our approach, the
uncertainty is predominantly statistical.
