Cell is the structural and functional unit of life. This Resource Letter
serves as a guide to the literature on nano-machines which drive not only
intracellular movements, but also motility of the cell. These machines are
usually proteins or macromolecular assemblies which require appropriate fuel
for their operations. Although, traditionally, these machines were subjects of
investigation in biology and biochemistry, increasing use of the concepts and
techniques of physics in recent years have contributed to the quantitative
understanding of the fundamental principles underlying their operational
mechanisms. The possibility of exploiting these principles for the design and
control of artificial nano-machines has opened up a new frontier in the
bottom-up approach to nano-technology.
