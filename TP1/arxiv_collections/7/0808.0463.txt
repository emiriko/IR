An experimental protocol is presented that allows the entropy generated by
spin-transfer to be measured. The effect of a strong spin-polarized current
injected on a ferromagnetic nanostructure is investigated with focusing on the
quasi-static equilibrium states of a ferromagnetic single domain. The samples
are single contacted Ni nanowires obtained by electrodeposition in a nanoporous
template. The thermal susceptibility of the magnetoresistance is measured as a
function of the magnetic field for different values of the current injected
through the wire. This quantity is related to the thermal magnetic
susceptibility of the ferromagnetic wire through the anisotropic
magnetoresistance. The ferromagnetic entropy generated by the current injection
is deduced thanks to a thermodynamic Maxwell relation. This study shows that
the effect of the spin-transfer in our samples results in the generation of
incoherent excitations instead of rotation of the magnetization.
