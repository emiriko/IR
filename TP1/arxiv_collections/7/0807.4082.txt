We compute the decay rates of emitters coupled to spheroidal nanoantennas
made of gold, copper, silver, and aluminum. The spectral position of the
localized surface plasmon-polariton resonance, the enhancement factors and the
quantum efficiency are investigated as a function of the aspect ratio,
background index and the metal composing the nanoantenna. While copper yields
results similar to gold, silver and aluminum exhibit different performances.
Our results show that with a careful choice of the parameters these
nanoantennas can enhance emitters ranging from the UV to the near-IR spectrum.
