Diverse means are used to investigate the spectra of the radioactive, exotic
ions, 17,19C. First, estimates have been made using a shell model for the
systems. Information from those shell model studies were then used in
evaluating cross sections of the scattering of 70A MeV 17,19C ions from
hydrogen. Complementing those studies, a multichannel algebraic scattering
(MCAS) theory for n+16,18C coupled-channel problems has been used to identify
structures of the compound systems. The results show that the shell model
structure assumed for these ions is reasonable with little need of effective
charges. The conditions that two excited states exist within a few hundred keV
of the ground state places some restriction upon the structure models. Other
positive parity states are expected in the low-lying spectra of the two nuclei.
