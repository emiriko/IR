Holographic QCD provides a unique framework in which to compute QCD
observables. In this talk we summarize recent numerical work on computing the
pion electromagnetic form factor using an AdS/QCD action that includes both
spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking. We consider both hard- and
soft-wall model results and develop an intermediate background that supports
the best features of both. We also begin to see possible evidence in the fit
for the presence of 1/N_c corrections.
