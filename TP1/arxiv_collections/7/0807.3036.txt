The coordinate space formulation of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) method
enables self-consistent treatment of mean-field and pairing in weakly bound
systems whose properties are affected by the particle continuum space. Of
particular interest are neutron-rich, deformed drip-line nuclei which can
exhibit novel properties associated with neutron skin. To describe such systems
theoretically, we developed an accurate 2D lattice Skyrme-HFB solver {\hfbax}
based on B-splines. Compared to previous implementations, we made a number of
improvements aimed at boosting the solver's performance. These include:
explicit imposition of axiality and space inversion, use of the modified
Broyden's method to solve self-consistent equations, and a partial
parallelization of the code. {\hfbax} has been benchmarked against other HFB
solvers, both spherical and deformed, and the accuracy of the B-spline
expansion was tested by employing the multiresolution wavelet method.
Illustrative calculations are carried out for stable and weakly bound nuclei at
spherical and very deformed shapes, including constrained fission pathways. In
addition to providing new physics insights, {\hfbax} can serve as a useful tool
to assess the reliability and applicability of coordinate-space and
configuration-space HFB solvers, both existing and in development.
