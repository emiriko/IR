In this paper we prove that any lambda-term that is strongly normalising for
beta-reduction is also strongly normalising for beta,assoc-reduction. assoc is
a call-by-value rule that has been used in works by Moggi, Joachimsky, Espirito
Santo and others. The result has often been justified with incomplete or
incorrect proofs. Here we give one in full details.
