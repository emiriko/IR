We report 75As-NMR measurements of the ternary iron arsenide BaFe2As2.
75As-NMR spectra clearly revealed that magnetic transition occurs at around 131
K in our samples, which corresponds to the emergence of spin density wave.
Temperature dependence of the internal magnetic field suggests that the
transition is likely of the first order. The critical-slowing-down phenomenon
in the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 is not pronounced in this material.
