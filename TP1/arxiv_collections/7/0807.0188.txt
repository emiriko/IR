The D0 experiment has searched for phenomena beyond the standard model in top
quark events. The methods and results of four analyses covering various
possible deviations from the standard model behaviour are discussed. With data
sets covering up to 2.1fb^-1 no deviation from the standard model expectations
could be found.
