The experimental investigation of quantum phases in optical lattice systems
provides major challenges. Recently, dynamical generation of double occupancy
via modulation of the hopping amplitude t has been used to characterize the
strongly correlated phase of fermionic atoms. Here, we want to validate this
experimental technique with a theoretical study of the driven Hubbard model
using analytic methods. We find that conclusive evidence for a Mott phase can
be inferred from such a measurement, provided that sufficiently low
temperatures kT<<t can be reached.
