High-energy photon-proton interactions at the LHC offer interesting
possibilities for the study of the electroweak sector up to TeV scale and
searches for processes beyond the Standard Model. An analysis of the W
associated single top photoproduction has been performed using the adapted
MadGraph/MadEvent and CalcHEP programs interfaced to the Pythia generator and a
fast detector simulation program. Event selection and suppression of main
backgrounds have been studied. A comparable sensitivity to |V_{tb}| to those
obtained using the standard single top production in pp collisions has been
achieved already for 10 fb^{-1} of integrated luminosity. Photoproduction at
the LHC provides also an attractive framework for observation of the anomalous
production of single top due to Flavour-Changing Neutral Currents. The
sensitivity to anomalous coupling parameters, k_{tu\gamma} and k_{tc\gamma} is
presented and indicates that stronger limits can be placed on anomalous
couplings after 1 fb^{-1}.
