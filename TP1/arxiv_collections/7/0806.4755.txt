Analysis of regular inflationary cosmological models with two torsion
functions filled with scalar field with quadratic potential and
ultrarelativistic matter is carried out numerically. Properties of different
stages of regular inflationary cosmological solutions are studied, restrictions
on admissible values of parameters and initial conditions at transition from
compression to expansion are found. The structure of extremum surface in space
of physical variables is investigated.
