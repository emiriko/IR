We prove a new theorem about the relationship between optical field Wigner
function's Radon transform and optical Fresnel transform of the field, i.e.,
when an input field Phi(x') propagates through an optical [D(-B)(-C)A] system,
the energy density of the output field is equal to the Radon transform of the
Wigner function of the input field, where the Radon transform parameters are
D,B. We prove this theorem in both spatial-domain and frequency-domain.
