We demonstrate a heralded quantum memory based on mapping of a photon
polarization state onto a single collective-spin excitation (magnon) shared
between two spatially overlapped atomic ensembles. The polarization fidelity is
measured by quantum state tomography to be above 90(2)% for any input
polarization, which far exceeds the classical limit of 2/3. The process also
constitutes a quantum non-destructive probe that detects and regenerates a
photon without touching its - potentially undetermined - polarization.
