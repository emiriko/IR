We analyze localization of light at the interface separating square and
hexagonal photonic lattices, as recently realized experimentally in
two-dimensional laser-written waveguide arrays in silica glass with
self-focusing nonlinearity [A. Szameit {\em et al.}, Opt. Lett. {\bf 33}, 663
(2008)]. We reveal the conditions for the existence of {\em linear} and {\em
nonlinear} surface states substantially influenced by the lattice topology, and
study the effect of the different symmetries and couplings on the stability of
two-dimensional interface solitons.
