The problem of community detection is relevant in many disciplines of science
and modularity optimization is the widely accepted method for this purpose. It
has recently been shown that this approach presents a resolution limit by which
it is not possible to detect communities with sizes smaller than a threshold
which depends on the network size. Moreover, it might happen that the
communities resulting from such an approach do not satisfy the usual
qualitative definition of commune, i.e., nodes in a commune are more connected
among themselves than to nodes outside the commune. In this article we
introduce a new method for community detection in complex networks. We define
new merit factors based on the weak and strong community definitions formulated
by Radicchi et al (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 101, 2658-2663 (2004)) and we show
that this local definitions avoid the resolution limit problem found in the
modularity optimization approach.
