The memory kernel of the self-part of the intermediate scattering function is
studied. We found that the short-time behavior of the memory kernel for our
MD-simulated glass-forming Ni$_{20}$Zr$_{80}$-system shows a deviation from the
polynomial form predicted by MCT. By using the gaussian approximation we give a
more detailed description of the short-time dynamics of the system.
