Reciprocal movement cannot be used for locomotion at low-Reynolds number in
an infinite fluid or near a rigid surface. Here we show that this limitation is
relaxed for a body performing reciprocal motions near a deformable interface.
Using physical arguments and scaling relationships, we show that the
nonlinearities arising from reciprocal flow-induced interfacial deformation
rectify the periodic motion of the swimmer, leading to locomotion. Such a
strategy can be used to move toward, away from, and parallel to any deformable
interface as long as the length scales involved are smaller than intrinsic
scales, which we identify. A macro-scale experiment of flapping motion near a
free surface illustrates this new result.
