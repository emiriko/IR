Conditions for obtaining the absolute magnetic trap (AMT) to be used for the
controlled fusion by means of high power relativistic charged beam have been
considered. It is shown that AMT can not be created by external electromagnetic
fields. Also the virial theorem implies that strict stationary state of the
system does not exist in empty flat Minkowski space-time in case of positive
beam pressure and positive electromagnetic field energy density.
