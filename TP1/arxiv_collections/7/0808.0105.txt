We present the formalism and demonstrate the use of the overlapping
muffin-tin approximation (OMTA). This fits a full potential to a superposition
of spherically symmetric short-ranged potential wells plus a constant. For
one-electron potentials of this form, the standard multiple-scattering methods
can solve Schr\"{o}dingers' equation correctly to 1st order in the potential
overlap. Choosing an augmented-plane-wave method as the source of the full
potential, we illustrate the procedure for diamond-structured Si. First, we
compare the potential in the Si-centered OMTA with the full potential, and then
compare the corresponding OMTA $N$-th order muffin-tin orbital and
full-potential LAPW band structures. We find that the two latter agree
qualitatively for a wide range of overlaps and that the valence bands have an
rms deviation of 20 meV/electron for 30% radial overlap. Smaller overlaps give
worse potentials and larger overlaps give larger 2nd-order errors of the
multiple-scattering method. To further remove the mean error of the bands for
small overlaps is simple.
