Quantum Mechanics (QM) is a very special probabilistic theory, yet we don't
know which operational principles make it so. All axiomatization attempts
suffer at least one postulate of a mathematical nature. Here I will analyze the
possibility of deriving QM as the mathematical representation of a "fair
operational framework", i.e. a set of rules which allows the experimenter to
make predictions on future "events" on the basis of suitable "tests", e.g.
without interference from uncontrollable sources. Two postulates need to be
satisfied by any fair operational framework: NSF: "no-signaling from the
future"--for the possibility of making predictions on the basis of past tests;
PFAITH: "existence of a preparationally faithful state"--for the possibility of
preparing any state and calibrating any test. I will show that all theories
satisfying NSF admit a C*-algebra representation of events as linear
transformations of effects. Based on a very general notion of dynamical
independence, it is easy to see that all such probabilistic theories are
"non-signaling without interaction" ("non-signaling" for short)--another
requirement for a fair operational framework. Postulate PFAITH then implies the
"local observability principle", the tensor-product structure for the linear
spaces of states and effects, the impossibility of bit commitment and
additional features, such an operational definition of transpose, a scalar
product for effects, weak-selfduality of the theory, and more. Dual to
Postulate PFAITH an analogous postulate for effects would give additional
quantum features, such as teleportation. However, all possible consequences of
these postulates still need to be investigated, and it is not clear yet if we
can derive QM from the present postulates only. [CONTINUES on manuscript]
