We show that the linking of a semiclassical path of a charged particle with a
knotted magnetic solenoid results in the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The phase shift
in the wave function is proportional to the flux intersecting a certain
connected and orientable surface bounded by the knot (a Seifert surface of the
knot).
