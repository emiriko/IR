The Beijing Electron Collider has been upgraded (BEPCII) to a two-ring
collider with a design luminosity of $1 \times 10^{33}$cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at a
center-of-mass energy of 3.78 GeV. It will operate between 2 and 4.6 GeV in the
center of mass. With this luminosity, the BESIII detector will be able to
collect, for example, 10 billion $J/\psi$ events in one year of running. This
will be a unique facility in the world opening many physics opportunities.
BEPCII and BESIII are both currently being commissioned, first events have been
obtained, and data taking will take place in fall 2008.
