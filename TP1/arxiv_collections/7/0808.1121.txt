A preliminary measurement of the branching fraction B(tau- --> K0 pi- nu) is
made using 384.6 fb-1 of e+e- collision data provided by the PEP-II collider,
operating primarily at sqrt(s)=10.58 GeV, and recorded using the BaBar
detector. From this we measure: B(tau- --> K0 pi- nu) = (0.840 +/- 0.004 (stat)
+/- 0.023 (syst)) %. This result is the most precise measurement to date and is
consistent with the world average.
