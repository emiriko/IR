A large CP-violating phase uncovered recently by CDF and D$\O$ collaborations
in the time-dependent CP asymmetry (CPA) of the $B_s\to J/\Psi \phi$ decay
clearly indicates that a non-Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) phase has to be
brought into the $b\to s$ transition. We find that the model with $SU(2)_L$
singlet exotic quarks can not only provide the new phase induced from the
Z-mediated flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) at tree level, but also
strongly relate the $B_s-\bar B_s$ mixing, $B_q\to V_q \ell^{+} \ell^{-}$
($V_{d[s]}=K^*[\phi])$ and $B_s\to \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ together. In particular, we
show that the new CP phase can be unambiguously exposed by the large
statistical significances of $T$ violating observables in $B_q\to V_q \ell^{+}
\ell^{-}$, while the branching ratio of $B_s\to \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ can be
enhanced to be $O(10^{-8})$.
