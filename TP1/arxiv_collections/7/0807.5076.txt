A systematic procedure to derive shell models for MHD turbulence is proposed.
It takes into account the conservation of ideal quadratic invariants such as
the total energy, the cross-helicity and the magnetic helicity as well as the
conservation of the magnetic energy by the advection term in the induction
equation. This approach also leads to simple expressions for the energy
exchanges as well as to unambiguous definitions for the energy fluxes. When
applied to the existing shell models with nonlinear interactions limited to the
nearest neighbour shells, this procedure reproduces well known models but
suggests a reinterpretation of the energy fluxes.
