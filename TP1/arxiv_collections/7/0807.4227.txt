We propose a model of evolutionary snowdrift game with $N$-person
interactions and study the effects of multi-person interactions on the
emergence of cooperation. An exact $N$-th-order equation for the equilibrium
density of cooperators $x^*$ is derived for a well-mixed population using the
approach of replicator dynamics. The results show that the extent of
cooperation drops with increasing cost-to-benefit ratio and the number $N$ of
interaction persons in a group, with $x^{*}\sim1/N$ for large $N$. An algorithm
for numerical simulations is constructed for the model. The simulation results
are in good agreements with theoretical results of the replicator dynamics.
