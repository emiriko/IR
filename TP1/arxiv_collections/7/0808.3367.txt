One of the first physics results to come out of ATLAS will be an analysis of
J/psi and Upsilon production at 14 TeV. I give an overview of the motivation
for looking at the theoretical model underlying quarkonium production, ATLAS
expected performance and rates for quarkonium reconstruction and ability to
separate out various proposed production models with a view to improving our
understanding of QCD.
