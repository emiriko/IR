This note summarizes the results of the "Workshop on Polarisation and Beam
Energy Measurements at the ILC", held at DESY (Zeuthen) April 9-11 2008. The
topics for the workshop included (i) physics requirements, (ii) polarised
sources and low energy polarimetry, (iii) BDS polarimeters, (iv) BDS energy
spectrometers, and (v) physics-based measurements of beam polarisation and beam
energy from collider data. Discussions focused on the current ILC baseline
programme as described in the Reference Design Report (RDR), which includes
physics runs at beam energies between 100 and 250 GeV, as well as calibration
runs on the Z-pole. Electron polarisation of P_e- >~ 80% and positron
polarisation of P_e+ >~ 30% are part of the baseline configuration of the
machine. Energy and polarisation measurements for ILC options beyond the
baseline, including Z-pole running and the 1 TeV energy upgrade, were also
discussed.
