We investigate the classical spin dynamics of the kagome antiferromagnet by
combining Monte Carlo and spin dynamics simulations. We show that this model
has two distinct low temperature dynamical regimes, both sustaining propagative
modes. The expected gauge invariance type of the low energy low temperature out
of plane excitations is also evidenced in the non linear regime. A detailed
analysis of the excitations allows to identify ghosts in the dynamical
structure factor, i.e propagating excitations with a strongly reduced spectral
weight. We argue that these dynamical extinction rules are of geometrical
origin.
