In this paper, by using two dimensional (2D) Hubbard models with pi-flux
phase and that on a hexagonal lattice as examples, we explore
spin-charge-separated solitons in nodal antiferromagnetic (AF) insulator - an
AF order with massive Dirac fermionic excitations (see detail in the paper). We
calculate fermion zero modes and induced quantum numbers on solitons (half
skyrmions) in the continuum limit, which are similar to that in the quasi
one-dimensional conductor polyacetylene (CH)x and that in topological band
insulator. In particular, we find some novel phenomena : thanks to an induced
staggered spin moment, a mobile half skyrmion becomes a fermionic particle;
when a hole or an electron is added, the half skyrmion turns into a bosonic
particle with charge degree of freedom only. Our results imply that nontrivial
induced quantum number on solitons may be a universal feature of spin-charge
separation in different systems.
