Recent lattice data have reported an infrared suppressed, positivity
violating gluon propagator which is nonvanishing at zero momentum and a ghost
propagator which is no longer enhanced. This paper discusses how to obtain
analytical results which are in qualitative agreement with these lattice data
within the Gribov-Zwanziger framework. This framework allows one to take into
account effects related to the existence of gauge copies, by restricting the
domain of integration in the path integral to the Gribov region. We elaborate
to great extent on a previous short paper by presenting additional results,
also confirmed by the numerical simulations. A detailed discussion on the soft
breaking of the BRST symmetry arising in the Gribov-Zwanziger approach is
provided.
