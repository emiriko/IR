There is an intrinsic relationship between the molecular evolution in
primordial period and the properties of genomes and proteomes of contemporary
species. The genomic data may help us understand the driving force of evolution
of life at molecular level. In absence of evidence, numerous problems in
molecular evolution had to fall into a twilight zone of speculation and
controversy in the past. Here we show that delicate structures of variations of
genomic base compositions and amino acid frequencies resulted from the genetic
code evolution. And the driving force of evolution of life also originated in
the genetic code evolution. The theoretical results on the variations of amino
acid frequencies and genomic base compositions agree with the experimental
observations very well, not only in the variation trends but also in some fine
structures. Inversely, the genomic data of contemporary species can help
reconstruct the genetic code chronology and amino acid chronology in primordial
period. Our results may shed light on the intrinsic mechanism of molecular
evolution and the genetic code evolution.
