We study theoretically the electronic properties of $c$-plane GaN/AlN quantum
dots (QDs) with focus on their potential as sources of single polarized photons
for future quantum communication systems. Within the framework of eight-band
k.p theory we calculate the optical interband transitions of the QDs and their
polarization properties. We show that an anisotropy of the QD confinement
potential in the basal plane (e.g. QD elongation or strain anisotropy) leads to
a pronounced linear polarization of the ground state and excited state
transitions. An externally applied uniaxial stress can be used to either induce
a linear polarization of the ground-state transition for emission of single
polarized photons or even to compensate the polarization induced by the
structural elongation.
