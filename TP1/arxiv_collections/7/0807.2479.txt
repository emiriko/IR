We show that a perfect absorber/thermal emitter exhibiting an absorption peak
of 99.9% can be achieved in metallic nanostructures that can be easily
fabricated. The very high absorption is maintained for large angles with a
minimal shift in the center frequency and can be tuned throughout the visible
and near-infrared regime by scaling the nanostructure dimensions. The stability
of the spectral features at high temperatures is tested by simulations using a
range of material parameters.
