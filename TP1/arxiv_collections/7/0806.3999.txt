We show that there is a way to unify distribution functions that describe
simultaneously a signal in space and (spatial) frequency. Probably the most
known of them is the Wigner distribution function. Here we show how to unify
functions of the Cohen class, Rihacek's complex energy function, Husimi and
Glauber-Sudarshan distribution functions.
