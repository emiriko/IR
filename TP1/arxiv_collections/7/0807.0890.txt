A new world volume theory with a free scalar field was proposed for Multiple
M2 branes recently. By giving the free scalar a large VEV, we can obtain a
gauge theory of multiple D2 branes with a coupling constant proportional to the
VEV. It is pointed out by Banerjee and Sen that we can get D2 branes by
choosing a compactification in the $\theta$ direction, with radial position
having the same value of the VEV. Following this work, we try to describe the
multiple M2 branes in R^8/Z_K and give a simple provement of g_{YM} \propto {1
\ov \sqrt{K}} in the compactification. We try to interpret T^0 and T^{-1} as
the radial coordinate operator and momentum operator and give some evidences in
geometry and quantum mechanics.
