We demonstrate that a theoretical framework fully incorporating intra-atomic
correlations and multiplet structure of the localized 4f states is required in
order to capture the essential physics of rare-earth semiconductors and
semimetals. We focus in particular on the rare-earth semimetal erbium arsenide
(ErAs), for which effective one-electron approaches fail to provide a
consistent picture of both high and low-energy electronic states. We treat the
many-body states of the Er 4f shell within an atomic approximation in the
framework of dynamical mean-field theory. Our results for the magnetic-field
dependence of the 4f local moment, the influence of multiplets on the
photoemission spectrum, and the exchange splitting of the Fermi surface pockets
as measured from Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, are found to be in good
agreement with experimental results.
