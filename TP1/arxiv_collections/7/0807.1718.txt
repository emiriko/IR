When used with coherent light, optical imaging systems, even
diffraction-limited, are inherently unable to reproduce both the amplitude and
the phase of a two-dimensional field distribution because their impulse
response function varies slowly from point to point (a property known as
non-isoplanatism). For sufficiently small objects, this usually results in a
phase distortion and has no impact on the measured intensity. Here, we show
that the intensity distribution can also be dramatically distorted when objects
of large extension or of special shapes are imaged. We illustrate the problem
using two simple examples: the pinhole camera and the aberration-free thin
lens. The effects predicted by our theorical analysis are also confirmed by
experimental observations.
