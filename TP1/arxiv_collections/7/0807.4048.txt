Recent results of searches for events containing isolated leptons and missing
transverse momentum at HERA are presented. Searches in this final state have
yielded notable excesses over Standard Model expectations in the past. Searches
for isolated leptons in channels corresponding to all three generations of
leptons over the full HERA running period are now available. The combined
H1+ZEUS results for searches for electrons and muons are compatible with the
Standard Model.
