Production cross sections of medium-mass neutron-rich nuclei obtained in the
fragmentation of 136Xe projectiles at 1 A GeV have been measured with the
FRagment Separator (FRS) at GSI. 125Pd was identified for the first time. The
measured cross sections are compared to 238U fission yields and model
calculations in order to determine the optimum reaction mechanism to extend the
limits of the chart of the nuclides around the r-process waiting point at N=82.
