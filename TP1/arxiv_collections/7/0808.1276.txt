Tracy and Widom showed that fundamentally important kernels in random matrix
theory arise from differential equations with rational coefficients. More
generally, this paper considers symmetric Hamiltonian systems abd determines
the properties of kernels that arise from them. The inverse spectral problem
for self-adjoint Hankel operators gives a sufficient condition for a
self-adjoint operator to be the Hankel operator on $L^2(0, \infty)$ from a
linear system in continuous time; thus this paper expresses certain kernels as
squares of Hankel operators. For a suitable linear system $(-A,B,C)$ with one
dimensional input and output spaces, there exists a Hankel operator $\Gamma$
with kernel $\phi_{(x)}(s+t)=Ce^{-(2x+s+t)A}B$ such that $\det
(I+(z-1)\Gamma\Gamma^\dagger)$ is the generating function of a determinantal
random point field.
