Here we address the question regarding the nature of quark gluon plasma
(QGP), whether it is a liquid or strongly coupled plasma (SCP), using two
different phenomenological models, namely quasi-particle model (qQGP) and
strongly coupled quark gluon plasma (SCQGP). First we compare these two models,
both of which explains the results of lattice simulation of quantum
chromodynamics, as a function of plasma parameter and conclude that the QGP is
largely ($T > 1.5 T_c$) SCQGP and only for $T < 1.5 T_c$ it may be a liquid.
