One of the most complex systems is the human brain whose formalized
functioning is characterized by decision theory. We present a "Quantum Decision
Theory" of decision making, based on the mathematical theory of separable
Hilbert spaces. This mathematical structure captures the effect of
superposition of composite prospects, including many incorporated intentions,
which allows us to explain a variety of interesting fallacies and anomalies
that have been reported to particularize the decision making of real human
beings. The theory describes entangled decision making, non-commutativity of
subsequent decisions, and intention interference of composite prospects. We
demonstrate how the violation of the Savage's sure-thing principle (disjunction
effect) can be explained as a result of the interference of intentions, when
making decisions under uncertainty. The conjunction fallacy is also explained
by the presence of the interference terms. We demonstrate that all known
anomalies and paradoxes, documented in the context of classical decision
theory, are reducible to just a few mathematical archetypes, all of which
finding straightforward explanations in the frame of the developed quantum
approach.
