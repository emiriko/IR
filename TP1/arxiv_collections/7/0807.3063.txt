We study the transport and quantum walk of nonclassical light in an array of
coupled waveguides which have novel properties like very low decoherence and
thus making them ideal for storage of quantum information. We show how
squeezing gets turned over from one waveguide to another. We further show how
input nonclassical light can generate entanglement among different waveguides.
Our results involve both first quantization due to array structure and second
quantization due to the quantum nature of fields and can also be used to
discuss the Talbot effect in the quantum regime.
