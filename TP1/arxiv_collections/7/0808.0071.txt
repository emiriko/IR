We focus in future proposals to measure coherent neutrino-nuclei scattering
and we show that such kind of experiments are very sensitive to nonstandard
neutrino interactions with quarks. First in a model independent parametrization
and then we focused in particular models such as leptoquarks and models with
extra neutral gauge bosons and with R-parity breaking interactions. We show
that in all these three different types of new physics it is possible to obtain
competitive bounds to those of future collider experiments. For the particular
case of leptoquarks we found that the expected sensitivity to the coupling and
mass for most of the future experimental setups is quite better than the
current constraints.
