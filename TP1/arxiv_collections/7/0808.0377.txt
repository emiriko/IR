Let $G$ be a non-abelian group and $Z(G)$ be its center. The non-commuting
graph $\mathcal{A}_G$ of $G$ is the graph whose vertex set is $G\backslash
Z(G)$ and two vertices are joined by an edge if they do not commute. Let
$\mathrm{SL}(2,q)$ be the special linear group of degree 2 over the finite
field of order $q$. In this paper we prove that if $G$ is a group such that
$\mathcal{A}_G\cong \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{SL}(2,q)}$ for some prime power $q\geq
2$, then $G\cong \mathrm{SL}(2,q)$.
