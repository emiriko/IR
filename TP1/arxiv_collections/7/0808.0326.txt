It is demonstrated how the equilibrium semiclassical approach of Coffey et
al. can be improved to describe more correctly the evolution. As a result a new
semiclassical Klein-Kramers equation for the Wigner function is derived, which
remains quantum for a free quantum Brownian particle as well. It is transformed
to a semiclassical Smoluchowski equation, which leads to our semiclassical
generalization of the classical Einstein law of Brownian motion derived before.
A possibility is discussed how to extend these semiclassical equations to
nonlinear quantum Fokker-Planck equations based on the Fisher information.
