It is given an efficient complete parametrization of wavelet matrices of rank
$m$, genus $g+1$, and degree $g$, which are naturally identified with
corresponding polynomial paraunitary matrix-functions. The parametrization
depends on Wiener-Hopf factorization of unitary matrix-functions with constant
determinant given in the unit circle. This method allows us to construct in
real time the coefficients of wavelet matrices from the above class.
