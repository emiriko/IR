LISA is a joint space mission of the ESA and NASA for detecting low frequency
gravitational radiation in the band $10^{-5} - 1$ Hz. In order to attain the
requisite sensitivity for LISA, the laser frequency noise must be suppressed
below the other secondary noises such as the optical path noise, acceleration
noise etc. This is achieved because of the redundancy in the data, more
specifically, by combining six appropriately time-delayed data streams
containing fractional Doppler shifts - time delay interferometry (TDI). The
orbits of the spacecraft are computed in the gravitational field of the Sun and
Earth in the Newtonian framework, while the optical links are treated fully
general relativistically and thus, effects such as the Sagnac, Shapiro delay,
etc. are automatically incorporated. We show that in the model of LISA that we
consider here, there are symmetries inherent in the physics, which may be used
effectively to suppress the residual laser frequency noise and simplify the
algebraic approach to TDI.
