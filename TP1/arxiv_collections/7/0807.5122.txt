The aim of this paper is to provide a proof for a version of Morse inequality
for manifolds with boundary. Our main results are certainly known to the
experts on Morse theory, nevertheless it seems necessary to write down a
complete proof for it. Our proof is analytic and is based on J. Roe's account
of Witten's approach to Morse Theory.
