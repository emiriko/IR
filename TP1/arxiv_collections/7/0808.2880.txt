Triply heavy flavour baryons are studied using the hyper central description
of the three-body system. The confinement potential is assumed as hyper central
coulomb plus power potential with power index $p$. The ground state
($J^P={1/2}^+$ and ${3/2}^+$) masses of heavy flavour baryons are computed for
different power index, $ p$ starting from 0.5 to 2.0. The predicted masses are
found to attain a saturated value with respect to variation in $p$ beyond the
power index $p>1.0$. Using the spin-flavour structure of the constituting
quarks and by defining effective mass of the confined quarks within the
baryons, the magnetic moments are computed with no additional free parameters.
