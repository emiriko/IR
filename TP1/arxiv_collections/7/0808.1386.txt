We have developed a Josephson parametric amplifier, comprising a
superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator terminated by a dc SQUID
(superconducting quantum interference device). An external field (the pump,
$\sim 20$ GHz) modulates the flux threading the dc SQUID, and, thereby, the
resonant frequency of the cavity field (the signal, $\sim 10$ GHz), which leads
to parametric signal amplification. We operated the amplifier at different band
centers, and observed amplification (17 dB at maximum) and deamplification
depending on the relative phase between the pump and the signal. The noise
temperature is estimated to be less than 0.87 K.
