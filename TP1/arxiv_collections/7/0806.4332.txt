We deal with a generalized statistical description of nonequilibrium complex
systems based on least biased distributions given some prior information. A
maximum entropy principle is introduced that allows for the determination of
the distribution of the fluctuating intensive parameter $\beta$ of a
superstatistical system, given certain constraints on the complex system under
consideration. We apply the theory to three examples: The superstatistical
quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator, the superstatistical classical ideal
gas, and velocity time series as measured in a turbulent Taylor-Couette flow.
