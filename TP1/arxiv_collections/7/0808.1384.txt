We predict surface electromagnetic waves propagating across the layers of
intrinsic Josephson junctions. We find the spectrum of the surface waves and
study the distribution of the electromagnetic field inside and outside the
superconductor. The profile of the amplitude oscillations of the electric field
component of such waves is peculiar: initially, it increases toward the center
of the superconductor and, after reaching a crossover point, decreases
exponentially.
