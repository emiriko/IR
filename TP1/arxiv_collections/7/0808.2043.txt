The infrared behavior of the Adler function is examined by making use of a
recently derived integral representation for the latter. The obtained result
for the Adler function agrees with its experimental prediction in the entire
energy range. The inclusive $\tau$ lepton decay is studied in the framework of
the developed approach.
