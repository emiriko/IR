The role of graphene in mediating the exchange interaction is theoretically
investigated when it is placed between two ferromagnetic dielectric materials.
The calculation based on a tight-binding model illustrates that the magnetic
interactions at the interfaces affect not only the graphene band structure but
also the thermodynamic potential of the system. This induces an indirect
exchange interaction between the magnetic layers that can be considered in term
of an effective exchange bias field. The analysis clearly indicates a strong
dependence of the effective exchange bias on the properties of the mediating
layer, revealing an effective mechanism of electrical control even at room
temperature. This dependence also results in qualitatively different
characteristics for the cases involving mono- and bilayer graphene.
