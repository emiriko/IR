Electromagnetic mean squared radii of Lambda(1405) are evaluated in chiral
unitary approach. In this approach we regard Lambda(1405) as dynamically
generated resonances in the octet meson and octet baryon scattering, and also
as KbarN bound state. Especially for the Lambda(1405) as KbarN bound state we
obtain negative electric mean squared radius. With the small binding energy of
Lambda(1405) in the chiral unitary approach, our results imply that
Lambda(1405) has structure that K^- is widely spread around p.
