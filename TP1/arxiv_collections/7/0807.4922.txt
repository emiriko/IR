It is demonstrated that the light Higgs boson scenario, which the lightest
Higgs mass is less than the LEP bound, mh > 114.4 GeV, is consistent with the
SUSY seesaw model. With the assumptions of the universal right-handed neutrino
mass and the hierarchical mass spectrum of the ordinary neutrinos, the bounds
for the right-handed neutrino mass is investigated in terms of lepton flavor
violating charged lepton decays. We also discuss the effect of the modification
of renormalization group equations by the right-handed neutrinos on the b to s
gamma process and the relic abundance of dark matter in the light Higgs boson
scenario.
