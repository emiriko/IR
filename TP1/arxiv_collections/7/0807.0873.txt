With the aim at quantitatively investigating the longstanding problem
concerning the effect of short range nucleon-nucleon correlations on scattering
processes at high energies, the total neutron-nucleus cross section is
calculated within a parameter-free approach which, for the first time, takes
into account, simultaneously, central, spin, isospin and tensor nucleon-nucleon
(NN) correlations, and Glauber elastic and Gribov inelastic shadowing
corrections. Nuclei ranging from 4He to 208Pb and incident neutron momenta in
the range 3 GeV/c - 300 GeV/c are considered; the commonly used approach which
approximates the square of the nuclear wave function by a product of one-body
densities is carefully analyzed, showing that NN correlations can play a
non-negligible role in high energy scattering off nuclei.
