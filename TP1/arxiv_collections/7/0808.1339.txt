This article proposes some cosmological reflections at the qualitative and
conjectural level, suggested by the Fantappie & Arcidiacono projective
relativity theory. The difference will firstly be discussed between two types
of singularity in this theory: geometric (de Sitter horizon) and physical (big
bang, big crunch). The reasons for the existence of geometric singularities are
deeply rooted in the principle of inertia and in the principle of relativity,
while physical singularities are associated with the creation or destruction of
matter. In this framework, quantum mechanics is introduced through a particular
interpretation of Bohm holomovement. Finally, a possible mechanism is discussed
for the genesis of the cosmological term. No form of inflation appears in the
scenario described.
