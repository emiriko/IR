We study a two-component Fermi system with attractive interactions and
different populations of the two species in a cubic lattice. For an
intermediate coupling we find a uniformly polarized superfluid which is stable
down to very low temperatures. The momentum distribution of this phase closely
resembles that of the Sarma phase, characterized by two Fermi surfaces. This
phase is shown to be stabilized by a potential energy gain, as in a BCS
superfluid, in contrast to the unpolarized BEC which is stabilized by kinetic
energy. We present general arguments suggesting that preformed pairs in the
unpolarized superfluid favor the stabilization of a polarized superfluid phase.
