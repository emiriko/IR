Recently several authors have developed multilinear and in particular
quadratic extensions of the classical Morawetz inequality. Those extensions
provide (among other results) an easy proof of asymptotic completeness in the
energy space for nonlinear Schr"odinger equations in arbitrary space dimension
and for Hartree equations in space dimension greater than two in the
noncritical cases. We give a pedagogical review of the latter results.
