The work reported here originates in the discovery, four decades ago, of a
previously unknown type of self-organizing interaction among oscillating
systems -- so-called argumental interactions -- and of "quantized" modes of
behavior in macroscopic argumentally-coupled oscillators, having no equivalent
in the classical theory of oscillations. Recently the present authors have been
jointly pursuing new lines of investigation into argumental interactions and
their possible significance for the foundations of physics. Among other things,
the study of argumentally-coupled oscillators suggested to the authors a new
general way of looking at physical objects, their interactions and their
aggregative,"social" behavior as manifested on all scales of observation. We
believe this new viewpoint, which differs significantly both from that of
classical physics and from quantum theory as presently understood, might lead
to a more coherent understanding of many natural phenomena which until now have
been studied only in a piecemeal fashion. To make the authors' train of thought
intelligible to the reader not familiar with the field of argumental
interactions, we have combined the presentation of our ideas with an extended
review of experimental and theoretical results on argumentally-coupled
oscillators and the associated "Macroscopic Quantization Effect". Our review
serves the additional purpose of introducing this little-known, but most
interesting field of research to a broader scientific audience.
