Possibility of unconventional pairing due to Coulomb interaction in
iron-pnictide superconductors is studied by applying a perturbative approach to
realistic 2- and 5-band Hubbard models. The linearized Eliashberg equation is
solved by expanding the effective pairing interaction perturbatively up to
third order in the on-site Coulomb integrals. The numerical results for the
5-band model suggest that the eigenvalues of the Eliashberg equation are
sufficiently large to explain the actual high Tc for realistic values of
Coulomb interaction and the most probable pairing state is spin-singlet s-wave
without any nodes just on the Fermi surfaces, although the superconducting
order parameter changes its sign between the small Fermi pockets. On the other
hand the 2-band model is quite insufficient to explain the actual high Tc.
