The electronic structure in the normal state of CeFeAsO0.89F0.11 oxypnictide
superconductors has been investigated with x-ray absorption and photoemission
spectroscopy. All the data exhibit signatures of Fe d-electron itinerancy.
Exchange multiplets appearing in the Fe 3s core level indicate the presence of
itinerant spin fluctuations. These findings suggest that the underlying physics
and the origin of superconductivity in these materials are likely to be quite
different from those of the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. These
materials provide opportunities for elucidating the role of magnetic
fluctuations in high-temperature superconductivity.
