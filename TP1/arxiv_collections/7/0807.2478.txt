We demonstrate theoretically that electromagnetically induced transparency
can be achieved in metamaterials, in which electromagnetic radiation is
interacting resonantly with mesoscopic oscillators rather than with atoms. We
describe novel metamaterial designs that can support full dark resonant state
upon interaction with an electromagnetic beam and we present results of its
frequency-dependent effective permeability and permittivity. These results,
showing a transparency window with extremely low absorption and strong
dispersion, are confirmed by accurate simulations of the electromagnetic field
propagation in the metamaterial.
