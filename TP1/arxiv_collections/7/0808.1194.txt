Continuous time random walks are non-Markovian stochastic processes, which
are only partly characterized by single-time probability distributions. We
derive a closed evolution equation for joint two-point probability density
functions of a subdiffusive continuous time random walk, which can be
considered as a generalization of the known single-time fractional diffusion
equation to two-time probability distributions. The solution of this
generalized diffusion equation is given as an integral transformation of the
probability distribution of an ordinary diffusion process, where the integral
kernel is generated by an inverse L\'evy stable process. Explicit expressions
for the two time moments of a diffusion process are given, which could be
readily compared with the ones determined from experiments.
