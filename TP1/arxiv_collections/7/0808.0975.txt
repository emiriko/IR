An analysis of the magnetocaloric properties of the pure and substituted Fe2P
compounds is made based on KKR-CPA electronic structure calculations and
magnetisation M(H,T) measurements. The computed electronic densities of states
and magnetic moments are used to calculate both the values of the electronic
and magnetic entropies, which fairly agree with the experimental findings. To
enlighten the magnetic properties above Curie temperature, the paramagnetic
state behaviours are simulated using the disordered local moments (DLM)
concept. The KKR-CPA computations show, that in Fe2P, the Fe magnetic moment of
the (3f) site disappears in the DLM state, while the moment of the (3g) site is
only little lowered, comparison made with the low temperature ferromagnetic
state.
