CMS will use dijets to search for physics beyond the standard model during
early LHC running. The inclusive jet cross section as a function of jet
transverse momentum, with 10 inverse picobarns of integrated luminosity, is
sensitive to contact interactions beyond the reach of the Tevatron. The dijet
mass distribution will be used to search for dijet resonances coming from new
particles, for example an excited quark. Additional sensitivity to the
existence of contact interactions or dijet resonances can be obtained by
comparing dijet rates in two distinct pseudorapidity regions.
