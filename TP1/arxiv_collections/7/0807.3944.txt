We derive analytical properties for the degeneracy $\nu(N,j)$ occurring in
the decomposition $\bigoplus\limits_{j}^\frac{N}{2}\nu(N,j)\mathbb C^{2j+1}$ of
the state space $\mathbb C^{2\otimes N}$. We also investigate the dynamics of
two qubits coupled via Ising interactions to separate spin baths, and we study
the thermodynamic limit.
