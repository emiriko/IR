Detailed doping dependence of the electronic specific heat coefficient gamma
is studied for La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) single crystals in the slightly-doped
regime. We find that gamma systematically increases with doping, and
furthermore, even for the samples in the antiferromagnetic (AF) regime, gamma
already acquires finite value and grows with x. This suggests that finite
electronic density of states (DOS) is created in the AF regime where the
transport shows strong localization at low temperatures, and this means the
system is not a real insulator with a clear gap even though it still keeps long
range AF order.
