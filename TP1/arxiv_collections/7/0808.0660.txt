We consider a $d$-dimensional disordered harmonic chain (DHC) perturbed by an
energy conservative noise. We obtain uniform in the volume upper and lower
bounds for the thermal conductivity defined through the Green-Kubo formula.
These bounds indicate a positive finite conductivity. We prove also that the
infinite volume homogenized Green-Kubo formula converges.
