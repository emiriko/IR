Current-induced torque is formulated based on the spin continuity equation.
The formulation does not rely on the assumption of separation of local spin and
charge degrees of freedom, in contrast to approaches based on the $s$-$d$ model
or mean-field approximation of itinerant ferromagnetism. This new method would
be thus useful for the estimation of torques in actual materials by
first-principles calculations. As an example, the formalism is applied to the
adiabatic limit of the $s$-$d$ model in order to obtain the analytical
expression for torques and corresponding $\beta$ terms arising from spin
relaxation due to spin-flip scattering and spin-orbit interaction.
