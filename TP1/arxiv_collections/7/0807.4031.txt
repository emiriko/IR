Merging event horizons of the binary black holes is investigated. While
recent development of the numerical study of the binary black hole coalescence
has shown that their apparent horizons can orbit for many periods, we study the
orbital motion of the event horizon. We discuss how many periods their event
horizons orbit before their coalescence. Then, we find that they soon merge
into one and the black holes cannot orbit for a half period while the apparent
horizons can orbit many times.
