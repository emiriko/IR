We consider the impact that can be made on our understanding of parton
distributions (PDFs) and QCD from early measurements at the LHCb experiment.
The high rapidity values make the experiment uniquely suited to a detailed
study of small-x parton distributions and hence will make a significant
contribution towards the clarification of both experimental and theoretical
uncertainties on PDFs and their applications.
