We present angular distributions of photoelectrons of atomic model systems
excited by intense linearly polarized laser pulses in the VUV- and XUV-regime.
We solve the multi-dimensional time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for one
particle on large spatial grids and investigate the direction dependence of the
ionized electrons for isotropic s-states as well as p-states. Although the
ponderomotive potential is small compared to the binding energy of the
initially bound electron and the photon energy of the exciting laser field,
richly structured photoelectron angular distributions are found which
sensitively depend on the laser frequency and intensity as well as on the
number of absorbed photons. The occuring shapes are explained in terms of
scattering mechanisms.
