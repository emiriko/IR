Thermodynamic length is a path function that generalizes the notion of length
to the surface of thermodynamic states. Here, we show how to measure
thermodynamic length in far-from-equilibrium single molecule experiments using
the work fluctuation relations. For these microscopic systems, it proves
necessary to define the thermodynamic length in terms of the Fisher
information. Consequently, the thermodynamic length can be directly related to
the magnitude of fluctuations about equilibrium. The work fluctuation relations
link the work and the free energy change during an external perturbation on a
system. We use this result to determine equilibrium averages at intermediate
points of the protocol in which the system is out-of-equilibrium. This allows
us to extend Bennett's method to determine the potential of mean force, as well
as the thermodynamic length, in single molecule experiments.
