The phenomenon of gene conservation is an interesting evolutionary problem
related to speciation and adaptation. Conserved genes are acted upon in
evolution in a way that preserves their function despite other structural and
functional changes going on around them. The recent availability of
whole-genomic data from closely related species allows us to test the
hypothesis that a core genome present in a hypothetical common ancestor is
inherited by all sister taxa. Furthermore, this core genome should serve
essential functions such as genetic regulation and cellular repair.
Whole-genome sequences from three strains of bacteria (Shewanella sp.) were
used in this analysis. The open reading frames (ORFs) for each identified and
putative gene were used for each genome. Reciprocal Blast searches were
conducted on all three genomes, which distilled a list of thousands of genes to
68 genes that were identical across taxa. Based on functional annotation, these
genes were identified as housekeeping genes, which confirmed the original
hypothesis. This method could be used in eukaryotes as well, in particular the
relationship between humans, chimps, and macaques.
