We explicitly construct a non-microreversible transition matrix for a Markov
process and apply it to the standard three-state Potts model. This provides a
clear and simple demonstration that the usual micoreversibility property of
thermodynamical Monte Carlo algorithms is not strictly necessary from a
mathemetical point of view.
