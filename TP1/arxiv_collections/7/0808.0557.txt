The pressure of QCD admits at high temperatures a factorization into purely
perturbative contributions from "hard" thermal momenta, and slowly convergent
as well as non-perturbative contributions from "soft" thermal momenta. The
latter can be related to various effective gluon condensates in a dimensionally
reduced effective field theory, and measured there through lattice simulations.
Practical measurements of one of the relevant condensates have suffered,
however, from difficulties in extrapolating convincingly to the continuum
limit. In order to gain insight on this problem, we employ Numerical Stochastic
Perturbation Theory to estimate the problematic condensate up to 4-loop order
in lattice perturbation theory. Our results seem to confirm the presence of
"large" discretization effects, going like $a\ln(1/a)$, where $a$ is the
lattice spacing. For definite conclusions, however, it would be helpful to
repeat the corresponding part of our study with standard lattice perturbation
theory techniques.
