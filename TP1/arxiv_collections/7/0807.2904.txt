In the paper, PRB {\bf 77}, 085118 (2008), the authors conclude that the
observation of Ti-doping induced half-metallicity in SrRu$_{1-x}$TI$_x$O$_3$
within the limit of local density approximations is not valid as the
experimental results indicate insulating behavior. It was described that the
metal-insulator transition (MIT) at x = 0.5 observed in this system appears due
to the enhancement of on-site Coulomb repulsion strength, U with Ti
substitutions, x. The MIT primarily depends on U and partially on x and/or
disorder. All these conclusions are in sharp contrast to the experimental
observations, which predicted Anderson insulating phase at x = 0.5 (finite
localized density of states at the Fermi level). The hard gap due to electron
correlation appears at much higher x (~ 0.8). In addition, it is well
established that homovalent substitution has negligible influence on on-site
$U$ (a local variable). These inconsistencies appear due to the fact that the
calculated results representing the bulk electronic structure are compared with
the experimental results dominated by surface contributions. The experimental
bulk spectra, already available in the literature exhibit finite density of
states at the Fermi level even for x >= 0.5 sample, which suggests that the
conclusion of half metallic phase in an earlier study is reasonable. Thus, the
insulator to metal transition in these systems is driven by bandwidth, W rather
than U and disorder plays dominant role in the metal-insulator transition. One
needs to consider the bulk spectra to reproduce numerically the bulk electronic
structure.
