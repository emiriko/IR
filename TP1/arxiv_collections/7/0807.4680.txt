Each cognitive science tries to understand a set of cognitive behaviors. The
structuring of knowledge of this nature's aspect is far from what it can be
expected about a science. Until now universal standard consistently describing
the set of cognitive behaviors has not been found, and there are many questions
about the cognitive behaviors for which only there are opinions of members of
the scientific community. This article has three proposals. The first proposal
is to raise to the scientific community the necessity of unified the cognitive
behaviors. The second proposal is claim the application of the Newton's
reasoning rules about nature of his book, Philosophiae Naturalis Principia
Mathematica, to the cognitive behaviors. The third is to propose a scientific
theory, currently developing, that follows the rules established by Newton to
make sense of nature, and could be the theory to explain all the cognitive
behaviors.
