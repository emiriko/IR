I consider the problem of a thin membrane on which a metric has been
prescribed, for example by lithographically controlling the local swelling
properties of a polymer thin film. While any amount of swelling can be
accommodated locally, geometry prohibits the existence of a global strain-free
configuration. To study this geometrical frustration, I introduce a
perturbative approach. I compute the optimal shape of an annular, thin ribbon
as a function of its width. The topological constraint of closing the ribbon
determines a relationship between the mean curvature and number of wrinkles
that prevents a complete relaxation of the compression strain induced by
swelling and buckles the ribbon out of the plane. These results are then
applied to thin, buckled disks, where the expansion works surprisingly well. I
identify a critical radius above which the disk in-plane strain cannot be
relaxed completely.
