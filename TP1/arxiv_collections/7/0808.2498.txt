We investigated the vortex dynamics in the non-centrosymmetric superconductor
Li_2Pt_3B in the temperature range 0.1 K - 2.8 K. Two different logarithmic
creep regimes in the decay of the remanent magnetization from the Bean critical
state have been observed. In the first regime, the creep rate is
extraordinarily small, indicating the existence of a new, very effective
pinning mechanism. At a certain time a vortex avalanche occurs that increases
the logarithmic creep rate by a factor of about 5 to 10 depending on the
temperature. This may indicate that certain barriers against flux motion are
present and they can be opened under increased pressure exerted by the
vortices. A possible mechanism based on the barrier effect of twin boundaries
is briefly discussed.
