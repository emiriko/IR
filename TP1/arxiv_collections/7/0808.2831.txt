Projective connections first appeared in Cartan's papers in the 1920's. Since
then they have resurfaced periodically in, for example, integrable systems and
perhaps most recently in the context of so called projectively equivariant
quantisation. We recall the notion of projective connection and describe its
relation with the algebra of densities on a manifold. In particular, we
construct a Laplace-type operator on functions using a Thomas projective
connection and a symmetric contravariant tensor of rank 2 (`upper metric').
