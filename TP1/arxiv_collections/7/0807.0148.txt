We measure the CP-violating asymmetries in decays to the D0 -> K+K- and D0 ->
pi+pi- CP eigenstates using 540 fb^{-1} of data collected with the Belle
detector at or near the Upsilon(4S) resonance. Cabibbo-favored D0 -> K-pi+
decays are used to correct for systematic detector effects. The results,
A_{CP}^{KK} = (-0.43 +- 0.30 +- 0.11)% and A_{CP}^{pipi} = (+0.43 +- 0.52 +-
0.12)%, are consistent with no CP violation.
