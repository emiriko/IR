Spinorial geometry techniques have recently been used to classify all half
supersymmetric solutions in gauged five dimensional supergravity with vector
multiplets. In this paper we consider solutions for which at least one of the
Killing spinors generates a timelike Killing vector. We obtain coordinate
transformations which considerably simplify the solutions, and in a number of
cases, we obtain explicitly some additional Killing vectors which were hidden
in the original analysis.
