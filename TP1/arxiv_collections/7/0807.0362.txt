Through a series of exact mappings we reinterpret the Bernoulli model of
sequence alignment in terms of the discrete-time totally asymmetric exclusion
process with backward sequential update and step function initial condition.
Using earlier results from the Bethe ansatz we obtain analytically the exact
distribution of the length of the longest common subsequence of two sequences
of finite lengths $X,Y$. Asymptotic analysis adapted from random matrix theory
allows us to derive the thermodynamic limit directly from the finite-size
result.
