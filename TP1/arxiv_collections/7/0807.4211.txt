The "standard" Brownian motion master equation, used to describe thermal
damping, is not completely positive, and does not admit a Monte Carlo method,
important in numerical simulations. To eliminate both these problems one must
add a term that generates additional position diffusion. He we show that one
can obtain a completely positive simple quantum Brownian motion, efficiently
solvable, without any extra diffusion. This is achieved by using a stochastic
Schroedinger equation (SSE), closely analogous to Langevin's equation, that has
no equivalent Markovian master equation. Considering a specific example, we
show that this SSE is sensitive to nonlinearities in situations in which the
master equation is not, and may therefore be a better model of damping for
nonlinear systems.
