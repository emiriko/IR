The thesis divides into three parts. The first is devoted to a careful study
of very convenient superspace conventions which are a basic tool for the second
part. A theorem is formulated that gives a clear statement about when the signs
of a superspace calculation can be omitted.
  The second part describes the type II superstring using Berkovits' pure
spinor formalism. The derivation of the supergravity constraints from classical
BRST invariance of Berkovits and Howe is carefully reviewed and new aspects are
added. The present derivation uses a covariant variation principle and stays
throughout in the Lagrangian formalism. A new result is the explicit form of
the BRST transformation of the worldsheet fields for type II. By further
deriving the form of the local supersymmetry transformations of the fermionic
fields, a connection is established to the starting point of those supergravity
calculations, which derive generalized Calabi Yau conditions from effective
four-dimensional supersymmetry.
  Generalized complex geometry is in turn the motivation for the last part,
which is based on the author's paper on derived brackets from sigma models and
the relation to integrability of generalized complex structures. Finally there
are detailed appendices on geometric brackets, generalized complex geometry,
Noether's theorem, Bianchi identities, supergauge transformations and the WZ
gauge, gamma-matrices and on some aspects of structure group connections.
