We present the quantum mechanics of "partial-trace" non-linear sigma models,
on the grounds of a fully symmetry-based procedure. After the general scheme is
sketched, the particular example of a particle on the two-sphere is explicitly
developed. As a remarkable feature, no explicit constraint treatment is
required nor ordering ambiguities do appear. Moreover, the energy spectrum is
recovered without extra terms in the curvature of the sphere.
