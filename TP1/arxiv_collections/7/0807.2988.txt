We study the European river Danube and the South American river Negro daily
water levels. We present a fit for the Negro daily water level period and
standard deviation. Unexpectedly, we discover that the river Negro and Danube
are mirror rivers in the sense that the daily water levels fluctuations
histograms are close to the BHP and reversed BHP, respectively.
