We show, the SR can appear in monostable overdamped systems driven by
additive mix of periodical signal and white Gaussian noise. It can be observed
as nonmonotonic dependence of SNR on the input noise intensity. In this sense
it is similar to classical SR observed in overdamped bistable systems with
potential barrier.
