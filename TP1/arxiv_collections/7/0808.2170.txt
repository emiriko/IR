We investigate possible effects of high order nonlinearities on the shapes of
infection refugia of the Hantavirus epidemic. We replace Fisher-like equations
that have been recently used to describe Hantavirus spread in mouse populations
by generalizations capable of describing Allee effects that are a consequence
of the high order nonlinearities. We analyze the equations to calculate steady
state solutions. We study the stability of those solutions under physical
conditions and compare to the earlier Fisher-like case. We consider spatial
modulation of the environment and find that unexpected results appear,
including a bifurcation that has not been studied before.
