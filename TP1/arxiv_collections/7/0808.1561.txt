Dislocations in a material will, when present in enough numbers, change the
speed of propagation of elastic waves. Consequently, two material samples,
differing only in dislocation density, will have different elastic constants, a
quantity that can be measured using Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy.
Measurements of this effect on aluminum samples are reported. They compare well
with the predictions of the theory.
