We formulate the Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model in 0+1 dimensions.
The thermodynamics captured by the partition function yields a bulk pressure,
as well as quark susceptibilities versus temperature that are similar to the
ones in 3+1 dimensions. Around the transition temperature the behavior in the
pressure and quark susceptibilities follows from the interplay between the
lowest Matsubara frequency and the Polyakov line. The reduction to the lowest
Matsubara frequency yields a matrix Model. In the presence of the Polyakov line
the UV part of the Dirac spectrum features oscillations when close to the
transition temperature.
