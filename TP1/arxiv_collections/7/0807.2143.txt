We present a protocol to simulate the correlations implied by nonmaximally
entangled two qubit states. We extend this protocol to simulate the non-local
part of these correlations. These protocols use single cbit communication and a
single use of Millionaire box (M-box). To the best of our knowledge, these
resources are weaker than those used in previous protocols using classical
communication.
