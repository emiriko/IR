We emphasize that non-conformal theories provide a natural playground for the
ideas of the Maldacena conjecture, opening the possibility of exploring
properties that could potentially be in the same universality class as QCD. In
particular, we discuss in detail how light-like Wilson loops, an important
ingredient in the prescription for scattering amplitudes, can be described in a
number of gravity duals of non-conformal gauge theories. We point out to a few
universal properties and the prominent role of the strong scale.
