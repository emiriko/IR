We study the nonlinear dynamics of a completely inhomogeneous DNA chain which
is governed by a perturbed sine-Gordon equation. A multiple scale perturbation
analysis provides perturbed kink-antikink solitons to represent open state
configuration with small fluctuation. The perturbation due to inhomogeneities
changes the velocity of the soliton. However, the width of the soliton remains
constant.
