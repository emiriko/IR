Andreev scattering of thermal excitations is a powerful tool for studying
quantized vortices and turbulence in superfluid He3-B at very low temperatures.
We write Hamilton's equations for a quasiparticle in the presence of a vortex
line, determine its trajectory, and find under wich conditions it is Andreev
reflected. To make contact with experiments, we generalize our results to the
Onsager vortex gas, and find values of the intervortex spacing in agreement
with less rigorous estimates.
