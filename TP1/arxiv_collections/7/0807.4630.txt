A first step in investigating colour symmetries of periodic and nonperiodic
patterns is determining the number of colours which allow perfect colourings of
the pattern under consideration. A perfect colouring is one where each symmetry
of the uncoloured pattern induces a global permutation of the colours. Two
cases are distinguished: Either perfect colourings with respect to all
symmetries, or with respect to orientation preserving symmetries only (no
reflections). For the important class of colourings of regular tilings (and
some Laves tilings) of the Euclidean or hyperbolic plane, this mainly
combinatorial question is addressed here using group theoretical methods.
