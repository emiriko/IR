The relationship between efficient quantum gate synthesis and control theory
has been a topic of interest in the quantum control literature. Motivated by
this work, we describe in the present article how the dynamic programming
technique from optimal control may be used for the optimal synthesis of quantum
circuits. We demonstrate simulation results on an example system on SU(2), to
obtain plots related to the gate complexity and sample paths for different
logic gates.
