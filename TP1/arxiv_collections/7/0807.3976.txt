DNA is an ideal candidate to organize matter on the nanoscale, primarily due
to the specificity and complexity of DNA based interactions. Recent advances in
this direction include the self-assembly of colloidal crystals using DNA
grafted particles. In this article we theoretically study the self-assembly of
DNA-caged particles. These nanoblocks combine DNA grafted particles with more
complicated purely DNA based constructs. Geometrically the nanoblock is a
sphere (DNA grafted particle) inscribed inside a polyhedron (DNA cage). The
faces of the DNA cage are open, and the edges are made from double stranded
DNA. The cage vertices are modified DNA junctions. We calculate the
equilibriuim yield of self-assembled, tetrahedrally caged particles, and
discuss their stability with respect to alternative structures. The
experimental feasability of the method is discussed. To conclude we indicate
the usefulness of DNA-caged particles as nanoblocks in a hierarchical
self-assembly strategy.
