We consider a nanomechanical resonator coupled to a double quantum dot. We
demonstrate how the finite-frequency current noise spectrum through the double
quantum dot can be used to distinguish classical and quantum behaviour in the
nearby nano-electromechanical resonator. We also show how the full frequency
current noise spectrum gives important information on the combined double
quantum dot-resonator energy spectrum. Finally, we point out regimes where the
quantum state of the resonator becomes squeezed, and also examine the
cross-correlated electron-phonon current noise.
