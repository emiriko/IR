We evaluate differential distributions for exclusive scalar $f_0(1500)$
production for $p \bar p \to N_1 N_2 f_0$ (FAIR@GSI) and $p p \to p p f_0$
(J-PARC@Tokai). Both QCD diffractive and pion-pion meson exchange current (MEC)
components are included. Rather large cross sections are predicted. The
pion-pion component, never discussed in the literature, dominates close to the
threshold while the diffractive component takes over for larger energies. The
diffractive component is calculated based on two-gluon impact factors as well
as in the framework of Khoze-Martin-Ryskin approach proposed for diffractive
Higgs boson production. Different unintegrated gluon distribution functions
(UGDFs) from the literature are used. The production of $f_0(1500)$ close to
threshold could limit the so-called $\pi NN$ form factor in the region of
larger pion virtualities.
