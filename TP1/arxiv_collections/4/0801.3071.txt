We discuss the B-meson light-cone wavefunction relevant for QCD factorization
approach for exclusive B-meson decays. We derive the operator product expansion
for the B-meson light-cone wavefunction, taking into account the local
composite operators of dimension less than 6 and calculating the radiative
corrections at order \alpha_s for the corresponding Wilson coefficients. The
result embodies peculiar UV and IR behaviors of the B-meson light-cone
wavefunction, the Sudakov-type double logarithmic effects and the mixing of the
multiparticle states with additional gluons inside the B meson. The former
effects are induced from the cusp singularity in the radiative corrections,
while the latter is manifested by the participation of the higher-dimensional
operators associated with the nonperturbative structure of the B meson.
