We prove exponential estimates for plurisubharmonic functions with respect to
Monge-Ampere measures with Holder continuous potential. As an application, we
obtain several stochastic properties for the equilibrium measures associated to
holomorphic maps on projective spaces. More precisely, we prove the exponential
decay of correlations, the central limit theorem for general d.s.h.
observables, and the large deviations theorem for bounded d.s.h. observables
and Holder continuous observables.
