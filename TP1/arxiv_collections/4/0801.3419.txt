The variation of TO zone-center vibration spectra with concentration in mixed
zincblende-type semiconductors can be understood within a paradigm of unified
"one bond - two modes" approach, which has been recently outlined as a rather
general concept, and emerges from a number of previous experimental and
theoretical studies. The crucial issue is that the vibration frequency,
associated with a certain cation-anion bond, depends on the length of the
latter, and the bond length, in its turn, depends not only on the average alloy
concentration, but on local variations of it. In an (A,B)C substitutional
alloy, the A-C bond length differ in A-rich and A-poor regions, yielding a
splitting of the A-C vibration frequency. Such splittings can be measured and
reproduced in first-principles calculations.
  An analysis of vibration spectra helps to get an insight into the structural
short-range (clustering) and long-range (formation of extended chains of
certain cation-anion pairs and other structural motives at the mesoscopic
scale) tendencies. For this however, one needs first-principles benchmark
calculations for representative model systems. The simplest yet important
result from first-principles calculations is a prediction of how the impurity
phonon mode evolves as isolated (distant) impurities get clustered.
