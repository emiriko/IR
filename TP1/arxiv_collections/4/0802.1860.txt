We consider the semilinear reaction diffusion equation
$\partial_t\phi-\nu\Delta\phi-V(x)\phi+f(\phi)=0$, $\nu>0$ in a bounded domain
$\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$. We assume the standard Allen-Cahn-type
nonlinearity, while the potential $V$ is either the inverse square potential
$V(x)=\delta |x|^{-2}$ or the borderline potential $V(x)=\delta
\mathrm{dist}(x,\partial\Omega)^{-2}$, $\delta\geq 0$ (thus including the
classical Allen-Cahn equation as a special case when $\delta=0$). In the
subcritical cases $\delta=0$, $N\geq 1$ and $0<\mu:=\frac{\delta}{\nu}<\mu^*$,
$N\geq 3$ (where $\mu^*$ is the optimal constant of Hardy and Hardy-type
inequalities), we present a new estimate on the dimension of the global
attractor. This estimate comes out by an improved lower bound for sums of
eigenvalues of the Laplacian by A. D. Melas (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.
\textbf{131} (2003), 631-636). The estimate is sharp, revealing the existence
of (an explicitly given) threshold value for the ratio of the volume to the
moment of inertia of $\Omega$ on which the dimension of the attractor may
considerably change. Consideration is also given on the finite dimensionality
of the global attractor in the critical case $\mu=\mu^*$.
