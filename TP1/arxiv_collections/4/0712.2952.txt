A Conway semiring is a semiring $S$ equipped with a unary operation $^*:S \to
S$, always called 'star', satisfying the sum star and product star identities.
It is known that these identities imply a Kleene type theorem. Some
computationally important semirings, such as $N$ or $N^{\rat}\llangle \Sigma^*
\rrangle$ of rational power series of words on $\Sigma$ with coefficients in
$N$, cannot have a total star operation satisfying the Conway identities. We
introduce here partial Conway semirings, which are semirings $S$ which have a
star operation defined only on an ideal of $S$; when the arguments are
appropriate, the operation satisfies the above identities. We develop the
general theory of partial Conway semirings and prove a Kleene theorem for this
generalization.
