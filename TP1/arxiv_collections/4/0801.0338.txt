Controlled movement and manipulation of magnetic micro and nanostructures
using magnetic forces can give rise to important applications in biomedecine,
diagnostics and immunology. We report controlled magnetophoresis and
stretching, in aqueous solution, of a DNA-based dumbbell structure containing
magnetic and diamagnetic microspheres. The velocity and stretching of the
dumbbell were experimentally measured and correlated with a theoretical model
based on the forces acting on individual magnetic beads or the entire dumbbell
structures. The results show that precise and predictable manipulation of
dumbbell structures is achievable and can potentially be applied to
immunomagnetic cell separators.
