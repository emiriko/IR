The controlled interaction between a single, trapped, laser-driven atom and
the mode of a high-finesse optical cavity allows for the generation of
temporally separated, entangled light pulses. Entanglement between the
photon-number fluctuations of the pulses is created and mediated via the atomic
center-of-mass motion, which is interfaced with light through the mechanical
effect of atom-photon interaction. By means of a quantum noise analysis we
determine the correlation matrix which characterizes the entanglement, as a
function of the system parameters. The scheme is feasible in experimentally
accessible parameter regimes. It may be easily extended to the generation of
entangled pulses at different frequencies, even at vastly different
wavelengths.
