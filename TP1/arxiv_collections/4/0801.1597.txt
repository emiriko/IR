We investigate the collision-limited electronic Raman response and the
attenuation of ultrasound in spin-singlet d-wave superconductors at low
temperatures. The dominating elastic collisions are treated within a t-matrix
approximation, which combines the description of weak (Born) and strong
(unitary) impurity scattering. In the long wavelength limit a two-fluid
description of both response and transport emerges. Collisions are here seen to
exclusively dominate the relaxational dynamics of the (Bogoliubov)
quasiparticle system and the analysis allows for a clear connection of response
and transport phenomena. When applied to quasi-2-d superconductors like the
cuprates, it turns out that the transport parameter associated with the Raman
scattering intensity for B1g and B2g photon polarization is closely related to
the corresponding components of the shear viscosity tensor, which dominates the
attenuation of ultrasound. At low temperatures we present analytic solutions of
the transport equations, resulting in a non-power-law behavior of the transport
parameters on temperature.
