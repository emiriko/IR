We investigate the Khovanov-Rozansky invariant of a certain tangle and its
compositions. Surprisingly the complexes we encounter reduce to ones that are
very simple. Furthermore, we discuss a "local" algorithm for computing
Khovanov-Rozansky homology and compare our results with those for the "foam"
version of sl_3-homology.
