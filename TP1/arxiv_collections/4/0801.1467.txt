Recent developments are summarised concerning low-energy KbarN interactions
as they relate to the possible existence of antikaon-nuclear quasibound states.
An exploratory study of antikaons bound to finite nuclei is performed, with
emphasis on the evolution of such states from light to heavy nuclei (A = 16 -
208). The energy dependent, driving attractive KbarN interactions are
constructed using the s-wave coupled-channel amplitudes involving the
Lambda(1405) and resulting from chiral SU(3) dynamics, plus p-wave amplitudes
dominated by the Sigma(1385). Effects of Pauli and short-range correlations are
discussed. The decay width induced by K^-NN two-body absorption is estimated
and found to be substantial. It is concluded that Kbar-nuclear quasibound
states can possibly exist with binding energies ranging from 60 to 100 MeV, but
with short life times corresponding to decay widths of the similar magnitudes.
