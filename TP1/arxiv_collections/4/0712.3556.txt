We study the critical behavior and phase diagram of the $d$-dimensional
random field O(N) model by means of the nonperturbative functional
renormalization group approach presented in the preceding paper. We show that
the dimensional reduction predictions, obtained from conventional perturbation
theory, break down below a critical dimension $d_{DR}(N)$ and we provide a
description of criticality, ferromagnetic ordering and quasi-long range order
in the whole $(N,d)$ plane. Below $d_{DR}(N)$, our formalism gives access to
both the typical behavior of the system, controlled by zero-temperature fixed
points with a nonanalytic dimensionless effective action, and to the physics of
rare low-energy excitations ("droplets"), described at nonzero temperature by
the rounding of the nonanalyticity in a thermal boundary layer.
