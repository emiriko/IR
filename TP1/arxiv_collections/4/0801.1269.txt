In large extra dimensional Kaluza-Klein (KK) scenario, where the usual
Standard Model (SM) matter is confined to a 3+1-dimensional hypersurface called
the 3-brane and gravity can propagate to the bulk (D=4+d, d being the number of
extra spatial dimensions), the light graviton KK modes can be produced inside
the supernova core due to the usual nucleon-nucleon bremstrahlung,
electron-positron and photon-photon annihilations. This photon inside the
supernova becomes plasmon due to the plasma effect. In this paper, we study the
energy-loss rate of SN 1987A due to the KK gravitons produced from the
plasmon-plasmon annihilation. We find that the SN 1987A cooling rate leads to
the conservative bound $M\_D$ > 22.9 TeV and 1.38 TeV for the case of two and
three space-like extra dimensions.
