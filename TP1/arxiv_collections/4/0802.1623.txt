The magnitude of binding energy used in the conventional nuclear theory to
explain the EMC experimental data, seems to be larger than the one expected. In
this paper to get sufficient depletion in the binding energy, different
oscillator-model parameters $ \textit{$h\omega$} $ for different shells and the
proton (neutron) structure function that have good agrement with experimental
data are used. The extracted results for $^4He, ^{12}C, ^{40}Ca$ and $^{56}Fe$
nuclei show that one can get improved results in medium x ranges by less
binding energy.
