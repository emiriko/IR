The interaction-free measurements proposed by Elitzur and Vaidman (EV IFM) is
a quantum mechanical method to find an object that interacts with other systems
solely via its explosion without exploding it. In this method, an object can be
found without ``touching it'', i.e. without any particle being at its vicinity.
