The theory of nonlinear diffraction of intensive light beams propagating
through photorefractive media is developed. Diffraction occurs on a reflecting
wire embedded in the nonlinear medium at relatively small angle with respect to
the direction of the beam propagation. It is shown that this process is
analogous to the generation of waves by a flow of a superfluid past an
obstacle. The ``equation of state'' of such a superfluid is determined by the
nonlinear properties of the medium. On the basis of this hydrodynamic analogy,
the notion of the ``Mach number'' is introduced where the transverse component
of the wave vector plays the role of the fluid velocity. It is found that the
Mach cone separates two regions of the diffraction pattern: inside the Mach
cone oblique dark solitons are generated and outside the Mach cone the region
of ``ship waves'' is situated. Analytical theory of ``ship waves'' is developed
and two-dimensional dark soliton solutions of the equation describing the beam
propagation are found. Stability of dark solitons with respect to their decay
into vortices is studied and it is shown that they are stable for large enough
values of the Mach number.
