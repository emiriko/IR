We summarize the di-hadron correlation results from RHIC, focusing on the
high $p_T$ region and lower $p_T$ region for the away-side. The former is
consistent with fragmentation of jets that surviving the medium, while the
latter suggests the redistribution of the energy from the quenched jets. We
also discuss the role of the jet in the intermediate $p_T$.
