We have studied the iso-height lines on the $\mathrm{WO_3}$ surface as a
physical candidate for conformally invariant curves. We have shown that these
lines are conformally invariant with the same statistics of domain walls in the
critical Ising model. They belong to the family of conformal invariant curves
called Schramm-Loewner evolution (or $SLE_{\kappa}$), with diffusivity of
$\kappa \sim 3$. This can be regarded as the first experimental observation of
SLE curves. We have also argued that Ballistic Deposition (BD) can serve as a
growth model giving rise to contours with similar statistics at large scales.
