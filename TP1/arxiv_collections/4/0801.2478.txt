The existence and uniqueness of nonnegative strong solutions for stochastic
porous media equations with noncoercive monotone diffusivity function and
Wiener forcing term is proven. The finite time extinction of solutions with
high probability is also proven in 1-D. The results are relevant for
self-organized critical behaviour of stochastic nonlinear diffusion equations
with critical states.
