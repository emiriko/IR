The effects of noncommutativity and of the existence of a minimal length on
the phase space of a dilatonic cosmological model are investigated. The
existence of a minimum length, results in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle
(GUP), which is a deformed Heisenberg algebra between the minisuperspace
variables and their momenta operators. We extend these deformed commutating
relations to the corresponding deformed Poisson algebra. For an exponential
dilaton potential, the exact classical and quantum solutions in the commutative
and noncommutative cases, and some approximate analytical solutions in the case
of GUP, are presented and compared.
