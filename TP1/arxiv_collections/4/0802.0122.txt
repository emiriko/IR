We explore stimulated photo-association in the context of attosecond
pump-probe schemes of atomic matter. An attosecond pulse -- the probe -- is
used to induce photo-association of an electronic wave packet which had been
created before, typically with an attosecond pump pulse at an atomic center
different from the one of photo-association. We will show that the electron
absorption is maximal for a certain delay between the pulses. Two ways of
enhancing and controlling stimulated photo-association are proposed, namely
using an additional infrared pulse to steer the electronic wave packet and
using a train of attosecond pulses instead of a single pair. A direct
application of ultrafast stimulated photo-association is the measurement of
atomic distances.
