Homogeneous nucleation and growth in a simplest two-dimensional phase field
model is numerically studied using the cell dynamics method. Whole process from
nucleation to growth is simulated and is shown to follow closely the
Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (KJMA) scenario of phase transformation.
Specifically the time evolution of the volume fraction of new stable phase is
found to follow closely the KJMA formula. By fitting the KJMA formula directly
to the simulation data, not only the Avrami exponent but the magnitude of
nucleation rate and, in particular, of incubation time are quantitatively
studied. The modified Avrami plot is also used to verify the derived KJMA
parameters. It is found that the Avrami exponent is close to the ideal
theoretical value m=3. The temperature dependence of nucleation rate follows
the activation-type behavior expected from the classical nucleation theory. On
the other hand, the temperature dependence of incubation time does not follow
the exponential activation-type behavior. Rather the incubation time is
inversely proportional to the temperature predicted from the theory of
Shneidman and Weinberg [J. Non-Cryst. Solids {\bf 160}, 89 (1993)]. A need to
restrict thermal noise in simulation to deduce correct Avrami exponent is also
discussed.
