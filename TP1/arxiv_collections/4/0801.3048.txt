We investigate the problem of autonomous agents processing pieces of
information that may be corrupted (tainted). Agents have the option of
contacting a central database for a reliable check of the status of the
message, but this procedure is costly and therefore should be used with
parsimony. Agents have to evaluate the risk of being infected, and decide if
and when communicating partners are affordable. Trustability is implemented as
a personal (one-to-one) record of past contacts among agents, and as a
mean-field monitoring of the level of message corruption. Moreover, this
information is slowly forgotten in time, so that at the end everybody is
checked against the database. We explore the behavior of a homogeneous system
in the case of a fixed pool of spreaders of corrupted messages, and in the case
of spontaneous appearance of corrupted messages.
