It is demonstrated that in photoabsorption by endohedral atoms some atomic
Giant resonances are almost completely destroyed while the others are totally
preserved due to different action on it of the fullerenes shell. As the first
example we discuss the 4d10 Giant resonance in Xe@C60 whereas as the second
serves the Giant autoionization resonance in Eu@C60. The qualitative difference
comes from the fact that photoelectrons from the 4d Giant resonance has small
energies (tens of eV) and are strongly reflected by the C60 fullerenes shell.
As to the Eu@C60, Giant autoionization leads to fast photoelectrons (about
hundred eV) that go out almost untouched by the C60 shell. As a result of the
outgoing electrons energy difference the atomic Giant resonances will be
largely destroyed in A@C60 while the Giant autoionization resonance will be
almost completely preserved. Thus, on the way from Xe@C60 Giant resonance to
Eu@C60 Giant autoionization resonance the oscillation structure should
disappear. Similar will be the decrease of oscillations on the way from pure
Giant to pure Giant autoionization resonances for the angular anisotropy
parameters. At Giant resonance frequencies the role of polarization of the
fullerenes shell by the incoming photon beam is inessential. Quite different is
the situation for the outer electrons in Eu@C60, the photoionization of which
will be also considered.
