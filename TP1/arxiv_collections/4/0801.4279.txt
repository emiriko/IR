We set up the Maxwell's equations and the corresponding classical wave
equations for the electromagnetic waves which together with the generating
source, a traveling oscillatory charge of zero rest mass, comprise a particle
traveling in the force field of an usual conservative potential and an
additional frictional force $f$. At the de Broglie wavelength scale and in the
classic-velocity limit, the total wave equation decomposes into a component
equation describing the particle kinetic motion, which for $f=0$ identifies
with the usual linear Schr\"odinger equation as previously. The $f$-dependent
probability density presents generally an observable diffusion current of a
real diffusion constant; this and the particle's usual quantum diffusion
current as a whole are under adiabatic condition conserved and obey the
Fokker-Planck equation. The corresponding extra, $f$-dependent term in the
Hamiltonian operator identifies with that obtained by H.-D. Doebner and G.A.
Goldin. The friction produces to the particle's wave amplitude a damping that
can describe well the effect due to a radiation (de)polarization field, which
is always by-produced by the particle's oscillatory charge in a (nonpolar)
dielectric medium. The radiation depolarization field in a dielectric vacuum
has two separate significances: it participates to exert on another particle an
attractive, depolarization radiation force which resembles in overall respects
Newton's universal gravity as we showed earlier, and it exerts on the particle
itself an attractive, self depolarization radiation force whose time rate gives
directly the frictional force $f$.
