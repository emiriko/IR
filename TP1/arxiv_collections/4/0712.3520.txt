The objective of this paper is to describe a simple phenomenological approach
for including incoherent dephasing processes in quantum transport models. The
presented illustrative numerical results show this model provides the
flexibility of adjusting the degree of phase and momentum relaxation
independently that is not currently available in mesoscopic physics and in
device simulations while retaining the simplicity of other phenomenological
models.
