The effect of cobalt and nickel substitutions for manganese on the physical
properties of the perovskite manganite La1.2Bi0.8Mn2-x(Ni/Co)xO6+d, with x =
0.0-0.8, has been investigated. It is observed that the ferromagnetism is
enhanced, TC being increased from 103 K for the parent compound (x = 0.0) to
178 K for Ni-phase, and to 181 K for the Co-phase (x = 0.8). Moreover, the
systems remain insulating and depict relatively large values of
magnetoresistance effect at low temperatures (up to 67 % at 90K and 70 kOe, for
x = 0.0 phase). These phenomena are interpreted by means of electronic phase
separation, where the ferromagnetic Mn4+/Ni2+ and Mn4+/Co2+ interactions
reinforce the Mn3+/Mn4+ interactions by super-exchange interaction. The
dielectric measurements below the magnetic transition temperatures exhibit weak
magneto-dielectric effect of around 0.25% at 80K, which may be due to
spin-lattice interaction.
