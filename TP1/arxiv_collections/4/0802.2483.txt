We propose a mesoscopic kinetic-inductance radiation detector based on a long
superconductor--normal metal--superconductor Josephson junction. The operation
of this proximity Josephson sensor (PJS) relies on large kinetic inductance
variations under irradiation due to the exponential temperature dependence of
the critical current. Coupled with a dc SQUID readout, the PJS is able to
provide a signal to noise (S/N) ratio up to ~10^3 in the THz regime if operated
as calorimeter, while electrical noise equivalent power (NEP) as low as
~7x10^{-20} W(Hz)^(-1/2) at 200 mK can be achieved in the bolometer operation.
The high performance together with the ease of fabrication make this structure
attractive as an ultrasensitive cryogenic detector of THz electromagnetic
radiation.
