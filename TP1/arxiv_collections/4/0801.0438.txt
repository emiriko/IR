We describe several classes of holomorphic functions of positive real part on
the unit ball; each is characterized by an operator-valued Herglotz formula.
Motivated by results of J.E. McCarthy and M. Putinar, we define a family of
weighted Cauchy-Fantappi\`e pairings on the ball and establish duality
relations between certain pairs of classes, and in particular we identify the
dual of the positive Schur class. We also establish the existence of self-dual
classes with respect to this pairing, and identify some extreme points of the
positive Schur class.
