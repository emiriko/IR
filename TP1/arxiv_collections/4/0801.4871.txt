It is the aim of this paper to summarize results about the construction of
amplitudes, which rigorously satisfy Mandelstam analyticity, crossing symmetry,
and (at least partly) the constraints imposed by elastic and inelastic
unitarity. The results are discussed under particular emphasis of a strong
increase of the absorptive part of the forward amplitude and the saturation of
the Froissart bound.
