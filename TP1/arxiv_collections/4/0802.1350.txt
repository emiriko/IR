The spin-orbit (SO) interaction in condensed matter can be described in terms
of a non-Abelian potential known in high-energy physics as a color field. I
show that a magnetic component of this color field inevitably generates
diamagnetic color currents which are just the equilibrium spin currents
discussed in a condensed matter context. These dissipationless spin currents
thus represent a universal property of systems with SO interaction. In
semiconductors with linear SO coupling the spin currents are related to the
effective non-Abelian field via Yang-Mills magnetostatics equation.
