In this paper we describe a new approach to programming which generalizes
object-oriented programming. It is based on using a new programming construct,
called concept, which generalizes classes. Concept is defined as a pair of two
classes: one reference class and one object class. Each concept has a parent
concept which is specified using inclusion relation generalizing inheritance.
We describe several important mechanisms such as reference resolution, context
stack, dual methods and life-cycle management, inheritance and polymorphism.
This approach to programming is positioned as a new programming paradigm and
therefore we formulate its main principles and rules.
