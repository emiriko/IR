A flat mounting unit with electronically variable thermal resistance [1] has
been presented in the last year [2]. The design was based on a Peltier cell and
the appropriate control electronics and software. The device is devoted
especially to the thermal characterization of packages, e.g. in dual cold plate
arrangements. Although this design meets the requirements of the static
measurement we are intended to improve its parameters as the settling time and
dynamic thermal impedance and the range of realized thermal resistance. The new
design applies the heat flux sensor developed by our team as well [3], making
easier the control of the device. This development allows even the realization
of negative thermal resistances.
