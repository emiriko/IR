Comparing the theoretically predicted and measured values of the mass
difference of the $B^{0}_{s}$ system, we estimate the lower bound on the mass
of the $Z^{\prime}$ boson of models based on the $SU(3)_{c} \otimes SU(3)_{L}
\otimes U(1)_X$ gauge group. By assuming zero-texture approaches of the quark
mass matrices, we find the ratio of the measured value to the theoretical
prediction from the Standard Model and the $Z^{\prime}$ contribution from the
331 models of the mass difference of the $B^{0}_{s}$ system. We find lower
bounds on the $Z^{\prime}$ mass ranging between 1 TeV and 30 TeV for the two
most popular 331 models, and four different zero-textures ans\"atze. The above
results are expressed as a function of the weak angle associated to the
$b-s-Z^{\prime}$ couplings.
