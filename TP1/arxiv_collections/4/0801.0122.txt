The emission of gravitational waves from a system of massive objects
interacting on hyperbolic orbits is studied in the quadrupole approximation.
Analytic expressions are derived for the gravitational radiation luminosity,
the total energy output and the gravitational radiation amplitude. An
estimation of the expected number of events towards different targets (i.e.
globular clusters and the center of the Galaxy) is also given. In particular,
for a dense stellar cluster at the galactic center, a rate up to one event per
year is obtained.
