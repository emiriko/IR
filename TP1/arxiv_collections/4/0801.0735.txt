Over the past two decades, substantial efforts have been made to understand
the way in which physics enforces the ordinary topology and causal structure
that we observe, from subnuclear to cosmological scales. We review the status
of topological censorship and the topology of event horizons; chronology
protection in classical and semiclassical gravity; and related progress in
establishing quantum energy inequalities.
