It is widely believed that chiral symmetry is restored not only at high
temperatures, but also at high nuclear densities. The drop of the order
parameter of the chiral phase transition, the chiral condensate, with density
has indeed been calculated in various models and is as such a rather robust
result. In this talk I point out that the connection of this property with
actual observables is far less clear. For this task a good hadronic description
of the primary production of hadrons, their propagation inside the nuclear
medium, their decay and the propagation of the decay products through the
medium to the detector all have to be treated with equal accuracy and weight.
In this talk I illustrate with the examples of $\omega$ production and
$\pi^0\pi^0$ production how important in particular final state interactions
are.
