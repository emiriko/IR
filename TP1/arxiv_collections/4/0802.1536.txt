Wooters, Zurek and others have shown that "A Single Quantum Cannot Be
Cloned". The reason is two-fold: 1. A quantum cloner would permit FTL
signaling; 2. A quantum cloner would violate the linearity requirement for
quantum superposition. I present here a similar proof that two arbitrary
quantum states cannot be universally welded together to produce a double
quantum state. In particular, opposite polarization states cannot be perfectly
merged. This paper closes another FTL loophole and discloses a new law of
nature: Perfect quantum weddings are not possible.
