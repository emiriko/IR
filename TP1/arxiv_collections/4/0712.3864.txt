We propose a scheme for realizing the Ising spin-spin interaction and atomic
cluster states utilizing trapped atoms in coupled microcavities. It is shown
that the atoms can interact with each other via the exchange of virtual photons
of the cavities. Through suitably tuning the parameters, an effective Ising
spin-spin interaction can be generated in this optical system, which is used to
produce the cluster states. This scheme does not need the preparation of
initial states of atoms and cavity modes, and is insensitive to cavity decay.
