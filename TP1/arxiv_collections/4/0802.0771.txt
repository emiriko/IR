The spatially uniaxially anisotropic d=3 Ising spin glass is solved exactly
on a hierarchical lattice. Five different ordered phases, namely ferromagnetic,
columnar, layered, antiferromagnetic, and spin-glass phases, are found in the
global phase diagram. The spin-glass phase is more extensive when randomness is
introduced within the planes than when it is introduced in lines along one
direction. Phase diagram cross-sections, with no Nishimori symmetry, with
Nishimori symmetry lines, or entirely imbedded into Nishimori symmetry, are
studied. The boundary between the ferromagnetic and spin-glass phases can be
either reentrant or forward, that is either receding from or penetrating into
the spin-glass phase, as temperature is lowered. However, this boundary is
always reentrant when the multicritical point terminating it is on the
Nishimori symmetry line.
