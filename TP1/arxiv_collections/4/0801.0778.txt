Revised analysis of $\Sigma$ beam asymmetry for the $\eta$ photoproduction on
the free proton reveals a structure at $W\sim 1.69$ GeV. Fit of the
experimental data based on the E429 solution of the SAID partial wave analysis
suggests a narrow ($\Gamma \leq 25$ MeV) resonance. Possible candidates are
$P_{11}, P_{13}$, or $D_{13}$ resonances. The result is considered in
conjunction with the recent evidence for a bump-like structure at $W\sim 1.67 -
1.68$ GeV in the quasi-free $\eta$ photoproduction on the neutron.
