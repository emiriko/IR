Condensation of exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities takes place
despite in plane disorder. Below the critical density the inhomogeneity of the
potential seen by the polaritons strongly limits the spatial extension of the
ground state. Above the critical density, in presence of weak disorder, this
limitation is spontaneously overcome by the non linear interaction, resulting
in an extended synchronized phase. This mechanism is clearly evidenced by
spatial and spectral studies, coupled to interferometric measurements. In case
of strong disorder, several non phase-locked (independent) condensates can be
evidenced. The transition from synchronized phase to desynchronized phase is
addressed considering multiple realizations of the disorder.
