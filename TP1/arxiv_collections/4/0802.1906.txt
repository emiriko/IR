We propose two novel schemes to engineer four-partite entangled
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states in a deterministic way by using
chains of (two-level) Rydberg atoms within the framework of cavity QED. These
schemes are based on the resonant interaction of the atoms with a bimodal
cavity that simultaneously supports, in contrast to a single-mode cavity, two
independent modes of the photon field. In addition, we suggest the schemes to
reveal the non-classical correlations for the engineered GHZ and W states. It
is shown how these schemes can be extended in order to produce general
N-partite entangled GHZ and W states.
