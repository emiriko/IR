Individual electrodynamically trapped and laser cooled ions are addressed in
frequency space using radio-frequency radiation in the presence of a static
magnetic field gradient. In addition, an interaction between motional and spin
states induced by an rf field is demonstrated employing rf-optical double
resonance spectroscopy. These are two essential experimental steps towards
realizing a novel concept for implementing quantum simulations and quantum
computing with trapped ions.
