We consider non-linear changes of variables and Fubini's theorem for certain
integrals over a two-dimensional local field. An interesting example is
presented in which imperfectness of a finite characteristic local field causes
Fubini's theorem to unexpectedly fail. The relationship to ramification theory
is discussed.
