We theoretically investigate strong coupling between a single molecule and a
single metallic nanoparticle. A theory suited for the quantum-mechanical
description of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) is developed. The coupling
between these SPPs and a single molecule, and the modified molecular dynamics
in presence of the nanoparticle are described within a combined Drude and
boundary-element-method approach. Our results show that strong coupling is
possible for single molecules and metallic nanoparticles, and can be observed
in fluorescence spectroscopy through the splitting of emission peaks.
