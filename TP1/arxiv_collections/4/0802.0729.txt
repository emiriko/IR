This numerical study examines the importance of self-consistently accounting
for transport and electrostatics in the calculaiton of semiconductor/metal
Schottky contact resistivity. It is shown that ignoring such self-consistency
results in significant under-estimation of the contact resistivity. An explicit
numerical method has also been proposed to efficiently improve contact
resistivity calculations.
