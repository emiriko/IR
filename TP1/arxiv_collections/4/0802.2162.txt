We discuss collider signatures of (1,1)-th Kaluza-Klein (KK) mode vector
bosons in the framework of two universal extra dimension model, at a future
electron-positron collider. Production of the (1,1)-th KK mode of electro-weak
vector bosons (B(1,1), W3(1,1)), are considered in association with a hard
photon. Without caring about the decay products of those vector bosons, one can
measure the masses of these particles just by looking at the photon energy
distribution. Once produced these particles dominantly decay to a pair of jets
or to a pair of top quarks. Thus we look for a pair of jets or a pair of top
quarks in association with a photon. Upto the kinematic limit of the collider,
signals from the B(1,1) production and decay in both the above mentioned
channels are greater than the $5\sigma$ fluctuation of the Standard Model
background. However, the number of events from W3(1,1) production and decay is
smaller and its detection prospect is not very good.
