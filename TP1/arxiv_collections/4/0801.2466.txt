We demonstrate theoretically that a charge current and a spin current are
generated by spin dynamics in the presence of spin-orbit interaction in the
perturbative regime. We consider a general spin-orbit interaction including the
spatially inhomogeneous case. Spin current due to spin damping is identified as
one origin of generated charge current, but other contributions exist, such as
the one due to an induced conservative field and the one arising from the
inhomogeneity of spin-orbit interaction.
