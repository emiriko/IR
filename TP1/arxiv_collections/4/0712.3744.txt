  Abstract : "This paper deals with the convergence of the expected improvement
algorithm, a popular global optimization algorithm based on a Gaussian process
model of the function to be optimized. The first result is that under some mild
hypotheses on the covariance function k of the Gaussian process, the expected
improvement algorithm produces a dense sequence of evaluation points in the
search domain, when the function to be optimized is in the reproducing kernel
Hilbert space generated by k. The second result states that the density
property also holds for P-almost all continuous functions, where P is the
(prior) probability distribution induced by the Gaussian process."
