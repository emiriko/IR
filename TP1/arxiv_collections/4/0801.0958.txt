Using three point QCD sum rules method, the form factors relevant to the
semileptonic
  $B_{s}\to D_{sJ}(2460)\ell\nu$ decay are calculated. The $q^2$ dependencies
of these form factors are evaluated. The dependence of the asymmetry parameter
$\alpha$, characterizing the polarization of $D_{sJ}$ meson, on $q^2$ is
studied. This study gives useful information about the structure of the
$D_{sJ}$ meson. Finally the branching ratio of this decay is also estimated and
is shown that it can be easily detected at LHC.
