All atom molecular dynamics simulations with explicit water were done to
study the interaction between two parallel double-stranded DNA molecules in the
presence of the multivalent counterions putrescine (2+), spermidine (3+),
spermine (4+) and cobalt hexamine (3+). The inter-DNA interaction potential is
obtained with the umbrella sampling technique. The attractive force is
rationalized in terms of the formation of ion bridges, i.e. multivalent ions
which are simultaneously bound to the two opposing DNA molecules. The lifetime
of the ion bridges is short on the order of a few nanoseconds.
