We propose skewed stable random projections for approximating the pth
frequency moments of dynamic data streams (0<p<=2), which has been frequently
studied in theoretical computer science and database communities. Our method
significantly (or even infinitely when p->1) improves previous methods based on
(symmetric) stable random projections.
  Our proposed method is applicable to data streams that are (a) insertion only
(the cash-register model); or (b) always non-negative (the strict Turnstile
model), or (c) eventually non-negative at check points. This is only a minor
restriction for practical applications.
  Our method works particularly well when p = 1+/- \Delta and \Delta is small,
which is a practically important scenario. For example, \Delta may be the decay
rate or interest rate, which are usually small. Of course, when \Delta = 0, one
can compute the 1th frequent moment (i.e., the sum) essentially error-free
using a simple couter. Our method may be viewed as a ``genearlized counter'' in
that it can count the total value in the future, taking in account of the
effect of decaying or interest accruement.
  In a summary, our contributions are two-fold. (A) This is the first propsal
of skewed stable random projections. (B) Based on first principle, we develop
various statistical estimators for skewed stable distributions, including their
variances and error (tail) probability bounds, and consequently the sample
complexity bounds.
