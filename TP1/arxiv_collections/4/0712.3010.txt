The atomic cascade in $\mu^- p$ and $\pi^- p$ atoms has been studied with the
improved version of the extended cascade model in which new quantum mechanical
calculations of the differential and integral cross sections of the elastic
scattering, Stark transitions and Coulomb de-excitation have been included for
the principal quantum number values $n\le 8$ and the relative energies $E \ge
0.01$ eV. The $X$-ray yields and kinetic energy distributions are compared with
the experimental data.
