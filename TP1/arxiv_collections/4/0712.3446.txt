We propose a description of the vortex dynamics in YBCO films from the
critical to the normal states. This description supposes that the vortex motion
is thermally activated along the twin boundaries of the films. The
discontinuity observed in the current-voltage curves at the transition to the
normal state is explained by the sudden increase in the dissipated power rate
due to vortex depinning. However, near the critical temperature, this
phenomenon does not occur because the vortex activation energy is near zero. We
also show how the current at the transition to the normal state can be computed
from the current-voltage curves measured at low currents. The predictions of
this description are compared to the data published by Gonzalez et al.
