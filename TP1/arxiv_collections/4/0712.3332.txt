A molecular dynamics calculation of the amino acid polar requirement is
presented and used to score the canonical genetic code. Monte Carlo simulation
shows that this computational polar requirement has been optimized by the
canonical genetic code more than any previously-known measure. These results
strongly support the idea that the genetic code evolved from a communal state
of life prior to the root of the modern ribosomal tree of life.
