The response of superconducting aluminum to electromagnetic radiation is
investigated in a broad frequency (45 MHz to 40 GHz) and temperature range
($T>T_c/2$), by measuring the complex conductivity. While the imaginary part
probes the superfluid density (Cooper-pairs), the real part monitors the
opening of the superconducting energy gap and -- most important here -- the
zero-frequency quasi-particle response. Varying the mean free path gives some
insight into the dynamics, scattering and coherence effects of the
quasi-particles in the superconducting state.
