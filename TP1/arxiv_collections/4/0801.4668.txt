We consider a stochastic control problem where the set of controls is not
necessarily convex and the system is governed by a nonlinear backward
stochastic differential equation. We establish necessary as well as sufficient
conditions of optimality for two models. The first concerns the strict
(classical) controls. The second is an extension of the first to relaxed
controls, who are a measure valued processes.
