We analyze the effect of local spin operators in the Kitaev model on the
honeycomb lattice. We show, in perturbation around the isolated-dimer limit,
that they create Abelian anyons together with fermionic excitations which are
likely to play a role in experiments. We derive the explicit form of the
operators creating and moving Abelian anyons without creating fermions and show
that it involves multi-spin operations. Finally, the important experimental
constraints stemming from our results are discussed.
