CdS nanotubes with wall thickness comparable to excitonic diameter of the
bulk material are synthesized by a chemical route. A change in experimental
conditions result in formation of nanowires, and well-separated nanoparticles.
The diameter and wall thickness of nanotubes measured to be 14.4 $\pm$ 6.1 and
4.7 $\pm$ 2.2 nm, respectively. A large number of CdS nanocrystallites having
wurzite structure constitute these nanotubes. These nanotubes show high energy
shifting of optical absorption and photoluminescence peak positions, compared
to its bulk value, due to quantum confinement effect. It is proposed that
nucleation and growth of bubbles and particles in the chemical reaction, and
their kinetics and interactions are responsible for the formation of nanotubes.
