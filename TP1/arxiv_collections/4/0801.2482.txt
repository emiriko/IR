A reanalysis of the radiative pion decay together with the calculation of the
radiative corrections within chiral perturbation theory (CHPT) is performed.
The amplitude of this decay contains an inner Bremsstrahlung contribution and a
structure-dependent part that are both accessible in experiments. In order to
obtain a reliable estimate of the hadronic contributions we combine the CHPT
result with a large-N_C expansion and experimental data on other decays, which
makes it possible to determine the occurring coupling constants.
