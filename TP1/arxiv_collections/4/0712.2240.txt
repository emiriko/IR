Scientific theories need to be testable by observations, say using Bayes'
theorem. A complete theory needs at least the three parts of dynamical laws for
specified physical variables, the correct solution of the dynamical laws
(boundary conditions), and the connection with observations or experience or
conscious perceptions (laws of psycho-physical parallelism). Principles are
proposed for Bayesian meta-theories. One framework that obeys these principles
is Sensible Quantum Mechanics (SQM), which is discussed. In principle, it
allows one to test between single-history and many-worlds theories, and to
discuss threats to certain theories from fake universes and Boltzmann brains.
The threat of fake universes may be dismissed if one doubts the
substrate-independence of consciousness, which seems very implausible in the
SQM framework. Boltzmann brains seem more problematic, though there are many
conceivable solutions. SQM also suggests the possibility that past steps along
our evolutionary ancestry may be so rare that they have occurred nowhere else
within the part of the universe that we can observe.
