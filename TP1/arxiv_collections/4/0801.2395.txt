We present a quasi-particle model that allows for a simple description of the
electronic properties of metallic helimagnets. For weak quenched disorder, we
find a leading linear temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity for
3-d materials. This is reminiscent of the behavior of nonmagnetic 2-d systems,
and reflects a general tendency of certain properties of bulk helimagnets to
appear effectively 2-d. The sign of the effect is opposite to that in
nonmagnetic 2-d materials. These surprising predictions should be observable in
weak helimagnets.
