Here, we theoretically analyze spectra of weakly attenuated electromagnetic
waves which may appear in a Fermi-liquid of charge carriers in
quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) layered conductors when an external magnetic field
is applied perpendicularly to the conducting layers. We study transverse modes
propagating along the magnetic field. The frequencies of the modes are assumed
to be lower than the cyclotron frequency of the charge carriers. It is shown
that Fermi-liquid interaction of the charge carriers in Q2D conductors gives
rise to a mode which cannot appear in a gase of charged quasiparticles, as well
as it happens in conventional metals. Also, we show that the Fermi surface
plofile may cause significant changes in the waves spectra and we analyze these
changes.
