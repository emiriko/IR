It has previously been proposed that annihilating dark matter particles with
MeV-scale masses could be responsible for the flux of 511 keV photons observed
from the region of the Galactic Bulge. The conventional wisdom, however, is
that it is very challenging to construct a viable particle physics model
containing MeV dark matter. In this letter, we challenge this conclusion by
describing a simple and natural supersymmetric model in which the lightest
supersymmetric particle naturally has a MeV-scale mass and the other
phenomenological properties required to generate the 511 keV emission. In
particular, the small ($\sim$ $10^{-5}$) effective couplings between dark
matter and the Standard Model fermions required in this scenario naturally lead
to radiative corrections that generate MeV-scale masses for both the dark
matter candidate and the mediator particle.
