We provide evidence for the existence of a {\em quantum critical point} at
the metallization of magnetite Fe$_{3}$O$_{4}$ at an applied pressure of $p_{c}
\approx 8$ GPa. We show that the present ac magnetic susceptibility data
support earlier resistivity data. The Verwey temperature scales with pressure
$T_{V}\sim (1-p/p_{c})^{\nu}$, with $\nu\sim 1/3$. The resistivity data shows a
temperature dependence $\rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{n}$, with $n\simeq 3$ above and
2.5 at the critical pressure, respectively. This difference in $n$ with
pressure is a sign of critical behavior at $p_{c}$. The magnetic susceptibility
is smooth near the critical pressure, both at the Verwey transition and near
the ferroelectric anomaly. A comparison with the critical behavior observed in
the Mott-Hubbard and related systems is made.
