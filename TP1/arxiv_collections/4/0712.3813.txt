The diffractive nature of light has limited optics and photonics to operate
at scales much larger than the wavelength of light. The major challenge in
scaling-down integrated photonics is how to mold the light flow below
diffraction-limit in all three dimensions. A high index solid immersion lens
can improve the spatial resolution by increasing the medium refractive index,
but only to few times higher than in air. Photonic crystals can guide light in
three dimensions, however, the guided beam width is around a wavelength.
Surface plasmons has a potential to reach the sub-wavelength scales;
nevertheless, it is confined in the two-dimensional interface between metals
and dielectrics. Here, we present a new approach for molding the light flow at
the deep sub-wavelength scale, using metamaterials with uniquely designed
dispersion. We develop a design methodology for realizing sub-wavelength ray
optics, and demonstrate lambda/10 width light beams flow through
three-dimensional space.
