The active region of a ballistic nanostructure is an open quantum-mechanical
system, whose nonunitary evolution (decoherence) towards a nonequilibrium
steady state is determined by carrier injection from the contacts. The purpose
of this paper is to provide a simple theoretical description of the
contact-induced decoherence in ballistic nanostructures, which is established
within the framework of the open systems theory. The active region's evolution
in the presence of contacts is generally non-Markovian. However, if the
contacts' energy relaxation due to electron-electron scattering is sufficiently
fast, then the contacts can be considered memoryless on timescales coarsened
over their energy relaxation time, and the evolution of the current-limiting
active region can be considered Markovian. Therefore, we first derive a general
Markovian map in the presence of a memoryless environment, by coarse-graining
the exact short-time non-Markovian dynamics of an abstract open system over the
environment memory-loss time, and we give the requirements for the validity of
this map. We then introduce a model contact-active region interaction that
describes carrier injection from the contacts for a generic two-terminal
ballistic nanostructure. Starting from this model interaction and using the
Markovian dynamics derived by coarse-graining over the effective memory-loss
time of the contacts, we derive the formulas for the nonequilibrium
steady-state distribution functions of the forward and backward propagating
states in the nanostructure's active region. On the example of a double-barrier
tunneling structure, the present approach yields an I-V curve with all the
prominent resonant features. The relationship to the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker
formalism is also discussed, as well as the inclusion of scattering.
