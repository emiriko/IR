We review the construction of the tensorial structure of the graviton
propagator in the context of loop quantum gravity and spinfoam formalism. The
main result of this analysis is that applying the same strategy used to compute
the diagonal terms, the Barrett-Crane vertex is unable to yield the correct
propagator in the long distance limit. The problem is in the
intertwiner-independence of the Barrett-Crane vertex. We also review the
asymptotic behavior of an alternative vertex that is able to give the correct
propagator.
