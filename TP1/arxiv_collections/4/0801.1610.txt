We study numerically the character of electron eigenstates of the three
dimensional disordered Anderson model. Analysis of the statistics of inverse
participation ratio as well as numerical evaluation of the electron-hole
correlation function confirm that there are no localized states below the
mobility edge, as well as no metallic state in the tail of the conductive band.
We discuss also finite size effects observed in the analysis of all the
discussed quantities.
