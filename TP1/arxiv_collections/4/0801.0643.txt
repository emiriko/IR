A scheme of an optical detector is proposed for checking Einsteins
equivalence principle (EEP) in a null gravitational redshift experiment and for
testing methods for calculating the length of a resonator in a weak variable
gravitational field by recording the variations of the difference frequency of
resonators caused by lunisolar variations of the geopotential in a double or a
two-resonator laser system.
