Edwards et al. [Nature 449, 1044-1048 (2007)] revisited well-known studies
reporting power-laws in the frequency distribution of flight duration of
wandering albatrosses, and concluded that no L\'evy process could model recent
observations with higher resolution. Here we show that this re-analysis suffers
from a conceptual misunderstanding, and that the new albatross data remain
consistent with a biological L\'evy flight.
