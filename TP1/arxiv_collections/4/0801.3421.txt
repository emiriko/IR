The discovery of quantum oscillations in the normal-state electrical
resistivity of YBa2Cu3O6.5 provides the first evidence for the existence of
Fermi surface (FS) pockets in an underdoped cuprate. However, the pockets'
electron vs. hole character, and the very interpretation in terms of closed FS
contours, are the subject of considerable debate. Angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES), with its ability to probe electronic dispersion as well
as the FS, is ideally suited to address this issue. Unfortunately, the ARPES
study of YBa2C3O7-d (YBCO) has been hampered by the technique's surface
sensitivity. Here we show that this stems from the polarity and corresponding
self-doping of the YBCO surface. By in-situ deposition of potassium atoms on
the cleaved surface, we are able to continuously tune the doping of a single
sample from the heavily overdoped to the underdoped regime. This reveals the
progressive collapse of the normal-metal-like FS into four disconnected nodal
FS arcs, or perhaps into hole but not electron pockets, in underdoped YBCO6.5.
