Subsystem codes are the most versatile class of quantum error-correcting
codes known to date that combine the best features of all known passive and
active error-control schemes. The subsystem code is a subspace of the quantum
state space that is decomposed into a tensor product of two vector spaces: the
subsystem and the co-subsystem. A generic method to derive subsystem codes from
existing subsystem codes is given that allows one to trade the dimensions of
subsystem and co-subsystem while maintaining or improving the minimum distance.
As a consequence, it is shown that all pure MDS subsystem codes are derived
from MDS stabilizer codes. The existence of numerous families of MDS subsystem
codes is established. Propagation rules are derived that allow one to obtain
longer and shorter subsystem codes from given subsystem codes. Furthermore,
propagation rules are derived that allow one to construct a new subsystem code
by combining two given subsystem codes.
