We address the formation of optical surface waves at the very edge of
semiconductor materials illuminated by modulated light beams that generate
thermal waves rapidly fading in the bulk material. We find families of
thresholdless surface waves which existing due to the combined action of
thermally-induced refractive index modulations and instantaneous Kerr-type
nonlinearity.
