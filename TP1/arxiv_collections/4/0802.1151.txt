The recently developed 'Resummed' ChPT is illustrated on the case of
pseudoscalar meson decay constants. We try to get an estimate of the eta decay
constant, which is not well known from experiments, while using several ways
including the Generalized ChPT Lagrangian to gather information beyond Standard
next-to-leading order. We compare the results to published ChPT predictions,
our own Standard ChPT calculations and available phenomenological estimates.
