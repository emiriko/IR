We present in detail a recent conjecture on self-adjoint representations of
the Temperley-Lieb algebra for particular values on the unit circle. The
formulation in terms of graphical calculus is emphasized and discussed for
several examples. The role of PT (parity and time reversal) invariance is
highlighted as it might prove important for generalising the construction to
other cases.
