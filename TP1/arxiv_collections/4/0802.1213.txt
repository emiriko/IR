We demonstrate confinement of $^{85}$Rb atoms in a dark, toroidal optical
trap. We use a spatial light modulator to convert a single blue-detuned
Gaussian laser beam to a superposition of Laguerre-Gaussian modes that forms a
ring-shaped intensity null bounded harmonically in all directions. We measure a
1/e spin-relaxation lifetime of ~1.5 seconds for a trap detuning of 4.0 nm. For
smaller detunings, a time-dependent relaxation rate is observed. We use these
relaxation rate measurements and imaging diagnostics to optimize trap alignment
in a programmable manner with the modulator. The results are compared with
numerical simulations.
