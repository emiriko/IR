We report measurements of the non-resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (NRIXS)
from the O 1s orbitals in ice Ih, and also report calculations of the
corresponding spectra for ice Ih and several other phases of water ice. We find
that the intermediate-energy fine structure may be calculated well using an ab
initio real-space full multiple scattering approach, and that it provides a
strong fingerprint of the intermediate-range order for some ice phases. These
results have important consequences for future NRIXS measurements of
high-pressure phases of ice and also may call into question the assumption that
the wavefunctions for final states within a few eV of the absorption edge are
strongly localized.
