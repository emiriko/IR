Teleportation is a crucial element in fault-tolerant quantum computation and
a complete understanding of its capacity is very important for the practical
implementation of optimal fault-tolerant architectures. It is known that
stabilizer codes support a natural set of gates that can be more easily
implemented by teleportation than any other gates. These gates belong to the so
called $\mathcal{C}_k$ hierarchy introduced by Gottesman and Chuang (Nature
\textbf{402}, 390). Moreover, a subset of $\mathcal{C}_k$ gates, called
semi-Clifford operations, can be implemented by an even simpler architecture
than the traditional teleportation setup (Phys. Rev. \textbf{A62}, 052316).
However, the precise set of gates in $\mathcal{C}_k$ remains unknown, even for
a fixed number of qubits $n$, which prevents us from knowing exactly what
teleportation is capable of. In this paper we study the structure of
$\mathcal{C}_k$ in terms of semi-Clifford operations, which send by conjugation
at least one maximal abelian subgroup of the $n$-qubit Pauli group into another
one. We show that for $n=1,2$, all the $\mathcal{C}_k$ gates are semi-Clifford,
which is also true for $\{n=3,k=3\}$. However, this is no longer true for
$\{n>2,k>3\}$. To measure the capability of this teleportation primitive, we
introduce a quantity called `teleportation depth', which characterizes how many
teleportation steps are necessary, on average, to implement a given gate. We
calculate upper bounds for teleportation depth by decomposing gates into both
semi-Clifford $\mathcal{C}_k$ gates and those $\mathcal{C}_k$ gates beyond
semi-Clifford operations, and compare their efficiency.
