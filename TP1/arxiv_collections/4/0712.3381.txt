We report Raman scattering spectra for single crystals of overdoped
Tl2Ba2CuO6+d (Tl-2201) at low temperatures. It was observed that the
pair-breaking peaks in A1g and B1g spectra radically shift to lower energy with
carrier doping. We interpret it as s-wave component mixing into d-wave,
although the crystal structure is tetragonal. Since similar phenomena were
observed also in YBa2Cu3Oy and Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oz, we conclude that s-wave mixing is
a common property for overdoped high-Tc superconductors.
