For Au + Au collisions at 200 GeV we measure neutral pion production with
good statistics for transverse momentum, p_T, up to 20 GeV/c. A fivefold
suppression is found, which is essentially constant for 5 < p_T < 20 GeV/c.
Experimental uncertainties are small enough to constrain any model-dependent
parameterization for the transport coefficient of the medium, e.g. \mean(q^hat)
in the parton quenching model. The spectral shape is similar for all collision
classes, and the suppression does not saturate in Au+Au collisions; instead, it
increases proportional to the number of participating nucleons, as N_part^2/3.
