It is well known that correlations in microarray data represent a serious
nuisance deteriorating the performance of gene selection procedures. This paper
is intended to demonstrate that the correlation structure of microarray data
provides a rich source of useful information. We discuss distinct correlation
substructures revealed in microarray gene expression data by an appropriate
ordering of genes. These substructures include stochastic proportionality of
expression signals in a large percentage of all gene pairs, negative
correlations hidden in ordered gene triples, and a long sequence of weakly
dependent random variables associated with ordered pairs of genes. The reported
striking regularities are of general biological interest and they also have
far-reaching implications for theory and practice of statistical methods of
microarray data analysis. We illustrate the latter point with a method for
testing differential expression of nonoverlapping gene pairs. While designed
for testing a different null hypothesis, this method provides an order of
magnitude more accurate control of type 1 error rate compared to conventional
methods of individual gene expression profiling. In addition, this method is
robust to the technical noise. Quantitative inference of the correlation
structure has the potential to extend the analysis of microarray data far
beyond currently practiced methods.
