The unfolded formulation for arbitrary massless mixed-symmetry bosonic and
fermionic fields in Minkowski space is constructed. The unfolded form is proved
to be uniquely determined by the requirement that all gauge symmetries are
manifest. The unfolded equations have the form of a covariant constancy
condition. The gauge fields and gauge parameters are differential forms with
values in certain irreducible Lorentz tensors. The unfolded equations for
bosons determine completely those for fermions. The proposed unfolded
formulation also contains dual formulations for massless mixed-symmetry fields.
