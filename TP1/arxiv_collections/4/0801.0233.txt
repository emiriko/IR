The product of any finite number of factorial Schur functions can be expanded
as a $Z[y]$-linear combination of Schur functions. We give a rule for computing
the coefficients in such an expansion which generalizes a specialization of the
Molev-Sagan rule, which in turn generalizes the classical Littlewood-Richardson
rule.
