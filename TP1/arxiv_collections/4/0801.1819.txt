The ability of metal adsorption to transfer charge to the surface of single
molecular carbon sheets is explored in this paper. Though other metals are
considered we basically will deal with Lithium We concentrate on fairly small
sheets and examined the minimum threshold size of a molecular surface needed to
separate metals. From our quantum chemical calculations we deduce that a
molecular surface of six benzene rings is needed for Lithium dimers to be
separated. We further observe symmetry breaking, when two lithium atoms are
adsorbed right opposite to each other on the two sides of the sheet.
