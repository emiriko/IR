We consider the (multi) Splitting function of Wilson loops and MHV gluon
scattering S matrix elements in N=4 SYM. At strong coupling, one can utilize
the methods of Alday and Maldacena and at weak coupling (one loop) the
correspondence to light like Wilson loops is used. In both cases, the (multi)
Splitting function corresponds to flattened cusps in the light like polygon,
allowing for a clean disentanglement from the other gluons. We compute it in
some cases and estimate some terms in other cases. We also prove the anomalous
Ward identity of Drummond et al. in the strong coupling regime. Lastly, we
briefly comment on a possible strategy for a proof of collinear factorization
of Wilson loops at higher orders of perturbation theory.
