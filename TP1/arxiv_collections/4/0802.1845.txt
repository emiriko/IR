On the basis of the kinetic equation with selfconsistent relativistic mean
fields acting on baryons and antibaryons, we study dynamical response of the
nucleus to an antiproton implanted in its interior. By solving numerically the
time-dependent Vlasov equation, we show that the compressed state is formed on
a rather short time scale of about 4-10 fm/c. This justifies the assumption,
that the antiproton annihilation may happen in the compressed nuclear
environment. The evolution of the nucleus after antiproton annihilation is
described by the same kinetic equation including collision terms. We show, that
nucleon kinetic energy spectra and the total invariant mass distributions of
produced mesons are quite sensitive observables to the antiproton annihilation
in the compressed nucleus.
