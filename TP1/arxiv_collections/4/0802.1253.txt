A list of forty third-order exactly integrable two-field evolutionary systems
is presented. Differential substitutions connecting various systems from the
list are found. It is proved that all the systems can be obtained from only two
of them. Examples of zero curvature representations with $4 \times 4$ matrices
are presented.
