The convex hull $\psi_{n,n}$ of certain $(n!)^2$ tensors was considered
recently in connection with graph isomorphism. We consider the convex hull
$\psi_n$ of the $n!$ diagonals among these tensors. We show: 1. The polytope
$\psi_n$ is a face of $\psi_{n,n}$. 2. Deciding if a graph $G$ has a subgraph
isomorphic to $H$ reduces to optimization over $\psi_n$. 3. Optimization over
$\psi_n$ reduces to optimization over $\psi_{n,n}$. In particular, this implies
that the subgraph isomorphism problem reduces to optimization over
$\psi_{n,n}$.
