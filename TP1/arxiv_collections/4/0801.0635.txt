We consider a mixture of single-component bosonic and fermionic atoms with an
interspecies interaction that is varied using a Feshbach resonance. By
performing a mean-field analysis of a two-channel model, which describes both
narrow and broad Feshbach resonances, we find an unexpectedly rich phase
diagram at zero temperature: Bose-condensed and non-Bose-condensed phases form
a variety of phase-separated states that are accompanied by both critical and
tricritical points. We discuss the implications of our results for the
experimentally observed collapse of Bose-Fermi mixtures on the attractive side
of the Feshbach resonance, and we make predictions for future experiments on
Bose-Fermi mixtures close to a Feshbach resonance.
