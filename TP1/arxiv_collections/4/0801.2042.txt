We introduce our experiment of research-oriented teaching mainly in Nanjing
University and Tsinghua University, China. The great population and enrollment
in China makes it worth to concern. It lasts 20 years and involves thousands of
students and hundreds of instructors, consultant experts. We tried many
characteristic styles such as integrated teaching and case analysis, open
resources, interactive mode, course paper program, elite solutions and so on.
The research on the contents is also placed on the agenda. Many students joined
research works that lead to PRL, APL, Nature, Science, and Cell papers. To
impart colleagues the essence we offered some examples in every session. We
declare the accomplishment of the experiment through this paper and new project
is programming.
