We prove that a polar orthogonal representation of a real reductive algebraic
group has the same closed orbits as the isotropy representation of a
pseudo-Riemannian symmetric space. We also develop a partial structural theory
of polar orthogonal representations of real reductive algebraic groups which
slightly generalizes some results of the structural theory of real reductive
Lie algebras.
