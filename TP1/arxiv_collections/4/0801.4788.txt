We study the metal-insulator transition in individual self-assembled quantum
wires and report optical evidences of metallic liquid condensation at low
temperatures. Firstly, we observe that the temperature and power dependence of
the single nanowire photoluminescence follow the evolution expected for an
electron-hole liquid in one dimension. Secondly, we find novel spectral
features that suggest that in this situation the expanding liquid condensate
compresses the exciton gas in real space. Finally, we estimate the critical
density and critical temperature of the phase transition diagram at
$n_c\sim1\times10^5$ cm$^{-1}$ and $T_c\sim35$ K, respectively.
