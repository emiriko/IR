We address the problem of inertial property of matter through analysis of the
motion of an extended charged particle. Our approach is based on the continuity
equation for momentum (Newton's second law) taking due account of the vector
potential and its convective derivative. We obtain a development in terms of
retarded potentials allowing an intuitive physical interpretation of its main
terms. The inertial property of matter is then discussed in terms of a kind of
induction law related to the extended charged particle's own vector potential.
Moreover, it is obtained a force term that represents a drag force acting on
the charged particle when in motion relatively to its own vector potential
field lines. The time rate of variation of the particle's vector potential
leads to the acceleration inertia reaction force, equivalent to the Schott term
responsible for the source of the radiation field. We also show that the
velocity dependent term of the particle's vector potential is connected with
the relativistic increase of mass with velocity and generates a longitudinal
stress force that is the source of electric field lines deformation. In the
framework of classical electrodynamics, we have shown that the electron mass
has possibly a complete electromagnetic origin and the obtained covariant
equation solves the "4/3 mass paradox" for a spherical charge distribution.
