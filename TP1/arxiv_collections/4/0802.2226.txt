In this work we have analyzed the adsorption-desorption kinetics in the
framework of the lattice gas model. We have shown that the coefficients
representing the transition probabilities must be carefully chosen even when
they fulfill the principle of detailed balance, otherwise the observables
arising from the kinetics present anomalous behavior. We have demonstrated that
when the adsorption $A_i$ and desorption $D_i$ coefficients are linearly
related through a parameter $\gamma$, there are values of lateral interaction,
$V$, that lead to bad behavior in the kinetics. We have shown a phase diagram
for the allowed values of $V$ and $\gamma$, concluding that detailed balance
does not guarantee a correct physical behavior of the observables obtained from
the rate equations like adsorption isotherms, sticking coefficients and thermal
desorption spectra. Alternatively, we have introduced a description of the
adsorption-desorption processes based in a simple but consistent energetic
argument that leads to a correct behavior of the observables without physical
inconsistencies.
