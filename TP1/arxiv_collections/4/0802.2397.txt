We propose a scheme of spin transistor using a $T$-shaped structure with
local Rashba interaction. A wide antiresonance energy gap appears due to the
interplay of two types of interference, the Fano-Rashba interference and the
structure interference. A large current from the gap area can be obtained via
changing the Rashba strength and/or the length of the sidearm by using gate
voltage. The robustness of the antiresonance gap against strong disorder is
demonstrated and shows the feasibility of this structure for the real
application.
