We propose a model for isotropization and corresponding thermalization in a
nucleon system created in the collision of two nuclei. The model is based on
the assumption: during the fireball evolution, two-particle elastic and
inelastic collisions give rise to the randomization of the nucleon-momentum
transfer which is driven by a proper distribution. As a first approximation, we
assume a homogeneous distribution where the values of the momentum transfer is
bounded from above. These features have been shown to result in a smearing of
the particle momenta about their initial values and, as a consequence, in their
partial isotropization and thermalization. The nonequilibrium single-particle
distribution function and single-particle spectrum which carry a memory about
initial state of nuclei have been obtained.
