The loop-Virasoro algebra is the Lie algebra of the tensor product of the
Virasoro algebra and the Laurent polynomial algebra. This paper classifies
irreducible Harish-Chandra modules over the loop-Virasoro algebra, which turn
out to be highest weight modules, lowest weight modules and evaluation modules
of the intermediate series (all wight spaces are 1-dimensional). As a
by-product, we obtain a classification of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules
over truncated Virasoro algebras.
  We also determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for highest weigh
irreducible modules over the loop-Virasoro algebra to have all finite
dimensional weight spaces, as well as the necessary and sufficient conditions
for highest weigh Verma modules to be irreducible.
