We introduce a self-adjoint operator that indicates the direction of time
within the framework of standard quantum mechanics. That is, as a function of
time its expectation value decreases monotonically for any initial state. This
operator can be defined for any system governed by a Hamiltonian with a
uniformly finitely degenerate, absolutely continuous and semibounded spectrum.
We study some of the operator's properties and illustrate them for a large
equivalence class of scattering problems. We also discuss some previous
attempts to construct such an operator, and show that the no-go theorems
developed in this context are not applicable to our construction.
