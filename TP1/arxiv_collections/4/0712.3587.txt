In this paper, designs and analyses of compressive recognition systems are
discussed, and also a method of establishing a dual connection between designs
of good communication codes and designs of recognition systems is presented.
Pattern recognition systems based on compressed patterns and compressed sensor
measurements can be designed using low-density matrices. We examine truncation
encoding where a subset of the patterns and measurements are stored perfectly
while the rest is discarded. We also examine the use of LDPC parity check
matrices for compressing measurements and patterns. We show how more general
ensembles of good linear codes can be used as the basis for pattern recognition
system design, yielding system design strategies for more general noise models.
