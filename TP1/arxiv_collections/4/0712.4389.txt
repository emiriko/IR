Precision measurement of the stop mass at the ILC is done in a method based
on cross-sections measurements at two different center-of-mass energies. This
allows to minimize both the statistical and systematic errors. In the framework
of the MSSM, a light stop, compatible with electro-weak baryogenesis, is
studied in its decay into a charm jet and neutralino, the Lightest
Supersymmetric Particle(LSP), as a candidate of dark matter. This takes place
for a small stop-neutralino mass difference.
