We study propagation of light in nonlinear diffraction-managed photonic
lattices created with arrays of periodically-curved coupled optical waveguides
which were fabricated using femtosecond laser writing in silica glass, and
titanium indiffusion in LiNbO3 crystals. We identify different regimes of the
nonlinear propagation of light beams depending on the input power, and present
the first experimental observation of diffraction-managed solitons, which are
formed as a result of the interplay between the engineered beam diffraction and
nonlinear self-focusing or defocusing. We observe that in self-collimating
structures where linear diffraction is suppressed, a novel regime of nonlinear
beam diffusion takes place at the intermediate powers before the lattice
soliton is formed at higher powers.
