A circulating current can be induced in the Fermi sea by displacing a
scatterer, or more generally by integrating a quantum pump into a closed
circuit. The induced current may have either the same or the opposite sense
with respect to the "pushing" direction of the pump. We work out explicit
expressions for the associated geometric conductance using the Kubo-Dirac
monopoles picture, and illuminate the connection with the theory of adiabatic
passage in multiple path geometry.
