Extended Huckel theory (EHT) along with NEGF (Non-equilibrium Green's
function formalism) has been used for modeling coherent transport through
molecules. Incorporating dephasing has been proposed to theoretically reproduce
experimental characteristics for such devices. These elastic and inelastic
dephasing effects are expected to be important in quantum devices with the
feature size around 10nm, and hence an efficient and versatile solver is
needed. This model should have flexibility to be applied to a wide range of
nano-scale devices, along with 3D electrostatics, for arbitrary shaped contacts
and surface roughness. We report one such EHT-NEGF solver with dephasing by
self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA). 3D electrostatics is included using
a finite-element scheme. The model is applied to a single wall carbon nanotube
(CNT) cross-bar structure with a C60 molecule as the active channel. Without
dephasing, a negative differential resistance (NDR) peak appears when the C60
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level crosses a van Hove singularity in the
1D density of states of the metallic CNTs acting as contacts. This NDR
diminishes with increasing dephasing in the channel as expected.
