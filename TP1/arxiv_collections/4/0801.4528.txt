Based on the Kotliar-Ruckenstein slave-boson scheme we develop a
configuration-interaction (CI) approach which is suitable to improve the energy
of symmetry-broken saddle-point solutions. The theory is applied to
spin-polaron states in the Hubbard model and compared with analogous results
obtained within the Hartree-Fock approximation. In addition we show that within
the infinite ${\cal D}$ prescription of the Gutzwiller method a CI approach
does not improve the variational result since in the thermodynamic limit matrix
elements between different inhomogeneous states vanish due to an 'orthogonality
catastrophe'.
