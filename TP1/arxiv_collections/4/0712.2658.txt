We study the dynamical low temperature behaviour of the Ising spin glass on
the Bethe lattice. Starting from Glauber dynamics we propose a cavity like
Ansatz that allows for the treatment of the slow (low temperature) part of
dynamics. Assuming a continuous phase transitions and ultrametricity with
respect to long time scales we approach the problem perturbatively near the
critical temperature. The theory is formulated in terms of
correlation-response-functions of arbitrary order. They can, however, be broken
down completely to products of pair functions depending on two time arguments
only. For binary couplings $J=\pm I$ a spin glass solution is found which
approaches the corresponding solution for the SK-model in the limit of high
connectivity. For more general distributions $P(J)$ no stable or marginal
solution of this type appears to exist. The nature of the low temperature phase
in this more general case is unclear.
