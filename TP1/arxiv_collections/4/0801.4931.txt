In this talk I present a simple derivation of an old result of Kochen and
Specker, which is apparently unrelated to the famous work of Bell on hidden
variables, but is presumably equally important. Kochen and Specker showed in
1967 that quantum mechanics cannot be embedded into a classical stochastic
theory, provided the quantum theoretical probability distributions are
reproduced and one additional highly desirable property is satisfied. This
showed in a striking manner what were the difficulties in implementing the
Einstein programme of a `complete' version of quantum mechanics.
