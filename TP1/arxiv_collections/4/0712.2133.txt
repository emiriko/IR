The Div-Curl Lemma, which is the basic result of the compensated compactness
theory in Sobolev spaces, was introduced by F. Murat (1978) with distinct
proofs for the $L^2(\Omega)$ and $L^p(\Omega)$, $p \neq 2$, cases. In this note
we present a slightly different proof, relying only on a Green-Gauss integral
formula and on the usual Rellich-Kondrachov compactness properties.
