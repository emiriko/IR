We study the dynamics of entanglement in the XY spin chain subject to a
staggered magnetic field and contrast it to the previously studied uniform
field case. We find that, depending on parameter values, a staggered field can
provide better conditions for a perfect entanglement transfer, while even a
modest amount of exchange anisotropy appears to have a strong detrimental
effect. We also study interactions between different waves of entanglement and
assess the possibility of simultaneous transmission of multiple bits of quantum
information.
