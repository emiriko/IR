Theory of computer calculations strongly depends on the nature of elements
the computer is made of. Quantum interference allows to formulate the Shor
factorization algorithm turned out to be more effective than any one written
for classical computers. Similarly, quantum wave packet reduction allows to
devise the Grover search algorithm which outperforms any classical one. In the
present paper we argue that the quantum incoherent tunneling can be used for
elaboration of new algorithms able to solve some NP-hard problems, such as the
Traveling Salesman Problem, considered to be intractable in the classical
theory of computer computations.
