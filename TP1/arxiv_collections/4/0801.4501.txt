The steady-state distributions and dynamical behaviour of Zero Range
Processes with hopping rates which are non-monotonic functions of the site
occupation are studied. We consider two classes of non-monotonic hopping rates.
The first results in a condensed phase containing a large (but subextensive)
number of mesocondensates each containing a subextensive number of particles.
The second results in a condensed phase containing a finite number of extensive
condensates. We study the scaling behaviour of the peak in the distribution
function corresponding to the condensates in both cases. In studying the
dynamics of the condensate we identify two timescales: one for creation, the
other for evaporation of condensates at a given site. The scaling behaviour of
these timescales is studied within the Arrhenius law approach and by numerical
simulations.
