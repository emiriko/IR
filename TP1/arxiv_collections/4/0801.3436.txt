Diffusion-induced Ramsey narrowing that appears when atoms can leave the
interaction region and repeatedly return without lost of coherence is
investigated using strong collisions approximation. The effective diffusion
equation is obtained and solved for low-dimensional model configurations and
three-dimensional real one.
