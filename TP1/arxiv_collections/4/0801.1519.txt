We calculate the conductivity of a clean graphene sheet at finite
temperatures starting from the tight-binding model. We obtain a finite value
for the dc-conductivity at zero temperature. For finite temperature, the
spontaneous electron-hole creation, responsible for the finite conductivity at
zero temperature, is washed out and the dc-conductivity yields zero. Our
results are in agreement with calculations based on the field-theoretical model
for graphene.
