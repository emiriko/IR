Second-order correlation functions for photon pulses associated with
exciton-biexciton cascades are theoretically derived. A finite efficiency in
photon detection and statistical distribution in exciton numbers are taken into
account. It is found that the bunching peak height of photon statistics
(g(2)(0)) depends on the mean number of excitons, N, and significant bunching
is only detectable at very low excitation, N<<2.
