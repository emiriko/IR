We compare two fermionic renormalization group methods which have been used
to investigate the electronic transport properties of one-dimensional metals
with two-particle interaction (Luttinger liquids) and local inhomogeneities.
The first one is a poor man's method setup to resum ``leading-log'' divergences
of the effective transmission at the Fermi momentum. Generically the resulting
equations can be solved analytically. The second approach is based on the
functional renormalization group method and leads to a set of differential
equations which can only for certain setups and in limiting cases be solved
analytically, while in general it must be integrated numerically. Both methods
are claimed to be applicable for inhomogeneities of arbitrary strength and to
capture effects of the two-particle interaction, such as interaction dependent
exponents, up to leading order. We critically review this for the simplest case
of a single impurity. While on first glance the poor man's approach seems to
describe the crossover from the ``perfect'' to the ``open chain fixed point''
we collect evidence that difficulties may arise close to the ``perfect chain
fixed point''. Due to a subtle relation between the scaling dimensions of the
two fixed points this becomes apparent only in a detailed analysis. In the
functional renormalization group method the coupling of the different
scattering channels is kept which leads to a better description of the
underlying physics.
