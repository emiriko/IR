The assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy (JFK) traumatized the
nation. In this paper we show that evidence used to rule out a second assassin
is fundamentally flawed. This paper discusses new compositional analyses of
bullets reportedly to have been derived from the same batch as those used in
the assassination. The new analyses show that the bullet fragments involved in
the assassination are not nearly as rare as previously reported. In particular,
the new test results are compared to key bullet composition testimony presented
before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). Matches of bullets
within the same box of bullets are shown to be much more likely than indicated
in the House Select Committee on Assassinations' testimony. Additionally, we
show that one of the ten test bullets is considered a match to one or more
assassination fragments. This finding means that the bullet fragments from the
assassination that match could have come from three or more separate bullets.
Finally, this paper presents a case for reanalyzing the assassination bullet
fragments and conducting the necessary supporting scientific studies. These
analyses will shed light on whether the five bullet fragments constitute three
or more separate bullets. If the assassination fragments are derived from three
or more separate bullets, then a second assassin is likely, as the additional
bullet would not easily be attributable to the main suspect, Mr. Oswald, under
widely accepted shooting scenarios [see Posner (1993), Case Closed, Bantam, New
York].
