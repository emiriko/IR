We report the cooling of an atomic ensemble with light, where each atom
scatters only a single photon on average. This is a general method that does
not require a cycling transition and can be applied to atoms or molecules which
are magnetically trapped. We discuss the application of this new approach to
the cooling of hydrogenic atoms for the purpose of precision spectroscopy and
fundamental tests.
