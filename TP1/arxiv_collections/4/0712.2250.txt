The elementary excitations in antiferromagnets are magnons, quasiparticles
with integer spin and Bose statistics. In an experiment their density is
controlled efficiently by an applied magnetic field and can be made finite to
cause the formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Studies of magnon
condensation in a growing number of magnetic materials provide a unique window
into an exciting world of quantum phase transitions (QPT) and exotic quantum
states.
