Planar ${\cal N} =4$ super Yang-Mills SU(N) theory is expected to exhibit
stringy behavior, anticipated by the 't Hooft genus expansion and the $AdS/CFT$
correspondence. We examine the Bern-Dixon-Smirnov (BDS) conjecture for
$n$-gluon amplitudes in the context of single-Regge and multi-Regge limits and
show that these amplitudes have the expected Regge form in the Euclidean
region.
