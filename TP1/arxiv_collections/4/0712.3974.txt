We present an exact solution around global monopole resulting from the
breaking of a global S0(3) symmetry in a five dimensional space time. We have
shown that the global monopole in higher dimensional space time exerts
gravitational force which is attractive in nature. It is also shown that the
space around global monopole has a deficit solid angle. Finally, we study
monopole in higher dimensional space time within the framework of Lyra
geometry.
