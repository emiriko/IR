We present a new approach to estimate the effect of the gluon shadowing in
nucleus+nucleus collisions and its consequences on the J/psi production yield.
Using kinematical information available from the measured J/psi production in
proton+proton collisions at \sqrt s = 200 GeV, we build a Glauber Monte Carlo
code which takes into account shadowing in two alternative ways: multiple
scattering corrections or Q2 evolution of parton densities. We exploit the
dependence of these different parameterizations to the J/psi transverse
momentum and we give the first predictions on the resulting pT dependence of
the nuclear modification factor in deuteron+gold collisions at the same energy.
