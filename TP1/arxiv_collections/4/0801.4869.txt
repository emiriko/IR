The influence of medium dependent finite width of the QGP bags on their
equation of state is analyzed on a basis of an exactly solvable model with the
general mass-volume spectrum of these bags. It is arguing that the consistent
statistical description of the QGP bags is achieved for the width proportional
to the square root of their volume. The model allows us to estimate the minimal
value of the QGP bags' width from the new lattice QCD data. The large width of
the QGP bags not only explains the observed deficit in the number of hadronic
resonances compared to the Hagedorn mass spectrum, but also clarifies the
reason why the heavy/ large QGP bags cannot be directly observed in experiments
as metastable states in a hadronic phase.
