In this work, we consider a data array encoding interactions between two sets
of observations respectively referred to as "subjects" and "objects". Besides,
descriptions of subjects and objects are available through two variable sets.
We propose a geometrically grounded exploratory technique to analyze the
interactions using descriptions of subjects and objects: interactions are
modelled using a hierarchy of subject-factors and object-factors built up from
these descriptions. Our method bridges the gap between those of Chessel (RLQ
analysis) and Martens (L-PLS), although it only has rank 1 components in common
with them.
