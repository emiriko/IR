The invariant amplitudes for pion electroproduction on the nucleon are
evaluated by dispersion relations at constant t with MAID as input for the
imaginary parts of these amplitudes. In the threshold region these amplitudes
are confronted with the predictions of several low-energy theorems derived in
the soft-pion limit. In general agreement with Chiral Perturbation Theory, the
dispersive approach yields large corrections to these theorems because of the
finite pion mass.
