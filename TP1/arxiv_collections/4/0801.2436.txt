We calculate within a mean-field theory the spectral signatures of various
striped d-wave superconducting phases. We consider both in-phase and anti-phase
modulations of the superconducting order across a stripe boundary, and the
effects of coexisting inhomogeneous orders, including spin stripes, charge
stripes, and modulated d-density-wave. We find that the anti-phase modulated
d-wave superconductor exhibits zero-energy spectral weight, primarily along
extended arcs in momentum space. Concomitantly, a Fermi surface appears and
typically includes both open segments and closed pockets. When weak homogeneous
superconductivity is also present the Fermi surface collapses onto nodal
points. Among them are the nodal points of the homogeneous d-wave
superconductor, but others typically exist at positions which depend on the
details of the modulation and the band structure. Upon increasing the amplitude
of the constant component these additional points move towards the edges of the
reduced Brillouin zone where they eventually disappear. The above signatures
are also manifested in the density of states of the clean, and the disordered
system. While the presence of coexisting orders changes some details of the
spectral function, we find that the evolution of the Fermi-surface and the
distribution of the low-energy spectral weight are largely unaffected by them.
