We have studied the electrically induced off-plane surface displacement on
two microelectronic devices using Scanning Joule Expansion Microscopy (SJEM).
We present the experimental method and surface displacement results. We show
that they can be successfully compared with surface displacement images
obtained using an optical interferometry method. We also present thermal images
using Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) technique to underline that SJEM is
more adapted to higher frequency measurements, which should improve the spatial
resolution.
