Suppose we want to distinguish two quantum pure states. We consider the case
in which no classical knowledge on the two states is given and only a pair of
samples of the two states is available. This problem is called quantum
pure-state identification problem. Our task is to optimize the mean
identification success probability, which is averaged over an independent
unitary invariant distribution of the two reference states. In this paper, the
two states are assumed bipartite states which are generally entangled. The
question is whether the maximum mean identification success probability can be
attained by means of an LOCC (Local Operations and Classical Communication)
measurement scheme. We will show that this is possible by constructing a POVM
which respects the conditions of LOCC.
