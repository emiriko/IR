We discuss the problem of coexistence of genuine quantum multipartite
correlations and classical multipartite correlations. We introduce a postulate
which any measure of genuine multipartite classical correlations should
satisfy. We show that covariance does not satisfy this postulate. Finally we
propose a definition of genuine multipartite correlations and illustrate it
with examples.
