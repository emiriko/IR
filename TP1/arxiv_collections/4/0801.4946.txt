We demonstrate generation of the two-dimensional Chern-Simons-like
Lorentz-breaking action via an appropriate Lorentz-breaking coupling of scalar
and spinor fields at zero as well as at the finite temperature and via the
noncommutative fields method and study the dispersion relations corresponding
to this action.
