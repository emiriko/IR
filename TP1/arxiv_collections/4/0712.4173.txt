This paper proposes an efficient approach of secure clustering in distributed
sensor networks. The clusters or groups in the network are formed based on
offline rank assignment and predistribution of secret keys. Our approach uses
the concept of weakly connected dominating set (WCDS) to reduce the number of
cluster-heads in the network. The formation of clusters in the network is
secured as the secret keys are distributed and used in an efficient way to
resist the inclusion of any hostile entity in the clusters. Along with the
description of our approach, we present an analysis and comparison of our
approach with other schemes. We also mention the limitations of our approach
considering the practical implementation of the sensor networks.
