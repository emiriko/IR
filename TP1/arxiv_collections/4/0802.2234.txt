Current research in author profiling to discover a legal author's fingerprint
does not only follow examinations based on statistical parameters only but
include more and more dynamic methods that can learn and that react adaptable
to the specific behavior of an author. But the question on how to appropriately
represent a text is still one of the fundamental tasks, and the problem of
which attribute should be used to fingerprint the author's style is still not
exactly defined. In this work, we focus on linguistic selection of attributes
to fingerprint the style of the authors Parkin, Bassewitz and Leander. We use
texts of the genre Fairy Tale as it has a clear style and texts of a shorter
size with a straightforward story-line and a simple language.
