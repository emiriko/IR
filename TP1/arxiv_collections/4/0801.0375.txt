We report calculations of the energies of excitons and biexcitons in ideal
two-dimensional bilayer systems within the effective-mass approximation with
isotropic electron and hole masses. The exciton energies are obtained by a
simple numerical integration technique, while the biexciton energies are
obtained from diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations. The exciton binding
energy decays as the inverse of the separation of the layers, while the binding
energy of the biexciton with respect to dissociation into two separate excitons
decays exponentially.
