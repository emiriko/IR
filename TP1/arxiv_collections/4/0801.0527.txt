The properties of hairy black holes in Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) theory are
reviewed, focusing on spherically symmetric solutions. In particular, in
asymptotically anti-de Sitter space (adS) stable black hole hair is known to
exist for su(2) EYM. We review recent work in which it is shown that stable
hair also exists in su(N) EYM for arbitrary N, so that there is no upper limit
on how much stable hair a black hole in adS can possess.
