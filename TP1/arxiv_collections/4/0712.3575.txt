We calculate boundary operator product expansion coefficients for boundary
operators in the first column of the Kac table in conformal field theories. For
c=0 we give closed form expressions for all such coefficients. Then we
generalize to the augmented minimal models, giving explicit expressions for
coefficients valid when \phi_{1,2} mediates a change from fixed to free
boundary conditions. These quantities are determined by computing an arbitrary
four-point correlation function of first column operators. Our calculation
first determines the appropriate (non-logarithmic) conformal blocks by using
standard null-vector methods. The behavior of these blocks under crossing
symmetry then provides a general closed form expression for the desired
coefficients, as a product of ratios of gamma functions. This calculation was
inspired by the need for several of these coefficients in certain correlation
function formulas for critical two-dimensional percolation and the augmented
q=2 and q=3 state critical Potts models.
