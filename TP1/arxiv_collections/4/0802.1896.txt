Let A be a finite set and X a sequence of A-valued random variables. We do
not assume any particular correlation structure between these random variables;
in particular, X may be a non-Markovian sequence. An adapted embedding of X is
a sequence of the form R(X_1), R(X_1,X_2), R(X_1,X_2,X_3), etc where R is a
transformation defined over finite length sequences. In this extended abstract
we characterize a wide class of adapted embeddings of X that result in a
first-order homogeneous Markov chain. We show that any transformation R has a
unique coarsest refinement R' in this class such that R'(X_1), R'(X_1,X_2),
R'(X_1,X_2,X_3), etc is Markovian. (By refinement we mean that R'(u)=R'(v)
implies R(u)=R(v), and by coarsest refinement we mean that R' is a
deterministic function of any other refinement of R in our class of
transformations.) We propose a specific embedding that we denote as R^X which
is particularly amenable for analyzing the occurrence of patterns described by
regular expressions in X. A toy example of a non-Markovian sequence of 0's and
1's is analyzed thoroughly: discrete asymptotic distributions are established
for the number of occurrences of a certain regular pattern in X_1,...,X_n, as n
tends to infinity, whereas a Gaussian asymptotic distribution is shown to apply
for another regular pattern.
