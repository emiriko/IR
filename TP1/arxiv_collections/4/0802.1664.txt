We report a series of magnetic and transport measurements on high-quality
single crystal samples of colossal magnetoresistive manganites, La_{0.7}
Ca_{0.3} Mn O_3 and Pr_{0.7} Sr_{0.3} Mn O_3. 1 % Fe doping allows a Moessbauer
spectroscopy study, which shows (i) unusual line broadening within the
ferromagnetic phase and (ii) a coexistence of ferro- and paramagnetic
contributions in a region, T_1<T<T_2, around the Curie point T_C. In the case
of Pr_{0.7} Sr_{0.3} Mn O_3, the resistivity peak occurs at a considerably
higher temperature, T_{MI}>T_2. This shows that phase separation into metallic
(ferromagnetic) and insulating (paramagnetic) phases cannot be generally
responsible for the resistivity peak (and hence for the associated colossal
magnetoresistance). Our results can be understood phenomenologically within the
two-fluid approach, which also allows for a difference between T_C and T_{MI}.
Our data indeed imply that while magnetic and transport properties of the
manganites are closely interrelated, the two transitions at T_C and T_{MI} can
be viewed as distinct phenomena.
