We report on the calculation of the ground-state atomic kinetic energy,
$E_{k}$, and momentum distribution of solid Ne by means of the diffusion Monte
Carlo method and Aziz HFD-B pair potential. This approach is shown to perform
notably for this crystal since we obtain very good agreement with respect to
experimental thermodynamic data. Additionally, we study the structural
properties of solid Ne at densities near the equilibrium by estimating the
radial pair-distribution function, Lindemann's ratio and atomic density profile
around the positions of the perfect crystalline lattice. Our value for $E_{k}$
at the equilibrium density is $41.51(6)$ K, which agrees perfectly with the
recent prediction made by Timms {\it et al.}, $41(2)$ K, based on their
deep-inelastic neutron scattering experiments carried out over the temperature
range $4 - 20$ K, and also with previous path integral Monte Carlo results
obtained with the Lennard-Jones and Aziz HFD-C2 atomic pairwise interactions.
The one-body density function of solid Ne is calculated accurately and found to
fit perfectly, within statistical uncertainty, to a Gaussian curve.
Furthermore, we analyze the degree of anharmonicity of solid Ne by calculating
some of its microscopic ground-state properties within traditional harmonic
approaches. We provide insightful comparison to solid $^4$He in terms of the
Debye model, in order to size the relevance of anharmonic effects in Ne.
