We study theoretically the quantum transport properties of the Dirac fermions
with spin-orbit interactions (SOIs) in graphene by using the method of
Schwinger proper time together with decomposition over Landau level poles and
Kubo formula. The analytical expressions for both longitudinal and Hall
conductivities are derived explicitly. It is found that, from some numerical
examples, when the Rashba SOI is taken into account the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH)
oscillation peaks of the longitudinal conductivity versus the chemical
potential are split, while the SdH oscillation of the longitudinal conductivity
versus a external magnetic field exhibits a beating pattern. Furthermore, the
Rashba SOI tends to suppress the quantum Hall effect in graphene.
