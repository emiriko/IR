We study the effects of electron-electron interactions on the transport
properties of a junction of three quantum wires enclosing a magnetic flux. The
wires are modeled as single channel spin-1/2 Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids. The
system exhibits a rich phase diagram as a function of the electronic
interaction strength, which includes a chiral fixed point with an asymmetric
current flow highly sensitive to the sign of the flux, and another fixed point
where pair tunneling dominates, similarly to the case of spinless electrons.
While in the case of spinless electrons the perturbations that correspond to
unequal couplings between the three wires are always irrelevant, we find that,
when the electron spin is included, there are small regions in the phase
diagram where a current flows only between two of the wires and the third wire
is decoupled.
