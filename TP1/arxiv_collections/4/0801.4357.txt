We formulate the single transverse spin asymmetry in heavy quarkonium
production in lepton-nucleon and nucleon-nucleon collisions in the
non-relativistic limit. We find that the asymmetry is very sensitive to the
production mechanism. The final state interactions with the heavy quark and
antiquark cancel out among themselves when the pair are produced in a
color-single configuration, or cancel out with the initial state interaction in
pp scattering when they are in color-octet. As a consequence, the asymmetry is
nonzero in ep collisions only in the color-octet model, whereas in pp
collisions only in the color-singlet model.
