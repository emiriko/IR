A computational strategy for the evaluation of the crystal lattice constants
and cohesive energy of the weakly bound molecular solids is proposed. The
strategy is based on the high level ab initio coupled-cluster determination of
the pairwise additive contribution to the interaction energy. The
zero-point-energy correction and non-additive contributions to the interaction
energy are treated using density functional methods. The experimental crystal
lattice constants of the solid benzene are reproduced, and the value of 480
meV/molecule is calculated for its cohesive energy.
