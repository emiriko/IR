A data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.1 fb-1 collected
by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider was analyzed to search for
squarks and gluinos produced in ppbar collisions at a center-of-mass energy of
1.96 TeV. No evidence for the production of such particles was observed in
topologies involving jets and missing transverse energy, and 95% C.L. lower
limits of 379 GeV and 308 GeV were set on the squark and gluino masses,
respectively, within the framework of minimal supergravity with tan(beta)=3,
A0=0, and mu<0. The corresponding previous limits are improved by 54 GeV and 67
GeV.
