We study the (spinless) Falicov-Kimball model extended by a finite band width
(hopping $t_f$) of the localized (f-) electrons in infinite dimensions in the
weak-coupling limit of a small local interband Coulomb correlation $U$ for half
filling. In the case of overlapping conduction- and f-bands different kinds of
ordered solutions are possible, namely charge-density wave (CDW) order,
electronic ferroelectricity (EFE) and electronic antiferroelectricity (EAFE).
The order parameters are calculated as a function of the model parameters and
of the temperature. There is a first-order phase transition from the CDW-phase
to the EFE- or EAFE-phase. The total energy is calculated to determine the
thermodynamically stable solution. The quantum phase diagrams are calculated.
