We report on the magnetic and transport studies of hafnium oxide thin films
grown by pulsed-laser deposition on sapphire substrates under different oxygen
pressures, ranging from 10-7 to 10-1 mbar. Some physical properties of these
thin films appear to depend on the oxygen pressure during growth: the film
grown at low oxygen pressure (P ~= 10-7 mbar) has a metallic aspect and is
conducting, with a positive Hall signal, while those grown under higher oxygen
pressures (7 x 10-5 <= P <= 0.4 mbar) are insulating. However, no intrinsic
ferromagnetic signal could be attributed to the HfO2 films, irrespective of the
oxygen pressure during the deposition.
