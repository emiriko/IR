We propose a type of all-optical switch which consists of two periodically
curved nonlinear optical waveguides placed in parallel. Compared to the
all-optical switch based on the traditional nonlinear directional coupler with
straight waveguides, this all-optical switch has much lower switching threshold
power and sharper switching width.
