We study heat transport in normal/superconducting graphene junctions. We find
that while the thermal conductance displays the usual exponential dependence on
temperature, reflecting the s-wave symmetry of the superconductor, it exhibits
an unusual oscillatory dependence on the potential height or the length of the
barrier region. This oscillatory dependence stems from the emergent low-energy
relativistic nature of fermions in graphene, essentially different from the
result in conventional normal metal/superconductor junctions.
