The understanding of context and context-awareness is very important for the
areas of handheld and ubiquitous computing. Unfortunately, at present, there
has not been a satisfactory definition of these two concepts that would lead to
a more effective communication in humancomputer interaction. As a result, on
the one hand, application designers are not able to choose what context to use
in their applications and on the other, they cannot determine the type of
context-awareness behaviours their applications should exhibit. In this work,
we aim to provide answers to some fundamental questions that could enlighten us
on the definition of context and its functionality.
