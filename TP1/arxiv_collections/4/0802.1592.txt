A novel quantum pattern recognition scheme is presented, which combines the
idea of a classic Hopfield neural network with adiabatic quantum computation.
Both the input and the memorized patterns are represented by means of the
problem Hamiltonian. In contrast to classic neural networks, the algorithm can
return a quantum superposition of multiple recognized patterns. A proof of
principle for the algorithm for two qubits is provided using a liquid state NMR
quantum computer.
