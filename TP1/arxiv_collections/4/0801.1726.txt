By employing the higher (N\TEXTsymbol{>}5) dimensional version of the Wu-Yang
Ansatz we obtain magnetically charged new black hole solutions in the
Einstein-Yang-Mills-Lovelock (EYML) theory with second ($\alpha_{2}$) and third
($\alpha_{3}$)order parameters. These parameters, where $\alpha_{2}$ is also
known as the Gauss-Bonnet parameter, modify the horizons (and the resulting
thermodynamical properties) of the black holes. It is shown also that
asymptotically ($r\to \infty $), these parameters contribute to an effective
cosmological constant -without cosmological constant- so that the solution
behaves de-Sitter (Anti de-Sitter) like.
