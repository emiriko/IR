The statistical mechanics of a non-interacting polymer chain in the limit of
a large number of monomers is considered when the total angular momentum, L, is
fixed. The radius of gyration for a ring polymer in this situation is derived
exactly in closed form by functional integration techniques. Even when L = 0
the radius of gyration differs from that of a random walk by a prefactor of
order unity. The dependence on L is discussed qualitatively and the large L
limit can be understood by physical arguments.
