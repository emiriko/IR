We solve a model of self-avoiding walks which allows for a site to be visited
up to two times by the walk on the Husimi lattice. This model is inspired in
the Domb-Joyce model and was proposed to describe the collapse transition of
polymers with one-site interactions only. We consider the version in which
immediate self-reversals of the walk are forbidden (RF model). The phase
diagram we obtain for the grand-canonical version of the model is similar to
the one found in the solution of the Bethe lattice, with two distinct
polymerized phases, a tricritical point and a critical endpoint.
