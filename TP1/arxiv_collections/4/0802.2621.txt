The pair production of heavy fourth-generation quarks, which are predicted
under the hypothesis of flavor democracy, is studied using tree-level Monte
Carlo generators and fast detector simulation. Two heavy-quark mass values, 500
and 750$\gev$, are considered with the assumption that the fourth family mixes
primarily with the two light families. It is shown that a clear signature will
be observed in the data collected by the ATLAS detector, after the first year
of low-luminosity running at the Large Hadron Collider.
