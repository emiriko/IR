We analyze the effective actions of anomalous models in which a
four-dimensional version of the Green-Schwarz mechanism is invoked for the
cancellation of the anomalies, and we compare it with those models in which
gauge invariance is restored by the presence of a Wess-Zumino term. Some issues
concerning an apparent violation of unitarity of the mechanism, which requires
Dolgov-Zakharov poles, are carefully examined, using a class of amplitudes
studied in the past by Bouchiat-Iliopoulos-Meyer (BIM), and elaborating on
previous studies. In the Wess-Zumino case we determine explicitly the unitarity
bound using a realistic model of intersecting branes (the Madrid model) by
studying the corresponding BIM amplitudes. This is shown to depend
significantly on the St\"uckelberg mass and on the coupling of the extra
anomalous gauge bosons and allows one to identify Standard-Model-like regions
(which are anomaly-free) from regions where the growth of certain amplitudes is
dominated by the anomaly, separated by an inflection point which could be
studied at the LHC. The bound can even be around 5-10 TeV's for a $Z'$ mass
around 1 TeV and varies sensitively with the anomalous coupling. The results
for the WZ case are quite general and apply to all the models in which an
axion-like interaction is introduced as a generalization of the Peccei-Quinn
mechanism, with a gauged axion.
