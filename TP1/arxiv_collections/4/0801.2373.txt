The concept of the electron localization function (ELF) is extended to
two-dimensional (2D) electron systems. We show that the topological properties
of the ELF in 2D are considerably simpler than in molecules studied previously.
We compute the ELF and demonstrate its usefulness for various physical 2D
systems, focusing on semiconductor quantum dots that effectively correspond to
a confined 2D electron gas. The ELF visualizes the shell structure of harmonic
quantum dots and provides insight into electron bonding in quantum-dot
molecules. In external magnetic fields the ELF is found to be a useful measure
of vorticity when analyzing the properties of quantum-Hall droplets. We show
that the current-dependent term in the ELF expression is important in magnetic
fields.
