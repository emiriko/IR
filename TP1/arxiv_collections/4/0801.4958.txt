We review the current status of Finsler-Lagrange geometry and
generalizations. The goal is to aid non-experts on Finsler spaces, but
physicists and geometers skilled in general relativity and particle theories,
to understand the crucial importance of such geometric methods for applications
in modern physics. We also would like to orient mathematicians working in
generalized Finsler and Kahler geometry and geometric mechanics how they could
perform their results in order to be accepted by the community of ''orthodox''
physicists.
  Although the bulk of former models of Finsler-Lagrange spaces where
elaborated on tangent bundles, the surprising result advocated in our works is
that such locally anisotropic structures can be modelled equivalently on
Riemann-Cartan spaces, even as exact solutions in Einstein and/or string
gravity, if nonholonomic distributions and moving frames of references are
introduced into consideration.
  We also propose a canonical scheme when geometrical objects on a (pseudo)
Riemannian space are nonholonomically deformed into generalized Lagrange, or
Finsler, configurations on the same manifold. Such canonical transforms are
defined by the coefficients of a prime metric and generate target spaces as
Lagrange structures, their models of almost Hermitian/ Kahler, or nonholonomic
Riemann spaces.
  Finally, we consider some classes of exact solutions in string and Einstein
gravity modelling Lagrange-Finsler structures with solitonic pp-waves and
speculate on their physical meaning.
