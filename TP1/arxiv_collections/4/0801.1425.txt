Using the extrapolation of existing data estimations of prompt photon
production at FAIR energies have been made. At $y=y_{c.m.}$ the rapidity
density of prompt photons with $p_{t}>$ 1.5 GeV/c per central Au+Au event at 25
AGeV is estimated as $\sim 10^{-4}$ . With the planed beam intensity $10^{9}$
per second and 1% interaction probability, for 10% of most central events one
can expect the prompt photon rate $\sim 10^{2}$ photons per second.
  Direct photons from the hadron scenario of ion collisions generated by the
Hadron-String-Dynamics (HSD) transport approach with implemented meson
scatterings $\pi\rho\to\pi\gamma, \pi\pi\to\rho\gamma$ have been analyzed.
Photons from short-living resonances (e.g. $\omega \to \pi^{0} \gamma$)
decaying during the dense phase of the collision should be considered as direct
photons. They contribute significantly in the direct photon spectrum at
$p_{t}=0.5 - 1$ GeV/c. At the FAIR energy 25 AGeV in Au+Au central collisions
the HSD generator predicts, as a lower estimate,
$\gamma_{direct}/\gamma_{\pi^{0}} \simeq$ 0.5% in the region $p_{t}=0.5 - 1$
GeV/c. At $p_{t}=1.5 - 2$ GeV/c $\gamma_{prompt}/\gamma_{\pi^{0}} \simeq$ 2%.
  Thermal direct photons have been evaluated with the Bjorken Hydro-Dynamics
(BHD) model. The BHD spectra differ strongly from the HSD predictions. The
direct photon spectrum is very sensitive to the initial temperature parameter
$T_{0}$ of the model. The 10 MeV increase in the $T_{0}$ value leads to $\sim$
2 times higher photon yield.
