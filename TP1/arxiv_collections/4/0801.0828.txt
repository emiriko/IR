Quantum mechanics is usually presented starting from a series of postulates
about the mathematical framework. In this work we show that those same
postulates can be derived by assuming that measurements are discrete
interactions: that is, that we measure at specific moments in time (as opposed
to a continuous measurement that spans a long time interval) and that the
system is in general affected by our measurement. We believe that this way of
presenting quantum mechanics would make it easier to understand by laying out a
more cohesive view of the theory and making it resonate more with our physics
intuition.
