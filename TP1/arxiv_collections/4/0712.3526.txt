Using the light-cone gauge approach to relativistic field dynamics, we study
arbitrary spin fermionic and bosonic fields propagating in flat space of
dimension greater than or equal to four. Generating functions of parity
invariant cubic interaction vertices for totally symmetric and mixed-symmetry
massive and massless fields are obtained. For the case of totally symmetric
fields, we derive restrictions on the allowed values of spins and the number of
derivatives. These restrictions provide a complete classification of parity
invariant cubic interaction vertices for totally symmetric fermionic and
bosonic fields. As an example of application of the light-cone formalism, we
obtain simple expressions for the Yang-Mills and gravitational interactions of
massive arbitrary spin fermionic fields. For some particular cases, using our
light-cone cubic vertices, we discuss the corresponding manifestly Lorentz
invariant and on-shell gauge invariant cubic vertices.
