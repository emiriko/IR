The Kamioka-Korea two detector system is a powerful experimental setup for
resolving neutrino parameter degeneracies and probing CP violation in neutrino
oscillation. In this paper, we study sensitivities of this same setup to
several nonstandard neutrino physics such as quantum decoherence, tiny
violation of Lorentz symmetry, and nonstandard interactions of neutrinos with
matter. In most cases, the Kamioka-Korea two-detector setup is more sensitive
than the one-detector setup, except for the Lorentz symmetry violation with CPT
violation, and the nonstandard neutrino interactions with matter. It can
achieve significant improvement on the current bounds on nonstandard neutrino
physics.
