We review a recent asymptotic weak noise approach to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang
equation for the kinetic growth of an interface in higher dimensions. The weak
noise approach provides a many body picture of a growing interface in terms of
a network of localized growth modes. Scaling in 1d is associated with a gapless
domain wall mode. The method also provides an independent argument for the
existence of an upper critical dimension.
