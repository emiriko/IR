For partial wetting, motion of the triple liquid-gas-solid contact line is
influenced by heterogeneities of the solid surface. This influence can be
strong in the case of inertial (e.g. oscillation) flows where the line can be
pinned or move intermittently. A model that takes into account both surface
defects and fluid inertia is proposed. The viscous dissipation in the bulk of
the fluid is assumed to be negligible as compared to the dissipation in the
vicinity of the contact line. The equations of motion and the boundary
condition at the contact line are derived from Hamilton's principle. The rapid
capillary rise along a vertical inhomogeneous wall is treated as an example.
