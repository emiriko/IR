The thermodynamics of a first-order chiral phase transition is considered in
the presence of spinodal phase separation using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in
the mean field approximation. We focus on the behavior of conserved charge
fluctuations. We show that in non-equilibrium the specific heat and charge
susceptibilities diverge as the system crosses the isothermal spinodal lines.
