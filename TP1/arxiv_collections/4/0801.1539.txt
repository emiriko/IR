We present a detailed calculation of next-to-leading order QCD corrections to
the $tW$ associated production using the one cutoff phase space slicing method.
Such QCD corrections have been calculated independently by two groups already,
however, a number of differences were found. It is desirable to have a third
party calculation to make a crossing check. In this note, we present our
complete results of the virtual corrections which are not shown in the
literature so far. The numerical comparison will be presented in the
forthcoming paper. As a demonstration of the one cutoff phase space slicing
method, we also show in details how to organize the color ordered amplitudes
and how to slice the soft and collinear phase space regions.
