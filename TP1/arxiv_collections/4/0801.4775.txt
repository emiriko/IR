The traditional approach to spreadsheet auditing generally consists of
auditing every distinct formula within a spreadsheet. Although tools are
developed to support auditors during this process, the approach is still very
time consuming and therefore relatively expensive. As an alternative to the
traditional "control through" approach, this paper discusses a "control around"
approach. Within the proposed approach not all distinct formulas are audited
separately, but the relationship between input data and output data of a
spreadsheet is audited through comparison with a shadow model developed in a
modelling language. Differences between the two models then imply possible
errors in the spreadsheet. This paper describes relevant issues regarding the
"control around" approach and the circumstances in which this approach is
preferred above a traditional spreadsheet audit approach.
