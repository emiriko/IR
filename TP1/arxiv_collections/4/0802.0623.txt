The Hawking-Moss tunneling rate for a field described by the
Dirac-Born-Infeld action is calculated using a stochastic approach. We find
that the effect of the non-trivial kinetic term is to enhance the tunneling
rate, which can be exponentially significant. This result should be compared to
the DBI enhancement found in the Coleman-de Luccia case.
