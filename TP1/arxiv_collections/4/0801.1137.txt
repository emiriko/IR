The structural and magnetic anomaly of the layered compound SrFeO$_{2}$ were
examined by first principles density functional calculations and Monte Carlo
simulations. The down-spin Fe 3$d$ electron occupies the $d_{z^2}$ level rather
than the degenerate ($d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$) levels, which explains the absence of
Jahn-Teller instability, the easy ab-plane magnetic anisotropy and the observed
three-dimensional (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) antiferromagnetic order. Monte Carlo
simulations show that the strong inter-layer spin exchange is essential for the
high N\'eel temperature.
