We report all-electron and pseudopotential calculations of the
ground-stateenergies of the neutral Ne atom and the Ne+ ion using the
variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) methods. We investigate
different levels of Slater-Jastrow trial wave function: (i) using Hartree-Fock
orbitals, (ii) using orbitals optimized within a Monte Carlo procedure in the
presence of a Jastrow factor, and (iii) including backflow correlations in the
wave function. Small reductions in the total energy are obtained by optimizing
the orbitals, while more significant reductions are obtained by incorporating
backflow correlations. We study the finite-time-step and fixed-node biases in
the DMC energy and show that there is a strong tendency for these errors to
cancel when the first ionization potential (IP) is calculated. DMC gives highly
accurate values for the IP of Ne at all the levels of trial wave function that
we have considered.
