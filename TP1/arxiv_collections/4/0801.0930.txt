We study the suppression of nonlinear interactions in resonant macroscopic
quantum devices in the case of the solid-state ring laser gyroscope. These
nonlinear interactions are tuned by vibrating the gain medium along the cavity
axis. Beat note occurrence under rotation provides a precise measurement of the
strength of nonlinear interactions, which turn out to vanish for some discrete
values of the amplitude of vibration. Our theoretical description, in very good
agreement with the measured data, suggests the use of a higher vibration
frequency to achieve quasi-ideal rotation sensing over a broad range of
rotation speeds. We finally underline the analogy between this device and some
other macroscopic quantum rotation sensors, such as ring-shaped superfluid
configurations, where nonlinear interactions could be tuned for example by the
use of magnetically-induced Feschbach resonance.
