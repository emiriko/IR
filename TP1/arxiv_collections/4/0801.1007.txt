Thermal qualification of the die attach of semiconductor devices is a very
important element in the device characterization as the temperature of the chip
is strongly affected by the quality of the die attach. Voids or delaminations
in this layer may cause higher temperature elevation and thus damage or shorter
lifetime. Thermal test of each device in the manufacturing process would be the
best solution for eliminating the devices with wrong die attach layer. In this
paper we will present the short time thermal transient measurement method and
the structure function evaluation through simulations and measurements for die
attach characterization. We will also present a method for eliminating the very
time consuming calibration process. Using the proposed methods even the in-line
testing of LEDs can be accomplished.
