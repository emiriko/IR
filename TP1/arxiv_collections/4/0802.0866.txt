We review new constraints on the Yukawa-type corrections to Newtonian gravity
obtained recently from gravitational experiments and from the measurements of
the Casimir force. Special attention is paid to the constraints following from
the most precise dynamic determination of the Casimir pressure between the two
parallel plates by means of a micromechanical torsional oscillator. The
possibility of setting limits on the predictions of chameleon field theories
using the results of gravitational experiments and Casimir force measurements
is discussed.
