Within the framework of generalized Papapetrou method, we derive the
effective equations of motion for a string with two particles attached to its
ends, along with appropriate boundary conditions. The equations of motion are
the usual Nambu-Goto-like equations, while boundary conditions turn out to be
equations of motion for the particles at the string ends. Various properties of
those equations are discussed, and a simple example is treated in detail,
exhibiting the properties of Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions and
giving a small correction term to the law of Regge trajectories due to the
nonzero particle mass.
