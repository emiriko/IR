The thermal conductivity of nanoparticles colloidal suspensions, submitted to
the action of an external force field has been calculated by non equilibrium
molecular dynamics simulations. For driven forces in the radio frequency and
microwave ranges, we show that the thermal conductivity of nanofluids can be
strongly enhanced without cluster formation.
