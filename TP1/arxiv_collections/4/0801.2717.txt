We have studied the effects of momentum dependent interactions on the
single-particle properties of hot asymmetric nuclear matter. In particular, the
single-particle potential of protons and neutrons as well as the symmetry
potential have been studied within a self-consistent model using a momentum
dependent effective interaction. In addition, the isospin splitting of the
effective mass has been derived from the above model. In each case temperature
effects have been included and analyzed. The role of the specific
parametrization of the effective interaction used in the present work has been
investigated. It has been concluded that the behavior of the symmetry potential
depends strongly on the parametrization of the interaction part of the energy
density and the momentum dependence of the regulator function. The effects of
the parametrization have been found to be less pronounced on the isospin mass
splitting.
