We present a summary of recent photoproduction results in ultra peripheral
relativistic heavy ions collisions with STAR. These collisions have impact
parameters larger then twice the nuclear radius; the nuclei do not physically
collide, but interact via long-range electromagnetic fields. We observe
exclusive $\rho^0$ production as well as $AuAu\to Au^*Au^* \rho^0$ with
accompanying mutual nuclear excitation at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. We report
the $\rho^0$ production cross section for both coherent and incoherent coupling
accompanied by mutual nuclear excitation. We have studied the cross section as
a function of $p_T$, $y_{\rho^0}$ and $M_{\pi\pi}$ and compared it to
theoretical models. In addition, we measured the $\rho^0$ helicity matrix
elements. They are found to be consistent with s-channel helicity conservation.
The ratio of coherent $\rho^0$ and direct $\pi^+\pi^-$ pair photoproduction has
been measured and found to be consistent with earlier measurements. The 4-pion
final state $AuAu \to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ state has also been observed.
