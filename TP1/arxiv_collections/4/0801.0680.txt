The branching fractions of D_s meson decays serve to normalize many
measurements of processes involving charm quarks. Using 298 /pb of e+ e-
collisions recorded at a center of mass energy of 4.17 GeV, we determine
absolute branching fractions for eight D_s decays with a double tag technique.
In particular we determine the branching fraction B(D_s -> K- K+ pi+) = (5.50
+- 0.23 +- 0.16)%, where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic
respectively. We also provide partial branching fractions for kinematic subsets
of the K- K+ pi+ decay mode.
