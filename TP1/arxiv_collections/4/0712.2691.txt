The new polarization program SPASCHARM is being prepared in Protvino. The
program has two stages. The first stage is dedicated to single-spin asymmetries
in the production of miscellaneous light resonances with the use of 34 GeV
$\pi^-$-beam. Inclusive and exclusive reactions will be studied simultaneously.
The second stage is dedicated to single-spin and double-spin asymmetries in
charmonium production with the use of 70 GeV polarized proton beam which will
allow us to understand charmonium hadronic production mechanism and make gluon
polarization $\Delta g(x)$ extraction at large $x$.
