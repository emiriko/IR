We report a theoretical study of the axial Nucleon to Delta(1232)
($N\to\Delta$) transition form factors up to one-loop order in relativistic
baryon chiral perturbation theory. We adopt a formalism in which the $\Delta$
couplings obey the spin-3/2 gauge symmetry and, therefore, decouple the
unphysical spin-1/2 fields. We compare the results with phenomenological form
factors obtained from neutrino bubble chamber data and in quark models.
