Recently, an image encryption scheme based on a compound chaotic sequence was
proposed. In this paper, the security of the scheme is studied and the
following problems are found: (1) a differential chosen-plaintext attack can
break the scheme with only three chosen plain-images; (2) there is a number of
weak keys and some equivalent keys for encryption; (3) the scheme is not
sensitive to the changes of plain-images; and (4) the compound chaotic sequence
does not work as a good random number resource.
