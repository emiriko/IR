In this article, we clarify the link between the conformal (i.e. Weyl)
correspondence from the Minkowski space to the de Sitter space and the
conformal (i.e. SO(2,$d$)) invariance of the conformal scalar field on both
spaces. We exhibit the realization on de Sitter space of the massless scalar
representation of SO$(2,d)$. It is obtained from the corresponding
representation in Minkowski space through an intertwining operator inherited
from the Weyl relation between the two spaces. The de Sitter representation is
written in a form which allows one to take the point of view of a Minkowskian
observer who sees the effect of curvature through additional terms.
