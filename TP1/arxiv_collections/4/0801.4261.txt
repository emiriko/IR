Recent rsearches have shown that the lengths of the chemical bonds, whether
completely or partially covalent or ionic, are sums of the radii of the
adjacent atoms and/or ions. On investigating the bond length data for the
molecular components of nucleic acids, all were found (for the first time) to
be effectively the sums of the covalent radii of the adjacent atoms. This work
shows that the bond lengths in caffeine and related molecules are likewise sums
of the covalent radii of C, N, O and H. This has enabled arriving at the atomic
structures of these molecules, also for the first time.
