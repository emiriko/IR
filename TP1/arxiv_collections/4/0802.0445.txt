A connection-like objects, termed {\em hom-connections} are defined in the
realm of non-commutative geometry. The definition is based on the use of
homomorphisms rather than tensor products. It is shown that hom-connections
arise naturally from (strong) connections in non-commutative principal bundles.
The induction procedure of hom-connections via a map of differential graded
algebras or a differentiable bimodule is described. The curvature for a
hom-connection is defined, and it is shown that flat hom-connections give rise
to a chain complex.
