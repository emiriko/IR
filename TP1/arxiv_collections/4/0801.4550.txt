A generalized optical potential for elastic scattering induced by light
nuclei is calculated within the Feshbach projection operator method. The model
explicitly takes into account the contribution of the projectile break-up
continuum treated within a microscopic few-cluster model. In this work we
formulate the model, deriving an explicit expression for the optical potential,
and show ability of the model applying it to deuteron elastic scattering.
