We have developed prototypes of GEM-like detectors with resistive electrodes
to be used as RICH photodetectors equipped with CsI photocathodes. The main
advantages of these detectors are their intrinsic spark protection and
possibility to operate at high gain (~10E5) in many gases including poorly
quenched ones, allowing for the adoption of windowless configurations in which
the radiator gas is also used in the chamber. Results of systematic studies of
the resistive GEMs combined with CsI photocathodes are presented: its quantum
efficiency, rate characteristics, long-term stability, etc. On the basis of the
obtained results, we believe that the new detector will be a promising
candidate for upgrading the ALICE RICH detector
