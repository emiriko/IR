The torsion is shown to be vitally important in the explanation of the
evolution of the universe in a large class of gravitational theories containing
quadratic terms of curvature and torsion. The cosmological solutions with
homogeneous and isotropic torsion in a model of de Sitter gauge theory of
gravity are presented, which may explain the observation data for SN Ia when
parameters are suitably chosen and supply a natural transit from decelerating
expansion to accelerating expansion without the help of the introduction of
other strange fields in the theory.
