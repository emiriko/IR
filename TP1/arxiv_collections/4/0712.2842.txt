The refraction is theoretically considered of ultimately short pulses at
interface of two dielectrics that contains a thin film of nonlinear
metamaterial. For the model of metamaterial composed of nanoparticles and
magnetic nanocircuits (split-ring resonators) the equations are obtained
suitable for describing the coherent responses of such film. The numerical
simulation demonstrates the emergence of oscillatory echo in inhomogeneous
system of meta-atoms. It is supposed that the reported methods are applicable
for investigation of thin metamaterial films.
