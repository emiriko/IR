The local multiphoton absorption rate for an arbitrary quantum state of
monochromatic light, taking into account the photon number, momentum, and
polarization degrees of freedom, is shown to have an upper bound that can be
reached by coherent fields. This surprising result rules out any quantum
enhancement of the multiphoton absorption rate by momentum entanglement.
