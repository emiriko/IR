The diffusion of electronic wave packets in one-dimensional systems with
on-site, binary disorder is numerically investigated within the framework of a
single-band tight-binding model. Fractal properties are incorporated by
assuming that the distribution of distances $\ell$ between consecutive
impurities obeys a power law, $P(\ell) \sim \ell^{-\alpha}$. For suitable
ranges of $\alpha$, one finds system-wide anomalous diffusion. Asymmetric
diffusion effects are introduced through the application of an external
electric field, leading to results similar to those observed in the case of
photogenerated electron-hole plasmas in tilted InP/InGaAs/InP quantum wells.
