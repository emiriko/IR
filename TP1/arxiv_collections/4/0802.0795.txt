This is the second of two papers devoted to tight-binding electronic spectra
on graphs with the topology of the sphere. We investigate the problem of an
electron subject to a spin-orbit interaction generated by the radial electric
field of a static point charge sitting at the center of the sphere. The
tight-binding Hamiltonian considered is a discretization on polyhedral graphs
of the familiar form ${\bm L}\cdot{\bm S}$ of the spin-orbit Hamiltonian. It
involves SU(2) hopping matrices of the form $\exp({\rm i}\mu{\bm
n}\cdot{\bm\sigma})$ living on the oriented links of the graph. For a given
structure, the dimensionless coupling constant $\mu$ is the only parameter of
the model. An analysis of the energy spectrum is carried out for the five
Platonic solids (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron)
and the C$_{60}$ fullerene. Except for the latter, the $\mu$-dependence of all
the energy levels is obtained analytically in closed form. Rather unexpectedly,
the spectra are symmetric under the exchange $\mu\leftrightarrow\Theta-\mu$,
where $\Theta$ is the common arc length of the links. For the symmetric point
$\mu=\Theta/2$, the problem can be exactly mapped onto a tight-binding model in
the presence of the magnetic field generated by a Dirac monopole, studied
recently. The dependence of the total energy at half filling on $\mu$ is
investigated in all examples.
