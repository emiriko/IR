We show that a new type of photon detector, sensitive to the gradients of
electromagnetic fields, should be a useful tool to characterize the quantum
properties of spatially-dependent optical fields. As a simple detector of such
a kind, we propose using magnetic dipole or electric quadrupole transitions in
atoms or molecules and apply it to the detection of spiral photons in
Laguerre-Gauss (LG) beams. We show that LG beams are not true hollow beams, due
to the presence of magnetic fields and gradients of electric fields on beam
axis. This approach paves the way to an analysis at the quantum level of the
spatial structure and angular momentum properties of singular light beams.
