In this paper, the authors compare the security bounds for different quantum
communication protocols with the numerically evaluated losses in the
transmission channel, due to the interaction between the atmosphere and the
photon, which is the information carrier. The analysis is carried out using a
free-source library, which can solve the radiative transfer equation for a
parallel-plane atmosphere.
