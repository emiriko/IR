The G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily is currently the largest
class of therapeutic targets. \textit{In silico} prediction of interactions
between GPCRs and small molecules is therefore a crucial step in the drug
discovery process, which remains a daunting task due to the difficulty to
characterize the 3D structure of most GPCRs, and to the limited amount of known
ligands for some members of the superfamily. Chemogenomics, which attempts to
characterize interactions between all members of a target class and all small
molecules simultaneously, has recently been proposed as an interesting
alternative to traditional docking or ligand-based virtual screening
strategies. We propose new methods for in silico chemogenomics and validate
them on the virtual screening of GPCRs. The methods represent an extension of a
recently proposed machine learning strategy, based on support vector machines
(SVM), which provides a flexible framework to incorporate various information
sources on the biological space of targets and on the chemical space of small
molecules. We investigate the use of 2D and 3D descriptors for small molecules,
and test a variety of descriptors for GPCRs. We show fo instance that
incorporating information about the known hierarchical classification of the
target family and about key residues in their inferred binding pockets
significantly improves the prediction accuracy of our model. In particular we
are able to predict ligands of orphan GPCRs with an estimated accuracy of
78.1%.
