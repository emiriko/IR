We report PHENIX measurements of the correlation of a trigger hadron at
intermediate transverse momentum (2.5<p_{T,trig}<4 GeV/c), with associated
mesons or baryons at lower p_{T,assoc}, in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200
GeV. The jet correlations for both baryons and mesons show similar shape
alterations as a function of centrality, characteristic of strong modification
of the away-side jet. The ratio of jet-associated baryons to mesons for this
jet increases with centrality and p_{T,assoc} and, in the most central
collisions, reaches a value similar to that for inclusive measurements. This
trend is incompatible with in-vacuum fragmentation, but could be due to
jet-like contributions from correlated soft partons which recombine upon
hadronization.
