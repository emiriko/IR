In this paper, we report on different phenomena related to the magnetic
properties of artificially prepared highly ordered (periodic) two-dimensional
Josephson junction arrays (2D-JJA) of both shunted and unshunted Nb-AlOx-Nb
tunnel junctions. By employing mutual-inductance measurements and using a
high-sensitive bridge, we have thoroughly investigated (both experimentally and
theoretically) the temperature and magnetic field dependence of complex AC
susceptibility of 2D-JJA. We also demonstrate the use of the scanning SQUID
microscope for imaging the local flux distribution within our unshunted arrays.
