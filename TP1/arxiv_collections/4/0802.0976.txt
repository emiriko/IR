We show that Anderson localization in quasi-one dimensional conductors with
ballistic electron dynamics, such as an array of ballistic chaotic cavities
connected via ballistic contacts, can be understood in terms of classical
electron trajectories only. At large length scales, an exponential
proliferation of trajectories of nearly identical classical action generates an
abundance of interference terms, which eventually leads to a suppression of
transport coefficients. We quantitatively describe this mechanism in two
different ways: the explicit description of transition probabilities in terms
of interfering trajectories, and an hierarchical integration over fluctuations
in the classical phase space of the array cavities.
