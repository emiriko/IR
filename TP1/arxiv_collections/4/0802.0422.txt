We study adiabatic pumping of electrons through quantum dots attached to
ferromagnetic leads. Hereby we make use of a real-time diagrammatic technique
in the adiabatic limit that takes into account strong Coulomb interaction in
the dot. We analyze the degree of spin polarization of electrons pumped from a
ferromagnet through the dot to a nonmagnetic lead (N-dot-F) as well as the
dependence of the pumped charge on the relative leads' magnetization
orientations for a spin-valve (F-dot-F) structure. For the former case, we find
that, depending on the relative coupling strength to the leads, spin and charge
can, on average, be pumped in opposite directions. For the latter case, we find
an angular dependence of the pumped charge, that becomes more and more
anharmonic for large spin polarization in the leads.
