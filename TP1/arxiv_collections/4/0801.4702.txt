The standard inflationary version of the origin of the cosmic structure as
the result of the quantum fluctuations during the early universe is less than
fully satisfactory as has been argued in [A. Perez, H. Sahlmann, and D.
Sudarsky, Class. Quantum Grav., 23, 2317, (2006)]. A proposal is made there of
a way to address the shortcomings by invoking a process similar to the collapse
of the quantum mechanical wave function of the various modes of the inflaton
field. This in turn was inspired on the ideas of R. Penrose about the role that
quantum gravity might play in bringing about such breakdown of the standard
unitary evolution of quantum mechanics. In this paper we study in some detail
the two schemes of collapse considered in the original work together with an
alternative scheme, which can be considered as "more natural" than the former
two. The new scheme, assumes that the collapse follows the correlations
indicated in the Wigner functional of the initial state. We end with
considerations regarding the degree to which the various schemes can be
expected to produce a spectrum that resembles the observed one.
