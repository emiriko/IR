As the heaviest known fundamental particle, the top quark has taken a central
role in the study of fundamental interactions. Production of top quarks in
pairs provides an important probe of strong interactions. The top quark mass is
a key fundamental parameter which places a valuable constraint on the Higgs
boson mass and electroweak symmetry breaking. Observations of the relative
rates and kinematics of top quark final states constrain potential new physics.
In many cases, the tests available with study of the top quark are both
critical and unique. Large increases in data samples from the Fermilab Tevatron
have been coupled with major improvements in experimental techniques to produce
many new precision measurements of the top quark. The first direct evidence for
electroweak production of top quarks has been obtained, with a resulting direct
determination of $V_{tb}$. Several of the properties of the top quark have been
measured. Progress has also been made in obtaining improved limits on potential
anomalous production and decay mechanisms. This review presents an overview of
recent theoretical and experimental developments in this field. We also provide
a brief discussion of the implications for further efforts.
