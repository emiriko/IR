These lectures, presented at the 2006 TASI summer school, give a general
introduction to supersymmetry, emphasizing its application to models of
elementary particle physics at the 100 GeV energy scale. I discuss the
following topics: the construction of supersymmetric Lagrangians with scalars,
fermions, and gauge bosons, the structure and mass spectrum of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the measurement of the parameters of the
MSSM at high-energy colliders, and the solutions that the MSSM gives to the
problems of electroweak symmetry breaking and dark matter.
