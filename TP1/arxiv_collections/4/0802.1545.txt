We describe the complete set of pairwise non-isomorphic irreducible modules
S(a) over the algebra R given by the defining relation xy-yx=yy, and the rule
how they could be glued to indecomposables. Namely, we show that
Ext_k^1(S(a),S(b))=0, if a not equal to b. Also the set of all representations
is described subject to the Jordan normal form of Y.
  We study then properties of the image algebras in the endomorphism ring.
Among facts we prove is that they are all basic algebras. Along this line we
establish an analogue of the Gerstenhaber-Taussky-Motzkin theorem on the
dimension of algebras generated by two commuting matrices. All image algebras
of indecomposable modules turned out to be local complete algebras. We compare
them with the Ringel's classification by means of finding relations of image
algebras. As a result we derive that all image algebras of n-dimensional
representations with full block Y are tame for n smaller or equal then 4 and
wild for n starting from 5.
  We suggest a stratification of representation space of R related to the
partitions of n defined by the Jordan normal form of Y. We give a complete
classification by parameters for some strata and present examples of tame (up
to automorphisms) strata, while the generic strata is wild.
