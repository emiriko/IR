We investigate the chiral phase transition at finite temperature and chemical
potential within SU(2) and SU(3) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type models. The behavior
of the baryon number susceptibility and the specific heat, in the vicinity of
the critical end point, is studied. The class of the critical points is
analyzed by calculating critical exponents.
