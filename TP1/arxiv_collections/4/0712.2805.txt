We study spin polarization in a split-gate quantum wire focussing on the
effect of a realistic smooth potential due to remote donors. Electron
interaction and spin effects are included within the density functional theory
in the local spin density approximation. We find that depending on the electron
density, the spin polarization exhibits qualitatively different features. For
the case of relatively high electron density, when the Fermi energy $E_{F}$
exceeds a characteristic strength of a long-range impurity potential
$V_{donors}$, the density spin polarization inside the wire is practically
negligible and the wire conductance is spin-degenerate. When the density is
decreased such that $E_{F}$ approaches $V_{donors}$, the electron density and
conductance quickly become spin polarized. With further decrease of the density
the electrons are trapped inside the lakes (droplets) formed by the impurity
potential and the wire conductance approaches the pinch-off regime. We discuss
the limitations of DFT-LSDA in this regime and compare the obtained results
with available experimental data.
