We study the optical emission from single semiconductor quantum dots coupled
to the optical modes of photonic crystal nanocavities. For dots that are both
spectrally and spatially coupled, auto-correlation measurements reveal
efficient single photon generation, with a drastically reduced lifetime due to
the Purcell-effect. However, the multi-photon emission probability is enhanced
compared to the same QD transition when it is detuned from the cavity mode by
controlled $N_2$-deposition. This indicates the presence of an emission
background that is shown to be related to the dot using photon
cross-correlation spectroscopy. Photon temporal correlations persist even for
large spectral detunings beyond $\Delta\lambda\sim-10 nm$, excluding the
intrinsic QD continuum and phonon mediated processes as being responsible for
the cavity mode emission background. We propose a mechanism based on photon
induced shake up processes in the charged quantum dots, enhanced by the optical
cavity.
