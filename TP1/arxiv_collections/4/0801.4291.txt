I calculate the modes of vibration of membranes of arbitrary shape using a
collocation approach based on Little Sinc Functions. The matrix representation
of the PDE obtained using this method is explicit and it does not require the
calculation of integrals. To illustrate the virtues of this approach, I have
considered a large number of examples,part of them taken from the literature,
and part of them new. When possible, I have testedthe accuracy of these results
by comparing them with the exact results (when available) or with results from
the literature. In particular, in the case of the L-shaped membrane, the first
example discussed in the paper, I show that it is possible to extrapolate the
results obtained with different grid sizes to obtain higly precise results.
Finally, I also show that the present collocation technique can be easily
combined with conformal mapping to provide numerical approximations to the
energies which quite rapidly converge to the exact results.
