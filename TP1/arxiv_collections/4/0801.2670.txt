We show, in a completely analytical way, that a tight binding ladder network
composed of atomic sites with on-site potentials distributed according to the
quasiperiodic Aubry model can exhibit a metal-insulator transition at multiple
values of the Fermi energy. For specific values of the first and second
neighbor electron hopping, the result is obtained exactly. With a more general
model, we calculate the two-terminal conductance numerically. The numerical
results corroborate the analytical findings and yield a richer variety of
spectrum showing multiple mobility edges.
