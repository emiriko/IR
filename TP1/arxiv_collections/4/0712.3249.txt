Miniaturized ion trap arrays with many trap segments present a promising
architecture for scalable quantum information processing. The miniaturization
of segmented linear Paul traps allows partitioning the microtrap in different
storage and processing zones. The individual position control of many ions -
each of them carrying qubit information in its long-lived electronic levels -
by the external trap control voltages is important for the implementation of
next generation large-scale quantum algorithms.
  We present a novel scalable microchip multi-segmented ion trap with two
different adjacent zones, one for the storage and another dedicated for the
processing of quantum information using single ions and linear ion crystals: A
pair of radio-frequency driven electrodes and 62 independently controlled DC
electrodes allows shuttling of single ions or linear ion crystals with
numerically designed axial potentials at axial and radial trap frequencies of a
few MHz. We characterize and optimize the microtrap using sideband spectroscopy
on the narrow S1/2 <-> D5/2 qubit transition of the 40Ca+ ion, demonstrate
coherent single qubit Rabi rotations and optical cooling methods. We determine
the heating rate using sideband cooling measurements to the vibrational ground
state which is necessary for subsequent two-qubit quantum logic operations. The
applicability for scalable quantum information processing is proven.
