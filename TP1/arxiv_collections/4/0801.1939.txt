The potential of LHC for investigation of the $W$-$t$-$b$ vertex through the
$tW$ channel of single top quark production is studied. Unlike the other two
single top quark production processes ($t-$channel and $s-$channel), the $tW$
channel provides the possibility to study the $Wtb$ vertex without receiving
contamination from FCNC. This study has been done at parton level but is
involved the separation of signal from backgrounds when both $W$-bosons decay
to leptons. In this study $\mathcal{CP}$ is assumed to be conserved. The 68%
C.L. bounds on the non-Standard Model couplings are estimated.
