We consider the propagation of a matter wavepacket of two-level atoms through
a square potential created by a super-Gaussian laser beam. We explore the
matter wave analog of Goos-H\"{a}nchen shift within the framework of atom
optics where the roles of atom and light is exchanged with respect to
conventional optics. Using a vector theory, where atoms are treated as
particles possessing two internal spin components, we show that not only large
negative but also large positive Goos-H\"{a}nchen shifts can occur in the
reflected atomic beam.
