Quantum toroidal algebras (or double affine quantum algebras) are defined
from quantum affine Kac-Moody algebras by using the Drinfeld quantum
affinization process. They are quantum groups analogs of elliptic Cherednik
algebras (elliptic double affine Hecke algebras) to whom they are related via
Schur-Weyl duality. In this review paper, we give a glimpse on some aspects of
their very rich representation theory in the context of general quantum
affinizations. We illustrate with several examples. We also announce new
results and explain possible further developments, in particular on finite
dimensional representations at roots of unity.
