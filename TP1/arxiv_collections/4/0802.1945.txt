We show that if a differential equations $\mathscr{F}$ over a quasi-smooth
Berkovich curve $X$ has a certain compatibility condition with respect to an
automorphism $\sigma$ of $X$, and if the automorphism is sufficiently close to
the identity, then $\mathscr{F}$ acquires a semi-linear action of $\sigma$
(i.e. lifting that on $X$). This generalizes the previous works of Yves
Andr\'e, Lucia Di Vizio, and the author about $p$-adic $q$-difference
equations. We also obtain an application to Morita's $p$-adic Gamma function,
and to related values of $p$-adic $L$-functions.
