Experiments on the formation of spiraling hexagons (350 - 1000 nm in width)
from a solution of nanoparticles are presented. Transmission electron
microscopy images of the reaction products of chemically synthesized cadmium
nanocrystals indicate that the birth of the hexagons proceeds without
assistance from static screw or edge dislocatons, that is, they spiral without
constraints provided by an underlying substrate. Instead, the apparent growth
mechanism relies on what we believe is a dynamical dislocation identified as a
dense aggregate of small nanocrystals that straddles the spiraling hexagon at
the crystal surface. This nanocrystal bundle, which we term the "feeder", also
appears to release nanocrystals into the spiral during the growth process.
