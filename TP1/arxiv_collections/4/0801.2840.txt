We discuss cryptographic applications of single-qubit rotations from the
perspective of trapdoor one-way functions and public-key encryption. In
particular, we present an asymmetric cryptosystem whose security relies on
fundamental principles of quantum physics. A quantum public key is used for the
encryption of messages while decryption is possible by means of a classical
private key only. The trapdoor one-way function underlying the proposed
cryptosystem maps integer numbers to quantum states of a qubit and its
inversion can be infeasible by virtue of the Holevo's theorem.
