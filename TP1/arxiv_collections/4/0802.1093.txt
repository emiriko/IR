Recently, the quest for an ultracold and dense ensemble of polar molecules
has attracted strong interest. Polar molecules have bright prospects for novel
quantum gases with long-range and anisotropic interactions, for quantum
information science, and for precision measurements. However, high-density
clouds of ultracold polar molecules have so far not been produced. Here, we
report a key step towards this goal. Starting from an ultracold dense gas of
heteronuclear 40K-87Rb Feshbach molecules with typical binding energies of a
few hundred kHz and a negligible dipole moment, we coherently transfer these
molecules into a vibrational level of the ground-state molecular potential
bound by >10 GHz. We thereby increase the binding energy and the expected
dipole moment of the 40K-87Rb molecules by more than four orders of magnitude
in a single transfer step. Starting with a single initial state prepared with
Feshbach association, we achieve a transfer efficiency of 84%. While dipolar
effects are not yet observable, the presented technique can be extended to
access much more deeply bound vibrational levels and ultimately those
exhibiting a significant dipole moment. The preparation of an ultracold quantum
gas of polar molecules might therefore come within experimental reach.
