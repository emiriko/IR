We present fully empirical exchange-correlation functionals to be used within
reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT). These are of the popular J-K
form, where the function of the occupation numbers that multiplies the Fock
orbital term is written as a Pade approximant. The coefficients of the Pade are
optimized for a testset of eight molecules, and then refined for a larger set
of 35 molecules. Two different approaches were tried, either keeping the
self-interaction terms, or by removing them explicitly from the functional. The
functionals thus obtained involve very few parameters, but are able to
outperform other RDMFT functionals, yielding correlation energies that are, on
average, even slightly better than Moeller-Plesset MP2 theory.
