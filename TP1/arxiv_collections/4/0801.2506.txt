In a Letter, Cabello proposed a quantum key distribution (QKD) Protocol which
attended to Holevo limit. In this comment, we show that Eve could use a simple
plan to distinguish among quantum keys, without being detected by Alice and
Bob. In following, we show that our approach is not restricted to Cabello
Protocol. With attention to our Eavesdropping approach, it seems that Mor's
arguments for no-cloning principal for orthogonal states is not general enough
to avoid eavesdropping.
