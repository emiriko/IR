The Inverse Amplitude Method is a powerful unitarization technique to enlarge
the energy applicability region of Effective Lagrangians. It has been widely
used to describe resonances from Chiral Perturbation Theory as well as for the
Strongly Interacting Symmetry Breaking Sector. In this work we show how it can
be slightly modified to account also for the sub-threshold region,
incorporating correctly the Adler zeros required by chiral symmetry and
eliminating spurious poles. These improvements produce negligible effects on
the physical region.
