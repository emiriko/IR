In this paper, a reliability analysis is carried out to state a performance
comparison between two recently proposed proactive routing algorithms. These
protocols are able to scale in ad hoc and sensor networks by resorting to
dynamic addressing, to face with the topology variability, which is typical of
ad hoc, and sensor networks. Numerical simulations are also carried out to
corroborate the results of the analysis.
