It is explained how to provide self-adjoint operators having scattering
states forming a multiplicity one continuum and bound states whose
corresponding eigenvalues have an asymptotic density equivalent to the one of
the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. It is shown how this can be put into an
integro-differential form of a type recently considered by Sierra.
