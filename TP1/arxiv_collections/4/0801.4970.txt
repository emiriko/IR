In this talk I give a short review of theoretical results on the properties
of hadrons in cold, equilibrium nuclear matter. I then discuss the observable
consequences of any changes of these properties inside the medium in actual
experiments. I demonstrate that any experimental verification of in-medium
effects requires a state-of-the-art treatment of the reaction dynamics and, in
particular, also the final state interactions.
