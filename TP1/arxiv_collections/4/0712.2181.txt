We report the results of a combined muon spin rotation and neutron scattering
study on La2-xSrxCuO4 in the vicinity of the so-called 1/8-anomaly. Application
of a magnetic field drives the system towards a magnetically ordered
spin-density-wave state, which is fully developed at 1/8 doping. The results
are discussed in terms of competition between antiferromagnetic and
superconducting order parameters.
