High-precision Penning trap mass measurements on the stable nuclide 27Al as
well as on the short-lived radionuclides 26Al and 38,39Ca have been performed
by use of radiofrequency excitation with time-separated oscillatory fields,
i.e. Ramsey's method, as recently introduced for the excitation of the ion
motion in a Penning trap, was applied. A comparison with the conventional
method of a single continuous excitation demonstrates its advantage of up to
ten times shorter measurements. The new mass values of 26,27Al clarify
conflicting data in this specific mass region. In addition, the resulting mass
values of the superallowed beta-emitter 38Ca as well as of the groundstate of
the beta-emitter 26Al m confirm previous measurements and corresponding
theoretical corrections of the ft-values.
