We describe in this short review the influence of discrete symmetries in
complex quantum dots on the Kondo co-tunneling through these nano-objects.
These discrete symmetries stem from the geometrical structure of the tunneling
devices (e.g spatial symmetry of multivalley quantum dot in a tunneling contact
with leads). They affect the dynamical symmetry of spin multiplets
characterizing the ground state and excitations in quantum dots with definite
electron number occupation. The influence of external electric and magnetic
fields on these symmetries is examined, and analogies with the physics of
quantum tunneling through molecular complexes are discussed.
