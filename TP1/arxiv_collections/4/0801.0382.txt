Poltergeist accounts concern at least four kinds of strange spontaneous
manifestations, such as burning of materials, failures of electric equipments,
rapping noises and movements of objects. A simple analysis of phenomenology of
these disturbances shows that they might have a common origin, that is, a
reduction in strength of molecular bonds due to an enhancement in polarization
of vacuum which decreases the actual electron charge. Arguments based on
Prigogine' nonequilibrium thermodynamics are proposed, which show how
transformations in brain of some pubescent childs or young womans might be the
cause of these effects.
