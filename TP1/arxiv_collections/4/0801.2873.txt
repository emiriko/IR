Measurements provide a novel mechanism for generating the entanglement
resource necessary for performing scalable quantum computation. Recently, we
proposed a method for performing parity measurements in a coupled quantum dot
system. In this paper we generalise this scheme and perform a comprehensive
analytic and numerical study of environmental factors. We calculate the effects
of possible error sources including non-ideal photon detectors, ineffective
spin-selective excitation and dot distinguishability (both spatial and
spectral). Furthermore, we present an experimental approach for verifying the
success of the parity measurement.
