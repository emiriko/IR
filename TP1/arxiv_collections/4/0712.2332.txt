This article reviews some aspects in the current relationship between
mathematical and numerical General Relativity. Focus is placed on the
description of isolated systems, with a particular emphasis on recent
developments in the study of black holes. Ideas concerning asymptotic flatness,
the initial value problem, the constraint equations, evolution formalisms,
geometric inequalities and quasi-local black hole horizons are discussed on the
light of the interaction between numerical and mathematical relativists.
