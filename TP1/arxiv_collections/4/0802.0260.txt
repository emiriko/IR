Theory of splicing is an abstract model of the recombinant behaviour of DNAs.
In a splicing system, two strings to be spliced are taken from the same set and
the splicing rule is from another set. Here we propose a generalised splicing
(GS) model with three components, two strings from two languages and a splicing
rule from third component. We propose a generalised self assembly (GSA) of
strings. Two strings $u_1xv_1$ and $u_2xv_2$ self assemble over $x$ and
generate $u_1xv_2$ and $u_2xv_1$. We study the relationship between GS and GSA.
We study some classes of generalised splicing languages with the help of
generalised self assembly.
