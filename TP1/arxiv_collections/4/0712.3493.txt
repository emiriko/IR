Using 226 million BBbar events recorded on the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the
BABAR detector at the SLAC e+e- PEPII storage rings, we reconstruct B- -> D*0
e- nubar decays using the decay chain D*0 -> D0 pi0 and D0 -> K pi. From the
dependence of their differential rate on w, the dot product of the
four-velocities of B and D*0, and using the form factor description by Caprini
et al. with the parameters F(1) and rho_A1^2, we obtain the results rho_A1^2 =
1.16 +- 0.06 +- 0.08, F(1)|V_cb| = (35.9 +- 0.6 +- 1.4) 10^-3, and BF(B- -> D*0
e- nubar) = (5.56 +- 0.08 +- 0.41)%.
