Using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations we study the properties
of the ferromagnetic Heusler compounds NiYSi where Y stands for V, Cr or Mn.
NiCrSi and NiMnSi contrary to NiVSi are half-metallic at their equilibrium
lattice constant exhibiting integer values of the total spin magnetic moment
and thus we concentrate on these two alloys. The minority-spin gap has the same
characteristics as for the well-known NiMnSb alloy being around $\sim$1 eV.
Upon tetragonalization the gap is present in the density of states even for
expansion or contraction of the out-of-plane lattice parameter by 5%. The Cr-Cr
and Mn-Mn interactions make ferromagnetism extremely stable and the Curie
temperature exceeds 1000 K for NiMnSi. Surface and interfaces with GaP, ZnS and
Si semiconductors are not half-metallic but in the case of NiCrSi the Ni-based
contacts present spin-polarization at the Fermi level over 90%. Finally, we
show that there are two cases of defects and atomic-swaps. The first-ones which
involve the Cr(Mn) and Si atoms induce states at the edges of the gap which
persists for a moderate-concentration of defects. Defects involving Ni atoms
induce states localized within the gap completely destroying the
half-metallicity. Based on single-impurity calculations we associate these
states to the symmetry of the crystal.
