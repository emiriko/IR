The strong subadditivity is the most important inequality which entanglement
entropy satisfies. Based on the AdS/CFT conjecture, entanglement entropy in CFT
is equal to the area of the minimal surface in AdS space. It is known that a
Wilson loop can also be holographically computed from the minimal surface in
AdS space. In this paper, we argue that Wilson loops also satisfy a similar
inequality, and find several evidences of it.
