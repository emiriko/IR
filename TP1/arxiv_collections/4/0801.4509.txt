The SiLC - Silicon for the Linear Collider - collaboration aims to develop
silicon detector technology for tracking in the international linear collider
experiments. The R & D programme involves a substantial effort in simulation of
the response of detector designs. In this contribution, an overview of ongoing
efforts in this area is given.
