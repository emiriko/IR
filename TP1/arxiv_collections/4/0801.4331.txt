The variety of noise sources typical of the solid state represents the main
limitation toward the realization of controllable and reliable quantum
nanocircuits, as those allowing quantum computation. Such ``structured
environments'' are characterized by a non-monotonous noise spectrum sometimes
showing resonances at selected frequencies. Here we focus on a prototype
structured environment model: a two-state impurity linearly coupled to a
dissipative harmonic bath. We identify the time scale separating Gaussian and
non-Gaussian dynamical regimes of the Spin-Boson impurity. By using a
path-integral approach we show that a qubit interacting with such a structured
bath may probe the variety of environmental dynamical regimes.
