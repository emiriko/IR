A plasmonic "molecule" consisting of a radiative element coupled with a
sub-radiant (dark) element is theoretically investigated. The plasmonic
"molecule" shows close resemblance to the electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT) in an atomic system. Because of its sub-wavelength
dimension, this EIT-like "molecule" can be used as building block to construct
a "slow light" plasmonic metamaterial.
