In a one dimensional lattice thermal fluctuations destroy the long-range
order making particles of the lattice move on a scale much larger than the
lattice spacing. We discuss the assumption that this motion may be responsible
for the transport of localized electrons in a system of weakly coupled chains.
The model with diffusing localization sites gives a temperature-independent
mobility with a crossover to an activated dependence at high temperature. This
prediction is consistent with and might account for experimental results on
discotic liquid crystals and certain biopolymers.
