We discuss some topics concerning exclusive non-leptonic B decays. In
particular we focus on Bs->KK decays, for which we present complementary
predictions within the SM, as well as the impact that SUSY would have on the CP
observables. We also present an analysis of Bs->VV decays that allows to
measure the mixing angle of the Bs system. We make special emphasis on the
control of hadronic uncertainties.
