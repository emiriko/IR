We introduce and study a new class of kinetic equations, which arise in the
description of nonequilibrium macroscopic dynamics of soliton gases with
elastic collisions between solitons. These equations represent nonlinear
integro-differential systems and have a novel structure, which we investigate
by studying in detail the class of $N$-component `cold-gas' hydrodynamic
reductions. We prove that these reductions represent integrable linearly
degenerate hydrodynamic type systems for arbitrary $N$ which is a strong
evidence in favour of integrability of the full kinetic equation. We derive
compact explicit representations for the Riemann invariants and characteristic
velocities of the hydrodynamic reductions in terms of the `cold-gas' component
densities and construct a number of exact solutions having special properties
(quasi-periodic, self-similar). Hydrodynamic symmetries are then derived and
investigated. The obtained results shed the light on the structure of a
continuum limit for a large class of integrable systems of hydrodynamic type
and are also relevant to the description of turbulent motion in conservative
compressible flows.
