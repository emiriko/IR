This review gives an overview of effective field theory (EFT) as applied at
finite density, with a focus on nuclear many-body systems. Uniform systems with
short-range interactions illustrate the ingredients and virtues of many-body
EFT and then the varied frontiers of EFT for finite nuclei and nuclear matter
are surveyed.
