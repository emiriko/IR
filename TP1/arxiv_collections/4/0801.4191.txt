A rapidly developing field of spintronics is based on the premise that
substituting charge with spin as a carrier of information can lead to new
devices with lower power consumption, non-volatility and high operational
speed. Despite efficient magnetization detection, magnetization manipulation is
primarily performed by current-generated local magnetic fields and is very
inefficient. Here we report a novel non-volatile hybrid multiferroic memory
cell with electrostatic control of magnetization based on strain-coupled GaMnAs
ferromagnetic semiconductor and a piezoelectric material. We use the
crystalline anisotropy of GaMnAs to store information in the orientation of the
magnetization along one of the two easy axes, which is monitored via transverse
anisotropic magnetoresistance. The magnetization orientation is switched by
applying voltage to the piezoelectric material and tuning magnetic anisotropy
of GaMnAs via the resulting stress field.
