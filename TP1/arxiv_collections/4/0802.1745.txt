The application of superscaling ideas to predict neutral-current (NC)
quasielastic (QE) neutrino cross sections is investigated. Results obtained
within the relativistic impulse approximation (RIA) using the same relativistic
mean field potential (RMF) for both initial and final nucleons -- a model that
reproduces the experimental (e,e') scaling function -- are used to illustrate
the ideas involved. While NC reactions are not so well suited for scaling
analyses, to a large extent the RIA-RMF predictions do exhibit superscaling.
Independence of the scaled response on the nuclear species is very well
fulfilled. The RIA-RMF NC superscaling function is in good agreement with the
experimental (e,e') one. The idea that electroweak processes can be described
with a universal scaling function, provided that mild restrictions on the
kinematics are assumed, is shown to be valid.
