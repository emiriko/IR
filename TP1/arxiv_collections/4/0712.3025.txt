It is known that the discrepancy in pion spectral functions extracted from
positron-electron annihilation and tau decay leads to different predictions for
the muon anomalous magnetic moment. We will show that this discrepancy effects
also the extraction of the Cabibbo angle from the hadronic tau decays. The
corrections to the tau branching fractions, corresponding to the presence of
new centi-weak tensor interactions, allow us to extract the Cabibbo angle from
tau decays in agreement with its other precision determinations. Thus a more
precise value of |V_us|=0.2246 +/- 0.0012 is obtained and as a consequence
f(0)=0.9645 +/- 0.0055 and F_K/F_pi=1.196 +/- 0.007.
