We present a scheme for implementing quantum operations with superconducting
qubits. Our approach uses a "coupler" qubit to mediate a controllable, secular
interaction between "data" qubits, pulse sequences which strongly mitigate the
effects of 1/f flux noise, and a high-Q resonator-based local memory. We
develop a Monte-Carlo simulation technique capable of describing arbitrary
noise-induced dephasing and decay, and demonstrate in this system a set of
universal gate operations with O(10^-5) error probabilities in the presence of
experimentally measured levels of 1/f noise. We then add relaxation and
quantify the decay times required to maintain this error level.
