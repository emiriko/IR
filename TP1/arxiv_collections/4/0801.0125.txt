Bandstructure effects in the electronic transport of strongly quantized
silicon nanowire field-effect-transistors (FET) in various transport
orientations are examined. A 10-band sp3d5s* semi-empirical atomistic
tight-binding model coupled to a self consistent Poisson solver is used for the
dispersion calculation. A semi-classical, ballistic FET model is used to
evaluate the current-voltage characteristics. It is found that the total gate
capacitance is degraded from the oxide capacitance value by 30% for wires in
all the considered transport orientations ([100], [110], [111]). Different wire
directions primarily influence the carrier velocities, which mainly determine
the relative performance differences, while the total charge difference is
weakly affected. The velocities depend on the effective mass and degeneracy of
the dispersions. The [110] and secondly the [100] oriented 3nm thick nanowires
examined, indicate the best ON-current performance compared to [111] wires. The
dispersion features are strong functions of quantization. Effects such as
valley splitting can lift the degeneracies especially for wires with cross
section sides below 3nm. The effective masses also change significantly with
quantization, and change differently for different transport orientations. For
the cases of [100] and [111] wires the masses increase with quantization,
however, in the [110] case, the mass decreases. The mass variations can be
explained from the non-parabolicities and anisotropies that reside in the first
Brillouin zone of silicon.
