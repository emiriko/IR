We discuss several ways of illustrating fundamental concepts in statistical
and thermal physics by considering various models and algorithms. We emphasize
the importance of replacing students' incomplete mental images by models that
are physically accurate. In some cases it is sufficient to discuss the results
of an algorithm or the behavior of a model rather than having students write a
program.
