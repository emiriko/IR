In 5-dimensional models with gauge-Higgs unification, the F-term vacuum
expectation value of the radion provides, in close analogy to the
Giudice-Masiero mechanism, a natural source for the mu and B mu term. Both the
leading order gauge theory lagrangian and the supersymmetric Chern-Simons term
contain couplings to the radion superfield which can be used for this purpose.
We analyse the basic features of this mechanism for mu term generation and
provide an explicit example, based on a variation of the SU(6) gauge-Higgs
unification model of Burdman and Nomura. This construction contains all the
relevant features used in our generic analysis. More generally, we expect our
mechanism to be relevant to many of the recently discussed orbifold GUT models
derived from heterotic string theory. This provides an interesting way of
testing high-scale physics via Higgs mass patterns accessible at the LHC.
