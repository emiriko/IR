Using a three-dimensional focused-ion beam lithography process we have
fabricated nanopillar devices which show spin transfer torque switching at zero
external magnetic fields. Under a small in-plane external bias field, a
field-dependent peak in the differential resistance versus current is observed
similar to that reported in asymmetrical nanopillar devices. This is
interpreted as evidence for the low-field excitation of spin waves which in our
case is attributed to a spin-scattering asymmetry enhanced by the IrMn exchange
bias layer coupled to a relatively thin CoFe fixed layer.
