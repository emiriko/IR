We show an interesting PBD-closure result for the set of lengths of
constant-composition codes whose distance and size meet certain conditions. A
consequence of this PBD-closure result is that the size of optimal
constant-composition codes can be determined for infinite families of parameter
sets from just a single example of an optimal code. As an application, the size
of several infinite families of optimal constant-composition codes are derived.
In particular, the problem of determining the size of optimal
constant-composition codes having distance four and weight three is solved for
all lengths sufficiently large. This problem was previously unresolved for odd
lengths, except for lengths seven and eleven.
