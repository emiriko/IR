The quantum spin Hall state is a topologically non-trivial insulator state
protected by the time reversal symmetry. We show that such a state always leads
to spin-charge separation in the presence of a $\pi$ flux. Our result is
generally valid for any interacting system. We present a proposal to
experimentally observe the phenomenon of spin-charge separation in the recently
discovered quantum spin Hall system.
