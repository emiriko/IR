Two approaches to quantization of Freedman's closed Universe are compared. In
the first approach, the Shrodinger's norm of the wave function of Universe is
used, and in the second approach, the Klein-Gordon's norm is used. The second
one allows building the quasi-Heisenberg operators as functions of time and
finding their average values. It is shown that the average value of the
Universe scale factor oscillates with damping and approaches to some constant
value at the end of the Universe evolution.
