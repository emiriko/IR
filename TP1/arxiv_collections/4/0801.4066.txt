Optical supercontinuum radiation, a special kind of white light, has found
numerous applications in scientific research and technology. This bright,
broadband radiation can be generated from nearly monochromatic light through
the cooperative action of multiple nonlinear effects. Unfortunately,
supercontinuum radiation is plagued by large spectral and temporal fluctuations
owing to the spontaneous initiation of the generation process. While these
fluctuations give rise to fascinating behavior in the form of optical rogue
waves [1], they impede many critical applications of supercontinuum. Here, we
introduce, and experimentally demonstrate, a powerful means of control over
supercontinuum generation by stimulating the process with a very weak optical
seed signal [2]. This minute addition significantly reduces the input power
threshold for the process and dramatically increases the stability of the
resulting radiation. This effect represents an optical tipping point, as the
controlled addition of a specialized, but extraordinarily weak perturbation
powerfully impacts a much stronger optical field, inducing a drastic transition
in the optical system.
