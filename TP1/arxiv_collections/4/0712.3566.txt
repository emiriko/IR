Recent achievements in experiments with cold fermionic atoms indicate the
potential for developing novel superconducting devices which may be operated in
a wide range of regimes, at a level of precision previously not available.
Unlike traditional, solid-state superconducting devices, the cold-atom systems
allow the fast switching on of the BCS phase, and the observation of
non-equilibrium, coherent oscillations of the order parameter. The integrable
and non-linear nature of the equations of motions makes this operating regime
particularly rich in potential applications, such as quantum modulation and
encoding, or nonlinear mixing of quantum coherent oscillations, to name only
two. From a mathematical point of view, such systems can be described using the
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equation, or more generally, by the matrix
Kadomtsev-Petviashvilii integrable hierarchy. This identification is
particularly useful, since it allows a direct application of the known
non-linear phenomena described by particular solutions of these equations.
Other important features of this formulation, such as the relation to the spin
Calogero-Sutherland model, also have relevant physical interpretations. In this
work, a complete description of these relationships is presented, along with
their potential practical consequences.
