Using the Landauer-Buttiker theory we calculate the thermal conductance
associated to plasmons modes in one dimensional arrays of nanoparticles closely
spaced in a host fluid. Our numerical simulations show that the near-field
interactions between particles have a negligible effect on the thermal
conductivity of nanoparticles colloidal solutions (nanofluids).
