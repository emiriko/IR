The relativistic Lagrangian for a spinning particle in an electromagnetic
field is derived from the known Lagrangian in the particle's rest frame. The
resulting relativistic Stern-Gerlach and Thomas precession forces on the
particle are then derived from the Lagrangian in the laboratory frame. In
particular, the longitudinal component of this combined Stern-Gerlach-Thomas
force does not contain a term proportional to gamma-squared as was claimed in a
previous derivation [1].
