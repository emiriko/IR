We investigate the rare-earth polychalcogenide $R_2$Te$_5$ ($R$=Nd, Sm and
Gd) charge-density-wave (CDW) compounds by optical methods. From the absorption
spectrum we extract the excitation energy of the CDW gap and estimate the
fraction of the Fermi surface which is gapped by the formation of the CDW
condensate. In analogy to previous findings on the related $R$Te$_n$ (n=2 and
3) families, we establish the progressive closing of the CDW gap and the
moderate enhancement of the metallic component upon chemically compressing the
lattice.
