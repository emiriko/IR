New strong interactions at the LHC may exhibit a richer structure than
expected from simply rescaling QCD to the electroweak scale. In fact, a
departure from rescaled QCD is required for compatibility with electroweak
constraints. To navigate the space of possible scenarios, we use a simple
framework, based on a 5D model with modifications of AdS geometry in the
infrared. In the parameter space, we select two points with particularly
interesting phenomenology. For these benchmark points, we explore the discovery
of triplets of vector and axial resonances at the LHC.
