The Quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the two-dimensional Emery model of the
CuO2 plane of hight Tc superconductors were performed. The method based on the
direct-space proposed by Suzuki and Hirsch was used. Contrary to the method
based on the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, the states generated by this
method are basis states in occupation number representation, i. e.
configurations of fermions can be observed on real two-dimensional array.Energy
and specific heat were computed for different dopings. Specific heat curves
show peaks at low temperature which could be assigned to electronic
transitions. Quantity similar to current-current correlation function were
computed. The static electric conductivity curves obtained by this way show
metal-insulator transitions and two different metallic behaviours. On the
direct-space states generated at low temperature and zero doping, the fermions
form antiferromagnetic loops while they form antiferromagnetic chains for other
dopings. The loops seem to appear when the conductivity becomes zero while yhe
conductivity increases with the numbers of chains but superconductivity is not
unambiguously evident.
