We present a comparison of two english texts, written by Lewis Carroll, one
(Alice in wonderland) and the other (Through a looking glass), the former
translated into esperanto, in order to observe whether natural and artificial
languages significantly differ from each other. We construct one dimensional
time series like signals using either word lengths or word frequencies. We use
the multifractal ideas for sorting out correlations in the writings. In order
to check the robustness of the methods we also write the corresponding shuffled
texts. We compare characteristic functions and e.g. observe marked differences
in the (far from parabolic) f(alpha) curves, differences which we attribute to
Tsallis non extensive statistical features in the ''frequency time series'' and
''length time series''. The esperanto text has more extreme vallues. A very
rough approximation consists in modeling the texts as a random Cantor set if
resulting from a binomial cascade of long and short words (or words and
blanks). This leads to parameters characterizing the text style, and most
likely in fine the author writings.
