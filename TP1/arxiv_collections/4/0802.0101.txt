In a recent paper, we have shown that the QED nonlinear corrections imply a
phase correction to the linear evolution of crossing electromagnetic waves in
vacuum. Here, we provide a more complete analysis, including a full numerical
solution of the QED nonlinear wave equations for short-distance propagation in
a symmetric configuration. The excellent agreement of such a solution with the
result that we obtain using our perturbatively-motivated Variational Approach
is then used to justify an analytical approximation that can be applied in a
more general case. This allows us to find the most promising configuration for
the search of photon-photon scattering in optics experiments. In particular, we
show that our previous requirement of phase coherence between the two crossing
beams can be released. We then propose a very simple experiment that can be
performed at future exawatt laser facilities, such as ELI, by bombarding a low
power laser beam with the exawatt bump.
