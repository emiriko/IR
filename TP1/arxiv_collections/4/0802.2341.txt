Low-frequency $K^{\pi}=0^{+}$ states in deformed neutron-rich nuclei are
investigated by means of the quasiparticle-random-phase approximation based on
the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov formalism in the coordinate space. We have obtained
the very strongly collective $K^{\pi}=0^{+}$ modes not only in neutron-rich Mg
isotope but also in Cr and Fe isotopes in N=40 region, where the onset of
nuclear deformation has been discussed. It is found that the spatially extended
structure of neutron quasiparticle wave functions around the Fermi level brings
about a striking enhancement of the transition strengths. It is also found that
the fluctuation of the pairing field plays an important role in generating
coherence among two-quasiparticle excitations of neutron.
