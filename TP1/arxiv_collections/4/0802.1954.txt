A passive orthonomic system of PDEs defines a submanifold in the
corresponding jet manifold, coordinated by so called parametric derivatives. We
restrict the total differential operators and the prolongation of an
evolutionary vector field v to this submanifold. We show that the vanishing of
their commutators is equivalent to v being a generalized symmetry of the
system.
