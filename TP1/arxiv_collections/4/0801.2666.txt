Prostate brachytherapy involves implanting radioactive seeds (I125 for
instance) permanently in the gland for the treatment of localized prostate
cancers, e.g., cT1c-T2a N0 M0 with good prognostic factors. Treatment planning
and seed implanting are most often based on the intensive use of transrectal
ultrasound (TRUS) imaging. This is not easy because prostate visualization is
difficult in this imaging modality particularly as regards the apex of the
gland and from an intra- and interobserver variability standpoint. Radioactive
seeds are implanted inside open interventional MR machines in some centers.
Since MRI was shown to be sensitive and specific for prostate imaging whilst
open MR is prohibitive for most centers and makes surgical procedures very
complex, this work suggests bringing the MR virtually in the operating room
with MRI/TRUS data fusion. This involves providing the physician with
bi-modality images (TRUS plus MRI) intended to improve treatment planning from
the data registration stage. The paper describes the method developed and
implemented in the PROCUR system. Results are reported for a phantom and first
series of patients. Phantom experiments helped characterize the accuracy of the
process. Patient experiments have shown that using MRI data linked with TRUS
data improves TRUS image segmentation especially regarding the apex and base of
the prostate. This may significantly modify prostate volume definition and have
an impact on treatment planning.
