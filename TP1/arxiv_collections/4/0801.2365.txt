The problem of an accurate Eulerian-Lagrangian modeling of inertial particle
dispersion in Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of turbulent wall-bounded flows is
addressed. We run Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) for turbulent channel flow
at shear Reynolds numbers equal to 150 and 300 and corresponding a-priori and
a-posteriori LES on differently coarse grids. We then tracked swarms of
different inertia particles and we examined the influence of filtering and of
Sub-Grid Scale (SGS) modeling for the fluid phase on particle velocity and
concentration statistics. We also focused on how particle preferential
segregation is predicted by LES. Results show that even ``well-resolved'' LES
is unable to reproduce the physics as demonstrated by DNS, both for particle
accumulation at the wall and for particle preferential segregation. Inaccurate
prediction is observed for the entire range of particles considered in this
study, even when the particle response time is much larger than the flow
timescales not resolved in LES. Both a-priori and a-posteriori tests indicate
that recovering the level of fluid and particle velocity fluctuations is not
enough to have accurate prediction of near-wall accumulation and local
segregation. This may suggest that reintroducing the correct amount of
higher-order moments of the velocity fluctuations is also a key point for SGS
closure models for the particle equation. Another important issue is the
presence of possible flow Reynolds number effects on particle dispersion. Our
results show that, in small Reynolds number turbulence and in the case of heavy
particles, the shear fluid velocity is a suitable scaling parameter to quantify
these effects.
