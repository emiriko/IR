We investigate the current noise of a charge qubit coupled to a phonon bath
in different parameter regimes. We find, using the theory of Full Counting
Statistics of non-Markovian systems, that the current fluctuations are strongly
influenced by memory effects generated from the interplay between quantum
coherence and the dynamics of the phonon bath.
