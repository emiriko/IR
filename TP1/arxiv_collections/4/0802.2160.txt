The measurements of the Collins and Sivers asymmetries of identified hadrons
produced in deep-inelastic scattering of 160 GeV/c muons on a transversely
polarised 6LiD target at COMPASS are presented. The results for charged pions
and charged and neutral kaons correspond to all data available, which were
collected from 2002 to 2004. For all final state particles both the Collins and
Sivers asymmetries turn out to be small, compatible with zero within the
statistical errors, in line with the previously published results for not
identified charged hadrons, and with the expected cancellation between the u-
and d-quark contributions.
