We obtain the contributions to the renormalization group functions of all the
diagrams containing the unique one-loop primitive divergence of a simple
supersymmetric Wess--Zumino model, up to more than 200 loops. The asymptotic
behavior of the coefficients in the expansion of the anomalous dimension is
analyzed.
