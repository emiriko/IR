We compare the phase evolution of equal-mass nonspinning black-hole binaries
from numerical relativity (NR) simulations with post-Newtonian (PN) results
obtained from three PN approximants: the TaylorT1 and T4 approximants, for
which NR-PN comparisons have already been performed in the literature, and the
recently proposed approximant TaylorEt. The accumulated phase disagreement
between NR and PN results over the frequency range $M\omega = 0.0455$ to
$M\omega = 0.1$ is greater for TaylorEt than either T1 or T4, but has the
attractive property of decreasing monotonically as the PN order is increased.
