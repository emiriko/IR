In this paper, we show that some spectral properties of Anosov
diffeomorphisms can be obtained by semi-classical analysis. In particular the
Ruelle resonances which are eigenvalues of the Ruelle transfer operator acting
in suitable anisotropic Sobolev spaces and which govern the decay of dynamical
correlations, can be treated as the quantum resonances of open quantum systems
in the Aguilar-Baslev-Combes theory or the more recent Helffer-Sjostrand
phase-space theory.
