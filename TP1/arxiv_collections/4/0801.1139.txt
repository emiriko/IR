Above 54.4 eV, two-photon double ionization of helium is dominated by a
sequential absorption process, producing characteristic behavior in the single
and triple differential cross sections. We show that the signature of this
process is visible in the nuclear recoil cross section, integrated over all
energy sharings of the ejected electrons, even below the threshold for the
sequential process. Since nuclear recoil momentum imaging does not require
coincident photoelectron measurement, the predicted images present a viable
target for future experiments with new short-pulse VUV and soft X-ray sources.
