We study the long-time behavior of the probability density Q_t of the first
exit time from a bounded interval [-L,L] for a stochastic non-Markovian process
h(t) describing fluctuations at a given point of a two-dimensional, infinite in
both directions Gaussian interface. We show that Q_t decays when t \to \infty
as a power-law $^{-1 - \alpha}, where \alpha is non-universal and proportional
to the ratio of the thermal energy and the elastic energy of a fluctuation of
size L. The fact that \alpha appears to be dependent on L, which is rather
unusual, implies that the number of existing moments of Q_t depends on the size
of the window [-L,L]. A moment of an arbitrary order n, as a function of L,
exists for sufficiently small L, diverges when L approaches a certain threshold
value L_n, and does not exist for L > L_n. For L > L_1, the probability density
Q_t is normalizable but does not have moments.
