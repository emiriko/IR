Critical wetting transitions under nonequilibrium conditions are studied
numerically and analytically by means of an interface-displacement model
defined by a Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, plus some extra terms representing a
limiting, short-ranged attractive wall. Its critical behavior is characterized
in detail by providing a set of exponents for both the average height and the
surface order-parameter in one dimension. The emerging picture is qualitatively
and quantitatively different from recently reported mean-field predictions for
the same problem. Evidence is shown that the presence of the attractive wall
induces an anomalous scaling of the interface local slopes.
