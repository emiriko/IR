Despite its appeal, real and simulated glass forming systems do not undergo
an ergodic-nonergodic (ENE) transition. We reconsider whether the fluctuating
nonlinear hydrodynamics (FNH) model for this system, introduced by us in 1986,
supports an ENE transition. Using nonperturbative arguments, with no reference
to the hydrodynamic regime, we show that the FNH model does not support an ENE
transition. Our results support the findings in the original paper. Assertions
in the literature questioning the validity of the original work are shown to be
in error.
