The saturation-based reasoning methods are among the most theoretically
developed ones and are used by most of the state-of-the-art first-order logic
reasoners. In the last decade there was a sharp increase in performance of such
systems, which I attribute to the use of advanced calculi and the intensified
research in implementation techniques. However, nowadays we are witnessing a
slowdown in performance progress, which may be considered as a sign that the
saturation-based technology is reaching its inherent limits. The position I am
trying to put forward in this paper is that such scepticism is premature and a
sharp improvement in performance may potentially be reached by adopting new
architectural principles for saturation. The top-level algorithms and
corresponding designs used in the state-of-the-art saturation-based theorem
provers have (at least) two inherent drawbacks: the insufficient flexibility of
the used inference selection mechanisms and the lack of means for intelligent
prioritising of search directions. In this position paper I analyse these
drawbacks and present two ideas on how they could be overcome. In particular, I
propose a flexible low-cost high-precision mechanism for inference selection,
intended to overcome problems associated with the currently used instances of
clause selection-based procedures. I also outline a method for intelligent
prioritising of search directions, based on probing the search space by
exploring generalised search directions. I discuss some technical issues
related to implementation of the proposed architectural principles and outline
possible solutions.
