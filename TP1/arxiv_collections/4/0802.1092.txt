Equilibrium atomic configurations and electron energy structure of ethanol
adsorbed on the Si (111) surface are studied by the first-principles density
functional theory. Geometry optimization is performed by the total energy
minimization method. Several equilibrium atomic configurations of ethanol, both
undissociated and dissociated, on the Si (111) surface are found. Reaction
pathways and predicted transition states are discussed in comparison with
available experimental data in terms of the feasibility of the reactions
occurring. Analysis of atom and orbital resolved projected density of states
indicate substantial modifications of the Si surface valence and conduction
bands due to the adsorption of ethanol affecting the electrical properties of
the surface.
