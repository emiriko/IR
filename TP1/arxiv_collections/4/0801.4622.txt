We derive an efficient method for the insertion of structured particles in
grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations of adsorption in very confining
geometries. We extend this method to path integral simulations and use it to
calculate the isotherm of adsorption of hydrogen isotopes in narrow carbon
nanotubes (2D confinement) and slit pores (1D confinement) at the temperatures
of 20 K and 77 K, discussing its efficiency by comparison to the standard path
integral grand canonical Monte Carlo algorithm. We use this algorithm to
perform multicomponent simulations in order to calculate the hydrogen isotope
selectivity for adsorption in narrow carbon nanotubes and slit pores at finite
pressures. The algorithm described here can be applied to the study of
adsorption of real oligomers and polymers in narrow pores and channels.
