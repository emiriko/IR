In the Bose-Einstein condensation of interacting atoms or molecules such as
87Rb, 23Na and 7Li, the theoretical understanding of the transition temperature
is not always obvious due to the interactions or zero point energy which cannot
be exactly taken into account. The S-wave collision model fails sometimes to
account for the condensation temperatures. In this work, we look at the problem
within the nonextensive statistics which is considered as a possible theory
describing interacting systems. The generalized energy Uq and the particle
number Nq of boson gas are given in terms of the nonextensive parameter q. q>1
(q<1) implies repulsive (attractive) interaction with respect to the perfect
gas. The generalized condensation temperature Tcq is derived versus Tc given by
the perfect gas theory. Thanks to the observed condensation temperatures, we
find q ~ 0.1 for 87Rb atomic gas, q ~ 0.95 for 7Li and q ~ 0.62 for 23Na. It is
concluded that the effective interactions are essentially attractive for the
three considered atoms, which is consistent with the observed temperatures
higher than those predicted by the conventional theory.
