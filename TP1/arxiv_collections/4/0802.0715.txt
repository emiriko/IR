We analyze the electromagnetic scattering of massive particles with and
without spin and, using the techniques of effective field theory, we isolate
the leading long distance effects beyond one photon exchange, both classical
and quantum mechanical. Spin-independent and spin-dependent effects are
isolated and shown to have a universal structure.
