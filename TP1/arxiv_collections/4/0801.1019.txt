A mesoscopic description of spin-transfer effect is proposed, based on the
spin-injection mechanism occurring at the junction with a ferromagnet. The
effect of spin-injection is to modify locally, in the ferromagnetic
configuration space, the density of magnetic moments. The corresponding
gradient leads to a current-dependent diffusion process of the magnetization.
In order to describe this effect, the dynamics of the magnetization of a
ferromagnetic single domain is reconsidered in the framework of the
thermokinetic theory of mesoscopic systems. Assuming an Onsager
cross-coefficient that couples the currents, it is shown that spin-dependent
electric transport leads to a correction of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation of the ferromagnetic order parameter with supplementary diffusion
terms. The consequence of spin-injection in terms of activation process of the
ferromagnet is deduced, and the expressions of the effective energy barrier and
of the critical current are derived. Magnetic fluctuations are calculated: the
correction to the fluctuations is similar to that predicted for the activation.
These predictions are consistent with the measurements of spin-transfer
obtained in the activation regime and for ferromagnetic resonance under
spin-injection.
