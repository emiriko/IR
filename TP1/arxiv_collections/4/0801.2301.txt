In a recent Letter [G. Chiribella et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 120501
(2007)], four protocols were proposed to secretly transmit a reference frame.
Here We point out that in these protocols an eavesdropper can change the
transmitted reference frame without being detected, which means the consistency
of the shared reference frames should be reexamined. The way to check the above
consistency is discussed. It is shown that this problem is quite different from
that in previous protocols of quantum cryptography.
