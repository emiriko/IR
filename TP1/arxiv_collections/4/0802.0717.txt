Using the methods of effective field theory we examine long range effects in
mixed electromagnetic-gravitational scattering. Recent calculations which have
yielded differing results for such effects are examined and corrected. We
consider various spin configurations of the scattered particles and find that
universality with respect to spin-dependence is obtained in agreement with
expectations.
