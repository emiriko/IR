We perform Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations for semi-magic Calcium,
Nickel, Tin and Lead isotopes and $N$=20, 28, 50 and 82 isotones using
density-dependent pairing interactions recently derived from a microscopic
nucleon-nucleon interaction. These interactions have an isovector component so
that the pairing gaps in symmetric and neutron matter are reproduced. Our
calculations well account for the experimental data for the neutron number
dependence of binding energy, two neutrons separation energy, and odd-even mass
staggering of these isotopes. This result suggests that by introducing the
isovector term in the pairing interaction, one can construct a global effective
pairing interaction which is applicable to nuclei in a wide range of the
nuclear chart. It is also shown with the local density approximation (LDA) that
the pairing field deduced from the pairing gaps in infinite matter reproduces
qualitatively well the pairing field for finite nuclei obtained with the HFB
method.
