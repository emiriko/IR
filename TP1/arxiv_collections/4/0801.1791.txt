The Painlev\'{e} and weak Painlev\'{e} conjectures have been used widely to
identify new integrable nonlinear dynamical systems. For a system which passes
the Painlev\'{e} test, the calculation of the integrals relies on a variety of
methods which are independent from Painlev\'{e} analysis. The present paper
proposes an explicit algorithm to build first integrals of a dynamical system,
expressed as `quasi-polynomial' functions, from the information provided solely
by the Painlev\'{e} - Laurent series solutions of a system of ODEs.
Restrictions on the number and form of quasi-monomial terms appearing in a
quasi-polynomial integral are obtained by an application of a theorem by
Yoshida (1983). The integrals are obtained by a proper balancing of the
coefficients in a quasi-polynomial function selected as initial ansatz for the
integral, so that all dependence on powers of the time $\tau=t-t_0$ is
eliminated. Both right and left Painlev\'{e} series are useful in the method.
Alternatively, the method can be used to show the non-existence of a
quasi-polynomial first integral. Examples from specific dynamical systems are
given.
