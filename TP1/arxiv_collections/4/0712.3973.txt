Many kinds of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been described in the
literature since the last 30 years. However, though most of them share a common
structure, no existing software package allows the user to actually shift from
one model to another by simply changing a few parameters, e.g. in a single
window of a Graphical User Interface. This paper presents GUIDE, a Graphical
User Interface for DREAM Experiments that, among other user-friendly features,
unifies all kinds of EAs into a single panel, as far as evolution parameters
are concerned. Such a window can be used either to ask for one of the well
known ready-to-use algorithms, or to very easily explore new combinations that
have not yet been studied. Another advantage of grouping all necessary elements
to describe virtually all kinds of EAs is that it creates a fantastic pedagogic
tool to teach EAs to students and newcomers to the field.
