A transformation of gamma max-infinitely divisible laws viz. geometric gamma
max-infinitely divisible laws is considered in this paper. Some of its
distributional and divisibility properties are discussed and a random time
changed extremal process corresponding to this distribution is presented. A new
kind of invariance (stability) under geometric maxima is proved and a max-AR(1)
model corresponding to it is also discussed.
