This paper gives an overview about particular quasi-entropies, generalized
quantum covariances, quantum Fisher informations, skew-informations and their
relations. The point is the dependence on operator monotone functions. It is
proven that a skew-information is the Hessian of a quasi-entropy. The
skew-information and some inequalities are extended to a von Neumann algebra
setting.
