One of the important challenges facing high resolution molecular dynamics
calculations is to reproduce biological functions that occur in the macroscopic
world and involve macroscopic variables. Some of these functions can be well
described by reduced models, with few parameters, over a wide range of
conditions, even though the functions are complex. We are all eager to see how
molecular dynamics will accurately estimate the thermodynamic variables that
define and control so many macroscopic biological functions.
