It is known that K3 surfaces S whose Picard number rho (= rank of the
Neron-Severi group of S) is at least 19 are parametrized by modular curves X,
and these modular curves X include various Shimura modular curves associated
with congruence subgroups of quaternion algebras over Q. In a family of such K3
surfaces, a surface has rho=20 if and only if it corresponds to a CM point on
X. We use this to compute equations for Shimura curves, natural maps between
them, and CM coordinates well beyond what could be done by working with the
curves directly as we did in ``Shimura Curve Computations'' (1998) =
