We present a theory to study the temperature-dependent behavior of surface
states in a ferromagnetic semi-infinite crystal. Our approach is based on the
single-site approximation for the \emph{s-f} model. The effect of the
semi-infinite nature of the crystal is taken into account by a localized
perturbation method. Using the mean-field theory for the layer-dependent
magnetization, the local density of states and the electron-spin polarization
are investigated at different temperatures for ordinary and surface transition
cases. The results show that the surface magnetic properties may differ
strongly from those in the bulk and the coupling constant of atoms plays a
decisive role in the degree of spin polarization. In particular, for the case
in which the exchange coupling constant on the surface and between atoms in the
first and second layer is higher than the corresponding in the bulk, an
enhancement of surface Curie temperature and hence the spin polarization can be
obtained.
