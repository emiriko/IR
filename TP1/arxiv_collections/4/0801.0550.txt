Tensor universality often implies that multi-partite quantum-state processing
is determined by what happens in totally disentangled cases. In independent
systems relative time direction for the parts is arbitrary. This hints that
time may be linked to entanglement and measurements and that there may be a
measurement-only version of quantum mechanics. One-way quantum computation
suggests that this may be possible.
