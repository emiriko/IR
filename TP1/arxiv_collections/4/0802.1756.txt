We report amplification of biomolecular recognition signal in
lithographically defined silicon nanochannel devices. The devices are
configured as field effect transistors (FET) in the reversed source-drain bias
region. The measurement of the differential conductance of the nanowire
channels in the FET allows sensitive detection of changes in the surface
potential due to biomolecular binding. Narrower silicon channels demonstrate
higher sensitivity to binding due to increased surface-to-volume ratio. The
operation of the device in the negative source-drain region demonstrates signal
amplification. The equivalence between protein binding and change in the
surface potential is described.
