We argue that fractional order (FO) differential equations are more suitable
to model complex adaptive systems (CAS). Hence they are applied in replicator
equations for non-cooperative game. Rock-Scissors-Paper game is discussed. It
is known that its integer order model does not have a stable equilibrium. Its
fractional order model is shown to have a locally asymptotically stable
internal solution. A FO asymmetric game is shown to have a locally
asymptotically stable internal solution. This is not the case for its integer
order counterpart.
