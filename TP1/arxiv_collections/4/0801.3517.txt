Microscopic theory of domain wall dynamics under electric current is
reviewed. Domain wall is treated as rigid and planar. The spin-transfer torque
and forces on the wall are derived based on the $s$-$d$ exchange interaction
between localized spins and conduction electrons, treating non-adiabaticity
expressed by the gauge field perturbatively. Effect of spin relaxation is also
studied.
