A phenomenological description for the dynamical spin susceptibility
$\chi({\bf q},\omega;T)$ observed in inelastic neutron scattering measurements
on powder samples of LiV$_2$O$_4$ is developed in terms of the parametrized
self-consistent renormalization (SCR) theory of spin fluctuations. Compatible
with previous studies at $T\to 0$, a peculiar distribution in ${\bf q}$-space
of strongly enhanced and slow spin fluctuations at $q \sim Q_c \simeq$ 0.6
$\AA^{-1}$ in LiV$_2$O$_4$ is involved to derive the mode-mode coupling term
entering the basic equation of the SCR theory. The equation is solved
self-consistently with the parameter values found from a fit of theoretical
results to experimental data. For low temperatures, $T \lesssim 30$K, where the
SCR theory is more reliable, the observed temperature variations of the static
spin susceptibility $\chi(Q_c;T)$ and the relaxation rate $\Gamma_Q(T)$ at
$q\sim Q_c$ are well reproduced by those suggested by the theory. For $T\gtrsim
30$K, the present SCR is capable in predicting only main trends in
$T$-dependences of $\chi(Q_c;T)$ and $\Gamma_Q(T)$.
  The discussion is focused on a marked evolution (from $q \sim Q_c$ at $T\to
0$ towards low $q$ values at higher temperatures) of the dominant low-$\omega$
integrated neutron scattering intensity $I(q; T)$.
