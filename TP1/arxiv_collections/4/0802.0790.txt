In a systematic study we investigate the effect of dopant level and hydration
on the short-range structure of the proton conducting perovskite-type oxide
BaIn_{x}Zr_{1-x}O_{3-x/2} (x = 0-0.75), using infrared and Raman spectroscopy.
The results show that doping leads to significant local distortions of the
average cubic structure of these materials. By increasing the In concentration
from x = 0 to x = 0.75 new bands appear and grow in intensity in both the IR
and Raman spectra, showing that the local distortions become successively more
and more pronounced. The structural distortions are largely uncorrelated to the
presence of oxygen vacancies, but instead are mainly driven by the size
difference between the In^{3+} and Zr^{4+} ions, which leads to displacements
of the cations and to tilting of the (In/Zr)O_{6} octahedra. Based on our
results, we suggest that there is a threshold between x = 0.10 and x = 0.25
where the local structural distortions propagate throughout the whole
perovskite structure. Comparison of our spectroscopic data with the proton
conductivity reported for the same materials indicates that the presence of
extended structural distortions are favorable for fast proton transport.
