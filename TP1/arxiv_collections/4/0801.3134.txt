It has been proposed recently \cite{son} that excitations in Spin Ice can be
of the form of magnetic monopoles that does not obey the Dirac Quantization
Condition. It is also well known \cite{rj} that the above scenario leads to
non-associativity among translation generators. It will be interesting to see
how the monopole picture in Spin Ice survives in the light of the latter
observation.
