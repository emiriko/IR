A natural, non-supersymmetric solution to the hierarchy problem generically
requires fermionic partners of the top quark with masses not much heavier than
500 GeV. We study the pair production and detection at the LHC of the top
partners with electric charge Q=5/3 (T_{5/3}) and Q=-1/3 (B), that are
predicted in models where the Higgs is a pseudo-Goldstone boson. The exotic
T_{5/3} fermion, in particular, is the distinct prediction of a LR custodial
parity invariance of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector. Both kinds of
new fermions decay to Wt, leading to a t\bar{t}WW final state. We focus on the
golden channel with two same-sign leptons, and show that a discovery could come
with less than 100 pb^{-1} (less than 20 fb^{-1}) of integrated luminosity for
masses M=500 GeV (M=1TeV). In the case of the T_{5/3}, we present a simple
strategy for its reconstruction in the fully hadronic decay chain. Although no
full mass reconstruction is possible for the B, we still find that the
same-sign dilepton channel offers the best chances of discovery compared to
other previous searches that used final states with one or two opposite-sign
leptons, and hence suffered from the large t\bar{t} background. Our analysis
also directly applies to the search of 4th generation b' quarks.
