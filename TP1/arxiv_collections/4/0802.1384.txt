We study resonance distributions in a circular dielectric cavity. It is shown
that the decay-rate distribution has a peak structure and the details of the
peak are consistent with the classical survival probability time distribution.
We also investigate the behavior of the complex resonance positions at the
small opening limit. At the large $n$ limit, the real part of complex resonance
positions approaches the solutions with different $m$ of Dirichlet problem with
a scale $n^{-2}$ and the imaginary part goes zero as $n^{-2m}$ for TM and
$n^{-2(m+1)}$ for TE polarization, where $m$ is the order of the resonance.
