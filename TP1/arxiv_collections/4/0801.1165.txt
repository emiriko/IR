A new over-improved stout-link smearing algorithm, designed to stabilise
instanton-like objects, is presented. A method for quantifying the selection of
the over-improvement parameter, $\epsilon$, is demonstrated. The new smearing
algorithm is compared with the original stout-link smearing, and Symanzik
improved smearing through calculations of the topological charge and
visualisations of the topological charge density.
