We consider a pair of artificial atoms with different ground state energies.
By means of finite element calculations we predict that the ground state
energies can be tuned into resonance if the artificial atoms are placed into a
flexible ring structure, which is elastically deformed by an external force.
This concept is experimentally verified by embedding a low density of
self-assembled quantum dots into the wall of a rolled up micro tube ring
resonator. We demonstrate that quantum dots can elastically be tuned in- and
out of resonance with each other or with the ring resonator modes.
