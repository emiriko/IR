The earthquake-like model with a continuous distribution of static thresholds
is used to describe the properties of solid friction. The evolution of the
model is reduced to a master equation which can be solved analytically. This
approach naturally describes stick-slip and smooth sliding regimes of
tribological systems within a framework which separates the calculation of the
friction force from the studies of the properties of the contacts.
