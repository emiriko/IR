We analyze universal conductance fluctuations (UCF) in graphene in the
framework of diagrammatic perturbation theory in the metallic regime. It is
shown that strong inter-valley scattering lifts the valley degeneracy of
electronic states, whereas at weak inter-valley scattering two valleys
contribute independently such that the variance of UCF would be expected to
show sample- and geometry-dependent behavior.
