We present angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy data probing the
electronic structure of the Nd-substituted high-$T_c$ cuprate
La$_{1.48}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.12}$CuO$_4$ (Nd-LSCO). Data have been acquired at
low and high photon energies, $h\nu$ = 55 and 500 eV, respectively. Earlier
comparable low-energy studies of La$_{1.4-x}$Nd$_{0.6}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ ($x =
0.10, 0.12, 0.15$) have shown strongly suppressed photoemission intensity, or
absence thereof, in large parts of the Brillouin zone. Contrary to these
findings we observe spectral weight at all points along the entire Fermi
surface contour at low and high photon energies. No signs of strong charge
modulations are found. At high photon energy, the Fermi surface shows obvious
differences in shape as compared to the low-energy results presented here and
in similar studies. The observed difference in shape and the high
bulk-sensitivity at this photon energy suggest intrinsic electronic structure
differences between the surface and bulk regions.
