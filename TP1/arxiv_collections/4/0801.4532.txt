We deal with the viscous profiles for a class of mixed hyperbolic-parabolic
systems. We focus, in particular, on the case of the compressible Navier Stokes
equation in one space variable written in Eulerian coordinates. We describe the
link between these profiles and a singular ordinary differential equation in
the form $$ dV / dt = F(V) / z (V) . $$ Here $V \in R^d$ and the function F
takes values into $R^d$ and is smooth. The real valued function z is as well
regular: the equation is singular in the sense that z (V) can attain the value
0.
