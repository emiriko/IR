By combining analytic and numerical methods, edge states on a finite width
graphene ribbon in a magnetic field are studied in the framework of low-energy
effective theory that takes into account the possibility of quantum Hall
ferromagnetism (QHF) gaps and dynamically generated Dirac-like masses. The
analysis is done for graphene ribbons with both zigzag and armchair edges. The
characteristic features of the spectrum of the edge states in both these cases
are described. In particular, the conditions for the existence of the gapless
edge states are established. Implications of these results for the
interpretation of recent experiments are discussed.
