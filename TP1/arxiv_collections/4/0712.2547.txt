We demonstrate a quantitative broadband fiber sensor, based on evanescent
field sensing in the cladding holes of an air-suspended solid-core photonic
crystal fiber. We discuss the fabrication process, together with the
structural- and optical characterization of a range of different fibers.
Measured mode profiles are in good agreement with finite element method
calculations made without free parameters. The fraction of the light in the
hollow cladding can be tuned via the core diameter of the fiber. Dispersion
measurements are in excellent agreement with theory and demonstrate tuning of
the zero dispersion wavelength via the core diameter. Optimum design parameters
for absorption sensors are discussed using a general parameter diagram. From
our analysis, we estimate that a sensitivity increase of three orders of
magnitude is feasible compared to standard cuvette measurements. Our study
applies to both liquid and gas fiber sensors. We demonstrate the applicability
of our results to liquid chemical sensing by measuring the broad absorption
peak of an aqueous nickel chloride solution. We find striking agreement with
the reference spectrum measured in a standard cuvette, even though the sample
volume has decreased by three orders of magnitude. Our results demonstrate that
air-suspended solid-core PCFs can be used in quantitative broadband chemical
sensing measurements.
