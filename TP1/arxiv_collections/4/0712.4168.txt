In recent years, the proliferation of mobile computing devices has driven a
revolutionary change in the computing world. The nature of ubiquitous devices
makes wireless networks the easiest solution for their interconnection. This
has led to the rapid growth of several wireless systems like wireless ad hoc
networks, wireless sensor networks etc. In this paper we have proposed a
framework for rural development by providing various e-services to the rural
areas with the help of wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. We have discussed
how timely and accurate information could be collected from the rural areas
using wireless technologies. In addition to this, we have also mentioned the
technical and operational challenges that could hinder the implementation of
such a framework in the rural areas in the developing countries.
