A modified Woods-Saxon potential model is proposed for a unified description
of the entrance channel fusion barrier and the fission barrier of
fusion-fission reactions based on the Skyrme energy-density functional
approach. The fusion excitation functions of 120 reactions have been
systematically studied. The fusion (capture) cross sections are well described
with the calculated potential and an empirical barrier distribution.
Incorporating a statistical model (HIVAP code) for describing the decay of the
compound nucleus, the evaporation residue (and fission) cross sections of 51
fusion-fission reactions have been systematically investigated. Optimal values
of some key parameters of the HIVAP code are obtained based on the experimental
data of these reactions. The experimental data are reasonably well reproduced
by the calculated results. The upper and lower confidence limits of the
systematic errors of the calculated results are given.
