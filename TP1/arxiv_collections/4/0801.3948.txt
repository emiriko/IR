Electric current fluctuations are one type of unavoidable machine
imperfections,and induce magnetic-field perturbations as a source of
instabilities in accelerators. This paper presents measurement-based
methodology of modeling the fluctuating electric current arising from the power
system of Fermilab's Booster synchrotron to discuss the ramifications of the
presence of ripple current and space-charge defocusing effects. We also present
the method of generating stochastic noise and the measurement and analysis
methods of ripple current and offending electromagnetic interferences residing
in the Booster power system. This stochastic noise model, accompanied by a
suite of beam diagnostic calculations, manifests that the fluctuating
power-supply current, when coupled to space charge and impinging upon a beam,
can substantially enhance beam degradation phenomena--such as emittance growth
and halo formation--during the Booster injection period. With idealized and
uniform charge-density distribution, fractional growth of rms emittances due to
ripple current under space charge turn out to be about 8 ~ 9 % in both
transverse planes over the injection period of 2.2 ms prior to beam
acceleration.
