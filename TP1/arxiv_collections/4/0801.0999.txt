Heat generation from electronics increases with the advent of high-density
integrated circuit technology. To come up with the heat generation, microscale
cooling has been thought as a promising technology. Prediction of heat transfer
rate is crucial in design of microscale cooling device but is not clearly
understood yet. This work proposes a new correlation between heat transfer rate
and Brinkman number which is nondimensional number of viscosity, flow velocity
and temperature. It is expected that the equation proposed by this work can be
useful to design microchannel cooling device.
