The influence of He-3 nuclear magnetization relaxation on the second
viscosity in quantum solutions subjected to an external oscillating magnetic
field is studied. The cases of first-, second- and forth-sound waves are
examined. The expressions for the second viscosity coefficients are derived and
the conditions for the viscosity to be decreased are analyzed.
