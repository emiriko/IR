When two vortices cross, each of them breaks into two parts and exchanges
part of itself for part of the other. This process, called vortex reconnection,
occurs in classical as well as superfluids, and in magnetized plasmas and
superconductors. We present the first experimental observations of reconnection
between quantized vortices in superfluid helium. We do so by imaging
micron-sized solid hydrogen particles trapped on quantized vortex cores (Bewley
GP, Lathrop DP, Sreenivasan KR, 2006, Nature, 441:588), and by inferring the
occurrence of reconnection from the motions of groups of recoiling particles.
We show the distance separating particles on the just-reconnected vortex lines
grows as a power law in time. The average value of the scaling exponent is
approximately 1/2, consistent with the scale-invariant evolution of the
vortices.
