The longitudinal and transverse resistivities of differently strained
(Ga,Mn)As layers are theoretically and experimentally studied as a function of
the magnetization orientation. The strain in the series of (Ga,Mn)As layers is
gradually varied from compressive to tensile using (In,Ga)As templates with
different In concentrations. Analytical expressions for the resistivities are
derived from a series expansion of the resistivity tensor with respect to the
direction cosines of the magnetization. In order to quantitatively model the
experimental data, terms up to the fourth order have to be included. The
expressions derived are generally valid for any single-crystalline cubic and
tetragonal ferromagnet and apply to arbitrary surface orientations and current
directions. The model phenomenologically incorporates the longitudinal and
transverse anisotropic magnetoresistance as well as the anomalous Hall effect.
The resistivity parameters obtained from a comparison between experiment and
theory are found to systematically vary with the strain in the layer.
