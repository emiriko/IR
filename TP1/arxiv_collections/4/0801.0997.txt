This paper describes a novel integrated circuit technology to manufacture
high-density thermoelectric devices on a semiconductor wafer. With no moving
parts, a thermoelectric cooler operates quietly, allows cooling below ambient
temperature, and may be used for temperature control or heating if the
direction of current flow is reversed. By using a monolithic process to
increase the number of thermoelectric couples, the proposed solid-state cooling
technology can be combined with traditional air cooling, liquid cooling, and
phase-change cooling to yield greater heat flux and provide better cooling
capability.
