We address the viability of exact Yukawa unification in the context of
general SUSY GUTs with universal soft-breaking sfermion and gaugino mass terms
at the GUT scale. We find that this possibility is challenged, unless the
squark spectrum is pushed well above the limits allowed by naturalness. This
conclusion is assessed through a global fit using electroweak observables and
quark flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes. The problem is mostly
the impossibility of accommodating simultaneously the bottom mass and the BR(B
--> Xs gamma), after the stringent CDF upper bound on the decay Bs --> mu^+
mu^- is taken into account, and under the basic assumption that the b --> s
gamma amplitude have like sign with respect to the Standard Model one, as
indicated by the B --> Xs l^+ l^- data.
  With the same strategy, we also consider the possibility of relaxing Yukawa
unification to b - tau Yukawa unification. We find that with small departures
from the condition tan beta ~= 50, holding when Yukawa unification is exact,
the mentioned tension is substantially relieved. We emphasize that in the
region where fits are successful the lightest part of the SUSY spectrum is
basically fixed by the requirements of b - tau unification and the applied FCNC
constraints. As such, it is easily falsifiable once the LHC turns on.
