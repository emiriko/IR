If the next fundamental level of matter occurs (preons) then dark matter must
consist of familons containing a "hot" component from massless particles and a
"cold" component from massive particles. During evolution of the Universe this
dark matter was undergone to late-time relativistic phase transitions
temperatures of which were different. Fluctuations created by these phase
transitions have had a fractal character. In the result the structurization of
dark matter (and therefore the baryon subsystem) has taken place and in the
Universe some characteristic scales which have printed this phenomenon arise
naturally. Familons are collective excitations of nonperturbative preon
condensates which could be produced during more early relativistic phase
transition. For structurization of dark matter (and baryon component) three
generations of particles are necessary. The first generation of particles has
produced the observed baryon world. The second and third generations have
produced dark matter from particles which have appeared when symmetry among
generations was spontaneously broken.
