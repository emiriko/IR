We show that the defining relations needed to describe a generalized q-Schur
algebra as a quotient of a quantized enveloping algebra are determined
completely by the defining ideal of a certain finite affine variety, the points
of which correspond bijectively to the set of weights. This explains, unifies,
and extends previous results.
