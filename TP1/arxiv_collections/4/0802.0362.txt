We experimentally investigate the properties of radio-frequency-dressed
potentials for Bose-Einstein condensates on atom chips. The three-dimensional
potential forms a connected pair of parallel waveguides. We show that
rf-dressed potentials are robust against the effect of small magnetic-field
variations on the trap potential. Long-lived dipole oscillations of condensates
induced in the rf-dressed potentials can be tuned to a remarkably low damping
rate. We study a beam-splitter for Bose-Einstein condensates and show that a
propagating condensate can be dynamically split in two vertically separated
parts and guided along two paths. The effect of gravity on the potential can be
tuned and compensated for using a rf-field gradient.
