We introduce an interaction mechanism between oscillators leading to exact
anti-phase and in-phase synchronization. This mechanism is applied to the
coupling between two nonlinear oscillators with a limit cycle in phase space,
leading to a simple justification of the anti-phase synchronization observed in
the Huygens's pendulum clocks experiment. If the two coupled nonlinear
oscillators reach the anti-phase or the in-phase synchronized oscillatory
state, the period of oscillation is different from the eigen-periods of the
uncoupled oscillators.
