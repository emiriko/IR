We give counterexamples and a few positive results related to several
conjectures of R. Pemantle and D. Wagner concerning negative correlation and
log-concavity properties for probability measures and relations between them.
Most of the negative results have also been obtained, independently but
somewhat earlier, by Borcea et al. We also give short proofs of a pair of
results due to Pemantle and Borcea et al.; prove that "almost exchangeable"
measures satisfy the "Feder-Mihail" property, thus providing a "non-obvious"
example of a class of measures for which this important property can be shown
to hold; and mention some further questions.
