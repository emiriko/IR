The changes of defect characteristics induced by accelerated lifetime tests
on the heterostructure n-ZnO/i-ZnO/CdS/Cu(In, Ga)(S, Se)$_2$/Mo relevant for
photovoltaic energy conversion are investigated. We subject heterojunction and
Schottky devices to extended damp heat exposure at 85$^{\circ}$C ambient
temperature and 85% relative humidity for various time periods. In order to
understand the origin of the pronounced changes of the devices, we apply
current--voltage and capacitance--voltage measurements, admittance
spectroscopy, and deep-level transient spectroscopy. The fill factor and
open-circuit voltage of test devices are reduced after prolonged damp heat
treatment, leading to a reduced energy conversion efficiency. We observe the
presence of defect states in the vicinity of the CdS/chalcopyrite interface.
Their activation energy increases due to damp heat exposure, indicating a
reduced band bending at the Cu(In, Ga)(S, Se)$_2$ surface. The Fermi-level
pinning at the buffer/chalcopyrite interface, maintaining a high band bending
in as-grown cells, is lifted due to the damp-heat exposure. We also observe
changes in the bulk defect spectra due to the damp-heat treatment.
