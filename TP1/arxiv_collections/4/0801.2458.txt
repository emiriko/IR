A non-linear model associated with a Landau-Ginzburg-like behavior in mean
field approximation forecasts phase transition waves and solitary kinks near
the critical point. The behavior of isothermal waves is different of the one of
isentropic waves as well in conservative cases as in dissipative cases.
