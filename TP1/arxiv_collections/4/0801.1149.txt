In order to trace the initial interaction in ultra-relativistic heavy ion
collision in all azimuthal directions, two azimuthal multiplicity-correlation
patterns -- neighboring and fixed-to-arbitrary angular-bin correlation patterns
-- are suggested. From the simulation of Au + Au collisions at 200 GeV by using
the Monte Carlo models RQMD with hadron re-scattering and AMPT with and without
string melting, we observe that the correlation patterns change gradually from
out-of-plane preferential one to in-plane preferential one when the centrality
of collision shifts from central to peripheral, meanwhile the anisotropic
collective flow v_2 keeps positive in all cases. This regularity is found to be
model and collision energy independent. The physics behind the two opposite
trends of correlation patterns, in particular, the presence of out-of-plane
correlation patterns at RHIC energy, are discussed.
