Giving three examples, the form factors of the nucleon, the polarisability of
the charged pion and the interference of the $S_{11}(1535)$ with the
$D_{13}(1520)$ excitation of the nucleon in the $\eta p$-decay channel, it is
argued that the hadron structure at low momentum transfer is highly significant
for studying QCD.
