Many complex systems can be modeled as multiagent systems in which the
constituent entities (agents) interact with each other. The global dynamics of
such a system is determined by the nature of the local interactions among the
agents. Since it is difficult to formally analyze complex multiagent systems,
they are often studied through computer simulations. While computer simulations
can be very useful, results obtained through simulations do not formally
validate the observed behavior. Thus, there is a need for a mathematical
framework which one can use to represent multiagent systems and formally
establish their properties. This work contains a brief exposition of some known
mathematical frameworks that can model multiagent systems. The focus is on one
such framework, namely that of finite dynamical systems. Both, deterministic
and stochastic versions of this framework are discussed. The paper contains a
sampling of the mathematical results from the literature to show how finite
dynamical systems can be used to carry out a rigorous study of the properties
of multiagent systems and it is shown how the framework can also serve as a
universal model for computation.
