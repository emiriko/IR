Effects of resonant acoustic phonon scattering on magnetoresistivity are
examined in two-dimensional electron systems at low temperatures by using a
balance-equation magnetotransport scheme direct controlled by the current. The
experimentally observed resonances in linear resistivity are shown to result
from the conventional bulk phonon modes in a GaAs-based system, without
invoking leaky interface phonons. Due to quick heating of electrons, phonon
resonances can be dramatically enhanced by a finite bias current. When the
electron drift velocity increases to the speed of sound, additional and
prominent phonon resonance peaks begin to emerge. As a result, remarkable
resistance oscillation and negative differential resistivity can appear in
nonlinear transport in a modest mobility sample at low temperatures, which is
in agreement with recent experiments.
