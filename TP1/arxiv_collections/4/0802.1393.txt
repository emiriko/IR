We proposed in previous papers an extension and an implementation of the
STROBE model, which regards the Agents as Scheme interpreters. These Agents are
able to interpret messages in a dedicated environment including an interpreter
that learns from the current conversation therefore representing evolving
meta-level Agent's knowledge. When the Agent's interpreter is a
nondeterministic one, the dialogues may consist of subsequent refinements of
specifications in the form of constraint sets. The paper presents a worked out
example of dynamic service generation - such as necessary on Grids - by
exploiting STROBE Agents equipped with a nondeterministic interpreter. It shows
how enabling dynamic specification of a problem. Then it illustrates how these
principles could be effective for other applications. Details of the
implementation are not provided here, but are available.
