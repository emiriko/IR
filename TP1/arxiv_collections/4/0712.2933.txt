We propose an extension of the standard model, in which neutrinos are Dirac
particles and their tiny masses originate from a one-loop radiative diagram.
The new fields required by the neutrino mass-generation also accommodate the
explanation for the matter-antimatter asymmetry and dark matter in the
universe.
