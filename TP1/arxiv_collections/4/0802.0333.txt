We study the birefringence of the quantized polarized light in a
magneto-optically manipulated atomic ensemble as a generalized Stern-Gerlach
Effect of light. To explain this engineered birefringence microscopically, we
derive an effective Shr\"odinger equation for the spatial motion of two
orthogonally polarized components, which behave as a spin with an effective
magnetic moment leading to a Stern-Gerlach split in an nonuniform magnetic
field. We show that electromagnetic induced transparency (EIT) mechanism can
enhance the magneto-optical Stern-Gerlach effect of light in the presence of a
control field with a transverse spatial profile and a inhomogeneous magnetic
field.
