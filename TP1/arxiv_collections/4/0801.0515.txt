We present novel low-T_c superconductor-insulator-ferromagnet-superconductor
(SIFS) Josephson junctions with planar and stepped ferromagnetic interlayer. We
optimized the fabrication process to set a step in the ferromagnetic layer
thickness. Depending on the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer the ground
state of the SIFS junction has a phase drop of either 0 or pi. So-called 0-pi
Josephson junctions, in which 0 and pi ground states compete with each other,
were obtained. These stepped junctions may have a double degenerate ground
state, corresponding to a vortex of supercurrent circulating clock- or
counterclockwise and creating a magnetic flux which carries a fraction of the
magnetic flux quantum \Phi_0. Here, we limit the presentation to static
properties of short junctions.
