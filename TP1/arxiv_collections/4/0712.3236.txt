Compact binaries inspiralling along quasi-circular orbits are the most
plausible gravitational wave (GW) sources for the operational, planned and
proposed laser interferometers. We provide new class of restricted
post-Newtonian accurate GW templates for non-spinning compact binaries
inspiralling along PN accurate quasi-circular orbits. Arguments based on data
analysis, theoretical and astrophysical considerations are invoked to show why
these time-domain Taylor approximants should be interesting to various GW data
analysis communities.
