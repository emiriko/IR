Microscopic mechanisms of positive charge transfer in DNA remain unclear. A
quantum state of electron hole in DNA is determined by the competition of a
pi-stacking interaction $b$ smearing a charge between different base pairs and
interaction $\lambda$ with the local environment which attempts to trap charge.
To determine which interaction dominates we investigated charge quantum states
in various $(GC)_{n}$ sequences choosing DNA parameters satisfying experimental
data for the balance of charge transfer rates $G^{+} \leftrightarrow
G_{n}^{+}$, $n=2,3$ \cite{FredMain}. We show that experimental data can be
consistent with theory only under an assumption $b\ll \lambda$ meaning that
charge is typically localized within a single $G$ site. Consequently any DNA
sequence including the one consisting of identical base pairs behaves more like
an insulating material than a molecular conductor.
