The unparticle field operator can be expanded in terms of creation and
destruction operators corresponding to particles with a continuous mass
spectrum. Hence, when the 4-momentum of an unparticle is measured, then the
unparticle manifests as an ordinary particle with a definite (but arbitrary)
mass.
