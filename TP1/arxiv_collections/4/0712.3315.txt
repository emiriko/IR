We study thermodynamics of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole in five
dimensions by introducing two temperatures based on the standard and
Bousso-Hawking normalizations. We use the first-law of thermodynamics to derive
thermodynamic quantities. The two temperatures indicate that the Nariai black
hole is thermodynamically unstable. However, it seems that black hole
thermodynamics favors the standard normalization, and does not favor the
Bousso-Hawking normalization.
