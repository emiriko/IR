This paper introduces a procedure based on genetic programming to evolve XSLT
programs (usually called stylesheets or logicsheets). XSLT is a general
purpose, document-oriented functional language, generally used to transform XML
documents (or, in general, solve any problem that can be coded as an XML
document). The proposed solution uses a tree representation for the stylesheets
as well as diverse specific operators in order to obtain, in the studied cases
and a reasonable time, a XSLT stylesheet that performs the transformation.
Several types of representation have been compared, resulting in different
performance and degree of success.
