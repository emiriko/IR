Different relativistic quantum mechanics approaches have recently been used
to calculate properties of various systems, form factors in particular. It is
known that predictions, which most often rely on a single-particle current
approximation, can lead to predictions with a very large range. It was shown
that accounting for constraints related to space-time translations could
considerably reduce this range. It is shown here that predictions can be made
identical for a large range of cases. These ones include the following
approaches: instant form, front form, and "point-form" in arbitrary momentum
configurations and a dispersion-relation approach which can be considered as
the approach which the other ones should converge to. This important result
supposes both an implementation of the above constraints and an appropriate
single-particle-like current. The change of variables that allows one to
establish the equivalence of the approaches is given. Some points are
illustrated with numerical results for the ground state of a system consisting
of scalar particles.
