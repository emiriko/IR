We consider a simple-model population, whose individuals react with a certain
delay to temporal variations of their habitat. We investigate the impact of
such a delayed-answer on the survival chances of the population, both in a
periodically changing environment, and in the case of an abrupt change of it.
It is found that for population with low degree of mutation-induced
variability, being "slow-reacting" decreases the extinction risk face to
environmental changes. On the contrary, for populations with high mutation
amplitude, the delayed reaction reduces the survival chances.
