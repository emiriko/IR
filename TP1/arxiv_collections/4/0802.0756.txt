The paper deals with the interaction between buckling and resonance
instabilities of mechanical systems. Taking into account the effect of
geometric nonlinearity in the equations of motion through the geometric
stiffness matrix, the problem is reduced to a generalized eigenproblem where
both the loading multiplier and the natural frequency of the system are
unknown. According to this approach, all the forms of instabilities
intermediate between those of pure buckling and pure forced resonance can be
investigated. Numerous examples are analyzed, including: discrete mechanical
systems with one to n degrees of freedom, continuous mechanical systems such as
oscillating deflected beams subjected to a compressive axial load, as well as
oscillating beams subjected to lateral-torsional buckling. A general finite
element procedure is also outlined, with the possibility to apply the proposed
approach to any general bi- or tri-dimensional framed structure. The proposed
results provide a new insight in the interpretation of coupled phenomena such
as flutter instability of long-span or high-rise structures.
