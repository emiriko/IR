The paper contains a brief review of recent results on hidden symmetries in
higher dimensional black hole spacetimes. We show how the existence of a
principal CKY tensor (that is a closed non-degenerate conformal Killing-Yano
2-form) allows one to generate a `tower' of Killing-Yano and Killing tensors
responcible for hidden symmetries. These symmetries imply complete
integrability of geodesic equations and the complete separation of variables in
the Hamilton-Jacobi, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations in the general
Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metrics.
