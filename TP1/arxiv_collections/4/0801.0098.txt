This paper reports the first study carried out by surface-enhanced Raman
spectroscopy (SERS) during the galvanostatic electrodeposition (ECD) of copper
from an acidic sulphate solution, in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG),
bis-(3-sulfopropyl)-disulfide Na salt (SPS), benzyl-phenyl modified
polyethyleneimine (BPPEI) and chloride ions. The analysis of SERS spectra
recorded during electrodeposition allowed to get an insight into the complex
interfacial behaviour of the organic blend, in terms of co-adsorption and
reactivity. At open-circuit (OC), the additives co-adsorb on the copper
cathode. Upon increasing the cathodic polarization, progressive SPS-scavenging
action of PEG was observed. BPPEI is adsorbed in the entire process window and
cathodic reaction products of PEG were identified. The joint action of the
organic additives yields a continuous deposit with crystallites of submicron
dimensions, as revealed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).
