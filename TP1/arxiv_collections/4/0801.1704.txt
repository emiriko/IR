We investigate the equivalence of bipartite quantum mixed states under local
unitary transformations by introducing representation classes from a
geometrical approach. It is shown that two bipartite mixed states are
equivalent under local unitary transformations if and only if they have the
same representation class. Detailed examples are given on calculating
representation classes.
