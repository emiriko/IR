A wildland fire model based on semi-empirical relations for the spread rate
of a surface fire and post-frontal heat release is coupled with the Weather
Research and Forecasting atmospheric model (WRF). The propagation of the fire
front is implemented by a level set method. Data is assimilated by a morphing
ensemble Kalman filter, which provides amplitude as well as position
corrections. Thermal images of a fire will provide the observations and will be
compared to a synthetic image from the model state.
