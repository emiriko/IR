We demonstrate that necklace-shaped arrays of localized spatial beams can
merge into stable fundamental or vortex solitons in a generic model of laser
cavities, based on the two-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with
the cubic-quintic nonlinearity. The outcome of the fusion is controlled by the
number of beads in the initial necklace, 2N, and its topological charge, M. We
predict and confirm by systematic simulations that the vorticity of the
emerging soliton is the absolute value of difference of N and M. Threshold
characteristics of the fusion are found and explained too. If the initial
radius of the array (R0) is too large, it simply keeps the necklace shape (if
R0 is somewhat smaller, the necklace features a partial fusion), while, if R0
is too small, the array disappears.
