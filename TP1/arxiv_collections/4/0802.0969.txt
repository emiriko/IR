The present study aimed at investigating the effects of an artificial head
position-based tongue-placed electrotactile biofeedback on postural control
during quiet standing under different somatosensory conditions from the support
surface. Eight young healthy adults were asked to stand as immobile as possible
with their eyes closed on two Firm and Foam support surface conditions executed
in two conditions of No-biofeedback and Biofeedback. In the Foam condition, a
6-cm thick foam support surface was placed under the subjects' feet to alter
the quality and/or quantity of somatosensory information at the plantar sole
and the ankle. The underlying principle of the biofeedback consisted of
providing supplementary information about the head orientation with respect to
gravitational vertical through electrical stimulation of the tongue. Centre of
foot pressure (CoP) displacements were recorded using a force platform. Larger
CoP displacements were observed in the Foam than Firm conditions in the two
conditions of No-biofeedback and Biofeedback. Interestingly, this destabilizing
effect was less accentuated in the Biofeedback than No-biofeedback condition.
In accordance with the sensory re-weighting hypothesis for balance control, the
present findings evidence that the availability of the central nervous system
to integrate an artificial head orientation information delivered through
electrical stimulation of the tongue to limit the postural perturbation induced
by alteration of somatosensory input from the support surface.
