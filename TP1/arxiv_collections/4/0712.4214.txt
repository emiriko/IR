Assuming minimal regularity assumptions on the data, we revisit the classical
problem of finding isometric immersions into the Minkowski spacetime for
hypersurfaces of a Lorentzian manifold. Our approach encompasses metrics having
Sobolev regularity and Riemann curvature defined in the distributional sense,
only. It applies to timelike, spacelike, or null hypersurfaces with arbitrary
signature that possibly changes from point to point.
