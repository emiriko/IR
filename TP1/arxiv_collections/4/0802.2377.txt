The influence of higher-order wavelet properties on the analytic wavelet
transform behavior is investigated, and wavelet functions offering advantageous
performance are identified. This is accomplished through detailed investigation
of the generalized Morse wavelets, a two-parameter family of exactly analytic
continuous wavelets. The degree of time/frequency localization, the existence
of a mapping between scale and frequency, and the bias involved in estimating
properties of modulated oscillatory signals, are proposed as important
considerations. Wavelet behavior is found to be strongly impacted by the degree
of asymmetry of the wavelet in both the frequency and the time domain, as
quantified by the third central moments. A particular subset of the generalized
Morse wavelets, recognized as deriving from an inhomogeneous Airy function,
emerge as having particularly desirable properties. These "Airy wavelets"
substantially outperform the only approximately analytic Morlet wavelets for
high time localization. Special cases of the generalized Morse wavelets are
examined, revealing a broad range of behaviors which can be matched to the
characteristics of a signal.
