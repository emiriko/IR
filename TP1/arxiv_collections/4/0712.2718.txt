A new technique for improving the precision of measurements of SUSY particle
masses at the LHC is introduced. The technique involves kinematic fitting of
events with two fully identified decay chains. We incorporate both event ETmiss
constraints and independent constraints provided by kinematic end-points in
experiment invariant mass distributions of SUSY decay products. Incorporation
of the event specific information maximises the information used in the fit and
is shown to reduce the mass measurement uncertainites by ~30% compared to
conventional fitting of experiment end-point constraints for the SPS1a
benchmark model.
