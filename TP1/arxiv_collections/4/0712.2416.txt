The effect of conducting pipes on the equilibrium of intense nonaxisymmetric
continuous beams of charged particles is investigated. For a cylindrical pipe
and an elliptical beam, we obtain an exact closed form analytical expression
for the electrostatic potential. Using a variational principle, we then explore
the distortions that equilibrium beams suffer due to the conducting channel.
Finally, we present an exact proof that despite the nonlinear forces acting on
beams of arbitrary cross section inside conducting pipes of arbitrary shape,
the density of these beams remains homogeneous and their cross sectional area
remains the sa me as the one in free-space.
