Superconductivity is studied for a fermionic system with attractive four-body
interaction. Applying a Green function approach, the gap equation is derived.
  From the solution, the transition temperature is calculated. Under the
condition that the respective coupling constants are comparable, the transition
temperature of four-fermion complexes is considerably larger than the
corresponding BCS value.
