The paper is devoted to fundamental problems of the Wheeler - DeWitt quantum
geometrodynamics, which was the first attempt to apply quantum principles to
the Universe as a whole. Our purpose is to find out the origin of these
problems and follow up their consequences. We start from Dirac generalized
Hamiltonian dynamics as a cornerstone on which the Wheeler - DeWitt theory is
based. We remind the main statements of the famous DeWitt's paper of 1967 and
discuss the flaws of the theory: the well-known problem of time, the problem of
Hilbert space and others. In the concluding part of the paper we consider new
tendencies and approaches to quantum geometrodynamics appeared in the last
decade.
