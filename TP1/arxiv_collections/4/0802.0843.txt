Group formation is important in many economic contexts. The current
literature on group formation assumes that individuals may join any existing
group. In this paper, I consider the implications of social, geographic, and
informational constraints to group membership decisions. I embed the players in
a network of relationships, which constrains their choice of groups--they may
only join a group if that group contains a member that they are connected to on
the network. I then examine how this network constraint affects the equilibrium
group structure. I show that even with complete information, unconstrained
individuals form groups that are inefficiently large. When individuals are
constrained, the resulting group structures are much closer to the socially
optimal group structure, because the constraint limits the ability of the
individual to free ride on the efforts of other group members. The efficiency
of the outcome is related to the structure of the network constraint--outcomes
are more efficient when networks are sparse and have few random connections.
