The over-passing probability across an inverted parabolic potential barrier
is investigated according to the classical and quantal generalized Langevin
equations. It is shown that, in the classical case, the asymptotic value of the
over-passing probability is determined by a single dominant root of the
"characteristic function", and it is given by a simple expression. The
expression for the over-passing probability is quite general, and details of
dissipation mechanism and memory effects enter into the expression only through
the dominant root of the characteristic equation.
