It is well-known that the original lattice Boltzmann (LB) equation deviates
from the Navier-Stokes equations due to an unphysical velocity dependent
viscosity. This unphysical dependency violates the Galilean invariance and
limits the validation domain of the LB method to near incompressible flows. As
previously shown, recovery of correct transport phenomena in kinetic equations
depends on the higher hydrodynamic moments. In this Letter, we give specific
criteria for recovery of various transport coefficients. The Galilean
invariance of a general class of LB models is demonstrated via numerical
experiments.
