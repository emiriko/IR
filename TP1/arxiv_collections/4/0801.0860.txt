We report that the power driving gravity and capillary wave turbulence in a
statistically stationary regime displays fluctuations much stronger than its
mean value. We show that its probability density function (PDF) has a most
probable value close to zero and involves two asymmetric roughly exponential
tails. We understand the qualitative features of the PDF using a simple
Langevin type model.
