We provide the analysis of charmless two-body $B\to VP$ decays under the
framework of the soft-collinear-effective-theory (SCET), where $V(P)$ denotes a
light vector (pseudoscalar) meson. Besides the leading power contributions,
some power corrections (chiraly enhanced penguins) are also taken into account.
Using the current available $B\to PP$ and $B\to VP$ experimental data on
branching fractions and CP asymmetry variables, we find two kinds of solutions
in $\chi^2$ fit for the 16 non-perturbative inputs which are essential in the
87 $B\to PP$ and $B\to VP$ decay channels. Chiraly enhanced penguins can change
several charming penguins sizably, since they share the same topology. However,
most of the other non-perturbative inputs and predictions on branching ratios
and CP asymmetries are not changed too much. With the two sets of inputs, we
predict the branching fractions and CP asymmetries of other modes especially
$B_s\to VP$ decays. The agreements and differences with results in QCD
factorization and perturbative QCD approach are analyzed. We also study the
time-dependent CP asymmetries in channels with CP eigenstates in the final
states and some other channels such as $\bar B^0/B^0\to\pi^\pm\rho^\mp$ and
$\bar B_s^0/B_s^0\to K^\pm K^{*\mp}$. In the perturbative QCD approach, the
$(S-P)(S+P)$ penguins in annihilation diagrams play an important role. Although
they have the same topology with charming penguins in SCET, there are many
differences between the two objects in weak phases, magnitudes, strong phases
and factorization properties.
