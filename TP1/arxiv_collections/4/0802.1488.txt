The norm game described by Axelrod in 1985 was recently treated with the
master equation formalism. Here we discuss the equations, where {\it i)} those
who break the norm cannot punish and those who punish cannot break the norm,
{\it ii)} the tendency to punish is suppressed if the majority breaks the norm.
The second mechanism is new. For some values of the parameters the solution
shows the saddle-point bifurcation. Then, two stable solutions are possible,
where the majority breaks the norm or the majority punishes. This means, that
the norm breaking can be discontinuous, when measured in the social scale. The
bistable character is reproduced also with new computer simulations on the
Erd{\H o}s--R\'enyi directed network.
