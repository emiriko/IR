The nuclear gross theory, originally formulated by Takahashi and Yamada for
the $\beta$-decays, is applied for the electronic-neutrino nucleus reactions,
employing a more realistic description to the energetics of the Gamow-Teller
resonances. The model parameters are gauged from the most recent experimental
data, both for $\beta^-$ decay and electron-capture, separately for even-even,
even-odd, odd-odd, odd-even nuclei. The numerical estimates for
neutrino-nucleus cross sections agree fairly well with previous evaluations
done within the framework of microscopic models. The formalism presented here
can be extended to the heavy nuclei mass region, where weak processes are quite
relevant, which is of astrophysical interest because of its applications in
supernova explosive nucleosynthesis.
