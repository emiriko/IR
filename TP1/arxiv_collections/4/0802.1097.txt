We theoretically studied the in-plane tunneling spectroscopy of the hybrid
structure composed of a metal and a semiconductor with Rashba spin-orbit
coupling. We found that the energy spacing between two distinct features in the
conductance spectrum can be used to measure the Rashba energy of the
semiconductor. We also considered the effect that varying the probability of
spin-conserving and spin-flip scattering at the interface has on the overall
conductance. Surprisingly, an increase in interface scattering probability can
actually result in increased conductance under certain conditions.
Particularly, in the tunneling regime, an increase in spin-flip scattering
probability enhances the conductance. It is also found that the interfacial
scattering greatly affects the spin polarization of the conductance in metal,
but hardly affects that in the semiconductor.
