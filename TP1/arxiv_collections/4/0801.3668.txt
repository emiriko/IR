We study magnetic properties of the extended periodic Anderson model, which
includes electron correlations within and between itinerant and localized
bands. By combining dynamical mean-field theory with the numerical
renormalization group we calculate the sublattice magnetization and the
staggered susceptibility to determine the phase diagram in the particle-hole
symmetric case. We find that two kinds of magnetically ordered states compete
with the Kondo insulating state at zero temperature, which induces
non-monotonic behavior in the temperature-dependent magnetization. It is
furthermore clarified that a novel magnetic metallic state is stabilized at
half filling by the competition between Hund's coupling and the hybridization.
