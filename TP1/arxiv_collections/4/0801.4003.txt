A novel proton imaging technique was applied which allows a continuous
temporal record of electric fields within a time window of several nanoseconds.
This "proton streak deflectometry" was used to investigate transient electric
fields of intense (~ 10^17 W/cm^2) laser irradiated foils. We found out that
these fields with an absolute peak of up to 10^8 V/m extend over millimeter
lateral extension and decay at nanosecond duration. Hence, they last much
longer than the (~ ps) laser excitation, and extend much beyond the laser
irradiation focus.
