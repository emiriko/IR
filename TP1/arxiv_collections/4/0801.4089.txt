The paper uses geometrical arguments to derive equations with relevance for
cosmology; 5-dimensional spacetime is assumed because it has been shown in
other works to provide a setting for significant unification of different areas
of physics. Monogenic functions, which zero the vector derivative are shown to
effectively model electrodynamics and relativistic dynamics if one allows for
space curvature. Applying monogenic functions to flat space, the Hubble
relation can be derived straightforwardly as a purely geometrical effect.
Consideration of space curvature induced by mass density allows the derivation
of flat rotation curves for galaxies without appealing for dark matter.
Similarly, a small overall mass density in the Universe is shown to provide a
possible explanation for recent supernovae observations, without the need for a
cosmological constant.
