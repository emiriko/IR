The scalar-isoscalar term in the two-pion exchange $NN$ potential is
abnormally large and does not respect the hierarchy of effects predicted by
chiral perturbation theory. We argue that this anomaly is associated with
non-perturbative effects, which are also present in the $\pi N$ scalar form
factor.
