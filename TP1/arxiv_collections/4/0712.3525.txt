We report about on-going simulations of $N_f=2+1$ lattice QCD. We use a
tadpole improved Symanzik gauge action and stout link smeared Wilson fermions
with a clover term. We employ the Hasenbusch trick for the degenerate u- and
d-quarks, and the RHMC algorithm for the simulation of the strange quark.
