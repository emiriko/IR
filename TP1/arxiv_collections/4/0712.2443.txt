The model of spatial permutations is related to the Feynman-Kac
representation of the Bose gas. The transition to infinite cycles corresponds
to Bose-Einstein condensation. We review the general setting and some results,
and we derive a multi-body interaction between permutation jumps, that is due
to the original interactions between quantum particles.
