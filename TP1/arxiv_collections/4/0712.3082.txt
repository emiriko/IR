This article presents a phenomenological dynamic phase transition theory for
ferromagnetism, leading to a precise description of the dynamic transitions,
and to a physical predication on the spontaneous magnetization. The analysis
also suggests asymmetry of fluctuations in both the ferromagnetism and the PVT
systems.
