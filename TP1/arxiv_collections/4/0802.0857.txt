Laser cooling on weak transitions is a useful technique for reaching
ultracold temperatures in atoms with multiple valence electrons. However, for
strongly magnetic atoms a conventional narrow-line magneto-optical trap (MOT)
is destabilized by competition between optical and magnetic forces. We overcome
this difficulty in Er by developing an unusual narrow-line MOT that balances
optical and magnetic forces using laser light tuned to the blue side of a
narrow (8 kHz) transition. The trap population is spin-polarized with
temperatures reaching below 2 microkelvin. Our results constitute an
alternative method for laser cooling on weak transitions, applicable to
rare-earth-metal and metastable alkaline earth elements.
