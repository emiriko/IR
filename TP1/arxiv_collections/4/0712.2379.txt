Nonperturbative and lattice methods indicate that Gribov copies modify the
infrared behavior of gauge theories and cause a suppression of gluon
propagation. We investigate whether this can be implemented in a modified
perturbation theory. The minimal modification proceeds via a nonlocal
generalization of the Fadeev-Popov ghost that automatically decouples from
physical states. The expected scale invariance of the physics associated with
Gribov copies leads to the emergence of a nontrivial infrared fixed point. For
a range of a scaling exponent the gauge bosons exhibit unparticlelike behavior
in the infrared. The confining regime of interest for QCD requires a larger
scaling exponent, but then the severity of ghost dominance upsets naive power
counting for the infrared scaling behavior of amplitudes.
