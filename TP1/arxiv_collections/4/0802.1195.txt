An effective algorithm is presented for solving the Beltrami equation fzbar =
mu fz in a planar disk. The algorithm involves no evaluation of singular
integrals. The strategy, working in concentric rings, is to construct a
piecewise linear mu-conformal mapping and then correct the image using a known
algorithm for conformal mappings. Numerical examples are provided and the
computational complexity is analyzed.
