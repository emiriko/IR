In this Thesis I present a double slit experiment where two undistinguishable
photons produced by type I PDC are sent each to a well defined slit. Data about
the diffraction and interference patterns for coincidences are presented and
discussed. An analysis of these data allows a first test of standard quantum
mechanics against de Broglie-Bohm theory.
