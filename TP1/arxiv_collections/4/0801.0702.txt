We present a detailed analysis of the convergence properties of Lyapunov
control for finite-dimensional quantum systems based on the application of the
LaSalle invariance principle and stability analysis from dynamical systems and
control theory. For a certain class of ideal Hamiltonians, convergence results
are derived both pure-state and mixed-state control, and the effectiveness of
the method for more realistic Hamiltonians is discussed.
