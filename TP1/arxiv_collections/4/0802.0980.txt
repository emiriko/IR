We have used the latest data from the ALEPH Collaboration to extract values
for QCD condensates up to dimension d=12 in the V-A channel and up to dimension
d=8 in the V, A and V+A channels. Performing 2- and 3-parameter fits, we obtain
new results for the correlations of condensates. The results are consistent
among themselves and agree with most of the previous results found in the
literature.
