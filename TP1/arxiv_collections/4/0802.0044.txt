We construct the type IIA nonsupersymmetric meta-stable brane configuration
consisting of (2k+1) NS5-branes and D4-branes where the electric gauge theory
superpotential has an order (2k+2) polynomial for the bifundamentals. We find a
rich pattern of nonsupersymmetric meta-stable states as well as the
supersymmetric stable ones. By adding the orientifold 4-plane to this brane
configuration, we also describe the intersecting brane configuration of type
IIA string theory corresponding to the meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua of
corresponding gauge theory.
