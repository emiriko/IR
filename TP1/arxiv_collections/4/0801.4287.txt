We apply the Artificial Immune System (AIS) technology to the Collaborative
Filtering (CF) technology when we build the movie recommendation system. Two
different affinity measure algorithms of AIS, Kendall tau and Weighted Kappa,
are used to calculate the correlation coefficients for this movie
recommendation system. From the testing we think that Weighted Kappa is more
suitable than Kendall tau for movie problems.
