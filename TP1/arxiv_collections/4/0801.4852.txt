We examine static spherically symmetric polytropic spheres in Palatini f(R)
gravity and show that no regular solutions to the field equations exist for
physically relevant cases such as a monatomic isentropic gas or a degenerate
electron gas, thus casting doubt on the validity of Palatini f(R) gravity as an
alternative to General Relativity.
