This paper introduces QuanFruit v1.1, a Java application available for free.
(Source code included in the distribution.) Recently, Farhi-Goldstone-Gutmann
(FGG) wrote a paper arXiv:quant-ph/0702144 that proposes a quantum algorithm
for evaluating NAND formulas. QuanFruit outputs a quantum circuit for the FFG
algorithm.
