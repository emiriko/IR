We study the conjectured exact S-matrix for the scattering of BPS magnon
boundstates in the spin-chain description of planar N=4 SUSY Yang-Mills. The
conjectured S-matrix exhibits both simple and double poles at complex momenta.
Some of these poles lie parametrically close to the real axis in momentum space
on the branch where particle energies are positive. We show that all such poles
are precisely accounted for by physical processes involving one or more
on-shell intermediate particles belonging to the known BPS spectrum.
