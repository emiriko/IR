The lepton flavor violating interactions are worthwhile to examine since they
are sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model. The simplest extension of
the Standard Model promoting the lepton flavor violating interactions are the
so called two Higgs doublet model which contains an additional Higgs doublet
carrying the same quantum numbers as the first one. In this model, the lepton
flavor violating interactions are induced by new scalar Higgs bosons, scalar
h^{0} and pseudo scalar A^{0}, and Yukawa couplings, appearing as free
parameters, are determined by using the experimental data. On the other hand,
the possible extra dimensions are interesting in the sense that they ensure a
solution to the hierarchy and cosmological constant problems and also result in
the enhancement in the physical quantities of various processes. In the present
work, we predict the branching ratios of lepton flavor violating radion decays
r-> e^{\pm},\mu^{\pm}, r-> e^{\pm},\tau^{\pm} and r->\mu^{\pm},\tau^{\pm} in
the two Higgs doublet model, including a single extra dimension, in the
framework of the Randall Sundrum scenario. We observed that the branching
ratios of the processes we study are at most at the order of 10^{-8} for the
small values of radion mass and it decreases with the increasing values of the
radion mass. Among the LFV decays we study, the r->\mu^{\pm},\tau^{\pm} decay
would be the most suitable one to measure its branching ratio.
