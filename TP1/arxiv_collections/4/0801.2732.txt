A combination of ab initio simulations and linear-scaling Green's functions
techniques is used to analyze the transport properties of long (up to one
micron) carbon nanotubes with realistic disorder. The energetics and the
influence of single defects (mono- and di-vacancies) on the electronic and
transport properties of single-walled armchair carbon nanotubes are analyzed as
a function of the tube diameter by means of the local orbital first-principles
Fireball code. Efficient O(N) Green's functions techniques framed within the
Landauer-Buttiker formalism allow a statistical study of the nanotube
conductance averaged over a large sample of defected tubes and thus extraction
of the nanotubes localization length. Both the cases of zero and room
temperature are addressed.
