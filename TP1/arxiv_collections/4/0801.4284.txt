We consider models with a vectorlike confining gauge theory in the hidden
sector, and demonstrate that the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking
(EWSB) is due to the dimensional transmutation in the hidden sector gauge
theory, and the lightest mesons in the hidden sector could be a good cold dark
matter (CDM) candidate. There would be more than one neutral Higgs-like scalar
bosons, and they could decay mainly into the CDM pair, if that decay channel is
kinemtically allowed.
