We use a transfer-matrix method to study the disorder-induced metal-insulator
transition. We take isotropic nearest- neighbor hopping and an onsite potential
with uniformly distributed disorder. Following previous work done on the simple
cubic lattice, we perform numerical calculations for the body centered cubic
and face centered cubic lattices, which are more common in nature. We obtain
the localization length from calculated Lyapunov exponents for different system
sizes. This data is analyzed using finite-size scaling to find the critical
parameters. We create an energy-disorder phase diagram for both lattice types,
noting that it is symmetric about the band center for the body centered cubic
lattice, but not for the face centered cubic lattice. We find a critical
exponent of approximately 1.5-1.6 for both lattice types for transitions
occurring either at fixed energy or at fixed disorder, agreeing with results
previously obtained for other systems belonging to the same orthogonal
universality class. We notice an increase in critical disorder with the number
of nearest neighbors, which agrees with intuition.
