Using Lie group theory and canonical transformations, we construct explicit
solutions of nonlinear Schrodinger equations with spatially inhomogeneous
nonlinearities. We present the general theory, use it to study different
examples and use the qualitative theory of dynamical systems to obtain some
properties of these solutions.
