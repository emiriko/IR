In the presence of constant background electromagnetic fields, we discuss
three types of exactly marginal boundary tachyon operators for static kinks in
boundary conformal field theory. Functional forms of three operators are
hyperbolic sine, hyperbolic cosine, and exponential types, and they describe
codimension-one solitons when the transverse electric field has overcritical
value. The energy-momentum tensor and the source for antisymmetric tensor field
are computed in the path integral approach for the exponential-type tachyon
vertex operator.
