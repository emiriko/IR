Fractal geometry of random curves appearing in the scaling limit of critical
two-dimensional statistical systems is characterized by their harmonic measure
and winding angle. The former is the measure of the jaggedness of the curves
while the latter quantifies their tendency to form logarithmic spirals. We show
how these characteristics are related to local operators of conformal field
theory and how they can be computed using conformal invariance of critical
systems with central charge $c \leqslant 1$.
