We use coordinate transformation theory to realize substrates that can modify
the emission of an embedded source. Simulation results show that with proper
transformation functions the energy radiated by a source embedded in these
space variant media will be concentrated in a narrow beam. The thickness of the
slab achieved with our transformations will no longer be restricted by the
evanescent modes and the source can be placed at any position along the
boundary of the substrate without affecting the radiation pattern. We also
discuss the case where reduced parameters are used, which still performs well
and is physically realizable.
