We introduce multipole soliton complexes in optical lattices induced by
nondiffracting parabolic beams. Despite the symmetry-breaking dictated by the
curvature of the lattice channels, we find that complex, asymmetric
higher-order states can be stable. The unique topology of parabolic lattices
affords new types of soliton motion: single solitons launched into the lattice
with nonzero transverse momentum perform periodic oscillations along parabolic
paths.
