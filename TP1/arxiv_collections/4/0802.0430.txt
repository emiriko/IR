We study the t-J-$V$ model beyond mean field level at finite doping on the
triangular lattice. The Coulomb repulsion $V$ between nearest neighbors brings
the system to a charge ordered state for $V$ larger than a critical value
$V_c$. One-particle spectral properties as self-energy, spectral functions and
the quasiparticle weight are studied near and far from the charge ordered
phase. When the system approaches the charge ordered state, charge fluctuations
become soft and they strongly influence the system leading to incoherent
one-particle excitations. Possible implications for cobaltates are given.
