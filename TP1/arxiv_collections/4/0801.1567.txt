Josephson junctions and junction arrays are well studied devices in
superconductivity. With external magnetic fields one can modulate the phase in
a long junction and create traveling, solitonic waves of magnetic flux, called
fluxons. Today, it is also possible to device two different types of junctions:
depending on the sign of the critical current density, they are called 0- or
pi-junction. In turn, a 0-pi junction is formed by joining two of such
junctions. As a result, one obtains a pinned Josephson vortex of fractional
magnetic flux, at the 0-pi boundary. Here, we analyze this arrangement of
superconducting junctions in the context of an atomic bosonic quantum gas,
where two-state atoms in a double well trap are coupled in an analogous
fashion. There, an all-optical 0-pi Josephson junction is created by the phase
of a complex valued Rabi-frequency and we a derive a discrete four-mode model
for this situation, which qualitatively resembles a semifluxon.
