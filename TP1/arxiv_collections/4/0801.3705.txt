The energy-momentum for a gravitating system can be considered by the tetard
teleparalle gauge current in orthonormal frames. Whereas the Einstein
pseudotensor used holonomic frames. Tetrad expression itself gives a better
result for gravitational energy than Einstein's. Inspired by an idea of Deser,
we found a gravitational energy expression which enjoys the positive energy
property by combining the tetrad expression and the Einstein pseudotensor,
i.e., the connection coefficient has a form appropriate to a suitable
intermediate between orthonormal and holonomic frames.
