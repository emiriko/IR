Recent large-scale computer simulations suggest that it may be possible to
create a new class of soft solids, called `bijels', by stabilizing and
arresting the bicontinuous interface in a binary liquid demixing via spinodal
decomposition using particles that are neutrally wetted by both liquids. The
interfacial layer of particles is expected to be semi-permeable, hence, if
realised, these new materials would have many potential applications, e.g. as
microreaction media. However, the creation of bijels in the laboratory faces
serious obstacles. In general, fast quench rates are necessary to bypass
nucleation, so that only samples with limited thickness can be produced, which
destroys the three-dimensionality of the putative bicontinuous network.
Moreover, even a small degree of unequal wettability of the particles by the
two liquids can lead to ill-characterised, `lumpy' interfacial layers and
therefore irreproducible material properties. Here we report a reproducible
protocol for creating three-dimensional samples of bijel in which the
interfaces are stabilized by essentially a single layer of particles. We
demonstrate how to tune the mean interfacial separation in these bijels, and
show that mechanically, they indeed behave as soft solids.
