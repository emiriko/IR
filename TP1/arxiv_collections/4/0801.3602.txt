The role of multimode vibrational dynamics in electron transport through
single molecule junctions is investigated. The study is based on a generic
model, which describes charge transport through a single molecule that is
attached to metal leads. To address vibrationally-coupled electron transport,
we employ a nonequilibrium Green's function approach that extends a method
recently proposed by Galperin et al. [Phys. Rev. B 73, 045314 (2006)] to
multiple vibrational modes. The methodology is applied to two systems: a
generic model with two vibrational degrees of freedom and
benzenedibutanethiolate covalently bound to gold electrodes. The results show
that the coupling to multiple vibrational modes can have a significant effect
on the conductance of a molecular junction. In particular, we demonstrate the
effect of electronically induced coupling between different vibrational modes
and study nonequilibrium vibrational effects by calculating the current-induced
excitation of vibrational modes.
