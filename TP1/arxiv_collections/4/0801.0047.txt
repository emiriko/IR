A quark-gluon phase transition in the Universe is researched after which
vacuum (dark) energy has hardened and become cosmological constant. Before this
a vacuum component of the Universe was changing by jumps during phase
transitions since vacuum condensates of quantum fields carried a negative
contribution in its positive density energy. This quintessence period of the
Universe life took place during the first parts of a second when our Universe
was losing high symmetry. Using Zel'dovich's formula the modern value of vacuum
energy is also calculated. It is shown that a quantum chromodynamical vacuum
which is characterized by pseudogoldstone bosons existed definitely when
temperature of the Universe was T~150 MeV. Therefore there is a large
probability that dark energy is vacuum energy.
