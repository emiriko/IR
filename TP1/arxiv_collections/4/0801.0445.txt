We discuss the f(R)-theories of gravity with torsion in the framework of
jet-bundles. Such an approach is particularly useful since the components of
the torsion and curvature tensors can be chosen as fiber jet-coordinates on the
bundles and then the symmetries and the conservation laws of the theory can be
easily achieved. Field equations of f(R)-gravity are studied in empty space and
in presence of various forms of matter as Dirac fields, Yang--Mills fields and
spin perfect fluid. Such fields enlarge the jet-bundles framework and
characterize the dynamics. Finally we give some cosmological applications and
discuss the relations between f(R)-gravity and scalar-tensor theories.
