We present a variational wavefunction which explains the behaviour of the
supersolid state formed by hard-core bosons on the triangular lattice. The
wavefunction is a linear superposition of {\em only and all} configurations
minimising the repulsion between the bosons (which it thus implements as a hard
constraint). Its properties can be evaluated exactly--in particular, the
variational minimisation of the energy yields (i) the surprising and initially
controversial spontaneous density deviation from half-filling (ii) a
quantitatively accurate estimate of the corresponding density wave (solid)
order parameter.
