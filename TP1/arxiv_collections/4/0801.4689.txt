An effective Hamiltonian describing interaction between generic "fast" and a
"slow" systems is obtained in the strong interaction limit. The result is
applied for studying the effect of quantum phase transition as a bifurcation of
the ground state of the "slow subsystem" in the thermodynamic limit. Examples
as atom-field and atom-atom interactions are analyzed in detail.
