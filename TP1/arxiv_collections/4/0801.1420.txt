The Verwey phase transition in magnetite is analyzed on the basis of the
Landau theory. The free energy functional is expanded in a series of components
belonging to the primary and secondary order parameters. A low-temperature
phase with the monoclinic P2/c symmetry is a result of condensation of two
order parameters X_3 and \Delta_5 . The temperature dependence of the shear
elastic constant C_44 is derived and the mechanism of its softening is
discussed.
