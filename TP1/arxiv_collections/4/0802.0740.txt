Decay rate and forward-backward asymmetries in B -> K_{1} l^{+} l ^{-}, K_{1}
is the axial vector meson, are calculated in the universal extra dimension
(UED) model. The dependence of these physical quantities on the
compactification radius $R$, the only unknown parameter in UED model, is
studied and it is shown that zero of forward-backward asymmetry is sensitive to
the UED model, therefore they can be very useful tool to establish new physics
predicted by the UED model. This work is briefly extended to B ->
K^{*}l^{+}l^{-}.
