We study generalized uncertainty principle through the basic concepts of
limit and Fourier transformation and analyze both the quantum theory of gravity
and string theory from the perspective of complex function theory. Motivated
from the noncommutative nature of string theory, we have proposed a UV/IR
mixing dependent function $ \tilde{\delta}(\Delta x,\Delta k, \epsilon) $. For
a given $ \tilde{\delta}(\Delta x,\Delta k, \epsilon) $, we arrived at the
string uncertainty principle from the analyticity condition of a complex
function, which depends upon UV cut-off of the theory. This non trivially
modifies the quantum measurements, black hole physics and short distance
geometries. The present analysis is based on the postulate that the Planck
scale is the minimal length scale in nature. Furthermore, our consideration is
in perfect agreement with the existence of the maximum length scale in nature.
Both of the above length scales rely only upon the analysis of $
\tilde{\delta}(\Delta x,\Delta k, \epsilon) $ and do not directly make use of
any specific structure of the theory or Hamiltonian. The Regge behavior of the
string spectrum and the quantization of the horizon area of a black hole are
natural consequences of the function $ \tilde{\delta}(\Delta x,\Delta k,
\epsilon) $. It is hereby anticipated that $ \tilde{\delta}(\Delta x,\Delta k,
\epsilon) $ contains all possible corrections operating in nature, and thus a
promising possibility to reveal important clues towards the geometric origin of
$M$-theory.
