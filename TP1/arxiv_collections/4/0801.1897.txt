The role of spin-orbit interaction on the ground state and thermal
entanglement of a Heisenberg XYZ two-qubit system in the presence of an
inhomogeneous magnetic field is investigated. For a certain value of spin-orbit
parameter $D$, the ground state entanglement tends to vanish suddenly and when
$D$ crosses its critical value $D_c$, the entanglement undergoes a revival. The
maximum value of the entanglement occurs in the revival region. In finite
temperatures there are revival regions in $D-T$ plane. In these regions,
entanglement first increases with increasing temperature and then decreases and
ultimately vanishes for temperatures above a critical value. This critical
temperature is an increasing function of $D$, thus the nonzero entanglement can
exist for larger temperatures. In addition, the amount of entanglement in the
revival region depends on the spin-orbit parameter. Also, the entanglement
teleportation via the quantum channel constructed by the above system is
investigated and finally the influence of the spin-orbit interaction on the
fidelity of teleportation and entanglement of replica state is studied.
