The mass structure of hadron multiplets is understood to imply the
inexactness of SU(3) symmetry. Here we show that these symmetry broken mass
splittings amongst baryon and meson multiplet members are close integral
multiples of the mass difference between a neutral pion and a muon, the first
excitation within the elementary particle mass spectrum. This is found to be
equally true for the mass intervals amongst the particles belonging to the
multiplets having different spin and parity characteristics. The results
reinforce our earlier contention that the mass difference between a neutral
pion and a muon is of fundamental importance to the elementary particle mass
distribution.
