The physics underlying the magnetization process of quantum antiferromagnets
is revisited from the viewpoint of geometric phases. A continuum variant of the
Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type approach to the problem is put forth, where the
commensurability condition of Oshikawa {\it et al} derives from a Berry
connection formulation of the system's crystal momentum. %, similar to that
developed by Haldane for ferromagnets. %Building on the physical picture which
arises, We then go on to formulate an effective field theory which can deal
with higher dimensional cases as well. We find that a topological term, whose
principle function is to assign Berry phase factors to space-time vortex
objects, ultimately controls the magnetic behavior of the system. We further
show how our effective action maps into a ${\bf Z}_2$ gauge theory under
certain conditions, which in turn allows for the occurrence of a fractionalized
phase with topological order.
