DNA computation could in principle solve the satisfiability (SAT) problem due
to the operations in parallel on extremely large numbers of strands. We
demonstrate some quantum gates corresponding to the DNA ones, based on which an
implementation of DNA algorithm for SAT problem is available by quantum
mechanical way. Since quantum computation owns the favorable feature of
operations in parallel on 2$^{n}$ states by using only n qubits, instead of
2$^{n}$ strands in DNA computation, computational complexity is much reduced in
treating the SAT problem quantum mechanically. We take a three-clause SAT
problem with two variables as an example, and carry out a NMR experiment for
solving a one-variable SAT problem.
