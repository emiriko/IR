We analyze the outcome of a Mott insulator to superfluid transition for a
two-component Bose gas with two atoms per site in an optical lattice in the
limit of slow ramping down the lattice potential. This manipulation of the
initial Mott insulating state transforms local correlations between hyperfine
states of atom pairs into multiparticle correlations extending over the whole
system. We show how to create macroscopic twin Fock states in this way an that,
in general, the obtained superfluid states are highly depleted even for initial
ground Mott insulator states.
