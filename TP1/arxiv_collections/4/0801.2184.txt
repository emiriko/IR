We observe violation of a Bell inequality between the quantum states of two
remote Yb ions separated by a distance of about one meter with the detection
loophole closed. The heralded entanglement of two ions is established via
interference and joint detection of two emitted photons, whose polarization is
entangled with each ion. The entanglement of remote qubits is also
characterized by full quantum state tomography.
