Geometric Langlands duality can be understood from statements of mirror
symmetry that can be formulated in purely topological terms for an oriented
two-manifold $C$. But understanding these statements is extremely difficult
without picking a complex structure on $C$ and using Hitchin's equations. We
sketch the essential statements both for the ``unramified'' case that $C$ is a
compact oriented two-manifold without boundary, and the ``ramified'' case that
one allows punctures. We also give a few indications of why a more precise
description requires a starting point in four-dimensional gauge theory.
