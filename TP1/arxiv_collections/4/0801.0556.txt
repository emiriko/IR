Let U and V be two Bertrand numeration systems, and, a and b the two Parry
numbers there are naturally associated with. Suppose they are multiplicatively
independent. We prove that, if E is a subset of positive integers which is both
U and V recognizable, then E is a finite union of arithmetical progressions.
