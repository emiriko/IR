We study the quantum mechanics of a system with inverse square potential in
noncommutative space. Both the coordinates and momentums are considered to be
noncommutative, which breaks the original so(2,1) symmetry. The energy levels
and eigenfunctions are obtained. The generators of the so(2,1) algebra are also
studied in noncommutative phase space and the commutators are calculated, which
shows that the so(2,1) algebra obtained in noncommutative space is not closed.
However the commutative limit \Theta,\bar{\Theta}\to 0 for the algebra smoothly
goes to the standard so(2,1) algebra.
