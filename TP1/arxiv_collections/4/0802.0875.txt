Self-assembled patterns obtained from a drying nanosphere suspension are
investigated by computer simulations and simple experiments. Motivated by the
earlier experimental results of Sasaki and Hane and Schope, we confirm that
more ordered triangular lattice structures can be obtained whenever a moderate
intensity random shaking is applied on the drying system. Computer simulations
are realized on an improved version of a recently elaborated
Burridge-Knopoff-type model. Experiments are made following the setup of Sasaki
and Hane, using ultrasonic radiation as source for controlled shaking.
