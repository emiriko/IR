Motions of continuous media presenting singularities are associated with
phenomena involving shocks, interfaces or material surfaces. The equations
representing evolutions of these media are irregular through geometrical
manifolds. A unique continuous medium is conceptually simpler than several
media with surfaces of singularity. To avoid the surfaces of discontinuity in
the theory, we transform the model by considering a continuous medium taking
intoaccount more complete internal energies expressed in gradient developments
associated with the variables of state. Nevertheless, resulting equations of
motion are of an higher order than those of the classical models: they lead to
non-linear models associated with more complex integration processes on the
mathematical level as well as on the numerical point of view. In fact, such
models allow a precise study of singular zones when they have a non negligible
physical thickness. This is typically the case for capillarity phenomena in
fluids or mixtures of fluids in which interfacial zones are transition layers
between phases or layers between fluids and solid walls. Within the framework
of mechanics for continuous media, we propose to deal with the functional point
of view considering globally the equations of the media as well as the boundary
conditions associated with these equations. For this aim, we revisit the
d'Alembert-Lagrange principle of virtual works which is able to consider the
expressions of the works of forces applied to a continuous medium as a linear
functional value on a space of test functions in the form of virtual
displacements. At the end, we analyze examples corresponding to capillary
fluids. This analysis brings us to numerical or asymptotic methods avoiding the
difficulties due to singularities in simpler -but with singularities- models.
