Spontaneous breaking of local Lorentz symmetry occurs when a local vector or
tensor field acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value. The effects of such
breaking are examined in the context of gravity theory. These include an
associated spontaneous breaking of diffeomorphism symmetry and generation of
massless Nambu-Goldstone modes. The possibility of a Higgs mechanism is
examined as well, and it is found that the conventional Higgs mechanism (giving
rise to massive gauge fields) does not occur in a Riemann spacetime. However,
in a Riemann-Cartan spacetime a Higgs mechanism involving the spin connection
is possible. Despite the lack of a conventional Higgs mechanism in Riemann
spacetime, additional massive modes involving the metric can appear through
unconventional processes that have no analogue in nonabelian gauge theory. The
effects of these types of processes are illustrated using a specific model,
known as a bumblebee model, in which a vector field acquires a vacuum value.
