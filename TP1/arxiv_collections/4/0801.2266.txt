We propose a scheme for the realization of a hybrid, strongly
quantum-correlated system formed of an atomic ensemble surrounded by a
high-finesse optical cavity with a vibrating mirror. We show that the steady
state of the system shows tripartite and bipartite continuous variable
entanglement in experimentally accessible parameter regimes, which is robust
against temperature.
