Real time combination of nanosensors and nanoactuators with virtual reality
environment and multisensorial interfaces enable us to efficiently act and
perceive at nanoscale. Advanced manipulation of nanoobjects and new strategies
for scientific education are the key motivations. We have no existing intuitive
representation of the nanoworld ruled by laws foreign to our experience. A
central challenge is then the construction of nanoworld simulacrum that we can
start to visit and to explore. In this nanoworld simulacrum, object
identifications will be based on probed entity physical and chemical intrinsic
properties, on their interactions with sensors and on the final choices made in
building a multisensorial interface so that these objects become coherent
elements of the human sphere of action and perception. Here we describe a 1D
virtual nanomanipulator, part of the Cit\'e des Sciences EXPO NANO in Paris,
that is the first realization based on this program.
