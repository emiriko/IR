In connection with the experiments recently achieved on doped crystals,
biological samples, doped optical fibers and semiconductor heterostructures, we
revisit the theory of the propagation of a pulse-modulated light in a saturable
absorber. Explicit analytical expressions of the transmitted pulse are
obtained, enabling us to determine the parameters optimizing the time-delay of
the transmitted pulse with respect to the incident pulse. We finally compare
the maximum fractional delay or figure of merit so attainable to those which
have been actually demonstrated in the experiments.
