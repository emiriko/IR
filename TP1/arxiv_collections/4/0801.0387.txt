In a previous paper we proposed a modification of metal-coated tapered-fibre
aperture probes for scanning near-field optical microscopes. The modification
consists of radial corrugations of the metal-dielectric interface oriented
inward the core. Their purpose is to facilitate the excitation of propagating
surface plasmons, which increase the transport of energy beyond the cut-off
diameter and radiate a quasi-dipolar field from the probe output rim. An
increase in energy output allows for reduction of the apex diameter, which is
the main factor determining the resolution of the microscope. In FDTD
simulations we analyse the performance of the new type to SNOM probe. We aim at
achieving of maximum energy throughput in probes with corrugations that may be
realized in a glass etching process.
