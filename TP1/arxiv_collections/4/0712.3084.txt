We present a proxy signature scheme using bilinear pairings that provides
effective proxy revocation. The scheme uses a binding-blinding technique to
avoid secure channel requirements in the key issuance stage. With this
technique, the signer receives a partial private key from a trusted authority
and unblinds it to get his private key, in turn, overcomes the key escrow
problem which is a constraint in most of the pairing-based proxy signature
schemes. The scheme fulfills the necessary security requirements of proxy
signature and resists other possible threats.
