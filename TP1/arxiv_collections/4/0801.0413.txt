We perform density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations
extensively on one dimensional Mott and Peierls chains with explicit inclusion
of the static bias to study the insulator-metal transition in those systems. We
find that the electric field induces a number of insulator-metal transitions
for finite size systems and at the thermodynamic limit, the insulating system
breaks down into a completely conducting state at a critical value of bias
which depends strongly on the insulating parameters. Our results indicate that
the breakdown, in both the Peierls and Mott insulators, at thermodynamic limit,
does not follow the Landau-Zener mechanism. Calculations on various size
systems indicate that an increase in the system size decreases the threshold
bias as well as the charge gap at that bias, making the insulator-metal
transition sharper in both cases.
