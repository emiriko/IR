We study tt*-geometry on the classifying space for regular singular
TERP-structures, e.g., Fourier-Laplace transformations of Brieskorn lattices of
isolated hypersurface singularities. We show that (a part of) this classifying
space can be canonically equipped with a hermitian structure. We derive an
estimate for the holomorphic sectional curvature of this hermitian metric,
which is the analogue of a similar result for classifying spaces of pure
polarized Hodge structures.
