We reconsider the Enriques Calabi Yau (FHSV) model and its string derivation
and argue that the Octonionic magic supergravity theory admits a string
interpretation closely related to the Enriques model. The uplift to D=6 of the
Octonionic magic model has 16 abelian vectors related to the rank of Type I and
Heterotic strings.
