The classical confinement condition of test particles to a brane universe in
the absence of non-gravitational forces is transformed using the
Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. The transformed condition provides a direct
criterion for selecting in a cosmological scenario 5D bulk manifolds wherein it
is possible to obtain confinement of trajectories to 4D hypersurfaces purely
due to classical gravitational effects.
