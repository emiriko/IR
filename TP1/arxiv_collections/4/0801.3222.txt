Axiomatic principles such as analyticity, unitarity and crossing symmetry
constrain the second derivative of the pi pi scattering amplitudes in some
channels to be positive in a region of the Mandelstam plane. Since this region
lies in the domain of validity of chiral perturbation theory, we can use these
positivity conditions to bound linear combinations of \bar{l}_1 and \bar{l}_2.
We compare our predictions with those derived previously in the literature
using similar methods. We compute the one-loop pi pi scattering amplitude in
the linear sigma model (LSM) using the MS-bar scheme, a result hitherto absent
in the literature. The LSM values for \bar{l}_1 and \bar{l}_2 violate the
bounds for small values of m_sigma/m_pi. We show how this can occur, while
still being consistent with the axiomatic principles.
