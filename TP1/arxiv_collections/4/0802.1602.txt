Consistent SU(6) and SU(8) spin-flavor extensions of the SU(3) flavor
Weinberg-Tomozawa (WT) meson-baryon chiral Lagrangian are constructed, which
incorporate vector meson degrees of freedom. In the charmless sector, the
on-shell approximation to the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) approach successfully
reproduces previous SU(3) WT results for the lowest-lying s--wave negative
parity baryon resonances. It also provides some information on the dynamics of
heavier ones and of the lightest d-wave negative parity resonances, as e.g. the
Lambda(1520). For charmed baryons the scheme is consistent with heavy quark
symmetry, and our preliminary results in the strangeness-less charm C=+1 sector
describe the main features of the three-star J^P=1/2^- Lambda_c(2595) and
J^P=3/2^- Lambda_c(2625) resonances. We also find a second broad J^P=1/2^-
state close to the Lambda_c(2595)
