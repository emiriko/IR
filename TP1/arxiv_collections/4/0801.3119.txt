There has been a significant amount of research into spreadsheets over the
last two decades. Errors in spreadsheets are well documented. Once used mainly
for simple functions such as logging, tracking and totalling information,
spreadsheets with enhanced formulas are being used for complex calculative
models. There are many software packages and tools which assist in detecting
errors within spreadsheets. There has been very little evidence of
investigation into the spreadsheet risks associated with the main stream
operations within an organisation. This study is a part of the investigation
into the means of mitigating risks associated with spreadsheet use within
organisations. In this paper the authors present and analyse three proposed
models for categorisation of spreadsheet use and the level of risks involved.
The models are analysed in the light of current knowledge and the general risks
associated with organisations.
