The coincidence-time loophole was identified by Larsson & Gill (Europhys.
Lett. 67, 707 (2004)); a concrete model that exploits this loophole has
recently been described by De Raedt et al. (Found. Phys., to appear). It is
emphasized here that De Raedt et al.'s model is experimentally testable. De
Raedt et al.'s model also introduces contextuality in a novel and classically
more natural way than the use of contextual particle properties, by introducing
a probabilistic model of a limited set of degrees of freedom of the measurement
apparatus, so that it can also be seen as a random field model. Even though De
Raedt et al.'s model may well contradict detailed Physics, it nonetheless
provides a way to simulate the logical operation of elements of a quantum
computer, and may provide a way forward for more detailed random field models.
