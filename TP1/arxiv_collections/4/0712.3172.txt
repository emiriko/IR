In an earlier paper, we studied solutions g to convolution equations of the
form a_d*g^{*d}+a_{d-1}*g^{*(d-1)}+...+a_1*g+a_0=0, where a_0, ..., a_d are
given arithmetic functions associated with Dirichlet series which converge on
some right half plane, and also g is required to be such a function. In this
article, we extend our previous results to multidimensional general Dirichlet
series of the form \sum_{x\in X} f(x) e^{-sx} (s in C^k), where X is an
additive subsemigroup of [0,\infty)^k. If X is discrete and a certain
solvability criterion is satisfied, we determine solutions by an elementary
recursive approach, adapting an idea of Feckan. The solution of the general
case leads us to a more comprehensive question: Let X be an additive
subsemigroup of a pointed, closed convex cone C in R^k. Can we find a complex
Radon measure on X whose Laplace transform satisfies a given polynomial
equation whose coefficients are Laplace transforms of such measures?
