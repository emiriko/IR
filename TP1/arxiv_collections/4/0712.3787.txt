We compare results from numerical simulations of spinning binaries in the
"orbital hangup" case, where the binary completes at least nine orbits before
merger, with post-Newtonian results using the approximants TaylorT1, T4 and Et.
We find that, over the ten cycles before the gravitational-wave frequency
reaches $M\omega = 0.1$, the accumulated phase disagreement between NR and
2.5PN results is less than three radians, and is less than 2.5 radians when
using 3.5PN results. The amplitude disagreement between NR and restricted PN
results increases with the black holes' spin, from about 6% in the equal-mass
case to 12% when the black holes' spins are $S_i/M_i^2 = 0.85$. Finally, our
results suggest that the merger waveform will play an important role in
estimating the spin from such inspiral waveforms.
