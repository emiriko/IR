We study the spatiotemporal properties of coherent states (peaks, holes, and
fronts) in a bistable activator-inhibitor system that exhibits biochemical
saturated autocatalysis, and in which fronts do not preserve spatial parity
symmetry. Using the Gierer-Meinhardt prototype model, we find the conditions in
which two distinct pinning regions are formed. The first pinning type is known
in the context of variational systems while the second is structurally
different due to the presence of a heteroclinic bifurcation between two uniform
states. The bifurcation also separates the parameter regions of
counterpropagating fronts, leading in turn to the growth or contraction of
activator domains. These phenomena expand the range of pattern formation theory
and its biomedical applications: activator domain retraction suggests potential
therapeutic strategies for patterned pathologies, such as cardiovascular
calcification.
