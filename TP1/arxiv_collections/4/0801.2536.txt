We present a method of constructing generic single-centered and
multi-centered extremal black hole solutions in a large class of 4D N=2
supergravities coupled to vector-multiplets with cubic prepotentials. The
method is applicable to models for which the 3D moduli spaces obtained via
c*-map are symmetric coset spaces. The attractor solutions are generated by
certain nilpotent elements in the coset algebra. We present explicit
computations in 4D N=2 supergravity coupled to one vector-multiplet, whose 3D
moduli space is the symmetric coset space G_{2(2)}/SL(2,R)^2. The
non-supersymmetric multi-centered black holes in this model are found to lack
the intricate moduli space of bound configurations that are typical of the
supersymmetric case.
