This paper introduces QuanTree v1.1 and QuanLin v1.1, two Java applications
available for free. (Source code included in the distribution.) Each
application compiles a different type of input quantum evolution operator. The
applications output a quantum circuit that is approximately equal to the input
evolution operator. QuanTree compiles an input evolution operator whose
Hamiltonian is proportional to the incidence matrix of a balanced, binary tree
graph. QuanLin compiles an input evolution operator whose Hamiltonian is
proportional to the incidence matrix of a line (open string) graph. Both
applications also output an error, defined as the distance in the Frobenius
norm between the input evolution operator and the output quantum circuit.
