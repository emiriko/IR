The transition amplitude between square roots of states, which is an analogue
of Hellinger integral in classical measure theory, is investigated in
connection with operator-algebraic representation theory. A variational
expression based on geometric mean of positive forms is utilized to obtain an
approximation formula for transition amplitudes.
