The ground-state Hartree-Fock (HF) wavefunction of the Hooke's atom is not
known in closed form, contrary to the exact solution. The single HF orbital
involved has thus far been studied using expansion techniques only, leading to
slightly disparate energies. Therefore, the present letter aims at proposing
alternative definitions of the HF wavefunction. First, the HF limit is
ascertained using a simple expansion, which makes it possible to formulate
explicit expressions of HF properties. The resulting energy, 2.038 438 871 8
Eh, is found stable at the tenth digit. Second and more instructive, an
analysis of the Hartree equation makes it possible to infer a remarkably simple
and accurate HF orbital, leading to an energy exceeding by 5.76 10-7 Eh only
the above HF limit. This orbital makes it possible to obtain (near)
Hartree-Fock properties in closed-form, which in turn enables handy comparisons
with exact quantities.
