The prospects of half-metallic ferromagnetism being induced by the
incorporation of C atoms into alkaline-earth-metal-oxides are investigated by
the first principle calculation. The origin of the ferromagnetism is discussed
through the calculation of the electronic structure and exchange coupling
constant by using the pseudo-potential-like self-interaction-corrected local
spin density method. The Curie temperature ($T_c$) is also predicted by
employing the Monte Carlo simulation. It is shown that by taking the electron
self-interaction into account, the half-metallic ferromagnetism induced by C in
the host materials is more stabilized in comparison with the standard LDA case,
and the C's $2p$ electron states in the bandgap become more localized resulting
in the predominance of the short-ranged exchange interaction. While the
ferromagnetism in MgO$_{1-x}$C$_x$ is stabilized due to the exchange
interaction of the $1st$-nearest neighbor pairs and might be suppressed by the
anti-ferromagnetic super-exchange interaction at higher $x$, the ferromagnetism
in CaO$_{1-x}$C$_x$, SrO$_{1-x}$C$_x$, and BaO$_{1-x}$C$_x$ is stabilized by
both the $1st$- and $2nd$-nearest neighbor pairs, and $T_c$ monotonously
increases with the C concentration.
