In that paper, we provide a new characterization of the solutions of specific
reflected backward stochastic differential equations (or RBSDEs) whose driver
$g$ is convex and has quadratic growth in its second variable: this is done by
introducing the extended notion of $g$-Snell enveloppe. Then, in a second step,
we relate this representation to a specific class of dynamic monetary concave
functionals already introduced in a discrete time setting. This connection
implies that the solution, characterized by means of non linear expectations,
has again the time consistency property.
