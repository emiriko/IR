We develop a theory of collective spin dynamics triggered by ultrafast
optical excitation of ferromagnetic semiconductors. Using the density matrix
equations of motion in the mean field approximation and including magnetic
anisotropy and hole spin dephasing effects, we predict the development of a
light--induced magnetization tilt during ultra--short time intervals comparable
to the pulse duration. This femtosecond dynamics in the coherent temporal
regime is governed by the interband nonlinear optical polarizations and is
followed by a second temporal regime governed by the magnetic anisotropy of the
Fermi sea. We interpret our numerical results by deriving a
Landau--Gilbert--like equation for the collective spin, which demonstrates an
ultrafast correction to the magnetic anisotropy effective field due to second
order coherent nonlinear optical processes. Using the Lindblad semigroup
method, we also derive a contribution to the interband polarization dephasing
determined by the Mn spin and the hole spin dephasing. Our predicted
magnetization tilt and subsequent nonlinear dynamics due to the magnetic
anisotropy can be controlled by varying the optical pulse intensity, duration,
and helicity and can be observed with pump--probe magneto--optical
spectroscopy.
