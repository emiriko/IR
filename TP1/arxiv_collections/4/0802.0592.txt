We study the Hamiltonian motion of an ensemble of unconfined classical
particles driven by an external field F through a translationally-invariant,
thermal array of monochromatic Einstein oscillators. The system does not
sustain a stationary state, because the oscillators cannot effectively absorb
the energy of high speed particles. We nonetheless show that the system has at
all positive temperatures a well-defined low-field mobility over macroscopic
time scales of order exp(-c/F). The mobility is independent of F at low fields,
and related to the zero-field diffusion constant D through the Einstein
relation. The system therefore exhibits normal transport even though the bath
obviously has a discrete frequency spectrum (it is simply monochromatic) and is
therefore highly non-Ohmic. Such features are usually associated with anomalous
transport properties.
