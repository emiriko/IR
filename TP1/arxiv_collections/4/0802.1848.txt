Dynamic stencil deposition (DSD) techniques offer a variety of fabrication
advantages not possible with traditional lithographic processing, such as the
the ability to directly deposit nanostructures with programmable height
profiles. However, DSD systems have not enjoyed widespread usage due to their
complexity. We demonstrate a simple, low-profile, portable, one-dimensional
nanotranslation system that facilitates access to nanoscale DSD abilities.
Furthermore we show a variety of fabricated programmable-height nanostructures,
including parallel arrays of such structures, and suggest other applications
that exploit the unique capabilities of DSD fabrication methods.
