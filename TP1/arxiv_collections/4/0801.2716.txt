We have performed zero-field muon spin rotation measurements on single
crystals of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} to search for spontaneous currents in the
pseudo-gap state. By comparing measurements on materials across the phase
diagram, we put strict upper limits on any possible time-reversal symmetry
breaking fields that could be associated with the pseudo-gap. Comparison
between experimental limits and proposed circulating current states effectively
eliminates the possibility that such states exist in this family of materials.
