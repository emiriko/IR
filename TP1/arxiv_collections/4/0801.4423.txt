As users begin to use many more devices for personal information management
(PIM) than just the traditional desktop computer, it is essential for HCI
researchers to understand how these devices are being used in the wild and
their roles in users' information environments. We conducted a study of 220
knowledge workers about their devices, the activities they performed on each,
and the groups of devices used together. Our findings indicate that several
devices are often used in groups; integrated multi-function portable devices
have begun to replace single-function devices for communication (e.g. email and
IM). Users use certain features opportunistically because they happen to be
carrying a multi-function device with them. The use of multiple devices and
multi-function devices is fraught with compromises as users must choose and
make trade-offs among various factors.
