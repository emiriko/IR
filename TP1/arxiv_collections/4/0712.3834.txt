While magnetic hysteresis usually considers magnetic domains, the switching
of the core of magnetic vortices has recently become an active topic. We
considered Bloch domain walls, which are known to display at the surface of
thin films flux-closure features called N\'eel caps. We demonstrated the
controlled switching of these caps under a magnetic field, occurring via the
propagation of a surface vortex. For this we considered flux-closure states in
elongated micron-sized dots, so that only the central domain wall can be
addressed, while domains remain unaffected.
