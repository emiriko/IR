We report precision measurements of the Feynman-x dependence, and first
measurements of the transverse momentum dependence, of transverse single spin
asymmetries for the production of \pi^0 mesons from polarized proton collisions
at \sqrt{s}=200 GeV. The x_F dependence of the results is in fair agreement
with perturbative QCD model calculations that identify orbital motion of quarks
and gluons within the proton as the origin of the spin effects. Results for the
p_T dependence at fixed x_F are not consistent with pQCD-based calculations.
