An analysis is made of the results of a recent polarization correlation
experiment by Bovino (unpublished) where about 60,000 data have been obtained.
I assume that the state of the photon pairs produced in the source (a
non-linear crystal) are in a (slightly)non-maximally entangled state and the
most relevant non-idealities of the set-up are taken into account. A comparison
is made between the predictions of quantum mechanics and a simple family of
local hidden varaibles models with the result that the former is violated by
more than 4 standard deviations whislt the data are compatible with the family
of local models.
