The variational principle and the corresponding differential equation for
geodesic circles in two dimensional (pseudo)-Riemannian space are being
discovered. The relationship with the physical notion of uniformly accelerated
relativistic particle is emphasized. The known form of spin-curvature
interaction emerges due to the presence of second order derivatives in the
expression for the Lagrange function. The variational equation itself reduces
to the unique invariant variational equation of constant Frenet curvature in
two dimensional (pseudo)-Euclidean geometry.
