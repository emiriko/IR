Portable Electronic Devices usually utilize a small screen with limited
viewing area and a keyboard with a limited number of keys. This makes it
difficult to perform quick searches in data arrays containing more than dozen
items such an address book or song list. In this article we present a new data
selection method which allows the user to quickly select an entry from a list
using 4-way navigation device such as joystick, trackball or 4-way key pad.
This method allows for quick navigation using just one hand, without looking at
the screen.
