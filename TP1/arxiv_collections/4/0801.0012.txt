The contribution of different modes of the Coulomb field to decoherence and
to the dynamical breakdown of the time reversal invariance is calculated in the
one-loop approximation for non-relativistic electron gas. The dominant
contribution was found to come from the usual collective modes in the plasma,
namely the zero-sound and the plasmon oscillations. The length scale of the
quantum-classical transition is found to be close to the Thomas-Fermi screening
length. It is argued that the extension of these modes to the whole Fock-space
yield optimal pointer states.
