Adopting the pullback approach to global Finsler geometry, the aim of the
present paper is to provide intrinsic (coordinate-free) proofs of the existence
and uniqueness theorems for the Chern (Rund) and Hashiguchi connections on a
Finsler manifold. To accomplish this, we introduce and investigate the notions
of semispray and nonlinear connection associated with a given regular
connection, in the pullback bundle. Moreover, it is shown that for the the
Chern (Rund) and Hashiguchi connections, the associated semispray coincides
with the canonical spray and the associated nonlinear connection coincides with
the Barthel connection. Explicit intrinsic expressions relating these
connections and the Cartan connection are deduced. Although our investigation
is entirely global, the local expressions of the obtained results, when
calculated, coincide with the existing classical local results. We provide, for
the sake of completeness and for comparison reasons, two appendices, one of
them presenting a global survey of canonical linear connections in Finsler
geometry and the other presenting a local survey of our global approach.
