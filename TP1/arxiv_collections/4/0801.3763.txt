Magnetic properties of single crystals of the heterometallic complex
[Cu(bpy)$_3$]$_2$[Cr(C$_2$O$_4$)$_3$]NO$_3\cdot $9H$_2$O (bpy =
2,2'-bipyridine) have been investigated. From the recorded EPR spectra, the
spin-Hamiltonian parameters have been determined. The magnetization
measurements have shown magnetic anisotropy at low temperatures, which has been
analysed as a result of the zero-field splitting of the Cr$^{\mathrm{III}}$
ion. By fitting the exactly derived magnetization expression to the measured
magnetization data, the axial zero-field splitting parameter, D, has been
calculated. Comparing to the EPR measurements, it has been confirmed that $D$
can be determined from the measurements of the macroscopic magnetization on the
single crystals.
