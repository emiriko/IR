We previously introduced a family of symplectic maps of the torus whose
quantization exhibits scarring on invariant co-isotropic submanifolds. The
purpose of this note is to show that in contrast to other examples, where
failure of Quantum Unique Ergodicity is attributed to high multiplicities in
the spectrum, for these examples the spectrum is (generically) simple.
