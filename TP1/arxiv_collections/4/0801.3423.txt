In positive characteristic, algebraic curves can have many more automorphisms
than expected from the classical Hurwitz's bound. There even exist algebraic
curves of arbitrary high genus g with more than 16g^4 automorphisms. It has
been observed on many occasions that the most anomalous examples invariably
have zero p-rank. In this paper, the K-automorphism group Aut(X) of a zero
2-rank algebraic curve X defined over an algebraically closed field K of
characteristic 2 is investigated. The main result is that if the curve has
genus g greater than or equal to 2, and |Aut(X)|>24g^2, then Aut(X) has a fixed
point on X, apart from few exceptions. In the exceptional cases the
possibilities for Aut(X) and g are determined.
