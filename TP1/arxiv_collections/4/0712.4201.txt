We extend our finite difference time domain method for numerical solution of
the Schrodinger equation to cases where eigenfunctions are complex-valued.
Illustrative numerical results for an electron in two dimensions, subject to a
confining potential V(x,y), in a constant perpendicular magnetic field
demonstrate the accuracy of the method.
