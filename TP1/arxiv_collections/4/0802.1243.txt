By using a generalized Bopp's shift formulation, instead of star product
method, we investigate the Aharonov-Casher(AC) effect for a spin-1 neutral
particle in non-commutative(NC) quantum mechanics. After solving the Kemmer
equations both on a non-commutative space and a non-commutative phase space, we
obtain the corrections to the topological phase of the AC effect for a spin-1
neutral particle both on a NC space and a NC phase space.
