Few-cycle pulses of intense 800 nm light are used to probe ionization and
dissociation of carbon disulfide in the intensity and temporal regime where
rescattering is expected to dominate the laser-molecule interaction. The
wavepacket of the rescattered electron destructively interferes with the
anti-bonding $\pi$-orbital of CS$_2^+$ such that rescattering is effectively
"switched off". Direct signature of enhanced ionization being "switched off" in
the ultrashort domain is also obtained. Consequently, dissociation becomes an
almost non-existent channel when few-cycle pulses are used, with only
long-lived singly-, doubly-, and triply-charged molecular ions dominating the
mass spectrum. Few-cycle optical pulses help reveal that quantum-mechanically
determined molecular symmetry contributes to strong field molecular ionization.
