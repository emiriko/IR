We derive a general expression for the cumulant generating function (CGF) of
non-Markovian quantum stochastic transport processes. The long-time limit of
the CGF is determined by a single dominating pole of the resolvent of the
memory kernel from which we extract the zero-frequency cumulants of the current
using a recursive scheme. The finite-frequency noise is expressed not only in
terms of the resolvent, but also initial system-environment correlations. As an
illustrative example we consider electron transport through a dissipative
double quantum dot for which we study the effects of dissipation on the
zero-frequency cumulants of high orders and the finite-frequency noise.
