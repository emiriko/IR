A continuous pathway from digital images acquired during a mechanical test to
quantitative identification of a constitutive law is presented herein based on
displacement field analysis. From images, displacement fields are directly
estimated within a finite element framework. From the latter, the application
of the equilibrium gap method provides the means for rigidity field evaluation.
In the present case, a reconditioned formulation is proposed for a better
stability. Last, postulating a specific form of a damage law, a linear system
is formed that gives a direct access to the (non-linear) damage growth law in
one step. The two last procedures are presented, validated on an artificial
case, and applied to the case of a biaxial tension of a composite sample driven
up to failure. A quantitative estimate of the quality of the determination is
proposed, and in the last application, it is shown that no more than 7% of the
displacement field fluctuations are not accounted for by the determined damage
law.
