The Landau-Lifshitz form of the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation in the
presence of a plane wave of arbitrary shape and polarization is solved exactly
and in closed form. The explicit solution is presented in the particular,
paradigmatic cases of a constant crossed field and of a monochromatic wave with
circular and with linear polarization.
