The propagator of the domain wall fermion is calculated from the gauge
configurations of the RBC-UKQCD collaborations with 2+1 dynamical flavors of
$16^3\times 32\times 16$ lattice. The ambiguity of the phase is adjusted such
that the overlap of the solution of the conjugate gradient method and the plane
wave at the source becomes real. The mass function becomes close to those of
Kogut-Susskind fermion, but no anomalous behavior for $u/d$-quark mass and
s-quark mass ratio close to 0.75 appears.
