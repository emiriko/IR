The random sequential adsorption (RSA) model is modified to describe damage
and crack accumulation. The exclusion for object deposition (for damaged region
formation) is not for the whole object, as in the standard RSA, but only for
the initial point (or higher-dimensional defect) from which the damaged region
or crack initiates. The one-dimensional variant of the model is solved exactly.
