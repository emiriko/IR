We investigate eigenvalues of many-body systems interacting by two-body
forces as well as those of random matrices. We find a strong linear correlation
between eigenvalues and diagonal matrix elements if both of them are sorted
from the smaller values to larger ones. By using this linear correlation we are
able to predict reasonably all eigenvalues of given shell model Hamiltonian
without complicated iterations.
