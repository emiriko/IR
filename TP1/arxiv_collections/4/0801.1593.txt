A uniform approximation for the coherent state propagator, valid in the
vicinity of phase space caustics, was recently obtained using the Maslov method
combined with a dual representation for coherent states. In this paper we
review the derivation of this formula and apply it to two model systems: the
one-dimensional quartic oscillator and a two-dimensional chaotic system.
