Precise determination of heavy flavor production cross-sections at LHC
energies will be of primary importance. The produced heavy quarks are expected
to be sensitive probes of parton energy loss in the medium formed in heavy-ion
collisions. Through the measurement of charm and bottom suppression in Pb + Pb
with respect to p + p, we hope to obtain insight into the color-charge and
quark mass dependence of the energy loss mechanism. The ALICE experiment with
its large acceptance is well suited to investigate the intermediate transverse
momentum spectrum of heavy flavor mesons where these energy loss effects are
expected to be visible. ALICE has very good electron PID capabilities over a
large kinematic range using Time Projection Chamber (TPC), Transition Radiation
Detector (TRD) and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). In addition the
EMCal, to be installed for the Pb + Pb runs, is planned to allow efficient
triggering on high-pT jets. We first introduce the EMCal project and an
overview of detector specifications. Then we introduce a method developed to
select preferentially electrons from heavy flavor decays by reconstructing
displaced secondary vertices. The strategy is to reconstruct displaced vertices
from semi-leptonic heavy flavor meson decays using the excellent spatial
resolution of the Inner Tracking System (ITS). We show preliminary results of
an efficiency study from charm vs. bottom vertices.
