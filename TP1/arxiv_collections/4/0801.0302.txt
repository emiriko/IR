Mesoscopic conductance fluctuations in graphene samples at energies not very
close to the Dirac point are studied analytically. We demonstrate that the
conductance variance $<[\delta G]^2>$ is very sensitive to the elastic
scattering breaking the valley symmetry. In the absence of such scattering
(disorder potential smooth at atomic scales, trigonal warping negligible), the
variance $<[\delta G]^2 > = 4 < [\delta G]^2 >_\text{metal}$ is four times
greater than that in conventional metals, which is due to the two-fold valley
degeneracy. In the absence of intervalley scattering, but for strong
intravalley scattering and/or strong warping $<[\delta G]^2 > =2 < [\delta G]^2
>_\text{metal}$. Only in the limit of strong intervalley scattering $<[\delta
G]^2 > = < [\delta G]^2 >_\text{metal}$. Our theory explains recent numerical
results and can be used for comparison with existing experiments.
