We theoretically calculate and compare the single-particle relaxation time
($\tau_s$) defining quantum level broadening and the transport scattering time
($\tau_t$) defining Drude conductivity in 2D graphene layers in the presence of
screened charged impurities scattering and short-range defect scattering. We
find that the ratio $\tau_t/\tau_s$ increases strongly with increasing $k_F
z_i$ and $\kappa$ where $k_F$, $z_i$, and $\kappa$ are respectively the Fermi
wave vector, the separation of the substrate charged impurities from the
graphene layer, and the background lattice dielectric constant. A critical
quantitative comparison of the $\tau_t/\tau_s$ results for graphene with the
corresponding modulation-doped semiconductor structures is provided, showing
significant differences between these two 2D carrier systems.
