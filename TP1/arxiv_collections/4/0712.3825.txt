Although the definition and measurement of intelligence is clearly of
fundamental importance to the field of artificial intelligence, no general
survey of definitions and tests of machine intelligence exists. Indeed few
researchers are even aware of alternatives to the Turing test and its many
derivatives. In this paper we fill this gap by providing a short survey of the
many tests of machine intelligence that have been proposed.
