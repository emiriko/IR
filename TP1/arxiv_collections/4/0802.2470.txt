It is widely considered that, for Higgs boson searches at the Large Hadron
Collider, WH and ZH production where the Higgs boson decays to b anti-b are
poor search channels due to large backgrounds. We show that at high transverse
momenta, employing state-of-the-art jet reconstruction and decomposition
techniques, these processes can be recovered as promising search channels for
the standard model Higgs boson around 120 GeV in mass.
