A new coding and queue management algorithm is proposed for communication
networks that employ linear network coding. The algorithm has the feature that
the encoding process is truly online, as opposed to a block-by-block approach.
The setup assumes a packet erasure broadcast channel with stochastic arrivals
and full feedback, but the proposed scheme is potentially applicable to more
general lossy networks with link-by-link feedback. The algorithm guarantees
that the physical queue size at the sender tracks the backlog in degrees of
freedom (also called the virtual queue size). The new notion of a node "seeing"
a packet is introduced. In terms of this idea, our algorithm may be viewed as a
natural extension of ARQ schemes to coded networks. Our approach, known as the
drop-when-seen algorithm, is compared with a baseline queuing approach called
drop-when-decoded. It is shown that the expected queue size for our approach is
$O(\frac1{1-\rho})$ as opposed to $\Omega(\frac1{(1-\rho)^2})$ for the baseline
approach, where $\rho$ is the load factor.
