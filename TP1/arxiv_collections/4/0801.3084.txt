We clarify the origin of anomalous tunneling [Yu. Kagan et al. Phys. Rev.
Lett. 90 (2003) 130402] i.e. the perfect transmission at low energy limit of
tunneling of phonon excitations across the potential barrier separating two
Bose condensates. The perfect transmission is a consequence of the coincidence
of the wave function of the excited state at low energy limit and the
macroscopic wave function of the condensate. We show that the perfect
transmission at low energy occurs even at finite temperatures within the scheme
of Popov approximation.
