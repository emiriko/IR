We perform a Faddeev calculation for the three mesons system, $\phi K
\bar{K}$, taking the interaction between two pseudoscalar mesons and between a
vector and a pseudoscalar meson from the chiral unitary approach. We obtain a
neat resonance peak around a total mass of 2150 MeV and an invariant mass for
the $K \bar{K}$ system around 970 MeV, very close to the $f_0(980)$ mass. The
state appears in I=0 and qualifies as a $\phi f_0(980)$ resonance. We enlarge
the space of states including $\phi \pi \pi$, since $\pi \pi$ and $K \bar{K}$
build up the $f_0$ (980), and find moderate changes that serve to quantify
theoretical uncertainties. No state is seen in I=1. This finding provides a
natural explanation for the recent state found at BABAR and BES, the X(2175),
which decays into $\phi f_0(980)$.
