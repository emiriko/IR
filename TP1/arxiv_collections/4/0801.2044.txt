Eigenfunctions for normal modes of scalar fields in BTZ black hole spacetime
are studied. Orthonormal relations among them are derived. Quantization for
scalar fields is done and particle number, energy and angular momentum are
expressed by the creation and annihilation operators. Allowed physical normal
mode region is studied on the basis of the no zero mode theorem. Its
implication to the statistical mechanics is also studied.
