In the framework of a chiral constituent quark model, considering the
contributions of $\pi$ annihilation and one-gluon annihilation, the
proton-antiproton $S$-wave elastic scattering cross section experimental data
can be reproduced by adjusting properly one-gluon annihilation coupling
constant. Meanwhile, using the fixed model parameter, we do a dynamical
calculation for all possible $S$-wave nucleon-antinucleon states, the results
show that, there is no $S$-wave bound state as indicated by a strong
enhancement at threshold of $p\bar{p}$ in $J/\psi$ and $B$ decays.
