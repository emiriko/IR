Applying the space-charge forces of a low-energy electron beam can lead to a
significant improvement of the beam-particle lifetime limit arising from the
beam-beam interaction in a high-energy collider [1]. In this article we present
the results of various beam experiments with electron lenses, novel instruments
developed for the beam-beam compensation at the Tevatron, which collides
980-GeV proton and antiproton beams. We study the dependencies of the particle
betatron tunes on the electron beam current, energy and position; we explore
the effects of electron-beam imperfections and noises; and we quantify the
improvements of the high-energy beam intensity and the collider luminosity
lifetime obtained by the action of the Tevatron Electron Lenses.
