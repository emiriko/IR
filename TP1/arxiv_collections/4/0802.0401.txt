We study the influence of nano-scale layers of converters made from natural
gadolinium and its 157 isotope into the total efficiency of registration of
thermal neutrons. Our estimations show that contribution of low-energy Auger
electrons with the runs about nanometers in gadolinium, to the total efficiency
of neutron converters in this case is essential and results in growth of the
total efficiency of converters. The received results are in good consent to the
experimental data.
