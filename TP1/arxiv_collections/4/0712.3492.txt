In order to enlarge the present arsenal of semiclassical toools we explicitly
obtain here the Husimi distributions and Wehrl entropy within the context of
deformed algebras built up on the basis of a new family of q-deformed coherent
states, those of Quesne [J. Phys. A 35, 9213 (2002)]. We introduce also a
generalization of the Wehrl entropy constructed with escort distributions. The
two generalizations are investigated with emphasis on i) their behavior as a
function of temperature and ii) the results obtained when the
deformation-parameter tends to unity.
