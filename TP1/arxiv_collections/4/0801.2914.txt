We study the long-time asymptotical behavior of the survival probability P_t
of a tagged monomer of an infinitely long Rouse chain in presence of two fixed
absorbing boundaries, placed at x = \pm L. Mean-square displacement of a tagged
monomer obeys \bar{X^2(t)} \sim t^{1/2} at all times, which signifies that its
dynamics is an anomalous diffusion process.
  Constructing lower and upper bounds on P_t, which have the same
time-dependence but slightly differ by numerical factors in the definition of
the characteristic relaxation time, we show that P_t is a stretched-exponential
function of time, \ln(P_t) \sim - t^{1/2}/L^2. This implies that the
distribution function of the first exit time from a fixed interval [-L,L] for
such an anomalous diffusion has all moments.
