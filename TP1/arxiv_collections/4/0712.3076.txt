We show that rocky shorelines with fractal dimension 4/3 are conformally
invariant curves by measuring the statistics of their winding angles from
global high-resolution data. Such coastlines are thus statistically equivalent
to the outer boundary of the random walk and of percolation clusters. A simple
model of coastal erosion gives an explanation for these results. Conformal
invariance allows also to predict the highly intermittent spatial distribution
of the flux of pollutant diffusing ashore.
