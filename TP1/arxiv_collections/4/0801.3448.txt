Platinum is widely used as a pressure calibration standard. However, the
established thermal EOS has uncertainties, especially in the high $P$-$T$
range. We use density functional theory to calculate the thermal equation of
state of platinum, up to 550 GPa and 5000 K. The static lattice energy is
computed by using the LAPW method, with LDA, PBE, and the recently proposed WC
functional. The electronic thermal free energy is evaluated using the Mermin
functional. The vibrational part is computed within the quasi-harmonic
approximation using density functional perturbation theory and
pseudopotentials. Special attention is paid to the influence of the electronic
temperature to the phonon frequencies. We find that in overall LDA results
agree best with the experiments. Based on the DFT calculations and the
established experimental data, we develop a consistent thermal EOS of platinum
as a reference for pressure calibration.
