We assess the prospect of observing a neutral Higgs boson at hadron colliders
in its decay to two spin-zero states, a, for a Higgs mass of 90-130 GeV, when
produced in association with a W or Z boson. Such a decay is allowed in
extensions of the MSSM with CP-violating interactions and in the NMSSM, and can
dominate Higgs boson final states, thereby evading the LEP constraints on
standard Higgs boson production. The light spin-zero state decays primarily via
a to bb and tau+tau-, so this signal channel retains features distinct from the
main backgrounds. Our study shows that at the Tevatron, there may be potential
to observe a few events in the bb tau+tau- or bbbb channels with relatively
small background, although this observation would be statistically limited. At
the LHC, the background problem is more severe, but with cross sections and
integrated luminosities orders of magnitude larger than at the Tevatron, the
observation of a Higgs boson in this decay mode would be possible. The channel
h to aa to bbbb would provide a large statistical significance, with a
signal-to-background ratio on the order of 1:2. In these searches, the main
challenge would be to retain the adequate tagging efficiency of b's and tau's
in the low p_T region.
