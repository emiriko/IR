We study the contribution of quantum phase fluctuations in the
superconducting order parameter to the low--temperature resistivity $\rho(T)$
of a dirty and inhomogeneous superconducting wire. In particular, we account
for random spatial fluctuations of arbitrary size in the wire thickness. For a
typical wire thickness above the critical value for superconductor--insulator
transition, phase--slips processes can be treated perturbatively. We use a
memory formalism approach, which underlines the role played by weak violation
of conservation laws in the mechanism for generating finite resistivity. Our
calculations yield an expression for $\rho(T)$ which exhibits a smooth
crossover from a homogeneous to a ``granular'' limit upon increase of $T$,
controlled by a ``granularity parameter'' $D$ characterizing the size of
thickness fluctuations. For extremely small $D$, we recover the power--law
dependence $\rho(T)\sim T^\alpha$ obtained by unbinding of quantum
phase--slips. However in the strongly inhomogeneous limit, the exponent
$\alpha$ is modified and the prefactor is {\em exponentially enhanced}. We
examine the dependence of the exponent $\alpha$ on an external magnetic field
applied parallel to the wire. Finally, we show that the power--law dependence
at low $T$ is consistent with a series of experimental data obtained in a
variety of long and narrow samples. The values of $\alpha$ extracted from the
data, and the corresponding field dependence, are consistent with known
parameters of the corresponding samples.
