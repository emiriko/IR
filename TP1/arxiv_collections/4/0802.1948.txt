Prima facie the systematic implementation of corrections to the
rainbow-ladder truncation of QCD's Dyson-Schwinger equations will uniformly
reduce in magnitude those calculated mass-dimensioned results for pseudoscalar
and vector meson properties that are not tightly constrained by symmetries. The
aim and interpretation of studies employing rainbow-ladder truncation are
reconsidered in this light.
