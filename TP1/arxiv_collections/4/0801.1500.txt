We investigate raytracing performance that can be achieved on a class of Blue
Gene supercomputers. We measure a 822 times speedup over a Pentium IV on a 6144
processor Blue Gene/L. We measure the computational performance as a function
of number of processors and problem size to determine the scaling performance
of the raytracing calculation on the Blue Gene. We find nontrivial scaling
behavior at large number of processors. We discuss applications of this
technology to scientific visualization with advanced lighting and high
resolution. We utilize three racks of a Blue Gene/L in our calculations which
is less than three percent of the the capacity of the worlds largest Blue Gene
computer.
