We study the BPS and non BPS black attractors in 7D N=2 supergravity embedded
in 11D M-theory compactified on K3. Combining Kahler and complex moduli in
terms of SO(3) representations, we build the Dalbeault like (DL) basis for the
second cohomology of K3 and set up the fundamental relations of the special
"hyperKahler" geometry of the underlying moduli space of the 7D theory. We
study the attractor eqs of the 7D black branes by using the method of the
criticality of the effective potential and also by using the extension of the
so called 4D new attractor approach to 7D N=2 supergravity. A comment,
regarding a 6D/7D correspondence, along the line of Ceresole-Ferrara-Marrani
used for 4D/5D, ref.arXiv:0707.0964, is made.
