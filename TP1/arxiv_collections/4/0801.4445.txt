We have succeeded in preparing A-site ordered- and disordered-Y1/4Sr3/4CoO3-d
with various oxygen deficiencies delta, and have made comparative study of
their structural and physical properties. In the A-site ordered structure,
oxygen vacancies order, and d = 0.34 sample shows a weak ferromagnetic
transition beyond 300 K. On the other hand, in the A-site disordered structure,
no oxygen vacancy ordering is observed, and d = 0.16 sample shows a
ferromagnetic metallic transition around 150 K. A-site disordering destroys the
orderings of oxygen-vacancies and orbitals, leading to the strong modification
of the electronic phases.
