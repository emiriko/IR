We report electronic control and measurement of an imbalance between spin-up
and spin-down electrons in micron-scale open quantum dots. Spin injection and
detection was achieved with quantum point contacts tuned to have spin-selective
transport, with four contacts per dot for realizing a non-local spin-valve
circuit. This provides an interesting system for studies of spintronic effects
since the contacts to reservoirs can be controlled and characterized with high
accuracy. We show how this can be used to extract in a single measurement the
relaxation time for electron spins inside the dot ~ 300 ps and the degree of
spin polarization of the contacts P ~ 0.8.
