Precise optical properties of metals are very important for accurate
prediction of the Casimir force acting between two metallic plates. Therefore
we measured ellipsometrically the optical responses of Au films in a wide range
of wavelengths from 0.14 mum to 33 mum. The films at various thickness were
deposited at different conditions on silicon or mica substrates. Considerable
variation of the frequency dependent dielectric function from sample to sample
was found. Detailed analysis of the dielectric functions was performed to check
the Kramers-Kronig consistency, and extract the Drude parameters of the films.
It was found that the plasma frequency varies in the range from 6.8 eV to 8.4
eV. It is suggested that this variation is related with the film density. X-ray
reflectivity measurements support qualitatively this conclusion. The Casimir
force is evaluated for the dielectric functions corresponding to our samples,
and for that typically used in the precise prediction of the force. The force
for our films was found to be 5-14% smaller at a distance of 100 nm between the
plates. Noise in the optical data is responsible for the force variation within
1%. It is concluded that prediction of the Casimir force between metals with a
precision better than 10% must be based on the material optical response
measured from visible to mid-infrared range.
