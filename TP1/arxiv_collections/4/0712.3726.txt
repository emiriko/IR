We analyze some extensions of General Relativity. Within the framework of
modified gravity, the Newtonian limit of a class of gravitational actions is
discussed on the basis of the corresponding scalar-tensor model. For a
generalized asymmetric metric, autoparallel trajectories are defined under
suitable conditions at first approximation order.
