This is a survey paper of our current research on the theory of partial
differential equations in conformal geometry. Our intention is to describe some
of our current works in a rather brief and expository fashion. We are not
giving a comprehensive survey on the subject and references cited here are not
intended to be complete. We introduce a bubble tree structure to study the
degeneration of a class of Yamabe metrics on Bach flat manifolds satisfying
some global conformal bounds on compact manifolds of dimension 4. As
applications, we establish a gap theorem, a finiteness theorem for
diffeomorphism type for this class, and diameter bound of the
$\sigma_2$-metrics in a class of conformal 4-manifolds. For conformally compact
Einstein metrics we introduce an eigenfunction compactification. As a
consequence we obtain some topological constraints in terms of renormalized
volumes.
