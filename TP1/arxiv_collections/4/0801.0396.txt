In earlier work, the first author outlined an algorithm for calculating a
parametrization of the conjugacy classes in a Sylow $p$-subgroup $U(q)$ of a
finite Chevalley group $G(q)$, valid when $q$ is a power of a good prime for
$G(q)$. In this paper we develop this algorithm and discuss an implementation
in the computer algebra language {\sf GAP}. Using the resulting computer
program we are able to calculate the parametrization of the conjugacy classes
in $U(q)$, when $G(q)$ is of rank at most 6. In these cases, we observe that
the number of conjugacy classes of $U(q)$ is given by a polynomial in $q$ with
integer coefficients.
