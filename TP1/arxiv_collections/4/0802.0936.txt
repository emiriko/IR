I will review the most recent and interesting results from gravitational wave
detection experiments, concentrating on recent results from the LIGO Scientific
Collaboration (LSC). I will outline the methodologies utilized in the searches,
explain what can be said in the case of a null result, what quantities may be
constrained. I will compare these results with prior expectations and discuss
their significance. As I go along I will outline the prospects for future
improvements.
