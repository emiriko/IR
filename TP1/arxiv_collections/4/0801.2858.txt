This thesis is divided in two parts. The first presents an overview of known
results in statistical mechanics of disordered systems and its approach to
random combinatorial optimization problems. The second part is a discussion of
two original results.
  The first result concerns DPLL heuristics for random k-XORSAT, which is
equivalent to the diluted Ising p-spin model. It is well known that DPLL is
unable to find the ground states in the clustered phase of the problem, i.e.
that it leads to contradictions with probability 1. However, no solid argument
supports this is general. A class of heuristics, which includes the well known
UC and GUC, is introduced and studied. It is shown that any heuristic in this
class must fail if the clause to variable ratio is larger than some constant,
which depends on the heuristic but is always smaller than the clustering
threshold.
  The second result concerns the properties of random k-SAT at large clause to
variable ratios. In this regime, it is well known that the uniform distribution
of random instances is dominated by unsatisfiable instances. A general
technique (based on the Replica method) to restrict the distribution to
satisfiable instances with uniform weight is introduced, and is used to
characterize their solutions. It is found that in the limit of large clause to
variable ratios, the uniform distribution of satisfiable random k-SAT formulas
is asymptotically equal to the much studied Planted distribution.
  Both results are already published and available as arXiv:0709.0367 and
arXiv:cs/0609101 . A more detailed and self-contained derivation is presented
here.
