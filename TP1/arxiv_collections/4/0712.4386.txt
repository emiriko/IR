The neutrino burst from a galactic supernova can help determine the neutrino
mass hierarchy and $\theta_{13}$, and provide crucial information about
supernova astrophysics. Here we review our current understanding of the
neutrino burst, flavor conversions of these neutrinos, and model independent
signatures of various neutrino mixing scenarios.
