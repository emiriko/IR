Our knowledge of the nucleon spin structure has greatly improved over the
last twenty years or so, but still many fundamental questions remain unsolved.
I will try to review some of the puzzling aspects of the structure of the
nucleon spin, in particular, what is known, what remains to be discovered and
the prospects for the near future. I will also focus on some current activities
in QCD spin physics.
