It is shown that, by theoretical and experimental results, a universal
zero-impedance condition exists for two kinds of localized interface modes in
the whole momentum space (both above and below the light line). It can be
applied at the interface between any two materials including photonic crystals,
single-negative (negative-permittivity or negative-permeability) materials, or
double-negative metamaterials. In addition, it presents an intuitive physical
concept, and also provides a feasible way to determine interface modes, which
will have predominance in various applications.
