We use Lagrange multipliers to extend the traditional definition of
Transverse Mass used in experimental high energy physics. We demonstrate the
method by implementing it to derive a new Transverse Mass that can be used as a
discriminator to distinguish between top decays via a charged W or a charged
Higgs Boson.
