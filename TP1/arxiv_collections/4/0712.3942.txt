The subject of limit curve theorems in Lorentzian geometry is reviewed. A
general limit curve theorem is formulated which includes the case of converging
curves with endpoints and the case in which the limit points assigned since the
beginning are one, two or at most denumerable. Some applications are
considered. It is proved that in chronological spacetimes, strong causality is
either everywhere verified or everywhere violated on maximizing lightlike
segments with open domain. As a consequence, if in a chronological spacetime
two distinct lightlike lines intersect each other then strong causality holds
at their points. Finally, it is proved that two distinct components of the
chronology violating set have disjoint closures or there is a lightlike line
passing through each point of the intersection of the corresponding boundaries.
