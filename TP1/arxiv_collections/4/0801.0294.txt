In this paper, we drive and simplify some important equations and relations
for an evolving star with spherical symmetry, and then give some simple
analysis for their properties and implications. In the light-cone coordinate
system, these equations and relations have a normal and neat form which is much
accessible than the usual Einstein field equation. So they may be helpful for
students to study general relativity and for researchers to do further
discussion.
