Quantum interference effects and resulting quantum corrections of the
conductivity have been intensively studied in disordered conductors over the
last decades. The knowledge of phase coherence lengths and underlying dephasing
mechanisms are crucial to understand quantum corrections to the resistivity in
the different material systems. Due to the internal magnetic field and the
associated breaking of time-reversal symmetry quantum interference effects in
ferromagnetic materials have been scarcely explored. Below we describe the
investigation of phase coherent transport phenomena in the newly discovered
ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As. We explore universal conductance
fluctuations in mesoscopic (Ga,Mn)As wires and rings, the Aharonov-Bohm effect
in nanoscale rings and weak localization in arrays of wires, made of the
ferromagnetic semiconductor material. The experiments allow to probe the phase
coherence length L_phi and the spin flip length L_SO as well as the temperature
dependence of dephasing.
