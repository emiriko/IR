We consider a simplified Boltzmann equation: spatially homogeneous,
two-dimensional, radially symmetric, with Grad's angular cutoff, and linearized
around its initial condition. We prove that for a sufficiently singular
velocity cross section, the solution may become instantaneously a function,
even if the initial condition is a singular measure. To our knowledge, this is
the first regularization result in the case with cutoff: all the previous
results were relying on the non-integrability of the angular cross section.
Furthermore, our result is quite surprising: the regularization occurs for
initial conditions that are not too singular, but also not too regular. The
objective of the present work is to explain that the singularity of the
velocity cross section, which is often considered as a (technical) obstacle to
regularization, seems on the contrary to help the regularization.
