We extend our previous results on small-x resummation in the pure Yang--Mills
theory to full QCD with nf quark flavours, with a resummed two-by-two matrix of
resummed quark and gluon splitting functions. We also construct the
corresponding deep-inelastic coefficient functions, and show how these can be
combined with parton densities to give fully resummed deep-inelastic structure
functions F_2 and F_L at the next-to-leading logarithmic level. We discuss how
this resummation can be performed in different factorization schemes, including
the commonly used MSbar scheme. We study the importance of the resummation
effects by comparison with fixed-order perturbative results, and we discuss the
corresponding renormalization and factorization scale variation uncertainties.
We find that for x below 0.01 the resummation effects are comparable in size to
the fixed order NNLO corrections, but differ in shape. We finally discuss the
phenomenological impact of the small-x resummation, specifically in the
extraction of parton distribution from present day experiments and their
extrapolation to the kinematics relevant for future colliders such as the LHC
