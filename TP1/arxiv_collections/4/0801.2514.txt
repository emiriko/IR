We examine the properties of a quantum reflection trap when
particle-interaction is included. We explore the influence of the
particle-interaction on the trapping for different regimes: repulsive
particle-interaction and attractive particle-interaction in its stable and
unstable limit. With variational techniques, we calculate the phase-diagram of
the quatum reflection trap and determine the stable and unstable regimes of the
system.
