We study the effects of spin transfer on thermally activated dynamics of
magnetic nanopillars with identical thicknesses of the magnetic layers. The
symmetric nanopillars exhibit anomalous dependencies of switching statistics on
magnetic field and current. We interpret our data in terms of simultaneous
current-induced excitation of both layers. We also find evidence for coupling
between the fluctuations of the layers due to the spin transfer.
