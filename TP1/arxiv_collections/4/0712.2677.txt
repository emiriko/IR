Single-spin asymmetries $A_N$ in reactions p+p(pol)->\pi^0 + X and
\pi^-+p(pol)->\pi^0 + X at 50 and 40 GeV/c respectively behave in drastically
different ways in function of transverse momentum in the central region. At the
same time $A_N$ in the polarized proton fragmentation region of these reactions
are practically coinciding. Our new data on the analyzing power at 50 GeV/c in
the polarized proton fragmentation region in reaction p+p(pol)->\pi^0 + X
confirm this conclusion with better statistics and coincide with our previous
data at 70 GeV/c for the same reaction.
