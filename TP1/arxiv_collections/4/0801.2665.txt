Let G be a finite group and let p be a prime. A module for G over a field of
characteristic p is called algebraic if it satisfies a polynomial, with
addition and multiplication given by direct sum and tensor product. In some
sense, having this property is equivalent to the tensor structure being 'nice'
for that module.
  In this paper we prove that if G is a group with abelian Sylow 2-subgroups,
and p=2, then all simple modules for G are algebraic. We include the conjecture
that this result holds for all abelian 2-blocks.
