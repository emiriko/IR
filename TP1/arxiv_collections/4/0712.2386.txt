The Method of Invariant Grid (MIG) is a model reduction technique based on
the concept of slow invariant manifold (SIM), which approximates the SIM by a
set of nodes in the concentration space (invariant grid). In the present work,
the MIG is applied to a realistic combustion system: An adiabatic constant
volume reactor with H2-air at stoichiometric proportions. By considering the
thermodynamic Lyapunov function of the detailed kinetic system, the notion of
the quasi-equilibrium manifold (QEM) is adopted as an initial approximation to
the SIM. One- and two-dimensional discrete approximations of the QEM
(quasi-equilibrium grids) are constructed and refined via the MIG to obtain the
corresponding invariant grids. The invariant grids are tabulated and used to
integrate the reduced system. Excellent agreements between the reduced and
detailed kinetics is demonstrated.
