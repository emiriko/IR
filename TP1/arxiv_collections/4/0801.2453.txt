At high e-foldings of expansion, the inflation with the quartic potential
exhibits the parametric attractor governed by the slowly running Hubble rate.
This quasiattractor simplifies the analysis of predictions for the
inhomogeneity generated by the quantum fluctuations of inflaton. The method
reveals the connection of inflation e-folding with general parameters of
preheating regime in various scenarios and observational data.
