Using non-equilibrium Green functions we calculate the spin-polarized current
and shot noise in a ferromagnet--quantum-dot--ferromagnet (FM-QD-FM) system.
Both parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) magnetic configurations are considered.
Coulomb interaction and coherent spin-flip (similar to a transverse magnetic
field) are taken into account within the dot. We find that the interplay
between Coulomb interaction and spin accumulation in the dot can result in a
bias-dependent current polarization $\wp$. In particular, $\wp$ can be
suppressed in the P alignment and enhanced in the AP case depending on the bias
voltage. The coherent spin-flip can also result in a switch of the current
polarization from the emitter to the collector lead. Interestingly, for a
particular set of parameters it is possible to have a polarized current in the
collector and an unpolarized current in the emitter lead. We also found a
suppression of the Fano factor to values well below 0.5.
