The present paper deals with an application of the analytical thermal
simulator DJOSER. It consist of the characterization of a water speed sensor
realized in hybrid technology. The capability of the thermal solver to manage
the convection heat exchange and the effects of the passivating layers make the
simulation work easy and fast.
