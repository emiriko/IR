We study neutrino induced one-pion production off the nucleon in and around
the Delta resonance region. Apart from the Delta-pole mechanism we include
background terms required by chiral symmetry. These background terms give
sizeable contributions in all channels. To better reproduce the ANL
$q^2$-differential cross section data, we make a new fit of the $C_5^A(q^2)$
axial nucleon to Delta form factor. The new result $C_5^A(0)=0.867\pm 0.075$ is
some 30% smaller than the commonly accepted value.
  This correction is compatible with most quark model estimates and a recent
lattice calculation
