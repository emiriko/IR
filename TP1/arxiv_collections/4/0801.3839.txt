We calculate gravitational form factors of vector mesons using a holographic
model of QCD. These provide restrictions on the generalized parton
distributions of vector mesons, via the sum rules connecting stress tensor form
factors to GPDs. We concentrate on the traceless part of the stress tensor,
which suffices to fix the momentum and angular momentum sum rules. The vector
mesons appear noticeably more compact measured by the gravitational form
factors than by the charge form factor.
