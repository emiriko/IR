We study electron transport through a quantum dot, connected to non-magnetic
leads, in a magnetic field. A super-Poissonian electron noise due to the
effects of both interacting localized states and dynamic channel blockade is
found when the Coulomb blockade is partially lifted. This is sharp contrast to
the sub-Poissonian shot noise found in the previous studies for a large bias
voltage, where the Coulomb blockade is completely lifted. Moreover, we show
that the super-Poissonian shot noise can be suppressed by applying an electron
spin resonance (ESR) driving field. For a sufficiently strong ESR driving field
strength, the super-Poissonian shot noise will change to be sub-Poissonian.
