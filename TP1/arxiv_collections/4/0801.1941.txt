An active method for long time storage of quantum superposition state in
atomic system using the Oscillating Dark States (ODS) is presented. Quantum
state of a three-level $\Lambda$ configuration atomic system oscillates
periodically between two ground levels, when two pairs of classical detuning
laser fields driving the system into the ODS under evolving adiabatic
conditions. When considering another uploading/unloading adiabatic conditions
and applying the oscillation of the ODS to quantum state storage, surprisingly,
we can obtain the greatly suppressed decoherence of the system and high
fidelity of the retrieved state, even if decay factor of coherence term of the
system density matrix $\gamma_{21}$$\cdot$ $t$$ \gg$1. The storage time is not
limited by coherence decay time of the atomic system any longer, and can be
thousands of times longer than that in those passive schemes without additional
laser fields.
