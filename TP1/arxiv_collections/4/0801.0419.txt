We show that the projection postulate plays a crucial role in the discussion
on the so called "quantum nonlocality", in particular in the EPR-argument. We
stress that the original von Neumann projection postulate was crucially
modified by extending it to observables with degenerate spectra (the L\"uders
postulate) and we show that this modification is highly questionable from a
physical point of view, and it is the real source of "quantum nonlocality". The
use of the original von Neumann postulate eliminates this problem: instead of
"action at the distance"-nonlocality, we obtain a classical measurement
nonlocality. It seems that EPR did mistake in their 1935-paper: if one uses
correctly von Neumann projection postulate, no ``elements of reality'' can be
assigned to entangled systems. Our analysis of the EPR and projection postulate
makes clearer Bohr's considerations in his reply to Einstein.
