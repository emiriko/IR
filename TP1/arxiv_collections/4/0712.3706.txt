The purpose of this paper is to review some elasticity effects in epitaxial
growth. We start by a description of the main ingredients needed to describe
elasticity effects (elastic interactions, surface stress, bulk and surface
elasticity, thermodynamics of stressed solids). Then we describe how bulk and
surface elasticity affect growth mode and surface morphology by means of
stress-driven instability. At last stress-strain evolution during crystal
growth is reported.
