A Bayesian procedure is developed for multivariate stochastic volatility,
using state space models. An autoregressive model for the log-returns is
employed. We generalize the inverted Wishart distribution to allow for
different correlation structure between the observation and state innovation
vectors and we extend the convolution between the Wishart and the multivariate
singular beta distribution. A multiplicative model based on the generalized
inverted Wishart and multivariate singular beta distributions is proposed for
the evolution of the volatility and a flexible sequential volatility updating
is employed. The proposed algorithm for the volatility is fast and
computationally cheap and it can be used for on-line forecasting. The methods
are illustrated with an example consisting of foreign exchange rates data of 8
currencies. The empirical results suggest that time-varying correlations can be
estimated efficiently, even in situations of high dimensional data.
