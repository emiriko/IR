We study quantum systems with broken symmetry that can be modelled as cyclic
three-level atoms with coexisting one- and two-photon transitions. They can be
selectively optically excited to any state. As an example, we show that left-
and right-handed chiral molecules starting in the same initial states can
evolve into different final states by a purely dynamic transfer process. That
means, left- and right-handed molecules can be distinguished purely
dynamically.
