We show how to differentiate the minimal supersymmetric extension of the
standard model from black hole events at the Large Hadron Collider. Black holes
are simulated with the CATFISH generator. Supersymmetry simulations use a
combination of PYTHIA and ISAJET. Our study, based on event shape variables,
visible and missing momenta, and analysis of dilepton events, demonstrates that
supersymmetry and black hole events at the LHC can be easily discriminated.
