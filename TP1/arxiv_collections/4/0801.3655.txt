Current-induced magnetic switching of a single magnetic molecule attached to
two ferromagnetic contacts is considered theoretically, with the main emphasis
put on the role of intrinsic spin relaxation processes. It is shown that
spin-polarized current can switch magnetic moment of the molecule, despite of
the intrinsic spin relaxation in the molecule. The latter processes increase
the threshold voltage (current) above which the switching takes place.
