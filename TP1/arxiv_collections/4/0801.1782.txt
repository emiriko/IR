Positivity restrains the allowed domains for pairs or triples of spin
observables in polarised reactions. Various domain shapes in
${1\over2}+{1\over2}\to{1\over2}+{1\over2}$ reactions are displayed. Some
methods to determine these domains are mentioned and a new one based on the
anticommutation between two observables is presented.
