In recent years, many efforts have been addressed on collision avoidance of
collectively moving agents. In this paper, we propose a modified version of the
Vicsek model with adaptive speed, which can guarantee the absence of
collisions. However, this strategy leads to an aggregated state with slowly
moving agents. We therefore further introduce a certain repulsion, which
results in both faster consensus and longer safe distance among agents, and
thus provides a powerful mechanism for collective motions in biological and
technological multi-agent systems.
