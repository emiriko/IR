The structural and electronic properties of gold decorated Si(335) surface
are studied by means of density-functional calculations. The resulting
structural model indicates that the Au atoms substitute some of the Si atoms in
the middle of the terrace in the surface layer. Calculated electronic band
structure near the Fermi energy features two metallic bands, one coming from
the step edge Si atoms and the other one having its origin in hybridization
between the Au and neighboring Si atoms in the middle of the terrace. The
obtained electronic bands remain in good agreement with photoemission data.
