The current status of the experimental measurements and theoretical
predictions of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $a_\mu$ is briefly
reviewed. The emphasis is put on the evaluation of the hadronic contribution to
$a_\mu$ as it has the largest uncertainty among all Standard Model
contributions. The precision of the hadronic contribution is driven by the
input e+e- data predominantly from the \pi+pi- channel. Including the latest
experimental data on e+e- annihilation into hadronsfrom CMD2 and SND for the
\pi+\pi- channel and BaBar for multihadron final states, the updated Standard
Model prediction disagrees with the measurement dominated by BNL by 3.3
standard deviations, with the theoretical precision exceeding the experimental
one.
