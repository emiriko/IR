The Taylor coefficients of flavor diagonal and off-diagonal susceptibilities
as well as baryon number, isovector and electric charge susceptibilities are
considered within a phenomenological quasiparticle model of the quark-gluon
plasma and successfully compared with lattice QCD data for two degenerate quark
flavors. These susceptibility coefficients represent sensible probes of baryon
density effects in the equation of state. The baryon charge is carried, in our
model, by quark-quasiparticle excitations for hard momenta.
