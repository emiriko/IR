Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) have recently been recognized as an
important future technique for microelectronics. Such SPPs have been studied
using classical theory. However, current state-of-the-art experiments are
rapidly approaching nanoscales, and quantum effects can then become important.
Here we study the properties of quantum SPPs at the interface between an
electron quantum plasma and a dielectric material. It is shown that the effect
of quantum broadening of the transition layer is most important. In particular,
the damping of SPPs does not vanish even in the absence of collisional
dissipation, thus posing a fundamental size limit for plasmonic devices.
Consequences and applications of our results are pointed out.
