The Dzialoshinskii model of periodic and helicoidal structures has been
analyzed without neglecting of the amplitude function oscillations. The
amplitude function oscillations are shown to be important for understanding of
the nature of the phase function. Analytic consideration is carried out in the
limit of small anisotropy (neglecting the cosine term in the Hamiltonian).
Surprisingly, the phase jumps survive even in the limit of the vanishing
anisotropy.
