The nucleon strange and anti-strange distribution asymmetry is an important
issue in the study of the nucleon structure. In this work, we show that the
heavy quark recombination processes from a perturbative QCD picture can give a
sizable influence on the measurement of the nucleon strangeness asymmetry from
charged-current charm production processes, such as the CCFR and NuTeV dimuon
measurements. When the influence of heavy quark recombination is considered, a
positive effective $\delta S^-_{\mathrm{HR}}$ should be added to the initially
extracted strangeness asymmetry $S^-\equiv\int dx[s(x)-\bar s(x)]x$, supporting
the strangeness asymmetry $S^-$ being positive, which is helpful to explain the
NuTeV anomaly within the framework of the standard model.
