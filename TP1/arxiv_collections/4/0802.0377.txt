We present a new method to introduce phase-space fluctuations in transport
theories, corresponding to a full implementation of the Boltzmann-Langevin
equation for fermionic systems. It is based on the procedure originally
developed by Bauer et al. for transport codes employing the test particle
method. In the new procedure, the Pauli principle is carefully checked, leading
to a good reproduction of the correct fluctuations in the ``continuum limit''
($h \to 0$). Accurate tests are carried out in one and two dimensional
idealized systems, and finally results for a full 3D application are shown. We
stress the reliability of this method, which can be easily plugged into
existing tranport codes using test particles, and its general applicability to
systems characterized by instabilities, like for instance multifragmentation
processes.
