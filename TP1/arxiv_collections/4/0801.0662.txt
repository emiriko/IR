The exact partition function of the two-dimensional nearest neighbour Ising
model pertaining to square lattices is derived for N sites in the case of a
non-vanishing magnetic field.When the magnetic field is zero,the partition
functions estimated from the present analysis are identical with those arising
from Onsager's exact solution.
