A foundation of quantum mechanics based on the concepts of focusing and
symmetry is proposed. Focusing is connected to c-variables - inaccessible
conceptually derived variables; several examples of such variables are given.
The focus is then on a maximal accessible parameter, a function of the common
c-variable. Symmetry is introduced via a group acting on the c-variable. From
this, the Hilbert space is constructed and state vectors and operators are
given a clear interpretation. The Born formula is proved from weak assumptions,
and from this the usual rules of quantum mechanics are derived. Several
paradoxes and other issues of quantum theory are discussed.
