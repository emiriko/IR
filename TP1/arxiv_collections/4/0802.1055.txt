We present an exact solution of percolation in a generalized class of
Watts-Strogatz graphs defined on a 1-dimensional underlying lattice. We find a
non-classical critical point in the limit of the number of long-range bonds in
the system going to zero, with a discontinuity in the percolation probability
and a divergence in the mean finite-cluster size. We show that the critical
behavior falls into one of three regimes depending on the proportion of
occupied long-range to unoccupied nearest-neighbor bonds, with each regime
being characterized by different critical exponents. The three regimes can be
united by a single scaling function around the critical point. These results
can be used to identify the number of long-range links necessary to secure
connectivity in a communication or transportation chain. As an example, we can
resolve the communication problem in a game of "telephone".
