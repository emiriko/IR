The close theoretical analogy between the physics of rapidly rotating atomic
Bose condensates and the quantum Hall effect (i.e., a two dimensional electron
gas in a strong magnetic field) was first pointed out ten years ago. As a
consequence of this analogy, a large number of strongly correlated quantum
Hall-type states have been predicted to occur in rotating Bose systems, and
suggestions have been made how to manipulate and observe their fractional
quasiparticle excitations. Due to a very rapid development in experimental
techniques over the past years, experiments on BEC now appear to be close to
reaching the quantum Hall regime. This paper reviews the theoretical and
experimental work done to date in exploring quantum Hall physics in cold
bosonic gases. Future perspectives are discussed briefly, in particular the
idea of exploiting some of these strongly correlated states in the context of
topological quantum computing.
