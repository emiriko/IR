Weak affine light typing (WALT) assigns light affine linear formulae as types
to a subset of lambda-terms in System F. WALT is poly-time sound: if a
lambda-term M has type in WALT, M can be evaluated with a polynomial cost in
the dimension of the derivation that gives it a type. In particular, the
evaluation can proceed under any strategy of a rewriting relation, obtained as
a mix of both call-by-name/call-by-value beta-reductions. WALT is poly-time
complete since it can represent any poly-time Turing machine. WALT weakens,
namely generalizes, the notion of stratification of deductions common to some
Light Systems -- we call as such those logical systems, derived from Linear
logic, to characterize FP, the set of Polynomial functions -- . A weaker
stratification allows to define a compositional embedding of the Quasi-linear
fragment QlSRN of Safe recursion on notation (SRN) into WALT. QlSRN is SRN,
which is a recursive-theoretical system characterizing FP, where only the
composition scheme is restricted to linear safe variables. So, the expressivity
of WALT is stronger, as compared to the known Light Systems. In particular,
using the types, the embedding puts in evidence the stratification of normal
and safe arguments hidden in QlSRN: the less an argument is impredicative, the
deeper, in a formal, proof-theoretical sense, gets its representation in WALT.
