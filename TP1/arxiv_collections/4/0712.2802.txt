The quasiclassical solution to the extended Toda chain hierarchy,
corresponding to the deformation of the simplest Seiberg-Witten theory by all
descendants of the dual topological string model, is constructed explicitly in
terms of the complex curve and generating differential. The first derivatives
of prepotential or quasiclassical tau-function over the extra times, extending
the Toda chain, are expressed through the multiple integrals of the
Seiberg-Witten one-form. We derive the corresponding quasiclassical Virasoro
constraints, discuss the functional formulation of the problem and propose
generalization of the extended Toda hierarchy to the nonabelian theory.
