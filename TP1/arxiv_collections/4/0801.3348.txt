We consider the Brownian market model and the problem of expected utility
maximization of terminal wealth. We, specifically, examine the problem of
maximizing the utility of terminal wealth under the presence of transaction
costs of a fund/agent investing in futures markets. We offer some preliminary
remarks about statistical arbitrage strategies and we set the framework for
futures markets, and introduce concepts such as margin, gearing and slippage.
The setting is of discrete time, and the price evolution of the futures prices
is modelled as discrete random sequence involving Ito's sums. We assume the
drift and the Brownian motion driving the return process are non-observable and
the transaction costs are represented by the bid-ask spread. We provide
explicit solution to the optimal portfolio process, and we offer an example
using logarithmic utility.
