The structure of Collapse Models is investigated in the framework of Quantum
Measure Theory, a histories-based approach to quantum mechanics. The underlying
structure of coupled classical and quantum systems is elucidated in this
approach which puts both systems on a spacetime footing. The nature of the
coupling is exposed: the classical histories have no dynamics of their own but
are simply tied, more or less closely, to the quantum histories.
