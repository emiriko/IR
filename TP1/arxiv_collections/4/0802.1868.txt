We extend the Hertz-Millis theory of quantum phase transitions in itinerant
electron systems to phases with broken discrete symmetry. Using a set of
coupled flow equations derived within the functional renormalization group
framework, we compute the second order phase transition line T_c(delta), with
delta a non-thermal control parameter, near a quantum critical point. We
analyze the interplay and relative importance of quantum and classical
fluctuations at different energy scales, and we compare the Ginzburg
temperature T_G to the transition temperature T_c, the latter being associated
with a non-Gaussian fixed-point.
