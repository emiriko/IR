Using improved experimentally based $X{}^1\Sigma^+$ and $a{}^3\Sigma^+$
molecular potentials of NaRb, we apply the variable phase method to compute new
data for low energy scattering of $^{23}$Na atoms by $^{85}$Rb atoms and
$^{87}$Rb atoms. These are the scattering lengths and volumes, numbers of bound
states and effective ranges, which we use to obtain the low energy spin-change
cross section as functions of the system temperature and the isotope masses.
  From an analysis of the contributions of s-wave and p-wave scatterings to the
elastic cross section we estimate temperatures below which only s-wave
scattering is dominant. We compare our quantal results to data obtained from
the semiclassical approximation. We supply evidence for the existence of a near
zero energy p-wave bound state supported by the singlet molecular potential.
