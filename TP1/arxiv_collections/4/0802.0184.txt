We construct different integrable generalizations of the massive Thirring
equations corresponding loop algebras $\widetilde{\mathfrak{g}}^{\sigma}$ in
different gradings and associated ''triangular'' $R$-operators. We consider the
most interesting cases connected with the Coxeter automorphisms, second order
automorphisms and with ''Kostant-Adler-Symes'' $R$-operators. We recover a
known matrix generalization of the complex Thirring equations as a partial case
of our construction.
