Recent advances in manipulating single electron spins in quantum dots have
brought us close to the realization of classical logic gates based on
representing binary bits in spin polarizations of single electrons. Here, we
show that a linear array of three quantum dots, each containing a single spin
polarized electron, and with nearest neighbor exchange coupling, acts as the
universal NAND gate. The energy dissipated during switching this gate is the
Landauer-Shannon limit of kTln(1/p) [T = ambient temperature and p = intrinsic
gate error probability]. With present day technology, p = 1E-9 is achievable
above 1 K temperature. Even with this small intrinsic error probability, the
energy dissipated during switching the NAND gate is only ~ 21 kT, while today's
nanoscale transistors dissipate about 40,000 - 50,000 kT when they switch.
