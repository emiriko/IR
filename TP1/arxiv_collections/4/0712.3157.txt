Unstable modes in asymmetric nuclear matter (ANM) at subsaturation densities
are studied in the framework of relativistic mean-field density-dependent
hadron models. The size of the instabilities that drive the system are
calculated and a comparison with results obtained within the non-linear Walecka
model is presented. The distillation and anti-distillation effects are
discussed.
