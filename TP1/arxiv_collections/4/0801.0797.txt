In this paper, we investigate the emergence of a predator-prey model with
Beddington-DeAngelis-type functional response and reaction-diffusion. We derive
the conditions for Hopf and Turing bifurcation on the spatial domain. Based on
the stability and bifurcation analysis, we give the spatial pattern formation
via numerical simulation, i.e., the evolution process of the model near the
coexistence equilibrium point. We find that for the model we consider, pure
Turing instability gives birth to the spotted pattern, pure Hopf instability
gives birth to the spiral wave pattern, and both Hopf and Turing instability
give birth to stripe-like pattern. Our results show that reaction-diffusion
model is an appropriate tool for investigating fundamental mechanism of complex
spatiotemporal dynamics. It will be useful for studying the dynamic complexity
of ecosystems.
