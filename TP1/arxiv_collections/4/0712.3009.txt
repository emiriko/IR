We study logarithmically enhanced electromagnetic corrections to the decay
rate in the high dilepton invariant mass region as well as corrections to the
forward backward asymmetry (FBA) of the inclusive rare decay $\bar{B} \to X_s
\ell^+ \ell^-$. As expected, the relative effect of these corrections in the
high dilepton mass region is around -8% for the muonic final state and
therefore much larger than in the low dilepton mass region.
  We also present a complete phenomenological analysis, to improved NNLO
accuracy, of the dilepton mass spectrum and the FBA integrated in the low
dilepton mass region, including a new approach to the zero of the FBA. The
latter represents one of the most precise predictions in flavour physics with a
theoretical uncertainty of order 5%. We find $(q_0^2)_{\mu\mu} = (3.50 \pm
0.12) \gev^2$. For the high dilepton invariant mass region, we have ${\cal
B}(\bar B\to X_s\mu\mu)_{\rm high} = (2.40^{+0.69}_{-0.62}) \times 10^{-7}$.
The dominant uncertainty is due to the $1/m_b$ corrections and can be
significantly reduced in the future. For the low dilepton invariant mass
region, we confirm previous results up to small corrections.
