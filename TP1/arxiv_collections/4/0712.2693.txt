We consider a minimal extension of the standard model where a real, gauge
singlet scalar field is added to the standard spectrum. Introducing the Ansatz
of universality of scalar couplings, we are led to a scenario which has a set
of very distinctive and testable predictions: (i) the mixing between the
standard model Higgs and the new state is near maximal, (ii) the ratio of the
two Higgs mass eigenstates is fixed ($\sim \sqrt{3}$), (iii) the decay modes of
each of the two eigenstates are standard model like. We also study how
electroweak precision tests constrain this scenario. We predict the lighter
Higgs to lie in the range of 114 and 145 GeV, and hence the heavier one between
198 and 250 GeV. The predictions of the model can be tested at the upcoming
LHC.
