We suggest a new practical scheme for the direct detection of pure spin
current by using the two-color Faraday rotation of optical quantum interference
process (QUIP) in a semiconductor system. We demonstrate theoretically that the
Faraday rotation of QUIP depends sensitively on the spin orientation and wave
vector of the carriers, and can be tuned by the relative phase and the
polarization direction of the $\omega$ and $2\omega$ laser beams. By adjusting
these parameters, the magnitude and direction of the spin current can be
detected.
