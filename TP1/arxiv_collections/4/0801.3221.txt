We investigate the stochastic dynamics of a particle in the presence of a
modulated sinusoidal potential. Using the time derivative of the winding
number, we quantify the particle's motion according to its running time, the
time it runs monotonically to the left or right. For a range of model
parameters, we show that, in the overdamped regime, the particle's motion in
this modulated washboard potential exhibits stochastic resonance. We briefly
suggest possible applications of our results, including the amplification of
signals for measurement devices and in stimulated tunneling of Bose-Einstein
condensates.
