The LULU operators for sequences are extended to multi-dimensional arrays via
the morphological concept of connection in a way which preserves their
essential properties, e.g. they are separators and form a four element fully
ordered semi-group. The power of the operators is demonstrated by deriving a
total variation preserving discrete pulse decomposition of images.
