We transpose work by K.Yajima and by T.Mizumachi to prove dispersive and
smoothing estimates for dispersive solutions of the linearization at a ground
state of a Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) in 2D. As an application we
extend to dimension 2D a result on asymptotic stability of ground states of NLS
proved in the literature for all dimensions different from 2.
