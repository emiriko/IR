Subwavelength aperture arrays in thin metal films can enable enhanced
transmission of light and matter (atom) waves. The phenomenon relies on
resonant excitation and interference of the plasmon or matter waves on the
metal surface. We show a new mechanism that could provide a great resonant and
nonresonant transmission enhancement of the light or de Broglie particle waves
passed through the apertures not by the surface waves, but by the constructive
interference of diffracted waves (beams generated by the apertures) at the
detector placed in the far-field zone. In contrast to other models, the
mechanism depends neither on the nature (light or matter) of the beams
(continuous waves or pulses) nor on material and shape of the multiple-beam
source (arrays of 1-D and 2-D subwavelength apertures, fibers, dipoles or
atoms). The Wood anomalies in transmission spectra of gratings, a long standing
problem in optics, follow naturally from the interference properties of our
model. The new point is the prediction of the Wood anomaly in a classical
Young-type two-source system. The new mechanism could be interpreted as a
non-quantum analog of the superradiance emission of a subwavelength ensemble of
atoms (the light power and energy scales as the number of light-sources
squared, regardless of periodicity) predicted by the well-known Dicke quantum
model.
