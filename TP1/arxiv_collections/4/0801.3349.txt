The nuclear shadowing and antishadowing effects are explained by a unitarized
BFKL equation. The $Q^2$- and $x$-variations of the nuclear parton
distributions are detailed based on the level of the unintegrated gluon
distribution. In particular, the asymptotical behavior of the unintegrated
gluon distribution near the saturation limit in nuclear targets is studied. Our
results in the nuclear targets are insensitive to the input distributions if
the parameters are fixed by the data of a free proton.
