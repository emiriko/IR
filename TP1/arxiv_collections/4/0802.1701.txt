We demonstrate that virtual excitations of higher radial modes in an atomic
Bose gas in a tightly confining waveguide result in effective three-body
collisions that violate integrability in this quasi-one-dimensional quantum
system and give rise to thermalization. The estimated thermalization rates are
consistent with recent experimental results in quasi-1D dynamics of ultracold
atoms.
