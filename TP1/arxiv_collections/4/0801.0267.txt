In this article, we take the point of view that the bottomed $(0^+,1^+)$
mesons $B_{s0}$ and $B_{s1}$ are the conventional $b\bar{s}$ meson, and
calculate the strong coupling constants $g_{B_{s0} B K}$ and $g_{B_{s1} B^* K}$
with the light-cone QCD sum rules. The numerical values of strong coupling
constants $g_{B_{s1} B^* K}$ and $g_{B_{s0} B K}$ are very large, and support
the hadronic dressing mechanism. Just like the scalar mesons $f_0(980)$,
$a_0(980)$, $D_{s0}$ and axial-vector meson $D_{s1}$, the $(0^+,1^+)$ bottomed
mesons $B_{s0}$ and $B_{s1}$ may have small $b\bar{s}$ kernels of the typical
$b\bar{s}$ meson size, the strong couplings to the hadronic channels (or the
virtual mesons loops) may result in smaller masses than the conventional
$b\bar{s}$ mesons in the potential quark models, and enrich the pure $b\bar{s}$
states with other components.
