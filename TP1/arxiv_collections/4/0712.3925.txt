While Quantum Information Science (QIS) is still in its infancy, the ability
for quantum based hardware or computers to communicate and integrate with their
classical counterparts will be a major requirement towards their success.
Little attention however has been paid to this aspect of QIS. To manage and
exchange information between systems, today's classic Information Technology
(IT) commonly uses the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and its related tools.
XML is composed of numerous specifications related to various fields of
expertise. No such global specification however has been defined for quantum
computers. QIS-XML is a proposed XML metadata specification for the description
of fundamental components of QIS (gates & circuits) and a platform for the
development of a hardware independent low level pseudo-code for quantum
algorithms. This paper lays out the general characteristics of the QIS-XML
specification and outlines practical applications through prototype use cases.
