Application of Jarzynski nonequilibrium work relation to free energy
calculation is limited by the very slow convergence of the estimate when
dissipation is high. We present a novel perturbation protocol able to improve
the convergence of Jarzynski estimator when it is applied in the reconstruction
of the potential of mean force. The improvement is based on the application of
the adaptive external work variation in addition to the one caused by thermal
fluctuations.
