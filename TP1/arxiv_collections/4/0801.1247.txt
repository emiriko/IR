We introduce a family of spin-1/2 quantum chains, and show that their exact
ground states break the rotational and translational symmetries of the original
Hamiltonian. We also show how one can use projection to construct a spin-3/2
quantum chain with nearest neighbor interaction, whose exact ground states
break the rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Correlation functions of both
models are determined in closed form. Although we confine ourselves to
examples, the method can easily be adapted to encompass more general models.
