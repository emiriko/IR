We investigate the competition between superconductivity and ferromagnetism
in chaotic ultra-small metallic grains in a regime where both phases can
coexist. We use an effective Hamiltonian that combines a BCS-like pairing term
and a ferromagnetic Stoner-like spin exchange term. We study the transport
properties of the grain in the Coulomb blockade regime and identify signatures
of the coexistence between pairing and exchange correlations in the mesoscopic
fluctuations of the conductance peak spacings and peak heights.
