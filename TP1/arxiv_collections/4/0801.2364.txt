We examine the dynamics of two bright solitary waves with a negative
nonlinear term. The observed repulsion between two solitary waves -- when these
are in an antisymmetric combination -- is attributed to conservation laws.
Slight breaking of parity, in combination with weak relaxation of energy, leads
the two solitary waves to merge. The effective repulsion between solitary waves
requires certain nearly ideal conditions and is thus fragile.
