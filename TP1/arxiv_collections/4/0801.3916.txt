We study the melting behavior of charged colloidal crystals, using a
simulation technique that combines a continuous mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann
description for the microscopic electrolyte ions with a Brownian-dynamics
simulation for the mesoscopic colloids. This technique ensures that many-body
interactions between the colloids are fully taken into account, and thus allows
us to investigate how many-body interactions affect the solid-liquid phase
behavior of charged colloids. Using the Lindemann criterion, we determine the
melting line in a phase-diagram spanned by the colloidal charge and the salt
concentration. We compare our results to predictions based on the established
description of colloidal suspensions in terms of pairwise additive Yukawa
potentials, and find good agreement at high-salt, but not at low-salt
concentration. Analyzing the effective pair-interaction between two colloids in
a crystalline environment, we demonstrate that the difference in the melting
behavior observed at low salt is due to many-body interactions.
