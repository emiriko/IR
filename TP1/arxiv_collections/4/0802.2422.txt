Adopting neutrino oscillation parameters obtained by Super-Kamiokande, a
numerical computer experiment for neutrino events occurring outside the
detector, is carried out in the same SK live days, 1645.9 live days,
constructing the virtual Super-Kamiokande detector in the computer. The
numerical results by the computer experiment could be directly compared with
the real SK experimental data. The comparison shows that it is difficult to
obtain convincing conclusion on the existence of the neutrino oscillation with
specified neutrino oscillation parameters claimed by SK through analysis for
neutrino events occurring outside the detector.
