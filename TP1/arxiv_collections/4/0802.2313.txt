A 2-torus manifold is a closed smooth manifold of dimension $n$ with an
effective action of a 2-torus group $(\Z_2)^n$ of rank $n$, and it is said to
be locally standard if it is locally isomorphic to a faithful representation of
$(\Z_2)^n$ on $\R^n$. This paper studies the equivariant classification of
locally standard 2-torus manifolds.
