Blood system functions are very diverse and important for most processes in
human organism. One of its primary functions is matter transport among
different parts of the organism including tissue supplying with oxygen, carbon
dioxide excretion, drug propagation etc. Forecasting of these processes under
normal conditions and in the presence of different pathologies like
atherosclerosis, loss of blood, anatomical abnormalities, pathological changing
in chemical transformations and others is significant issue for many
physiologists. In this connection should be pointed out that global processes
are of special interest as they include feedbacks and interdependences among
different regions of the organism. Thus the main goal of this work is to
develop the model allowing to describe effectively blood flow in the whole
organism. As we interested in global processes the models of the four vascular
trees (arterial and venous parts of systemic and pulmonary circulation) must be
closed with heart and peripheral circulation models. As one of the model
applications the processes of the blood loss is considered in the end of the
paper.
