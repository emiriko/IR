Current experimental data allow the zero value for one neutrino mass, either
m_1 =0 or m_3 =0. This observation implies that a realistic neutrino mass
texture can be established by starting from the limit (a) m_1 = m_2 =0 and m_3
\neq 0 or (b) m_1 = m_2 \neq 0 and m_3 =0. In both cases, we may introduce a
particular perturbation which ensures the resultant neutrino mixing matrix to
be the tri-bimaximal mixing pattern or its viable variations. We find that it
is natural to incorporate this kind of neutrino mass matrix in the minimal
Type-II seesaw model with only one heavy right-handed Majorana neutrino N. We
show that it is possible to account for the cosmological baryon number
asymmetry in the m_3 =0 case via thermal leptogenesis, in which the
CP-violating asymmetry of N decays is attributed to the electron flavor.
