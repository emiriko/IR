It is shown that the critical velocity of a small sphere oscillating in
superfluid helium increases with the square root of the oscillation frequency.
This behavior can be described by a simple dimensional argument. The size of
the sphere and the temperature of the superfluid are found to have no or only
very little effect. Surface properties of the sphere and remanent vorticity may
have an influence but have not been under systematic investigation in these
measurements
