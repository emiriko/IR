We study the effect of finite chemical potential for the QGP constituents in
the Ramanathan et al. statistical model (Phys.Rev.C70, 027903,2004). While the
earlier computations using this model with vanishing chemical potentials
indicated a weakly first order phase transition for the system in the vicinity
of 170 MeV (Pramana, 68, 757, 2007), the introduction of finite values for the
chemical potentials of the constituents makes the transition a smooth roll over
of the phases, while allowing fireball formation with radius of a few "fermi"
to take place. This seems to be in conformity with the latest consensus on the
nature of the QGP-Hadron phase transition.
