Different ways of modelling quantum control systems, formulating control
problems and solving the resulting problems are considered and compared. In
particular, we compare the performance of geometric and optimal control, as
well as iterative techniques for optimal control design versus local gradient
optimization using a Lyapunov-type potential function for two problems of
general interest: global control of qubits and entanglement generation in the
form of Bell state preparation.
