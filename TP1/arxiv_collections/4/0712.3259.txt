We study the effects of site dilution disorder on the electronic properties
in graphene multilayers, in particular the bilayer and the infinite stack. The
simplicity of the model allows for an easy implementation of the coherent
potential approximation and some analytical results. Within the model we
compute the self-energies, the density of states and the spectral functions.
Moreover, we obtain the frequency and temperature dependence of the
conductivity as well as the DC conductivity. The c-axis response is
unconventional in the sense that impurities increase the response for low
enough doping. We also study the problem of impurities in the biased graphene
bilayer.
