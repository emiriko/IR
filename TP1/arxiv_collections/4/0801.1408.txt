In perturbative quantum field theory the maintenance of classical symmetries
is quite often investigated by means of algebraic renormalization, which is
based on the Quantum Action Principle. We formulate and prove this principle in
a new framework, in causal perturbation theory with localized interactions.
Throughout this work a universal formulation of symmetries is used: the Master
Ward Identity.
