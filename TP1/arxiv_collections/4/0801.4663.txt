We determine the energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions of a 2D
Dirac oscillator in the presence of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect . It is shown
that the energy spectrum depends on the spin of particle and the AB magnetic
flux parameter. Finally, when the irregular solution occurs it is shown that
the energy takes particular values. The nonrelativistic limit is also
considered.
