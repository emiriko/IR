We study the full bosonic spectrum around giant and dual giant graviton
probes in exactly marginally deformed backgrounds. Considering supersymmetric
and non-supersymmetric three-parameter deformations of AdS_5 X S^5, we perform
a detailed analysis of small fluctuations for both the expanded D3-brane
configurations. In particular, we enhance the scalar spectra of frequencies
found in our previous paper hep-th/0609173 with the important contributions
brought by the gauge field fluctuations. The giant graviton case exhibits a
non-trivial coupling between scalar and vector modes driven by the deformation,
whose resolution yields to a universal correction of the undeformed spectrum.
On the other hand, dual giant vibrations turn out to be completely decoupled.
From our results one can also easily read the gauge field fluctuations in the
undeformed (dual) giant graviton scenario.
