Successive magnetic-field-induced charge-density-wave transitions in the
molecular conductor $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$KHg(SCN)$_4$ are studied in the
hydrostatic pressure regime, in which the zero field charge-density wave
(CDW)state is completely suppressed. The orbital effect of the magnetic field
is demonstrated to restore the density wave, while the orbital quantization
induces different CDW states in different field intervals. In particular, we
have found that at certain field orientations the hysteretic first order
transitions between field-induced CDW subphases become visible at much higher
temperatures. This observation is very well in line with the existing theories
of field-induced CDW transitions.
