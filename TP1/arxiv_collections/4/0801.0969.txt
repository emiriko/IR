A deterministic system of interacting agents is considered as a model for
economic dynamics. The dynamics of the system is described by a coupled map
lattice with near neighbor interactions. The evolution of each agent results
from the competition between two factors: the agent's own tendency to grow and
the environmental influence that moderates this growth. Depending on the values
of the parameters that control these factors, the system can display Pareto or
Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical behaviors in its asymptotic dynamical regime. The
regions where these behaviors appear are calculated on the space of parameters
of the system. Other statistical properties, such as the mean wealth, the
standard deviation, and the Gini coefficient characterizing the degree of
equity in the wealth distribution are also calculated on the space of
parameters of the system.
