The aim of this paper is to extend to Hom-algebra structures the theory of
formal deformations of algebras which was introduced by Gerstenhaber for
associative algebras and extended to Lie algebras by Nijenhuis-Richardson. We
deal with Hom-associative and Hom-Lie algebras. We construct the first groups
of a deformation cohomology and give several examples of deformations. We
provide families of Hom-Lie algebras deforming Lie algebra $sl_2$ and describe
as formal deformations the q-deformed Witt algebra and Jackson $sl_2$.
