The mixed state of superconducting (SC) and normal (N) phases in one
dimensional systems are characterized by several phase slips and localization
of the order parameter of the SC phase. The phenomenon is explained on the
basis of a complex Ginzburg Landau (CGL) model. We present a simple analysis of
the system on multiple scales to capture localization and phase slips when
phases coexist.
