In this paper bounds for L_1, L_2 and L_3 are obtained in Chiral Perturbation
Theory with three flavours. At the same time we test the compatibility of this
theory with axiomatic principles. Following a recent paper we use dispersion
relations to write positivity conditions that translate into bounds for the
chiral low energy constants. As a first approach we consider the exact SU(3)_V
limit and notice that if a common mass of the order of that of the kaon is
adopted for the octet of pseudo-Goldstone bosons the bounds have very large
O(p^6) corrections. Once the positivity conditions are adapted to account for
different masses, we correct the previous bounds for a physical kaon mass and
find that they tighten. We observe an overlap between the experimentally
determined region and the first principles forbidden region, in the space of
parameters.
