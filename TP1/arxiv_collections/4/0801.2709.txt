Comment on paper: Gopalswamy, N., S. Yashiro, and S. Akiyama (2007),
Geoeffectiveness of halo coronal mass ejections, J. Geophys. Res., 112, A06112,

  Gopalswamy et al. [2007] studied the geoeffectiveness of halo coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) on the basis of solar observations during 1996-2005 and found
that the geoeffectiveness of 229 frontside halo CMEs was 71%. Recently for
observations of 305 frontside halo CMEs during 1997-2003 the geoeffectiveness
was found to be 40% [Kim et al., 2005]. Complex analysis of both solar and
interplanetary measurements showed that the geoeffectiveness of frontside halo
CMEs is likely to be about 50% [Yermolaev et al., 2005; Yermolaev and
Yermolaev, 2006]. Gopalswamy et al. [2007] did not discuss possible causes of
this difference and were limited only to the general words: "The reason for the
conflicting results (geoeffectiveness of CMEs ranging from 35% to more than
80%) may be attributed to the different definition of halo CMEs and
geoeffectiveness." So, here we shall present our point of view on high
geoeffectivenees of CME obtained in paper by Gopalswamy et al. [2007].
