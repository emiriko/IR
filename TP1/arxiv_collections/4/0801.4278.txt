Interaction of a drug or chemical with a biological system can result in a
gene-expression profile or signature characteristic of the event. Using a
suitably robust algorithm these signatures can potentially be used to connect
molecules with similar pharmacological or toxicological properties. The
Connectivity Map was a novel concept and innovative tool first introduced by
Lamb et al to connect small molecules, genes, and diseases using genomic
signatures [Lamb et al (2006), Science 313, 1929-1935]. However, the
Connectivity Map had some limitations, particularly there was no effective
safeguard against false connections if the observed connections were considered
on an individual-by-individual basis. Further when several connections to the
same small-molecule compound were viewed as a set, the implicit null hypothesis
tested was not the most relevant one for the discovery of real connections.
Here we propose a simple and robust method for constructing the reference
gene-expression profiles and a new connection scoring scheme, which importantly
allows the valuation of statistical significance of all the connections
observed. We tested the new method with the two example gene-signatures (HDAC
inhibitors and Estrogens) used by Lamb et al and also a new gene signature of
immunosuppressive drugs. Our testing with this new method shows that it
achieves a higher level of specificity and sensitivity than the original
method. For example, our method successfully identified raloxifene and
tamoxifen as having significant anti-estrogen effects, while Lamb et al's
Connectivity Map failed to identify these. With these properties our new method
has potential use in drug development for the recognition of pharmacological
and toxicological properties in new drug candidates.
