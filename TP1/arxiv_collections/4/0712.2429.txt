Using Schroedinger Functional methods, we compute the non-perturbative
renormalisation and renormalisation group running of several four-fermion
operators, in the framework of lattice simulations with two dynamical Wilson
quarks. Two classes of operators have been targeted: (i) those with left-left
current structure and four propagating quark fields; (ii) all operators
containing two static quarks. In both cases, only the parity-odd contributions
have been considered, being the ones that renormalise multiplicatively. Our
results, once combined with future simulations of the corresponding lattice
hadronic matrix elements, may be used for the computation of phenomenological
quantities of interest, such as B_K and B_B (the latter also in the static
limit).
