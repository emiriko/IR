We give an elementary proof of a formula recently obtained by Hammond,
Moorhouse, and Robbins for the adjoint of a rationally induced composition
operator on the Hardy space H^2. We discuss some variants and implications of
this formula, and use it to provide a sufficient condition for a rationally
induced composition operator adjoint to be a compact perturbation of a weighted
composition operator.
