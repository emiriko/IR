In this talk we discuss recent progress concerning precise predictions for
the LHC. We give a status report of three applications of our method to deal
with multi-leg one-loop amplitudes: The interference term of Higgs production
by gluon- and weak boson fusion to order O(alpha^2 alpha_s^3) and the
next-to-leading order corrections to the two processes pp -> ZZ jet and u ubar
-> d dbar s sbar. The latter is a subprocess of the four jet cross section at
the LHC.
