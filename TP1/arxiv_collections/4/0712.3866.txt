In this article, we present theoretical as well as experimental results on
resonantly enhanced tunneling of Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices
both in the linear case and for small nonlinearities. Our results demonstrate
the usefulness of condensates in optical lattices for simulating Hamiltonians
originally used for describing solid state phenomena.
