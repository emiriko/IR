The problem of spin squeezing with a bimodal condensate in presence of
particle losses is solved analytically by the Monte Carlo wavefunction method.
We find the largest obtainable spin squeezing as a function of the one-body
loss rate, the two-body and three-body rate constants, and the s-wave
scattering length.
