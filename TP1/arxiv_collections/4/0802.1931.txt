Development of geothermal energy and basin-scale simulations of fluid and
heat flow both suffer from uncertain physical rock properties at depth.
Therefore, building better prognostic models are required. We analysed
hydraulic and thermal properties of the major rock types in the Molasse Basin
in Southern Germany. On about 400 samples thermal conductivity, density,
porosity, and sonic velocity were measured. Here, we propose a three-step
procedure with increasing complexity for analysis of the data set: First,
univariate descriptive statistics provides a general understanding of the data
structure, possibly still with large uncertainty. Examples show that the
remaining uncertainty can be as high as 0.8 W/(m K) or as low as 0.1 W/(m K).
This depends on the possibility to subdivide the geologic units into data sets
that are also petrophysically similar. Then, based on all measurements,
cross-plot and quick-look methods are used to gain more insight into
petrophysical relationships and to refine the analysis. Because these measures
usually imply an exactly determined system they do not provide strict error
bounds. The final, most complex step comprises a full inversion of select
subsets of the data comprising both laboratory and borehole measurements. The
example presented shows the possibility to refine the used mixing laws for
Petrophysical properties and the estimation of mineral properties. These can be
estimated to an accuracy of 0.3 W/(m K). The predictive errors for the
measurements are 0.07 W/(m K), 70 m/s, and 8 kg/m^3 for thermal conductivity,
sonic velocity, and bulk density, respectively.
