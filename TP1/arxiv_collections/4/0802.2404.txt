The microwave performance of amorphous dielectric materials at very low
temperatures and very low excitation strengths displays significant excess
loss. Here, we present the loss tangents of some common amorphous and
crystalline dielectrics, measured at low temperatures (T < 100 mK) with near
single-photon excitation energies, using both coplanar waveguide (CPW) and
lumped LC resonators. The loss can be understood using a two-level state (TLS)
defect model. A circuit analysis of the half-wavelength resonators we used is
outlined, and the energy dissipation of such a resonator on a multilayered
dielectric substrate is considered theoretically.
