In this paper we argue that biological fitness is a multi-objective concept
hence the statement "fittest" is inappropriate. The following statement is
proposed "Survival is mostly for those with non-dominated fitness". Also we use
some TV games to show that under the following conditions: i) There are no
dominant players. ii) At each time step successful players may eliminate some
of their less successful competitors, Then the ultimate winner may not be the
fittest (but close).
