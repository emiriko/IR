This review summarises issues that have arisen since the appearance of
"Rumsfeld Hadrons". We show that signals $\phi(2175)$; Y(4260) and
$\Upsilon(10890)$ in the \ssbar, \cc and \bb share features that point to the
possible role of $\pi$ exchange forces between flavoured mesons generating
effects that can mimic hybrid mesons. The flavour dependence of these phenomena
may help to resolve this question.
