In "extended phase space" approach to quantum geometrodynamics numerical
solutions to Schrodinger equation corresponding to various choice of gauge
conditions are obtained for the simplest isotropic model. The "extended phase
space" approach belongs to those appeared in the last decade in which, as a
result of fixing a reference frame, the Wheeler - DeWitt static picture of the
world is replaced by evolutionary quantum geometrodynamics. Some aspects of
this approach were discussed at two previous PIRT meetings. We are interested
in the part of the wave function depending on physical degrees of freedom.
Three gauge conditions having a clear physical meaning are considered. They are
the conformal time gauge, the gauge producing the appearance of Lambda-term in
the Einstein equations, and the one covering the two previous cases as
asymptotic limits. The interpretation and discussion of the obtained solutions
is given.
