We demonstrate theoretically that the collective abstraction reaction A+B$_2
\to$ AB+B can be realized efficiently with degenerate bosonic or fermionic
matter waves. We show that this is dominated by quantum fluctuations, which are
critical in triggering its initial stages with the appearance of macroscopic
non-classical correlations of the atomic and molecular fields as a result. This
study opens up a promising new regime of quantum degenerate matter-wave
chemistry.
