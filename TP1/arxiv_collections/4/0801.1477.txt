After a short summary of our bimetric model of the Universe, an exact
nonlinear solution is built, which demonstrates the existence of solutions for
our two coupled field equations system. In addition to the classical positive
gravitational lensing, this solution is shown to also lead to negative
gravitational lensing, a phenomenon previously described in 1995 (Astrophysics
and Space Science). Such negative lensing provides an alternative
interpretation for the observed faint magnitudes of high redshift galaxies, so
far considered as dwarf galaxies.
