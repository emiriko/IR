In production processes, e.g. J/Psi -> omega-pi-pi or pbar-p -> 3pi, the
sigma and fo(980) overlap in the same partial wave. The conjecture of Extended
Unitarity (EU) states that the pi-pi pair should have the same phase variation
as pi-pi elastic scattering. This is an extension of Watson's theorem beyond
its original derivation, which stated only that the s-dependence of a single
resonance should be universal. The prediction of EU is that the deep dip
observed in pi-pi elastic scattering close to 1 GeV should also appear in
production data. Four sets of data disagree with this prediction. All require
different relative magnitudes of sigma and fo(980). That being so, a fresh
conjecture is to rewrite the 2-body unitarity relation for production in terms
of observed magnitudes. This leads to a prediction different to EU. Central
production data from the AFS experiment fit naturally to this hypothesis.
