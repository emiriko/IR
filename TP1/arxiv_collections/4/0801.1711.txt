Spontaneous breaking of local Lorentz symmetry is of interest as a possible
mechanism originating from physics at the Planck scale. If such breaking
occurs, however, it raises the questions of what the fate of the
Nambu-Goldstone modes is, whether a Higgs mechanism can occur, and whether
additional massive modes (analogous to the Higgs particle) can appear. A
summary of some recent work looking at these questions is presented here.
