We introduce a diluted version of the one dimensional spin-glass model with
interactions decaying in probability as an inverse power of the distance. In
this model varying the power corresponds to change the dimension in short-range
models. The spin-glass phase is studied in and out of the range of validity of
the mean-field approximation in order to discriminate between different
theories. Since each variable interacts only with a finite number of others the
cost for simulating the model is drastically reduced with respect to the fully
connected version and larger sizes can be studied. We find both static and
dynamic evidence in favor of the so-called replica symmetry breaking theory.
