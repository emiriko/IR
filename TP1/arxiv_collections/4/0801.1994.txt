Review of recent works devoted to the temporal and spatial variation of the
fundamental constants and dependence of the fundamental constants on the
gravitational potential (violation of local position invariance) is presented.
  We discuss the variation of the fine structure constant $\alpha=e^2/\hbar c$,
strong interaction and fundamental masses (Higgs vacuum), e.g. the
electron-to-proton mass ratio $\mu=m_e/M_p$ or $X_e=m_e/\Lambda_{QCD}$ and
$X_q=m_q/\Lambda_{QCD}$. We also present new results from Big Bang
nucleosynthesis and Oklo natural nuclear reactor data and propose new
measurements of enhanced effects in atoms, nuclei and molecules, both in quasar
and laboratory spectra.
