In this paper, it is shown that in hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus
collisions, the main source for central exclusive diffractive Higgs production
is photon-photon fusion. At the LHC energy, the total cross section for this
process is about 0.6 pb (for proton-gold scattering), and 3.9 nb (for gold-gold
collision) while the gluon-gluon fusion leads to the value of the cross section
for CED Higgs production which is about 0.1 nb and 3.9 pb respectively.
