A model for the information transfer from DNA to protein using quantum
information and computation techniques is presented. DNA is modeled as the
sender and proteins are modeled as the receiver of this information. On the DNA
side, a 64-dimensional Hilbert space is used to describe the information stored
in DNA triplets (codons). A Hamiltonian matrix is constructed for this space,
using the 64 possible codons as base states. The eigenvalues of this matrix are
not degenerate. The genetic code is degenerate and proteins comprise only 20
different amino acids. Since information is conserved, the information on the
protein side is also described by a 64-dimensional Hilbert space, but the
eigenvalues of the corresponding Hamiltonian matrix are degenerate. Each amino
acid is described by a Hilbert subspace. This change in Hilbert space structure
reflects the nature of the processes involved in information transfer from DNA
to protein.
