We find the different spatial chaos in a one-dimensional attractive
Bose-Einstein condensate interacting with a Gaussian-like laser barrier and
perturbed by a weak optical lattice. For the low laser barrier the chaotic
regions of parameters are demonstrated and the chaotic and regular states are
illustrated numerically. In the high barrier case, the bounded perturbed
solutions which describe a set of discrete chaotic states are constructed for
the discrete barrier heights and magic numbers of condensed atoms. The chaotic
density profiles are exhibited numerically for the lowest quantum number, and
the analytically bounded but numerically unbounded Gaussian-like configurations
are confirmed. It is shown that the chaotic wave packets can be controlled
experimentally by adjusting the laser barrier potential.
