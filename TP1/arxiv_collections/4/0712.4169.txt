Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is an emerging technology that shows great
promise for various futuristic applications both for mass public and military.
The sensing technology combined with processing power and wireless
communication makes it lucrative for being exploited in abundance in future.
The inclusion of wireless communication technology also incurs various types of
security threats. The intent of this paper is to investigate the security
related issues and challenges in wireless sensor networks. We identify the
security threats, review proposed security mechanisms for wireless sensor
networks. We also discuss the holistic view of security for ensuring layered
and robust security in wireless sensor networks.
