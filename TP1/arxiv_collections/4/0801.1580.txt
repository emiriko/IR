We present a new measurement of the Newtonian gravitational constant G based
on cold atom interferometry. Freely falling samples of laser-cooled rubidium
atoms are used in a gravity gradiometer to probe the field generated by nearby
source masses. In addition to its potential sensitivity, this method is
intriguing as gravity is explored by a quantum system. We report a value of
G=6.667 10^{-11} m^{3} kg^{-1} s^{-2}, estimating a statistical uncertainty of
$\pm$ 0.011 10^{-11} m^{3} kg^{-1} s^{-2} and a systematic uncertainty of $\pm$
0.003 10^{-11} m^{3} kg^{-1} s^{-2}. The long-term stability of the instrument
and the signal-to-noise ratio demonstrated here open interesting perspectives
for pushing the measurement accuracy below the 100 ppm level.
