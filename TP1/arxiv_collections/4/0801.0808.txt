We consider U(n+1) Yang-Mills instantons on the space \Sigma\times S^2, where
\Sigma is a compact Riemann surface of genus g. Using an SU(2)-equivariant
dimensional reduction, we show that the U(n+1) instanton equations on
\Sigma\times S^2 are equivalent to non-Abelian vortex equations on \Sigma.
Solutions to these equations are given by pairs (A,\phi), where A is a gauge
potential of the group U(n) and \phi is a Higgs field in the fundamental
representation of the group U(n). We briefly compare this model with other
non-Abelian Higgs models considered recently. Afterwards we show that for g>1,
when \Sigma\times S^2 becomes a gravitational instanton, the non-Abelian vortex
equations are the compatibility conditions of two linear equations (Lax pair)
and therefore the standard methods of integrable systems can be applied for
constructing their solutions.
