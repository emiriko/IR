After discussing some hints for possible masses of quasiparticles in quark
matter on the basis of lattice equation of state, we present pion and kaon
transverse spectra obtained by recombining quarks with distributed mass and
thermal cut power-law momenta as well as fragmenting by NLO pQCD with intrinsic
$k_T$ {and nuclear} broadening.
