Analytic properties of Graham-Witten anomalies are considered. Weyl anomalies
according to their analytic properties are of type A (coming from
$\delta$-singularities in correlators of several energy-momentum tensors) or of
type B (originating in counterterms which depend logarithmically on a mass
scale). It is argued that all Graham-Witten anomalies can be divided into 2
groups: internal and external, and that all external anomalies are of type B,
whereas among internal anomalies there is one term of type A and all the rest
are of type B. This argument is checked explicitly for the case of a free
scalar field in a 6-dimensional space with a 2-dimensional submanifold.
