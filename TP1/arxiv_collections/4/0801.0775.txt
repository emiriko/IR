Molecular dynamics calculations revealed that the temperature of operation
and the applied tensile force (f) determine not only the kinetics but also the
mode and duration of Au nanowire breaking. In the tensile force range of 0.018
and 0.1 nN/atom, structure transformation of the wire occurs prior to breaking
at random positions. The gold wire breaks abruptly when the f is stronger than
0.1nN/atom but no rupture occurs at all when the f is weaker than 0.018
nN/atom. At higher temperatures and under stronger tensile forces, the wire
breaks even faster.
