We have measured the mechanical properties of few-layer graphene and graphite
flakes that are suspended over circular holes. The spatial profile of the
flake's spring constant is measured with an atomic force microscope. The
bending rigidity of and the tension in the membranes are extracted by fitting a
continuum model to the data. For flakes down to eight graphene layers, both
parameters show a strong thickness-dependence. We predict fundamental resonance
frequencies of these nanodrums in the GHz range based on the measured bending
rigidity and tension.
