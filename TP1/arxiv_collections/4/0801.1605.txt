Stabilization of inter-brane distance is analyzed in 5-dimensional models
with higher-order scalar kinetic terms. Equations of motion and boundary
conditions for background and for scalar perturbations are presented.
Conditions sufficient and (with one exception) necessary for stability are
derived and discussed. It is shown that it is possible to construct stable
brane configurations even without scalar potentials and cosmological constants.
As a byproduct we identify a large class of non-standard boundary conditions
for which the Sturm-Liouville operator is hermitian.
