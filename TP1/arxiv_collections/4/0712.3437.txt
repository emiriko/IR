We calculate chiral corrections to the semileptonic vector and axial quark
coupling constants using a manifestly Lorentz covariant chiral quark approach
up to order O(p4) in the two- and tree-flavor picture. These couplings are then
used in the evaluation of the corresponding couplings which govern the
semileptonic transitions between octet baryon states. In the calculation of
baryon matrix elements we use a general ansatz for the spatial form of the
quark wave function, without referring to a specific realization of
hadronization and confinement of quarks in baryons. Matching the physical
amplitudes calculated within our approach to the model-independent predictions
of baryon chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) allows one to deduce the connection
between our parameters and those of baryon ChPT.
