In this paper we derive an explicit expression for the normal zeta function
of class two nilpotent groups whose associated Pfaffian hypersurface is smooth.
In particular, we show how the local zeta function depends on counting mod p
rational points on related varieties, and we describe the varieties that can
appear in such a decomposition. As a corollary, we also establish explicit
results on the degree of polynomial subgroup growth in these groups, and we
study the behaviour of poles of this zeta function. Under certain geometric
conditions, we also confirm that these functions satisfy a functional equation.
