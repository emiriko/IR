Low-density parity check (LDPC) codes are a significant class of classical
codes with many applications. Several good LDPC codes have been constructed
using random, algebraic, and finite geometries approaches, with containing
cycles of length at least six in their Tanner graphs. However, it is impossible
to design a self-orthogonal parity check matrix of an LDPC code without
introducing cycles of length four.
  In this paper, a new class of quantum LDPC codes based on lines and points of
finite geometries is constructed. The parity check matrices of these codes are
adapted to be self-orthogonal with containing only one cycle of length four.
Also, the column and row weights, and bounds on the minimum distance of these
codes are given. As a consequence, the encoding and decoding algorithms of
these codes as well as their performance over various quantum depolarizing
channels will be investigated.
