We introduce an efficient scheme for the molecular dynamics of electronic
systems by means of quantum Monte Carlo. The evaluation of the
(Born-Oppenheimer) forces acting on the ionic positions is achieved by two main
ingredients: i) the forces are computed with finite and small variance, which
allows the simulation of a large number of atoms, ii) the statistical noise
corresponding to the forces is used to drive the dynamics at finite temperature
by means of an appropriate Langevin dynamics. A first application to the
high-density phase of Hydrogen is given, supporting the stability of the liquid
phase at \simeq 300GPa and \simeq 400K.
