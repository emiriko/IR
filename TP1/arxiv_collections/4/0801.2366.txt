Uranium and thorium within the Earth produce a major portion of terrestrial
heat along with a measurable flux of electron antineutrinos. These elements are
key components in geophysical and geochemical models. Their quantity and
distribution drive the dynamics, define the thermal history, and are a
consequence of the differentiation of the Earth. Knowledge of uranium and
thorium concentrations in geological reservoirs relies largely on geochemical
model calculations. This research report describes the methods and criteria to
experimentally determine average concentrations of uranium and thorium in the
continental crust and in the mantle using site-specific measurements of the
terrestrial antineutrino flux. Optimal, model-independent determinations
involve significant exposures of antineutrino detectors remote from nuclear
reactors at both a mid-continental and a mid-oceanic site. This would require
major, new antineutrino detection projects. The results of such projects could
yield a greatly improved understanding of the deep interior of the Earth.
