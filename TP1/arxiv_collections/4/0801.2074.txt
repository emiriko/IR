We consider the phase transition in the dual Yang-Mills theory at finite
temperature $T$. The phase transition is associated with a change (breaking) of
symmetry. The effective mass of the dual gauge field is derived as a function
of $T$-dependent gauge coupling constant. We investigate the analytical
criterion constraining the existence of a quark-antiquark bound state at
temperatures higher than the temperature of deconfinement.
