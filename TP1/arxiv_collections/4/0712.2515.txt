We study the critical point of directed pinning/wetting models with quenched
disorder. The distribution K(.) of the location of the first contact of the
(free) polymer with the defect line is assumed to be of the form
K(n)=n^{-\alpha-1}L(n), with L(.) slowly varying. The model undergoes a
(de)-localization phase transition: the free energy (per unit length) is zero
in the delocalized phase and positive in the localized phase. For \alpha<1/2 it
is known that disorder is irrelevant: quenched and annealed critical points
coincide for small disorder, as well as quenched and annealed critical
exponents. The same has been proven also for \alpha=1/2, but under the
assumption that L(.) diverges sufficiently fast at infinity, an hypothesis that
is not satisfied in the (1+1)-dimensional wetting model considered by Forgacs
et al. (1986) and Derrida et al. (1992), where L(.) is asymptotically constant.
Here we prove that, if 1/2<\alpha<1 or \alpha >1, then quenched and annealed
critical points differ whenever disorder is present, and we give the scaling
form of their difference for small disorder. In agreement with the so-called
Harris criterion, disorder is therefore relevant in this case. In the marginal
case \alpha=1/2, under the assumption that L(.) vanishes sufficiently fast at
infinity, we prove that the difference between quenched and annealed critical
points, which is known to be smaller than any power of the disorder strength,
is positive: disorder is marginally relevant. Again, the case considered by
Forgacs et al. (1986) and Derrida et al. (1992) is out of our analysis and
remains open.
