This paper presents Timed Quorum System (TQS), a new quorum system especially
suited for large-scale and dynamic systems. TQS requires that two quorums
intersect with high probability if they are used in the same small period of
time. It proposed an algorithm that implements TQS and that verifies
probabilistic atomicity: a consistency criterion that requires each operation
to respect atomicity with high probability. This TQS implementation has quorum
of size O(\sqrt{nD}) and expected access time of O(log \sqrt{nD}) message
delays, where n measures the size of the system and D is a required parameter
to handle dynamism.
