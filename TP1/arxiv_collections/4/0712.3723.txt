We find that the heat capacity of a strongly correlated metal presents
striking changes with respect to Landau Fermi liquid theory. In contrast with
normal metals, where the electronic specific heat is linear at low temperature
(with a T^3 term as a leading correction), a dynamical mean-field study of the
correlated Hubbard model reveals a clear kink in the temperature dependence,
marking a rapid change from a low-temperature linear behavior and a second
linear regime with a reduced slope. Experiments on LiV2O4 support our findings,
implying that correlated materials are more resistive to cooling at low T than
expected from the intermediate temperature behavior.
