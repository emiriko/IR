We prove a theorem that characterizes a large family of non-static solutions
to Einstein equations in $N$-dimensional space-time, representing, in general,
spherically symmetric Type II fluid. It is shown that the best known
Vaidya-based (radiating) black hole solutions to Einstein equations, in both
four dimensions (4D) and higher dimensions (HD), are particular cases from this
family. The spherically symmetric static black hole solutions for Type I fluid
can also be retrieved. A brief discussion on the energy conditions,
singularities and horizons is provided.
