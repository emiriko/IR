Conductivity of the defectless, perfect crystal graphene is found at the
neutrality point at zero temperature and in the limit of large dielectric
constant of the substrate. The steady state of the graphene with weak current
is assumed to be an ideal, rare plasma of particle and hole excitations
governed by the Boltzmann kinetic equation.
