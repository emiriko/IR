A scheme for direct projection of a quantum state on Bell states is
described. The method is based on constructing an average Hamiltonian with Bell
eigenstates and then, projecting the state on these eigenstates. The projection
is performed by adding the results of a direct and time-reversed evolution.
Experimental demonstration is shown for pairs of dipolar-coupled nuclear spins.
