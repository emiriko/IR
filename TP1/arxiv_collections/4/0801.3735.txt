We propose to probe the distribution of current fluctuations by means of the
escape probability histogram of a Josephson junction (JJ), obtained using very
short bias current pulses in the adiabatic regime, where the low-frequency
component of the current fluctuations plays a crucial role. We analyze the
effect of the third cumulant on the histogram in the small skewness limit, and
address two concrete examples assuming realistic parameters for the JJ. In the
first one we study the effects due to fluctuations produced by a tunnel
junction, finding that the signature of higher cumulants can be detected by
taking the derivative of the escape probability with respect to current. In
such a realistic situation, though, the determination of the whole distribution
of current fluctuations requires an amplification of the cumulants. As a second
example we consider magnetic flux fluctuations acting on a SQUID produced by a
random telegraph source of noise.
