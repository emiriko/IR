New results are established here on the phase portraits and bifurcations of
the kinematic model in a system of ODE's, first presented by H.K. Wilson in his
1971 book, and by him attributed to L. Markus (unpublished). A new,
self-sufficient, study which extends Wilson's result and allows an essential
conclusion for the applicability of the model is reported here.
