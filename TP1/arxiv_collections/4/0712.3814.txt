We investigate the effects of unparticles on gamma gamma--> gamma gamma
scattering for photon collider mode of the future multi-TeV e^+e^- linear
collider. We show the effects of unparticles on the differential, and total
scattering cross sections for different polarization configurations.
Considering 1-loop Standard Model background contributions from the charged
fermions, and W^{+-} bosons to the cross section, we calculate the upper limits
on the unparticle couplings lambda_0 to the photons for various values of the
scaling dimension d(1<d<2) at sqrt{s}=0.5-5 TeV.
