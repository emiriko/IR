Recently, de Visser and Blaauboer [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 96}, 246801 (2006)]
proposed the most efficient deterministic teleportation protocol $\cal T$ for
electron spins in a semiconductor nanostructure consisting of a single and a
double quantum dot. However, it is as yet unknown if $\cal T$ can be completed
before decoherence sets in. In this paper we analyze the detrimental effect of
nuclear spin baths, the main source of decoherence, on $\cal T$. We show that
nonclassical teleportation fidelity can be achieved with $\cal T$ provided
certain conditions are met. Our study indicates that realization of quantum
computation with quantum dots is indeed promising.
