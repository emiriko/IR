We introduce techniques to analyze unitary operations in terms of quadratic
form expansions, a form similar to a sum over paths in the computational basis
when the phase contributed by each path is described by a quadratic form over
$\mathbb R$. We show how to relate such a form to an entangled resource akin to
that of the one-way measurement model of quantum computing. Using this, we
describe various conditions under which it is possible to efficiently implement
a unitary operation U, either when provided a quadratic form expansion for U as
input, or by finding a quadratic form expansion for U from other input data.
