In this article, we present a multi-tool method for the development and the
analysis of a new medium access method. IEEE 802.15.4 / ZigBee technology has
been used as a basis for this new determinist MAC layer which enables a high
level of QoS. This WPAN can be typically used for wireless sensor networks
which require strong temporal constraints. To validate the proposed protocol,
three complementary and adequate tools are used: Petri Nets for the formal
validation of the algorithm, a dedicated simulator for the temporal aspects,
and some measures on a real prototype based on a couple of ZigBee FREESCALE
components for the hardware characterization of layers #1 and #2.
