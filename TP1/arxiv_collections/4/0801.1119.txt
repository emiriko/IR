The use of geometric methods has proved useful in the hamiltonian description
of classical constrained systems. In this note we provide the first steps
toward the description of the geometry of quantum constrained systems. We make
use of the geometric formulation of quantum theory in which unitary
transformations (including time evolution) can be seen, just as in the
classical case, as finite canonical transformations on the quantum state space.
We compare from this perspective the classical and quantum formalisms and argue
that there is an important difference between them, that suggests that the
condition on observables to become physical is through the double commutator
with the square of the constraint operator. This provides a bridge between the
standard Dirac procedure --through its geometric implementation-- and the
Master Constraint program.
