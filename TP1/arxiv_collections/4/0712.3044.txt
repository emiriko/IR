Recently, oxide multiferroics have attracted much attention due to their
large magnetoelectric effect which allows the tuning of magnetic properties
with electric field and vice versa and open new venues for future spintronic
applications such as multiple-state memory devices with dual magnetic and
electric control. BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) belongs to this new class of materials and
shows both ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic orders at room temperature with
a large electric polarizationassociated with a cycloidal spiral magnetic
ordering. The incommensurate magnetic order induces magnon zone folding and
allows investigations by optical probes of unusual spin waves which couples to
optical phonons, the so called "`electromagnons"'. Here, we unravel for the
first time the electromagnon spectra of BFO by means low energy inelastic light
scattering technique. We show the existence of two species of electromagnons
corresponding to spin wave excitations in and out of the cycloidal plane. The
present observations present an unique opportunity to study the interplay
between ferroelectric and magnetic orders.
