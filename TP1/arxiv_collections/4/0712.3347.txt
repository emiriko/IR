We study the behavior with the number of colors (Nc) of the two poles
associated to the Lambda(1405) resonance obtained dynamically within the chiral
unitary approach. The leading order chiral meson-baryon interaction manifests a
nontrivial Nc dependence for SU(3) baryons, which gives a finite attractive
interaction in some channels in the large Nc limit. As a consequence, the SU(3)
singlet (Kbar N) component of the Lambda(1405) survives in the large Nc limit
as a bound state, while the other components dissolve into the continuum. The
Nc dependence of the decay widths shows different behavior from the general
counting rule for a qqq state, indicating the dynamical origin of the two poles
for the Lambda(1405) resonance.
