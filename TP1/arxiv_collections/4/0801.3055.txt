A recombination radiation line of real excitons in dense two-dimensional
electron gas at the [100] silicon surface is observed in luminescence spectra
of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structures. A new effect of anisotropic
paramagnetic reduction of the luminescence line indicates a strong influence of
the Kondo correlations on electron paramagnetism of the excitons.
