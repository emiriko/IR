Signals of CPT and Lorentz violation are possible in the context of
spectroscopy using hydrogen and antihydrogen. We apply the Standard-Model
Extension, a broad framework for Lorentz breaking in physics, to various
transitions in the hydrogen and antihydrogen spectra. The results show an
unsuppressed effect in the transition between the upper two hyperfine sublevels
of the ground state of these systems. We also discuss related tests in Penning
traps, and recent work on Lorentz violation in curved spacetime.
