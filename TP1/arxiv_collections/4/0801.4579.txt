The Josephson relation for the superfluid density is derived for a Fermi
superfluid in the BCS-BEC crossover. This identity extends the original
Josephson relation for Bose superfluids. It gives a simple exact relation
between the superfluid density $\rho_s$ and the broken-symmetry Cooper pair
order parameter $\Delta_0$ in terms of the infrared limit of the pair
fluctuation propagator. The same expression holds through the entire BCS-BEC
crossover, describing the superfluid density of a weak-coupling BCS superfluid
as well as the superfluid density of a Bose condensate of dimer molecules.
