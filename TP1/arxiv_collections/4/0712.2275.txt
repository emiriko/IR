A self-contained Fortran-90 program based on a classical trajectory model
with stochastic breakup is presented, which should be a powerful tool for
quantifying complete and incomplete fusion, and breakup in reactions induced by
weakly-bound two-body projectiles near the Coulomb barrier. The code calculates
complete and incomplete fusion cross sections and their angular momentum
distribution, as well as breakup observables (angle, kinetic energy and
relative energy distributions).
