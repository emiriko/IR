We study DC charge and spin transport through a weakly coupled quantum dot,
driven by a non-adiabatic periodic change of system parameters. We generalize
the model of Tien and Gordon to simultaneously oscillating voltages and tunnel
couplings. When applying our general result to the two-parameter charge pumping
in quantum dots, we find interference effects between the oscillations of the
voltage and tunnel couplings. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility to
electrically pump a spin current in presence of a static magnetic field.
