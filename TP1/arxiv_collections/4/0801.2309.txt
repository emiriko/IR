Fundamental and applied concepts concerning the ability of light beams to
carry a certain mechanical angular momentum with respect to the propagation
axis are reviewed and discussed. Following issues are included:
  Historical reference;
  Angular momentum of a paraxial beam and its constituents;
  Spin angular momentum and paradoxes associated with it;
  Orbital angular momentum;
  Circularly-spiral beams: examples and methods of generation;
  Orbital angular momentum and the intensity moments;
  Symmetry breakdown and decomposition of the orbital angular momentum;
  Mechanical models of the vortex light beams;
  Mechanical action of the beam angular momentum;
  Rotational Doppler effect, its manifestation in the image rotation;
  Spectrum of helical harmonics and associated problems;
  Non-collinear rotational Doppler effect;
  Properties of a beam forcedly rotating around its own axis.
  Research prospects and ways of practical utilization of optical beams with
angular momentum.
