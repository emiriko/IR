It has previously been shown that a recommender based on immune system
idiotypic principles can out perform one based on correlation alone. This paper
reports the results of work in progress, where we undertake some investigations
into the nature of this beneficial effect. The initial findings are that the
immune system recommender tends to produce different neighbourhoods, and that
the superior performance of this recommender is due partly to the different
neighbourhoods, and partly to the way that the idiotypic effect is used to
weight each neighbours recommendations.
