From the wealth of data obtained from the first three years of RHIC
operation, the four RHIC experiments, BRAHMS, PHENIX, PHOBOS and STAR, have
concluded that a high density partonic matter is formed at central Au+Au
collisions at 200 GeV. The research focus now shifts from initial discovery to
a detailed exploration of partonic matter. Particles carrying heavy flavor,
i.e. charm or beauty quarks, are powerful tool for study the properties of the
hot and dense medium created in high-energy nuclear collisions at RHIC. At the
relatively low transverse momentum region, the collective motion of the heavy
flavor will be a sensitive signal for the thermalization of light flavors. An
upgrade of RHIC (RHIC-II) is intended for the second half of the decade, with a
luminosity increase to about 20-40 times the design value of 8x1026 cm-2 s-1
for Au+Au, and 2x1032 cm-2 s-1 for polarized proton beams. The PHENIX
collaboration plans to upgrade its experiment to exploit with an enhanced
detector new physics then in reach. For this purpose, we are constructing the
Silicon Vertex Tracker (VTX). The VTX detector will provide us the tool to
measure new physics observables that are not accessible at the present RHIC or
available only with very limited accuracy. The VTX detector consists of four
layers of barrel detectors located in the region of pseudorapidity |eta| < 1.2
and covers almost 2 azimuthal angle. The pseudorapidity is defined as eta =
-ln[tan(/2)], where is the emission angle relative to the beam axis. In this
paper, we will provide details of the physics capability added to PHENIX by the
new central silicon vertex tracker, the status of the project, including
technology choices used in the design, performance of individual silicon sensor
and silicon detector prototype.
