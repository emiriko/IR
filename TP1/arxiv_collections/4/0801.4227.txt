Isospin equilibration in multi-fragmentation processes is studied for the
system $^{40}Cl+^{28}Si$ at 40 MeV/nucleon. The investigation is performed
through semiclassical microscopic many-body calculations based on the CoMD-II
model. The study has been developed to describe isospin equilibration processes
involving the gas and liquid "phases" of the total system formed in the
collision processes. The investigation of the behavior of this observable in
terms of the repulsive/attractive action of the symmetry term, highlights
many-body correlations which are absent in semiclassical mean-field approaches.
