We review the current state of experimental knowledge on double ccbar
production in e+e- annihilation. The large cross-sections (O(20 fb)) for e+e-
-> gamma* -> psi(') ccbar_{res} processes have been confirmed by detailed tests
and reproduced by a second group: they should now be considered
well-established. The latest experimental results concern the case where the
second ccbar system is above open-charm threshold: hidden-charm states continue
to play a prominent role in the mass spectrum. Some ``loose ends'' in the field
are also briefly discussed.
