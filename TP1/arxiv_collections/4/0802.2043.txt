We report dynamics of the transient polar Kerr rotation (KR) and of the
transient reflectivity induced by femtosecond laser pulses in ferromagnetic
(Ga,Mn)As with no external magnetic field applied. It is shown that the
measured KR signal consist of several different contributions, among which only
the oscillatory signal is directly connected with the ferromagnetic order in
(Ga,Mn)As. The origin of the light-induced magnetization precession is
discussed and the magnetization precession damping (Gilbert damping) is found
to be strongly influenced by annealing of the sample.
