Acoustic cavitation bubbles are known to exhibit highly nonlinear and
unpredictable chaotic dynamics. Their inevitable role in applications like
sonoluminescence, sonochemistry and medical procedures suggests that their
dynamics be controlled. Reducing chaotic oscillations could be the first step
in controlling the bubble dynamics by increasing the predictability of the
bubble response to an applied acoustic field. One way to achieve this concept
is to perturb the acoustic forcing. Recently, due to the improvements
associated with using dual frequency sources, this method has been the subject
of many studies which have proved its applicability and advantages. Due to this
reason, in this paper, the oscillations of a spherical bubble driven by a dual
frequency source, were studied and compared to the ones driven by a single
source. Results indicated that using dual frequency had a strong impact on
reducing the chaotic oscillations to regular ones. The governing parameters
influencing its dynamics are the secondary frequency and its phase difference
with the fundamental frequency. Also using dual frequency forcing may arm us by
the possibility of generating oscillations of desired amplitudes. To our
knowledge the investigation of the ability of using a dual frequency forcing to
control chaotic oscillations are presented for the first time in this paper.
