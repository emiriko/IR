The opportunity of optimization of collimator was investigated by changing
collimator length, material and wall roughness for soft x-ray radiation with
wavelength 4 nm corresponding to carbon atoms absorption. From the obtained
results follows that effects of diffraction become significant for channel
widths up to 0.02 - 0.04 mm. Collimation angle was limited to 0.014 and 0.007
radian for carbon dust detection. The choice of lighter material with greater
height of roughness in shorter collimator with 2 reflections results in
considerably lower losses than for heavier materials and smoother walls where 4
reflections required.
