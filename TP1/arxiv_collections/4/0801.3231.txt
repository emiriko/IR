Spin precession and dephasing ("Hanle effect") provides an unambiguous means
to establish the presence of spin transport in semiconductors. We compare
theoretical modeling with experimental data from drift-dominated silicon
spin-transport devices, illustrating the non-trivial consequences of employing
oblique magnetic fields (due to misalignment or intentional, fixed in-plane
field components) to measure the effects of spin precession. Model results are
also calculated for Hanle measurements under conditions of diffusion-dominated
transport, revealing an expected Hanle peak-widening effect induced by the
presence of fixed in-plane magnetic bias fields.
