We demonstrate that multipartite Bell-inequality violations can be fully
destroyed in finite time in three-qubit systems subject only to the mechanism
of local external asymptotic dephasing noise. This broadens the study of
local-noise-induced sudden death of nonlocal behavior, extending it beyond the
realm of bipartite systems, to which it had previously been restricted.
