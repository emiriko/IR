The Cosmic Defect (CD) theory is reviewed and used to fit the data for the
accelerated expansion of the universe, obtained from the apparent luminosity of
192 SnIa's. The fit from CD is compared with the one obtained by means of
$\Lambda $CDM. The results from both theories are in good agreement and the
fits are satisfactory. The correspondence between both approaches is discussed
and interpreted.
