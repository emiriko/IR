We present a simple construction that maps quantum circuits to graphs and
vice-versa. Inspired by the results of D.A. Lidar linking the Ising partition
function with quadratically signed weight enumerators (QWGTs), we also present
a BQP-complete problem for the additive approximation of a function over
hypergraphs related to the generating function of Eulerian subgraphs for
ordinary graphs. We discuss connections with the Ising partition function.
