We report the first experimental demonstration of an optical controlled-NOT
gate constructed entirely in fibre. We operate the gate using two heralded
optical fibre single photon sources and find an average logical fidelity of 90%
and an average process fidelity of 0.83<F<0.91. On the basis of a simple model
we are able to conclude that imperfections are primarily due to the photon
sources, meaning that the gate itself works with very high fidelity.
