Encoding the imaginary part of a weak value onto an initially entangled probe
can modify its entanglement content - provided the probe observable can
distinguish between states of different entropies. Apart from fundamental
interest, this result illustrates the utility of the imaginary weak value as a
calculational tool in certain entanglement concentration protocols.
