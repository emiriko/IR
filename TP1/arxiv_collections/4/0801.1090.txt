We study few-boson tunneling in a one-dimensional double well. As we pass
from weak interactions to the fermionization limit, the Rabi oscillations first
give way to highly delayed pair tunneling (for medium coupling), whereas for
very strong correlations multi-band Rabi oscillations emerge. All this is
explained on the basis of the exact few-body spectrum and without recourse to
the conventional two-mode approximation. Two-body correlations are found
essential to the understanding of the different tunnel mechanisms. The
investigation is complemented by discussing the effect of skewing the double
well, which offers the possibility to access specific tunnel resonances
