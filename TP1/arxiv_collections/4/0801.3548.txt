We derive an exact general axi-symmetric solution of the coupled
gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the tetrad theory of gravitation.
The solution is characterized by four parameters $M$ (mass), $Q$ (charge), $a$
(rotation) and $L$ (NUT). We then, calculate the total exterior energy using
the energy-momentum complex given by M{\o}ller in the framework of
Weitzenb$\ddot{o}$ck geometry. We show that the energy contained in a sphere is
shared by its interior as well as exterior. We also calculate the components of
the spatial momentum to evaluate the angular momentum distribution. We show
that the only non-vanishing components of the angular momentum is in the Z
direction.
