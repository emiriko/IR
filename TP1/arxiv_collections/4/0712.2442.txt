The proton asymmetry parameter C in neutron decay describes the correlation
between neutron spin and proton momentum. In this Letter, the first measurement
of this quantity is presented. The result C=-0.2377(26) agrees with the
Standard Model expectation. The coefficient C provides an additional parameter
for new and improved Standard Model tests. From a differential analysis of the
same data (assuming the Standard Model), we obtain lambda=-1.275(16) as ratio
of axial-vector and vector coupling constant.
