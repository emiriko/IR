Gene activation in eukaryotes involves the concerted action of histone tail
modifiers, chromatin remodellers and transcription factors, whose precise
coordination is currently unknown. We demonstrate that the experimentally
observed interactions of the molecules are in accord with a kinetic
proofreading scheme. Our finding could provide a basis for the development of
quantitative models for gene regulation in eukaryotes based on the
combinatorical interactions of chromatin modifiers.
