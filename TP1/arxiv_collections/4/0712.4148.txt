An interval edge t-coloring of a graph G is a proper edge coloring of G with
colors 1,2...,t such that at least one edge of G is colored by color
i,i=1,2...,t, and the edges incident with each vertex v are colored by d_{G}(v)
consecutive colors, where d_{G}(v) is the degree of the vertex v in G. In this
paper interval edge colorings of bipartite cylinders and bipartite tori are
investigated.
