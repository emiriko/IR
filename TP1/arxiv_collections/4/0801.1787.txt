The magnetic correlations in the charge- and orbital-ordered manganite
La(0.5)Sr(1.5)MnO(4) have been studied by elastic and inelastic neutron
scattering techniques. Out of the well-defined CE-type magnetic structure with
the corresponding magnons a competition between CE-type and ferromagnetic
fluctuations develops. Whereas ferromagnetic correlations are fully suppressed
by the static CE-type order at low temperature, elastic and inelastic CE-type
correlations disappear with the melting of the charge-orbital order at high
temperature. In its charge-orbital disordered phase, La(0.5)Sr(1.5)MnO(4)
exhibits a dispersion of ferromagnetic correlations which remarkably resembles
the magnon dispersion in ferromagnetically ordered metallic perovskite
manganites.
