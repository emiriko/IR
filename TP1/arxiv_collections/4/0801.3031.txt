Point contact spectroscopy on a H2O molecule bridging Pt electrodes reveals a
clear crossover between enhancement and reduction of the conductance due to
electron-vibration interaction. As single channel models predict such a
crossover at transmission probability of t=0.5, we used shot noise measurements
to analyze the transmission and observed at least two channels across the
junction where the dominant channel has t=0.51+/-0.01 transmission probability
at the crossover conductance, which is consistent with the predictions for
single-channel models.
