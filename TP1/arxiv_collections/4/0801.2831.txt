The quantum spin Hall (QSH) state is a topologically non-trivial state of
quantum matter which preserves time-reversal symmetry; it has an energy gap in
the bulk, but topologically robust gapless states at the edge. Recently, this
novel effect has been predicted and observed in HgTe quantum wells. In this
work we predict a similar effect arising in Type-II semiconductor quantum wells
made from InAs/GaSb/AlSb. Because of a rare band alignment the quantum well
band structure exhibits an "inverted" phase similar to CdTe/HgTe quantum wells,
which is a QSH state when the Fermi level lies inside the gap. Due to the
asymmetric structure of this quantum well, the effects of inversion symmetry
breaking and inter-layer charge transfer are essential. By standard
self-consistent calculations, we show that the QSH state persists when these
corrections are included, and a quantum phase transition between the normal
insulator and the QSH phase can be electrically tuned by the gate voltage.
