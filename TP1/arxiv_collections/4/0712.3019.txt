Let A,B be two random subsets of a finite group G. We consider the event that
the products of elements from A and B span the whole group; i.e. (AB union BA)
= G. The study of this event gives rise to a group invariant we call \Theta(G).
\Theta(G) is between 1/2 and 1, and is 1 if and only if the group is abelian.
We show that a phase transition occurs as the size of A and B passes
\sqrt{\Theta(G)|G|\log|G|}; i.e. for any c>0, if the size of A and B is less
than (1-c)\sqrt{\Theta(G)|G|\log|G|}, then with high probability (AB union BA)
does not equal G. If A and B are larger than (1+c)\sqrt{\Theta(G)|G|\log|G|}
then (AB union BA) equals G with high probability.
