Two dimensional condensed matter is realised in increasingly diverse forms
that are accessible to experiment and of potential technological value. The
properties of these systems are influenced by many length scales and reflect
both generic physics and chemical detail. To unify their physical description
is therefore a complex and important challenge. Here we investigate the
distribution of experimentally estimated critical exponents, $\beta$, that
characterize the evolution of the order parameter through the ordering
transition. The distribution is found to be bimodal and bounded within a window
$\sim 0.1 \le \beta \le 0.25$, facts that are only in partial agreement with
the established theory of critical phenomena. In particular, the bounded nature
of the distribution is impossible to reconcile with existing theory for one of
the major universality classes of two dimensional behaviour - the XY model with
four fold crystal field - which predicts a spectrum of non-universal exponents
bounded only from below. Through a combination of numerical and renormalization
group arguments we resolve the contradiction between theory and experiment and
demonstrate how the "universal window" for critical exponents observed in
experiment arises from a competition between marginal operators.
