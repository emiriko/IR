Magneto-transport measurements are performed on the two-dimensional electron
system (2DES) in an AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure. By increasing the magnetic
field perpendicular to the 2DES, magnetoresistivity oscillations due to Landau
quantisation can be identified just near the direct insulator-quantum Hall
(I-QH) transition. However, different mobilities are obtained from the
oscillations and transition point. Our study shows that the direct I-QH
transition does not always correspond to the onset of strong localisation.
