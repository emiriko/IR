The existence of "superconducting islands" (i.e., locally confined regions
with superconducting correlations) in amorphous superconducting thin films can
account for numerous experimental findings. Such spatial fluctuations in the
superconducting gap were indeed observed experimentally, and were shown to
persist into the insulating side of the superconductor-insulator transition. In
this work a detailed account on the formation and evolution of superconducting
islands in disordered two-dimensional superconductors is presented, using a
locally self-consistent numerical solution of the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes
equations. Specifically, the formation of SC islands is demonstrated, and their
evolution with an applied perpendicular magnetic field is studied in details,
along with the disorder-induced vortex-pinning. Simulating the presence of a
parallel Zeeman field it is demonstrated that the islands are indeed
uncorrelated superconducting domains. Experimental predictions based on this
analysis are presented.
