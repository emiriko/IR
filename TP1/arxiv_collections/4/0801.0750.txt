Accurate knowledge of mechanical and thermal properties of structural
materials used in MEMS is essential for optimum geometric and functional
design. The extraction of precise physical properties is rather complicated due
to the size effects, the complexity of the structures and the variations of
formation processes. This work is intended to determine the thermal properties
of silicon-nitride and diamond layers applied in thermal sensor structures by
analyzing thermal responses of a multilayer micro-heater structure.
