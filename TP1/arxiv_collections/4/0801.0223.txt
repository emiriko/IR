We discuss vacuum energy in string and M-theory with a focus on heterotic
M-theory. In the latter theory a mechanism is described for maintaining zero
vacuum energy after supersymmetry breaking. Higher-order corrections can be
expected to give a sufficiently small amount of vacuum energy to possibly
account for dark energy.
