We report on a numerical study of quantum transport in disordered two
dimensional graphene and graphene nanoribbons. By using the Kubo and the
Landauer approaches, transport length scales in the diffusive (mean free path,
charge mobilities) and localized regimes (localization lengths) are computed,
assuming a short range disorder (Anderson-type). In agreement with localization
scaling theory, the electronic systems are found to undergo a conventional
Anderson localization in the zero temperature limit. Localization lengths in
weakly disordered ribbons are found to differ by two orders of magnitude
depending on their edge symmetry, but always remain several orders of magnitude
smaller than those computed for 2D graphene for the same disorder strength.
This pinpoints the role of transport dimensionality and edge effects.
