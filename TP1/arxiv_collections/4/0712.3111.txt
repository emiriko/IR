The scattering processes of exotic atoms in excited states from hydrogen such
as elastic scattering, Stark transitions and Coulomb de-excitation are studied
within a close coupling approach. The vacuum polarization and the strong
interaction shifts of $ns$-states (in case of hadronic atoms) are taken into
account. The differential and integral cross sections of the above processes
are calculated to use them as the input in cascade calculations. The effect of
closed channels on the scattering processes is investigated.
