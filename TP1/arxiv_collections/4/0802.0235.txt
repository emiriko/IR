We give a representation for entanglement-breaking channels in separable
Hilbert space that generalizes the "Kraus decomposition with rank one
operators" and use it to describe the complementary channels. We also give
necessary and sufficient condition of entanglement-breaking for a general
quantum Gaussian channel. Application of this condition to one-mode channels
provides several new cases where the additivity conjecture holds in full
generality.
