The notion of the Fibonacci cobweb poset from [1] has been naturally extended
to any admissible sequence $F$ in [2] where it was also recognized that the
celebrated prefab notion of Bender and Goldman [3] - (see also [4,5]) - admits
such an extension so as to encompass the new type combinatorial objects from
[2] as leading examples. Recently the present author had introduced also [6]
two natural partial orders in there: one $\leq$ in grading-natural subsets of
cobweb`s prefabs sets [2] and in the second proposal one endows the set sums of
the so called "prefabiants" with such another partial order that one arrives at
Bell-like numbers including Fibonacci triad sequences introduced by the present
author in [7]. Here we quote the basic observations concerning the new type
Stirling like numbers as they appear in [6]. For more on notation, Stirling
like numbers of the first kind and for proofs - see [6].
