We give a review of recent work aimed at understanding the dynamics of
gravitational collapse in quantum gravity. Its goal is to provide a
non-perturbative computational framework for understanding the emergence of the
semi-classical approximation and Hawking radiation. The model studied is the
gravity-scalar field theory in spherical symmetry. A quantization of this
theory is given in which operators corresponding to null expansions and
curvature are well defined. Together with the Hamiltonian, these operators
allow one to follow the evolution of an initial matter-geometry state to a
trapped configuration and beyond, in a singularity free and unitary setting.
