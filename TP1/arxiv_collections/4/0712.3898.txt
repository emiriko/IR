The effective photon hypothesis of Panarella and Raychaudhuri shows that the
self focusing of photon in the laser beam is inherent and it also shows that
the the cause of phenomena of self focusing of intense laser radiation in
solids is not actually the nonlinear intensity dependent refractive index. In
the effective photon hypothesis the laser photon have much better chance than
ordinary photon to undergo a phase transition to a superfluid state.
  If a super fluid photon in the laser beam can be realized then in the
effective photon hypothesis gives interesting results. The effective photon
hypothesis shows that if the average energy X-ray laser beams is $h\nu=10^{3}$
$eV \sim 10^{4}$ $eV$, we find that mass of the quasiparticles in the X-ray
laser beams is in the range $10^{5}$ $eV \sim 10^{12}$ $eV$. Thus the mass of
the quasipartcle in the X-ray laser beams can be $Z$-boson of the electroweak
theory of weak interactions. It is possible that $W^{+}$ and $W^{-}$ can be
originated from another vector boson whose mass is more than 200 GeV.
