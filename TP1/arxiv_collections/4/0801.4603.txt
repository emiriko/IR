We study the mass of the state Y(2175) of J^{PC} = 1^{--} in the QCD sum
rule. We construct both the diquark-antidiquark currents (ss)(s_bar s_bar) and
the meson-meson currents (s_bar s)(s_bar s). We find that there are two
independent currents for both cases, and derive the relations between them. The
OPE convergence of these two currents is sufficiently fast, which enables us to
perform good sum rule analysis. Both the SVZ sum rule and the finite energy sum
rule lead to a mass around 2.3+-0.4 GeV, which is consistent with the observed
mass within the uncertainties of the present QCD sum rule. The coupling of the
four-quark currents to lower lying states such as \phi(1020) turns out to be
rather small. We also discuss possible decay properties of Y(2175) if it is a
tetraquark state.
