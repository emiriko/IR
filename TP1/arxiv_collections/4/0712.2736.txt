It is shown that the statistics of the hardcore fermions is A-superstatistics
of order one [see T.D.P. J. Math. Phys. 21, 1293 (1980)]. The Pauli principle
for these particles is formulated. The Hubbard operators, which constitute a
basis in the Lie superalgebra gl(1|n), are expressed via the creation and the
annihilation operators of the hardcore fermions.
