Suppose there is a mesoscopic system connected to single channel leads. If
the system is non-chaotic or non-ergodic then the thermodynamic and transport
properties do not depend on impurity averaged density of states. We show that
the partial density of states as well as density of states of a given system
can be determined exactly from the asymptotic wave-function (or scattering
matrix) at the resonances. The asymptotic wave-function can be determined
experimentally without any knowledge about the quantum mechanical potential
(including electron-electron interaction) or wave function in the interior of
the system. Some counter intuitive relations derived here can allow this.
