We study an SU(2) supersymmetric gauge model in a framework of gauge-Higgs
unification. Multi-Higgs spectrum appears in the model at low energy. We
develop a useful perturbative approximation scheme for evaluating effective
potential to study the multi-Higgs mass spectrum. We find that both
tree-massless and massive Higgs scalars obtain mass corrections of similar size
from finite parts of the loop effects. The corrections modify multi-Higgs mass
spectrum, and hence, the loop effects are significant in view of future
verifications of the gauge-Higgs unification scenario in high-energy
experiments.
