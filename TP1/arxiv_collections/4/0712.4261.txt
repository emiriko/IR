A one-dimensional quantum mechanical model possessing mass gap, a gapless
excitation, and an approximate parity doubling of energy levels is constructed
basing on heuristic QCD-inspired arguments. The model may serve for
illustrative purposes in considering the related dynamical phenomena in
particle and nuclear physics.
