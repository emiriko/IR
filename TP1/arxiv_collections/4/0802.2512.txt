Many networks exhibit the small-world property of the neighborhood
connectivity being higher than in comparable random networks. However, the
standard measure of local neighborhood clustering is typically not defined if a
node has one or no neighbors. In such cases, local clustering has traditionally
been set to zero and this value influenced the global clustering coefficient.
Such a procedure leads to underestimation of the neighborhood clustering in
sparse networks. We propose to include $\theta$ as the proportion of leafs and
isolated nodes to estimate the contribution of these cases and provide a
formula for estimating a clustering coefficient excluding these cases from the
Watts and Strogatz (1998 Nature 393 440-2) definition of the clustering
coefficient. Excluding leafs and isolated nodes leads to values which are up to
140% higher than the traditional values for the observed networks indicating
that neighborhood connectivity is normally underestimated. We find that the
definition of the clustering coefficient has a major effect when comparing
different networks. For metabolic networks of 43 organisms, relations changed
for 58% of the comparisons when a different definition was applied. We also
show that the definition influences small-world features and that the
classification can change from non-small-world to small-world network. We
discuss the use of an alternative measure, disconnectedness D, which is less
influenced by leafs and isolated nodes.
