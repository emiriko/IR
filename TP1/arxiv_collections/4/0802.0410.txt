We derive the N=1 effective action of the heterotic string compactified on
manifolds with SU(3) structure in the presence of background fluxes. We use a
Kaluza-Klein reduction and compute the moduli dependence of the Kaehler
potential, the gauge kinetic function and the superpotential entirely from
fermionic terms of the reduced action.
