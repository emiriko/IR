Tabled Constraint Logic Programming is a powerful execution mechanism for
dealing with Constraint Logic Programming without worrying about fixpoint
computation. Various applications, e.g in the fields of program analysis and
model checking, have been proposed. Unfortunately, a high-level system for
developing new applications is lacking, and programmers are forced to resort to
complicated ad hoc solutions.
  This papers presents TCHR, a high-level framework for tabled Constraint Logic
Programming. It integrates in a light-weight manner Constraint Handling Rules
(CHR), a high-level language for constraint solvers, with tabled Logic
Programming. The framework is easily instantiated with new application-specific
constraint domains. Various high-level operations can be instantiated to
control performance. In particular, we propose a novel, generalized technique
for compacting answer sets.
