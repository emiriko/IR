The antivortex is a fundamental magnetization structure which is the
topological counterpart of the well-known magnetic vortex. We study here the
ultrafast dynamic behavior of an isolated antivortex in a patterned Permalloy
thin-film element. Using micromagnetic simulations we predict that the
antivortex response to an ultrashort external field pulse is characterized by
the production of a new antivortex as well as of a temporary vortex, followed
by an annihilation process. These processes are complementary to the recently
reported response of a vortex and, like for the vortex, lead to the reversal of
the orientation of the antivortex core region. In addition to its fundamental
interest, this dynamic magnetization process could be used for the generation
and propagation of spin waves for novel logical circuits.
