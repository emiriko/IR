In QCD with adjoint fermions (aQCD) the deconfining transition takes place at
a lower temperature than the chiral transition. We study the two transitions by
use of the Polyakov Loop, the monopole order parameter and the chiral
condensate. The deconfining transition is first order, the chiral is a
crossover. The order parameters for confinement are not affected by the chiral
transition. We conclude that the degrees of freedom relevant to confinement are
different from those describing chiral symmetry.
