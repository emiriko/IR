The ground state energy of current carriers in graphene considered as a
zero-gap semiconductor was calculated in the two-band approximation. The
condition of the electronic (hole) system stability in graphene was obtained.
The possibility of the zero-gap semiconductor-semimetal transition was
discussed.
