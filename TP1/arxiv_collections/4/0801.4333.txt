We have developed a conceptually new type of ellipsometry which allows the
determination of the complex refractive index by simultaneously measuring the
unpolarized normal-incidence reflectivity relative to the vacuum and to another
reference media. From these two quantities the complex optical response can be
directly obtained without Kramers-Kronig transformation. Due to its
transparency and large refractive index over a broad range of the spectrum,
from the far-infrared to the soft ultraviolet region, diamond can be ideally
used as a second reference. The experimental arrangement is rather simple
compared to other ellipsometric techniques.
