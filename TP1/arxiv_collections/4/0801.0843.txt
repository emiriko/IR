We give an algebro-geometric approach towards the dynamics of
automorphisms/endomorphisms of projective varieties or compact K\"ahler
manifolds, try to determine the building blocks of automorphisms
/endomorphisms, and show the relation between the dynamics of
automorphisms/endomorphisms and the geometry of the underlying manifolds.
