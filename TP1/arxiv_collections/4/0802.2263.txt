Existing measures of bipartite nonclassical correlation that is typically
characterized by nonvanishing nonlocalizable information under the zero-way
CLOCC protocol are expensive in computational cost. We define and evaluate
economical measures on the basis of a new class of maps,
eigenvalue-preserving-but-not-completely-eigenvalue-preserving (EnCE) maps. The
class is in analogy to the class of positive-but-not-completely-positive (PnCP)
maps that have been commonly used in the entanglement theories. Linear and
nonlinear EnCE maps are investigated. We also prove subadditivity of the
measures in a form of logarithmic fidelity.
