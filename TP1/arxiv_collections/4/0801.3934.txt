The effect of binary alloy disorder on the ferromagnetic phases of f-electron
materials is studied within the periodic Anderson model. We find that disorder
in the conduction band can drastically enhance the Curie temperature due to an
increase of the local f-moment. The effect may be explained qualitatively and
even quantitatively by a simple theoretical ansatz. The emergence of an alloy
Kondo insulator at non-integer filling is also pointed out.
