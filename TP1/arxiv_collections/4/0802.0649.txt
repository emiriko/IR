Recent data from Belle show unusually large partial widths Upsilon(5S) -->
Upsilon(1S) pi^+pi^- and \Upsilon(5S) --> \Upsilon(2S) pi^+ pi^-. The Z(4430)
narrow resonance also reported by Belle in psi' pi^+ spectrum has the
properties expected of a (cbar c u dbar) charged isovector tetraquark T^{+-}_cc
The analogous state T^{+-} in the bottom sector might mediate anomalously large
cascade decays in the Upsilon system, Upsilon(mS) --> T^{+-}_bb pi^{-+} -->
Upsilon(nS) pi^+ \pi^-, with a tetraquark-pion intermediate state. We suggest
looking for the (bbar b u dbar) tetraquark in these decays as peaks in the
invariant mass of Upsilon(1S) pi or Upsilon(2S) pi systems. The (bbar b u sbar)
tetraquark can appear in the observed decays Upsilon(5S) --> Upsilon(1S) K^+
K^- as a peak in the invariant mass of Upsilon(1S) K system. We review the
model showing that these tetraquarks are below the two heavy meson threshold,
but respectively above the Upsilon pi pi and Upsilon K Kbar thresholds.
