Near the critical point, isothermal interfacial zones are investigated
starting from a non-local density of energy. From the equations of motion of
thermocapillary fluids, we point out a new kind of adiabatic waves propagating
along the interfacial layers. The waves are associated with the second
derivatives of densities and propagate with a celerity depending on the
proximity of the critical point.
