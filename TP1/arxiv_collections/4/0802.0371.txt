We propose a numerical renormalization group (NRG) approach to steady-state
currents through nano-devices. A discretization of the scattering-states
continuum ensures the correct boundary condition for an open quantum system. We
introduce two degenerate Wilson chains for current carrying left and
right-moving electrons reflecting time-reversal symmetry in the absence of a
finite bias $V$. We employ the time-dependent NRG to evolve the known
steady-state density operator for a non-interacting junction into the density
operator of the fully interacting nano-device at finite bias. We calculate the
temperature dependent current as function of $V$ and applied external magnetic
field using a recently developed algorithm for non-equilibrium spectral
functions.
