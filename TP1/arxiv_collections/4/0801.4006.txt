We consider theoretically the possibility of observing unusual quantum fluid
behavior in liquid $^{3}$He and solutions of $^{3}$He in $^{4}$He systems
confined to nano-channels. In the case of pure ballistic flow at very low
temperature conductance will be quantized in units of $2m^{2}/h$. We show that
these steps should be sensitive to increases in temperature. We also use of a
random scattering matrix simulation to study flow with diffusive wall
scattering. Universal conductance fluctuations analogous to those seen in
electron systems should then be observable. Finally we consider the possibility
of the cross-over to a one-dimensional system at sufficiently low temperature
where the system could form a Luttinger liquid.
