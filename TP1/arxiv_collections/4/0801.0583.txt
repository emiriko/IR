We analyze the properties of Neel and Bloch domain walls as a function of
film thickness h, for systems where, in addition to exchange, the dipole-dipole
interaction must be included. The Neel to Bloch phase transition is found to be
a second order transition at hc, mediated by a single unstable mode that
corresponds to oscillatory motion of the domain wall center. A uniform
out-of-plane rf-field couples strongly to this critical mode only in the Neel
phase. An analytical Landau theory shows that the critical mode frequency
varies as the square root of (hc - h) just below the transition, as found
numerically.
