The dynamics of a single spin embedded in a the tunnel junction between
ferromagnetic contacts is strongly affected by the exchange coupling to the
tunneling electrons. Moment reversal of the local spin induced by the bias
voltage across the junction is shown to have a measurable effect on the
tunneling current. Furthermore, the frequency of a harmonic bias voltage is
picked up by the local spin dynamics and transferred back to the current
generating a double frequency component.
