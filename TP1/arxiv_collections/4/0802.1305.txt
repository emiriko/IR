Spatiotemporal correlations of the two-dimensional spring-block
(Burridge-Knopoff) models of earthquakes with the long-range inter-block
interactions are extensively studied by means of numerical computer
simulations. The long-range interaction derived from an elasticd theory, which
takes account of the effect of the elastic body adjacent to the fault plane,
falls off with distance r as 1/r^3. Comparison is made with the properties of
the corresponding short-range models studied earlier. Seismic spatiotemporal
correlations of the long-range models generally tend to be weaker than those of
the short-range models. The magnitude distribution exhibits a ``near-critical''
behavior, i.e., a power-law-like behavior close to the Gutenberg-Richter law,
for a wide parameter range with its B-value, B\simeq 0.55, insensitive to the
model parameters, in sharp contrast to that of the 2D short-range model and
those of the 1D short-range and long-range models where such a
``near-critical'' behavior is realized only by fine-tuning the model
parameters. In contrast to the short-range case, the mean stress-drop at a
seismic event of the long-range model is nearly independent of its magnitude,
consistently with the observation. Large events often accompany foreshocks
together with a doughnut-like quiescence as their precursors, while they hardly
accompany aftershocks with almost negligible seismic correlations observed
after the mainshock.
