We explore the possibility that the right-handed top quark is composite. We
examine the consequences that compositeness would have on $t \bar{t}$
production at the Tevatron, and derive a weak constraint on the scale of
compositeness of order a few hundred GeV from the $t \bar{t}$ inclusive cross
section. More detailed studies of differential properties of $t \bar{t}$
production could potentially improve this limit. We find that a composite top
can result in an enhancement of the $t \bar{t} t \bar{t}$ production rate at
the LHC (of as much as $10^3$ compared to the Standatd Model four top rate). We
explore observables which allow us to extract the four top rate from the
backgrounds, and show that the LHC can either discover or constrain top
compositeness for wide ranges of parameter space.
