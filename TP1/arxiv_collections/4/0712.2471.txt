We study extensions of a quantum channel whose one-way capacities are
described by a single-letter formula. This provides a simple technique for
generating powerful upper bounds on the capacities of a general quantum
channel. We apply this technique to two qubit channels of particular
interest--the depolarizing channel and the channel with independent phase and
amplitude noise. Our study of the latter demonstrates that the key rate of BB84
with one-way post-processing and quantum bit error rate q cannot exceed
H(1/2-2q(1-q)) - H(2q(1-q)).
