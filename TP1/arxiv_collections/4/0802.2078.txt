We study the moduli spaces of polarised irreducible symplectic manifolds. By
a comparison with locally symmetric varieties of orthogonal type of dimension
20, we show that the moduli space of 2d polarised (split type) symplectic
manifolds which are deformation equivalent to degree 2 Hilbert schemes of a K3
surface is of general type if d is at least 12.
