The relativistic Coulomb resummation factor suggested by I.L. Solovtsov is
used to reanalyze the mass limits obtained for magnetic monopoles which might
have been produced at the Fermilab Tevatron. The limits given by the Oklahoma
experiment (Fermilab E882) are pushed close to the unitary bounds, so that the
lower limits on monopole masses are increased from around 250 GeV to about 400
GeV.
