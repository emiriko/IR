We present a logical separability analysis for a functional quantum
computation language. This logic is inspired by previous works on logical
analysis of aliasing for imperative functional programs. Both analyses share
similarities notably because they are highly non-compositional. Quantum setting
is harder to deal with since it introduces non determinism and thus
considerably modifies semantics and validity of logical assertions. This logic
is the first proposal of entanglement/separability analysis dealing with a
functional quantum programming language with higher-order functions.
