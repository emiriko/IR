A simple non-local theoretical model is developed considering concentrated
ionic surfactant solutions as regular ones. Their thermodynamics is described
by the Cahn-Hilliard theory coupled with electrostatics. It is discovered that
unstable solutions possess two critical temperatures, where the temperature
coefficients of all characteristic lengths are discontinuous. At temperatures
below the lower critical temperature ionic surfactant solutions separate into
thin layers of oppositely charged liquids spread across the whole system and
the electric potential is strictly periodic. At temperatures between the two
critical temperatures separation can occur only near the solution surface thus
leading to an oscillatory-decaying electric double layer. At temperatures above
the higher critical temperature as well as in stable solutions there is no
separation and the electric potential decays exponentially.
