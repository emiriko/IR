We review here the recent success in quantum annealing, i.e., optimization of
the cost or energy functions of complex systems utilizing quantum fluctuations.
The concept is introduced in successive steps through the studies of mapping of
such computationally hard problems to the classical spin glass problems. The
quantum spin glass problems arise with the introduction of quantum
fluctuations, and the annealing behavior of the systems as these fluctuations
are reduced slowly to zero. This provides a general framework for realizing
analog quantum computation.
