Many networks extent in space, may it be metric (e.g. geographic) or
non-metric (ordinal). Spatial network growth, which depends on the distance
between nodes, can generate a wide range of topologies from small-world to
linear scale-free networks. However, networks often lacked multiple clusters or
communities. Multiple clusters can be generated, however, if there are time
windows during development. Time windows ensure that regions of the network
develop connections at different points in time. This novel approach could
generate small-world but not scale-free networks. The resulting topology
depended critically on the overlap of time windows as well as on the position
of pioneer nodes.
