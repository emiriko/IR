The introduction of new technologies and concepts of operation in the air
transportation system is not possible, unless they can be proven not to
adversely affect the system operation under not only nominal, but also degraded
conditions. In extreme scenarios, degraded operations due to partial or
complete technological failures should never endanger system safety. Many past
system evolutions, whether ground-based or airborne, have been based on
trial-and-error, and system safety was addressed only after a specific event
yielded dramatic or near- dramatic consequences. Future system evolutions,
however, must leverage available computation, prior knowledge and abstract
reasoning to anticipate all possible system degradations and prove that such
degradations are graceful and safe. This paper is concerned with the graceful
degradation of high-density, structured arrival traffic against partial or
complete surveillance failures. It is shown that for equal performance
requirements, some traffic configurations might be easier to handle than
others, thereby offering a quantitative perspective on these traffic
configurations. ability to "gracefully degrade". To support our work, we also
introduce a new conflict resolution algorithm, aimed at solving conflicts
involving many aircraft when aircraft position information is in the process of
degrading.
