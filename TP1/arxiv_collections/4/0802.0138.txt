Laser-driven rescattering of electrons is the basis of many strong-field
phenomena in atoms and molecules. Here, we will show how this mechanism
operates in extended atomic systems, giving rise to effective energy
absorption. Rescattering from extended systems can also lead to energy loss,
which in its extreme form results in non-linear photo-association.
Intense-laser interaction with atomic clusters is discussed as an example. We
explain fast electron emission, seen in experimental and numerically obtained
spectra, by rescattering of electrons at the highly charged cluster.
