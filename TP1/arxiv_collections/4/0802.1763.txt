We present a simple and stable numerical method to approximate the ground
state of a quantum many-body system by multiple determinant states. This method
searches these determinant states one by one according to the matching pursuit
algorithm. The first determinant state is identical to that of the Hartree-Fock
theory. Calculations for two-dimensional Hubbard model serve as a
demonstration.
