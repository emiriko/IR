We note that the vanishing and injectivity theorems of Koll\'ar and
Esnault-Viehweg can be used to give a quick algebraic proof of a strengthening
of the Ein-Lazarsfeld Skoda-type division theorem for global sections of
adjoint line bundles vanishing along suitable multiplier ideal sheaves, and to
extend it to higher cohomology classes as well. For global sections, this is
also a slightly more general statement of the algebraic translation of an
analytic result of Siu. Along the way we write down an injectivity statement
for multiplier ideals, and its standard consequences.
