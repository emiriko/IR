We propose a protocol for perfect quantum state transfer that is resilient to
a broad class of realistic experimental imperfections, including noise sources
that could be modelled either as independent Markovian baths or as certain
forms of spatially correlated environments. We highlight interesting
connections between the fidelity of state transfer and quantum stochastic
resonance effects. The scheme is flexible enough to act as an effective
entangling gate for the generation of genuine multipartite entanglement in a
control-limited setting. Possible experimental implementations using
superconducting qubits are also briefly discussed.
