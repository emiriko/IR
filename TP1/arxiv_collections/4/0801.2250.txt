The space of Gaussian measures on a Euclidean space is geodesically convex in
the $L^2$-Wasserstein space. This space is a finite dimensional manifold since
Gaussian measures are parameterized by means and covariance matrices. By
restricting to the space of Gaussian measures inside the $L^2$-Wasserstein
space, we manage to provide detailed descriptions of the $L^2$-Wasserstein
geometry from a Riemannian geometric viewpoint. We first construct a Riemannian
metric which induces the $L^2$-Wasserstein distance. Then we obtain a formula
for the sectional curvatures of the space of Gaussian measures, which is
written out in terms of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.
