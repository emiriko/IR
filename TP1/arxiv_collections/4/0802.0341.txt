Fermionic superfluidity requires the formation of pairs. The actual size of
these fermion pairs varies by orders of magnitude from the femtometer scale in
neutron stars and nuclei to the micrometer range in conventional
superconductors. Many properties of the superfluid depend on the pair size
relative to the interparticle spacing. This is expressed in BCS-BEC crossover
theories, describing the crossover from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) type
superfluid of loosely bound and large Cooper pairs to Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC) of tightly bound molecules. Such a crossover superfluid has
been realized in ultracold atomic gases where high temperature superfluidity
has been observed. The microscopic properties of the fermion pairs can be
probed with radio-frequency (rf) spectroscopy. Previous work was difficult to
interpret due to strong and not well understood final state interactions. Here
we realize a new superfluid spin mixture where such interactions have
negligible influence and present fermion-pair dissociation spectra that reveal
the underlying pairing correlations. This allows us to determine the
spectroscopic pair size in the resonantly interacting gas to be 2.6(2)/kF (kF
is the Fermi wave number). The pairs are therefore smaller than the
interparticle spacing and the smallest pairs observed in fermionic superfluids.
This finding highlights the importance of small fermion pairs for superfluidity
at high critical temperatures. We have also identified transitions from fermion
pairs into bound molecular states and into many-body bound states in the case
of strong final state interactions.
