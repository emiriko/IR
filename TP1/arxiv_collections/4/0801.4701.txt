As a model of composite materials, a bundle of many fibers with
stochastically distributed breaking thresholds for the individual fibers is
considered. The bundle is loaded until complete failure to capture the failure
scenario of composite materials under external load. The fibers are assumed to
share the load equally, and to obey Hookean elasticity right up to the breaking
point. We determine the distribution of bursts in which an amount of energy $E$
is released. The energy distribution follows asymptotically a universal power
law $E^{-5/2}$, for any statistical distribution of fiber strengths. A similar
power law dependence is found in some experimental acoustic emission studies of
loaded composite materials.
