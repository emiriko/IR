We study the radiative lepton flavor violating l_i -> l_j \gamma\gamma decays
in the case that the lepton flavor violation is induced by the scalar
unparticle mediation. We restrict the scaling dimension d_u and the scalar
unparticle-photon-photon coupling by using the experimental upper limit of the
branching ratio of the decay \mu -> e \gamma\gamma. Furthermore, we predict the
BRs of the other radiative decays by using the restrictions we get. We observe
that the measurements of upper limits of BRs of these decays ensure
considerable information for testing the possible signals coming from
unparticle physics
