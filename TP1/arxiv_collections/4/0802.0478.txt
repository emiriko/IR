The 1/[-i\omega + D(\omega, q)q^2] diffusion pole in the localized phase
transfers to the 1/\omega Berezinskii-Gorkov singularity, which can be analyzed
by the instanton method (M V. Sadovskii, 1982; J. L. Cardy, 1978).
Straightforward use of this approach leads to contradictions, which do not
disappear even if the problem is extremely simplied by taking zero-dimensional
limit. On the contrary, they are extremely sharpened in this case and become
paradoxes. The main paradox is specified by the following statements: (i) the
1/\omega singularity is determined by high orders of perturbation theory, (ii)
the high-order behaviors for two quantities \Phi^{RA} and U^{RA} are the same,
and (iii) \Phi^{RA} has the 1/\omega singularity, whereas U^{RA} does not have
it. Solution to the paradox indicates that the instanton method makes it
possible to obtain only the 1/(\omega + i\gamma) singularity, where the
parameter \gamma remains indefinite and must be determined from additional
conditions. This conceptually confirms the necessity of the self-consistent
treatment for the diffusion coefficient that is used in the Vollhardt-Wolfle
type theories.
