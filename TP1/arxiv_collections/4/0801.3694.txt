Bose condensation is responsible for many of the most spectacular effects in
physics because it can promote quantum behavior from the microscopic to the
macroscopic world. Bose condensates can be distinguished by the condensing
object; electron-electron Cooper-pairs are responsible for superconductivity,
Helium atoms for superfluidity, and ultracold alkali atoms in vapors for
coherent matter waves. Electron-hole pair (exciton) condensation has maintained
special interest because it has been difficult to realize experimentally, and
because exciton phase coherence is never perfectly spontaneous. Although ideal
condensates can support an exciton supercurrent, it has not been clear how such
a current could be induced or detected, or how its experimental manifestation
would be altered by the phase-fixing exciton creation and annhilation processes
which are inevitably present. In this article we explain how to induce an
exciton supercurrent in separately contacted bilayer condensates, and predict
electrical effects which enable unambiguous detection.
