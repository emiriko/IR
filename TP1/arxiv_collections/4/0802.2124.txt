The dispersion (van der Waals and Casimir) force between two semi-spaces are
calculated using the Lifshitz theory for different materials relevant for micro
and nanodevices fabrication, namely, gold, silicon, gallium arsenide, diamond
and two types of diamond-like carbon (DLC), silicon carbide, silicon nitride
and silicon dioxide. The calculations were performed using recent experimental
optical data available in the literature, usually ranging from the far infrared
up to the extreme ultraviolet bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. The
results are presented in the form of a correction factor to the Casimir force
predicted between perfect conductors, for the separation between the
semi-spaces varying from 1 nanometre up to 1 micrometre. The relative
importance of the contributions to the dispersion force of the optical
properties in different spectral ranges is analyzed. The role of the
temperature for semiconductors and insulators is also addressed. The results
are meant to be useful for the estimation of the impact of the Casimir and van
der Waals forces on the operational parameters of micro and nanodevices.
