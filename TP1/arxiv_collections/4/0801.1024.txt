The charmonium system provides an opportunity to explore a wide variety of
topics in hadronic physics. Studies of the properties of and transitions among
cc-bar states yield insight into relativistic and non-perturbative QCD effects.
At the same time, studies of the decays of charmonium states are a window into
gluon dynamics and the role of glueball mixing in the production of light quark
states. A collection of preliminary results utilizing the full CLEO-c psi(2S)
data sample is presented including two-body branching fractions of chi_cJ
decays, a precision measurement of the h_c mass, and results on the hindered M1
transition: psi(2S) -> gamma eta_c.
