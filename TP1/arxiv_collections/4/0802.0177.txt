We show how the early data runs of the LHC can provide valuable checks of the
different components of the formalism used to predict the cross sections of
central exclusive processes. The `soft' rapidity gap survival factor can be
studied in electroweak processes, such as W+gaps events, where the bare
amplitude is well known. The generalized gluon distribution, in the appropriate
kinematic region, can be probed by exclusive Upsilon production. The
perturbative QCD effects, especially the Sudakov-like factor, can be probed by
exclusive two- and three-jet production. We discuss the possible role of
enhanced absorptive corrections which would violate the soft-hard factorization
implied in the usual formalism, and suggest ways that the LHC may explore their
presence.
