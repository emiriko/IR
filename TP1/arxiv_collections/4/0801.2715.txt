Azimuthal di-hadron correlations play important role in the characterization
of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. Moreover, as a novel
phenomenon, strong modification of the away-side correlation is observed in
Au+Au with respect to p+p collisions. Below the exclusive jet reconstruction
threshold at LHC, leading particle correlations will provide access to the
regime where hard scatterings and bulk medium properties can be simultaneously
studied. Leading particle correlations can be extended to very low transverse
momenta via the tracking and particle identification capabilities of ALICE, to
the coalescence and hydrodynamic domains. In preparation for the first p+p and
Pb+Pb collisions of LHC, we present prospects on leading particle correlations
with identified particles in ALICE.
