We study the potential of the combination of the golden ($\nu_e \to \nu_\mu$)
and silver ($\nu_e \to \nu_\tau$) channels to solve the octant degeneracy
affecting the measurement of $\theta_{13}$ and $\delta$ at future neutrino
factories. To search for $\tau$ leptons produced in $\nu_\tau$ charged-current
interactions, we consider two different detectors: the Emulsion Cloud Chamber
detector (ECC) and the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC). We show
that, when using similar detector masses, the upgraded version of the ECC
detector (sensitive also to hadronic $\tau$ decay modes) and the LAr TPC
detector have comparable sensitivities to the octant of $\theta_{23}$, being
able to discriminate the two solutions for $\sin^2 (2\theta_{13}) \gtrsim
10^{-3}$ at 3$\sigma$ level if $\theta_{23}=40^\circ$. We also show that the
same setups are able to see deviation from maximal mixing as small as $\sim$
(4-6)% (at 3$\sigma$) if $\theta_{13}$ is close to its upper bound.
