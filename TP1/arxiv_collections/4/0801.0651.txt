Peter Jorgensen introduced the Auslander-Reiten quiver of a simply connected
Poincare duality space. He showed that its components are of the form ZA_infty
and that the Auslander-Reiten quiver of a d-dimensional sphere consists of d-1
such components. In this thesis we show that this is the only case where
finitely many components appear. More precisely, we construct families of
modules, where for each family, each module lies in a different component.
Depending on the cohomology dimensions of the differential graded algebras
which appear, this is either a discrete family or an n-parameter family for all
n.
