We report the discovery of a complete suppression of ferroelectricity in
$MnWO_4$ by 10 % iron substitution and its restoration in external magnetic
fields. The spontaneous polarization in $Mn_{0.9}Fe_{0.1}WO_4$ arises below 12
K in external fields above 4 T. The magnetic/ferroelectric phase diagram is
constructed from the anomalies of the dielectric constant, polarization,
magnetization, and heat capacity. The observations are qualitatively described
by a mean field model with competing interactions and strong anisotropy. We
propose that the magnetic field induces a non-collinear inversion symmetry
breaking magnetic structure in $Mn_{0.9}Fe_{0.1}WO_4$.
