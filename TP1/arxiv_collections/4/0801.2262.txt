We construct a familly of exact solutions of Lovelock equations describing
codimension four branes with discrete symmetry in the transverse space. Unlike
what is known from pure Einstein gravity, where such brane solutions of higher
codimension are singular, the solutions we find, for the complete Lovelock
theory, only present removable singularities. The latter account for a
localised tension-like energy-momentum tensor on the brane, in analogy with the
case of a codimension two self-gravitating cosmic string in pure Einstein
gravity. However, the solutions we discuss present two main distinctive
features : the tension of the brane receives corrections from the induced
curvature of the brane's worldsheet and, in a given Lovelock theory, the
spectrum of possible values of the tension is discrete. These solutions provide
a new framework for the study of higher codimension braneworlds.
