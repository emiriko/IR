The various sources of Rational Terms contributing to the one-loop amplitudes
are critically discussed. We show that the terms originating from the generic
(n-4)-dimensional structure of the numerator of the one-loop amplitude can be
derived by using appropriate Feynman rules within a tree-like computation. For
the terms that originate from the reduction of the 4-dimensional part of the
numerator, we present two different strategies and explicit algorithms to
compute them.
