We demonstrate the effects of embedding subgraphs using a Boolean network,
which is one of the discrete dynamical models for transcriptional regulatory
networks. After comparing the dynamical properties of network embedded seven
different subgraphs including feedback and feedforward subgraphs, we found that
complexity of the state space that increases with longer length of attractors
and greater number of attractors is reduced for networks with more feedforward
subgraphs. In addition, feedforward subgraphs can also provide higher mutual
information with lower entropy in a temporal program of gene expression.
Networks with other six subgraphs show opposite effects on dynamics of the
networks, is roughly consistent with Thomas's conjecture. These results suggest
that feedforward subgraphs are one of the favorable local structures in
biological complex networks.
