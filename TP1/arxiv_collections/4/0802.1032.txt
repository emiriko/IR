Einstein field equations under spherically symmetric space-times are
considered here in connection to dark energy investigation. A set of solutions
are obtained for a kinematical $\Lambda$ model, viz., $\Lambda \sim (\dot
a/a)^2$ without assuming any {\it a priori} value for the curvature constant
and the equation of state parameter $\omega$. Some interesting results, such as
the nature of cosmic density $\Omega$ and deceleration parameter $q$, have been
obtained with the consideration of two-fluid structure instead of usual
uni-fluid cosmological model.
