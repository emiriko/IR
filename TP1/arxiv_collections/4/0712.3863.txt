A nilmanifold is a quotient of a nilpotent group $G$ by a co-compact discrete
subgroup. A complex nilmanifold is one which is equipped with a $G$-invariant
complex structure. We prove that a complex nilmanifold has trivial canonical
bundle. This is used to study hypercomplex nilmanifolds (nilmanifolds with a
triple of $G$-invariant complex structures which satisfy quaternionic
relations). We prove that a hypercomplex nilmanifold admits an HKT (hyperkahler
with torsion) metric if and only if the underlying hypercomplex structure is
abelian. Moreover, any $G$-invariant HKT-metric on a nilmanifold is balanced
with respect to all associated complex structures.
