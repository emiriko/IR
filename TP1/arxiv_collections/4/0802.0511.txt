Functionally graded materials (FGMs) are two-phase composites with
continuously changing microstructure adapted to performance requirements.
Traditionally, the overall behavior of FGMs has been determined using local
averaging techniques or a given smooth variation of material properties.
Although these models are computationally efficient, their validity and
accuracy remain questionable, since a link with the underlying microstructure
(including its randomness) is not clear. In this paper, we propose a modeling
strategy for the linear elastic analysis of FGMs systematically based on a
realistic microstructural model. The overall response of FGMs is addressed in
the framework of stochastic Hashin-Shtrikman variational principles. To allow
for the analysis of finite bodies, recently introduced discretization schemes
based on the Finite Element Method and the Boundary Element Method are employed
to obtain statistics of local fields. Representative numerical examples are
presented to compare the performance and accuracy of both schemes. To gain
insight into similarities and differences between these methods and to minimize
technicalities, the analysis is performed in the one-dimensional setting.
