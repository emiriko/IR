We have derived consistent sets of band parameters (band gaps, crystal
field-splittings, band gap deformation potentials, effective masses, Luttinger
and EP parameters) for AlN, GaN, and InN in the zinc-blende and wurtzite phases
employing many-body perturbation theory in the G0W0 approximation. The G0W0
method has been combined with density-functional theory (DFT) calculations in
the exact-exchange optimized effective potential approach (OEPx) to overcome
the limitations of local-density or gradient-corrected DFT functionals (LDA and
GGA). The band structures in the vicinity of the Gamma-point have been used to
directly parameterize a 4x4 k.p Hamiltonian to capture non-parabolicities in
the conduction bands and the more complex valence-band structure of the
wurtzite phases. We demonstrate that the band parameters derived in this
fashion are in very good agreement with the available experimental data and
provide reliable predictions for all parameters which have not been determined
experimentally so far.
