We show that the construction of BPS-type equations for non-extremal black
holes due to Miller et. al. can be extended to branes of arbitrary dimension
and, more importantly, to time-dependent solutions. We call these first-order
equations fake- or pseudo-BPS equations in light of the formalism that has been
developed for domain wall and cosmological solutions of gravity coupled to
scalar fields. We present the fake/pseudo-BPS equations for all stationary
branes (timelike branes) and all time-dependent branes (spacelike branes) of an
Einstein-dilaton-p-form system in arbitrary dimensions.
