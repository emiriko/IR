We derived simple polynomial equations to determine the entire resonance
spectra of split ring structures. For double stacking split rings made with
flat wires, we showed that the resonance frequency depends linearly on the
ring-ring separation. In particular, we found that the wavelength of the lowest
resonance mode can be made as large as the geometrical size of the ring for
realistic experimental conditions, whereas for current systems this ratio is of
the order of 10. Finite-difference-time-domain simulations on realistic
structures verified the analytic predictions.
