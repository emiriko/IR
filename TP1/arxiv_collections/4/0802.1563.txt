The $B^* B\pi$ coupling is a fundamental parameter of chiral effective
Lagrangian with heavy-light mesons and can constrain the chiral behavior of
$f_B$, $B_B$ and the $B\to \pi l \nu$ form factor in the soft pion limit. We
compute the $B^* B \pi $ coupling with the static heavy quark and the
$O(a)$-improved Wilson light quark. Simulations are carried out with $n_f=2$
unquenched $12^3\times 24$ lattices at $\beta=1.80$ and $16^3\times 32$
lattices at $\beta=1.95$ generated by CP-PACS collaboration. To improve the
statistical accuracy, we employ the all-to-all propagator technique and the
static quark action with smeared temporal link variables following the quenched
study by Negishi {\it et al.}. These methods successfully work also on
unquenched lattices, and determine the $B^*B\pi$ coupling with 1--2%
statistical accuracy on each lattice spacing.
