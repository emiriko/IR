Exponential band edges have been observed in a variety of materials, both
crystalline and amorphous. In this paper, we infer the structural origins of
these tails in amorphous and defective crystalline Si by direct calculation
with current {\it ab initio} methods. We find that exponential tails appear in
relaxed models of diamond with suitable point defects. In amorphous silicon
(a-Si), we find that structural filaments of short bonds and long bonds exist
in the network, and that the tail states near the extreme edges of both band
tails are are also filamentary, with much localization on the structural
filaments. We connect the existence of both filament systems to structural
relaxation in the presence of defects and or topological disorder.
