We report on a recently developed novel type of large area (62 mm x 62 mm)
position sensitive silicon detector with four-corner readout. It consists of a
square-shaped ion-implanted resistive anode framed by additional
low-resistivity strips with resistances smaller than the anode surface
resistance by a factor of 2. The detector position linearity, position
resolution, and energy resolution were measured with alpha-particles and heavy
ions. In-beam experimental results reveal a position resolution below 1 mm
(FWHM) and a very good non-linearity of less than 1% (rms). The energy
resolution determined from 228Th alpha source measurements is around 2% (FWHM).
