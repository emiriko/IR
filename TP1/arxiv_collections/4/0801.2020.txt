We study self-consistent cosmological solutions for an Einstein Universe in a
graph-based induced gravity model. The graph-based field theory has been
proposed by the present authors to generalize dimensional deconstruction. In
this paper, we consider self-consistent Einstein equations for a ``graph theory
space''. Especially, we demonstrate specific results for cycle graphs.
