Spin-dependent transport is investigated in ballistic regime through the
interface between a ferromagnet and a spin spiral. We show that spin-dependent
interferences lead to a new type of diffraction called "spin-diffraction". It
is shown that this spin-diffraction leads to local spin and electrical currents
along the interface. This study also shows that in highly non homogeneous
magnetic configuration (non adiabatic limit), the contribution of the
diffracted electrons is crucial to describe spin transport in such structures.
