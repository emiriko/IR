A simple model of Laplacian growth is considered, in which the growth takes
place only at the tips of long, thin fingers. In a recent paper, Carleson and
Makarov used the deterministic Loewner equation to describe the evolution of
such a system. We extend their approach to a channel geometry and show that the
presence of the side walls has a significant influence on the evolution of the
fingers and the dynamics of the screening process, in which longer fingers
suppress the growth of the shorter ones.
