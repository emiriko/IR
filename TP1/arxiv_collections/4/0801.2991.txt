We propose a new concept of strong controllability associated with the Schur
complement of a suitable limiting matrix. This concept allows us to extend the
previous results associated with multidimensional ARX models. On the one hand,
we carry out a sharp analysis of the almost sure convergence for both least
squares and weighted least squares algorithms. On the other hand, we also
provide a central limit theorem and a law of iterated logarithm for these two
stochastic algorithms. Our asymptotic results are illustrated by numerical
simulations.
