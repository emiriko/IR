We report the first observation of three-mode opto-acoustic parametric
interactions of the type predicted to cause parametric instabilities in an 80 m
long, high optical power cavity that uses suspended sapphire mirrors. Resonant
interaction occurs between two distinct optical modes and an acoustic mode of
one mirror when the difference in frequency between the two optical cavity
modes is close to the frequency of the acoustic mode. Experimental results
validate the theory of parametric instability in high power optical cavities.
