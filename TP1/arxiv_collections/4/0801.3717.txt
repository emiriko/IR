We show that the classical Kolmogorov and Richardson scaling laws in fully
developed turbulence are consistent with a random Gaussian force field.
Numerical simulations of a shell model approximation to the Navier-Stokes
equations suggest that the fluctuations in the force (acceleration) field are
scale independent throughout the inertial regime. We conjecture that Lagrangian
statistics of the relative velocity in a turbulent flow is determined by the
typical force field, whereas the multiscaling is associated to extreme events
in the force field fluctuations.
