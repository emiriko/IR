A ship, moving with small acceleration in a reservoir of uniform depth, can
be subjected to a sudden hydrodynamical impact similar to collision with an
underwater rock, and on water surface unusual solitary wave will start running.
The factors responsible for formation of solitons induced by a moving ship are
analyzed. Emphasis is given to a phenomenon observed by John Scott Russell more
170 years ago when a sudden stop of a boat preceded the occurrence of exotic
water dome. In dramatic changes of polemic about the stability and mathematical
description of a solitary wave, the question why "Russell's wave" occurred has
not been raised, though attempts its recreation invariably suffered failure. In
our report the conditions disclosing the principle of the famous event as a
critical phenomenon are described. In a reservoir of uniform depth a ship can
confront by a dynamic barrier within narrow limits of ship's speed and
acceleration. In a wider interval of parameters a ship generates a satellite
wave, which can be transformed in a different-locking soliton. These phenomena
can be classified into an extensive category of dynamic barrier effects
including the transition of aircrafts through the sound barrier.
