Solar energetic ions are a known hazard to both spacecraft electronics and to
manned space flights in interplanetary space missions that extend over a long
period of time. A dipole-like magnetic field and a plasma source, forming a
mini magnetosphere, are being tested in the laboratory as means of protection
against such hazards. We investigate, via particle-in-cell hybrid simulations,
using kinetic ions and fluid electrons, the characteristics of the mini
magnetospheres. Our results, for parameters identical to the experimental
conditions, reveal the formation of a mini-magnetosphere, whose features are
scanned with respect to the plasma density, the plasma flow velocity, and the
intensity of the dipole field. Comparisons with a simplified theoretical model
reveal a good qualitative agreement and excellent quantitative agreement for
higher plasma dynamic pressures and lower B-fields.
