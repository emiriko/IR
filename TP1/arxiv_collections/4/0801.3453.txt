A unified linear tearing-mode formulation is given incorporating both
resistivity and Hall effects. A variational method is used that appears to be
best suited to deal with the difficulties peculiar to the {\it triple-deck}
structure associated with the Hall resistive tearing mode but also to lead to a
convenient analytical dispersion relation for the Hall resisitive tearing mode.
  This analytical dispersion relation -
  * recovers the Furth-Killeen-Rosenbluth[15] result for the resistive branch;
  * gives a growth rate for the Hall branch which appears to be consistent with
the growth rate of the electron-inertia driven tearing mode given previously
(Coppi [19]);
  * recovers the scaling relation for the transition from the resisitive regime
to the Hall regime numerically established by Fitzpatrick[20] in a driven Hall
resistive reconnection situation.
