Through Monte Carlo Simulation, the well-known majority-vote model has been
studied with noise on directed random graphs. In order to characterize
completely the observed order-disorder phase transition, the critical noise
parameter $q_c$, as well as the critical exponents $beta/nu$, $gamma/nu$ and
$1/nu$ have been calculated as a function of the connectivity $z$ of the random
graph.
