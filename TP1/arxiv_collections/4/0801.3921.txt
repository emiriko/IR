We prove that if $M$ is a CW-complex and $M^1$ is its 1-skeleton then the
crossed module $\Pi_2(M,M^1)$ depends only on the homotopy type of $M$ as a
space, up to free products, in the category of crossed modules, with
$\Pi_2(D^2,S^1)$. From this it follows that, if $G$ is a finite crossed module
and $M$ is finite, then the number of crossed module morphisms $\Pi_2(M,M^1)
\to G$ can be re-scaled to a homotopy invariant $I_G(M)$, depending only on the
homotopy 2-type of $M$. We describe an algorithm for calculating
$\pi_2(M,M^{(1)})$ as a crossed module over $\pi_1(M^{(1)})$, in the case when
$M$ is the complement of a knotted surface $\Sigma$ in $S^4$ and $M^{(1)}$ is
the handlebody made from the 0- and 1-handles of a handle decomposition of $M$.
Here $\Sigma$ is presented by a knot with bands. This in particular gives us a
geometric method for calculating the algebraic 2-type of the complement of a
knotted surface from a hyperbolic splitting of it. We prove in addition that
the invariant $I_G$ yields a non-trivial invariant of knotted surfaces in $S^4$
with good properties with regards to explicit calculations.
