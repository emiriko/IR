The SINTAGMA information integration system is an infrastructure for
accessing several different information sources together. Besides providing a
uniform interface to the information sources (databases, web services, web
sites, RDF resources, XML files), semantic integration is also needed. Semantic
integration is carried out by providing a high-level model and the mappings to
the models of the sources. When executing a query of the high level model, a
query is transformed to a low-level query plan, which is a piece of Prolog code
that answers the high-level query. This transformation is done in two phases.
First, the Query Planner produces a plan as a logic formula expressing the
low-level query. Next, the Query Optimizer transforms this formula to
executable Prolog code and optimizes it according to structural and statistical
information about the information sources.
  This article discusses the main ideas of the optimization algorithm and its
implementation.
