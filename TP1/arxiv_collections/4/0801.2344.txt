In the Standard Model with Minimal Supersymmetry, the Lagrangian contains
complex parameters which lead to additional CP violation. We study CP violating
asymmetries in the decays of the MSSM charged Higgs boson, induced by loop
corrections with intermediate SUSY particles, and perform analytical and
numerical analysis. The decay rate asymmetry can go up to 25% and the
forward-backward asymmetry can reach up to 10%.
