The aim of this paper is to gather and (try to) unify several approaches for
the modular representation theory of Hecke algebras of type $B$. We attempt to
explain the connections between Geck's cellular structures (coming from
Kazhdan-Lusztig theory with unequal parameters) and Ariki's Theorem on the
canonical basis of the Fock spaces.
