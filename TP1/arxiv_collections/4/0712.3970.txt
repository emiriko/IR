We have realized a tunable coupling over a large frequency range between an
asymmetric Cooper pair transistor (charge qubit) and a dc SQUID (phase qubit).
Our circuit enables the independent manipulation of the quantum states of each
qubit as well as their entanglement. The measurements of the charge qubit's
quantum states is performed by resonant read-out via the measurement of the
quantum states of the SQUID. The measured coupling strength is in agreement
with an analytic theory including a capacitive and a tunable Josephson coupling
between the two qubits.
