The most general physical boundary $S$-matrix for the open XXZ spin chain in
the non-critical regime ($\cosh (\eta)>1$) is derived starting from the bare
Bethe ansazt equations. The boundary $S$-matrix as expected is expressed in
terms of $\Gamma_q$-functions. In the isotropic limit corresponding results for
the open XXX chain are also reproduced.
