We derive a perturbative approach to study, in the large inertia limit, the
dynamics of solid particles in a smooth, incompressible and finite-time
correlated random velocity field. We carry on an expansion in powers of the
inverse square root of the Stokes number, defined as the ratio of the
relaxation time for the particle velocities and the correlation time of the
velocity field. We describe in this limit the residual concentration
fluctuations of the particle suspension, and determine the contribution to the
collision statistics produced by clustering. For both concentration
fluctuations and collision velocities, we analyze the differences with the
compressible one-dimensional case.
