It is proposed that using both self-non-self and danger theories give a
better understanding of how the immune system works. It is proposed that
comparing immune system to police force is useful in this case since police
responds both to danger or damage signals and to foreign or suspicious behavior
even if no danger signals existed. We also propose that due to low zone
tolerance immunotherapy needs to be combined with another treatment method for
cancer e.g. chemotherapy or/and radiotherapy to get a sufficient eradication of
tumors. Finally we propose that fractional order differential equations are
more suitable than the familiar integer order differential equations. A
fractional order example of two immune effectors attacking an antigen is given.
