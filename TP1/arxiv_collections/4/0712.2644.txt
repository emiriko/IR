In this chapter, we deal with some specific domains of applications to game
theory. This is one of the major class of models in the new approaches of
modelling in the economic domain. For that, we use genetic automata which allow
to build adaptive strategies for the players. We explain how the automata-based
formalism proposed - matrix representation of automata with multiplicities -
allows to define semi-distance between the strategy behaviors. With that tools,
we are able to generate an automatic processus to compute emergent systems of
entities whose behaviors are represented by these genetic automata.
