The magnetic properties and nature of the persistent current in small
flux-penetrated $t-t'-U$ rings are investigated. An effective rigid-rotator
description is formulated for this system, which coincides with a transition to
a ferromagnetic state in the model. The criteria for the onset of effective
rigid rotation is given. The model is used to understand continuum model
ground-state solutions for a 2D few-particle hard-wall quantum dot, where
ferromagnetic solutions are found even without the Zeeman coupling to spin.
After the onset of effective rigid rotation, a 97--98% correspondence can be
determined between the lattice model and continuum model eigenstate results.
