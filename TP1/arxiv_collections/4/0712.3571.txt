Recent developments of quantum information science critically rely on
entanglement, an intriguing aspect of quantum mechanics where parts of a
composite system can exhibit correlations stronger than any classical
counterpart. In particular, scalable quantum networks require capabilities to
create, store, and distribute entanglement among distant matter nodes via
photonic channels. Atomic ensembles can play the role of such nodes. So far, in
the photon counting regime, heralded entanglement between atomic ensembles has
been successfully demonstrated via probabilistic protocols. However, an
inherent drawback of this approach is the compromise between the amount of
entanglement and its preparation probability, leading intrinsically to low
count rate for high entanglement. Here we report a protocol where entanglement
between two atomic ensembles is created by coherent mapping of an entangled
state of light. By splitting a single-photon and subsequent state transfer, we
separate the generation of entanglement and its storage. After a programmable
delay, the stored entanglement is mapped back into photonic modes with overall
efficiency of 17 %. Improvements of single-photon sources together with our
protocol will enable "on demand" entanglement of atomic ensembles, a powerful
resource for quantum networking.
