We construct efficient interpolating fields for lattice spectroscopy of
mesons by applying covariant derivatives on Jacobi smeared quark sources. These
interpolators are tested in a quenched calculation of excited mesons based on
the variational method. We present results for pseudoscalar, scalar, vector and
pseudovector mesons.
