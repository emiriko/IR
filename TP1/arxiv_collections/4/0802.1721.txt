Silicon nanochannel biological field effect transistors have been developed
for glucose detection. The device is nanofabricated from a silicon-on-insulator
wafer with a top-down approach and surface functionalized with glucose oxidase.
The differential conductance of silicon nanowires, tuned with source-drain bias
voltage, is demonstrated to be sensitive to the biocatalyzed oxidation of
glucose. The glucose biosensor response is linear in the 0.5-8 mM concentration
range with 3-5 min response time. This silicon nanochannel-based glucose
biosensor technology offers the possibility of high density, high quality
glucose biosensor integration with silicon-based circuitry.
