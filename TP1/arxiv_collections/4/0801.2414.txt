Combined analyses at the Large Hadron Collider and at the International
Linear Collider are important to reveal precisely the new physics model as, for
instance, supersymmetry. Examples are presented where ILC results as input for
LHC analyses could be crucial for the identification of signals as well as of
the underlying model. The synergy of both colliders leads also to rather
accurate SUSY parameter determination and powerful mass constraints even if the
scalar particles have masses in the multi-TeV range.
