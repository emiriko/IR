Compact binaries inspiralling along eccentric orbits are plausible
gravitational wave (GW) sources for the ground-based laser interferometers. We
explore the losses in the event rates incurred when searching for GWs from
compact binaries inspiralling along post-Newtonian accurate eccentric orbits
with certain obvious non-optimal search templates. For the present analysis, GW
signals having 2.5 post-Newtonian accurate orbital evolution are modeled
following the phasing formalism, presented in [T. Damour, A. Gopakumar, and B.
R. Iyer, Phys. Rev. D \textbf{70}, 064028 (2004)]. We demonstrate that the
search templates that model in a gauge-invariant manner GWs from compact
binaries inspiralling under qudrupolar radiation reaction along 2PN accurate
circular orbits are very efficient in capturing our somewhat realistic GW
signals. However, three types of search templates based on the adiabatic,
complete adiabatic and gauge-dependent complete non-adiabatic approximants,
detailed in [P. Ajith, B. R. Iyer, C. A. K. Robinson and B. S. Sathyaprakash,
%``A new class of post-Newtonian approximants to the dynamics of inspiralling
%compact binaries: Test-mass in the Schwarzschild spacetime,'' Phys. Rev. D
{\bf 71}, 044029 (2005)], relevant for the circular inspiral under the
qudrupolar radiation reaction were found to be inefficient in capturing the
above mentioned eccentric signal. We conclude that further investigations will
be required to probe the ability of various types of PN accurate circular
templates, employed to analyze the LIGO/VIRGO data, to capture GWs from compact
binaries having tiny orbital eccentricities.
