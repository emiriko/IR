We construct two new families of basis for finite field extensions. Basis in
the first family, the so-called elliptic basis, are not quite normal basis, but
they allow very fast Frobenius exponentiation while preserving sparse
multiplication formulas. Basis in the second family, the so-called normal
elliptic basis are normal basis and allow fast (quasi linear) arithmetic. We
prove that all extensions admit models of this kind.
