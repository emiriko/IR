The control of Kerr nonlinearity with electric fields in an asymmetric double
quantum-dot systems coupling with tunneling is investigated theoretically. It
is found that,by proper tuning of two light beams and tunneling via a bias
voltage, the Kerr nonlinearity can be enhanced and varied within a wide scale.
