We study n-monotone functionals, which constitute a generalisation of
n-monotone set functions. We investigate their relation to the concepts of
exactness and natural extension, which generalise the notions of coherence and
natural extension in the behavioural theory of imprecise probabilities. We
improve upon a number of results in the literature, and prove among other
things a representation result for exact n-monotone functionals in terms of
Choquet integrals.
