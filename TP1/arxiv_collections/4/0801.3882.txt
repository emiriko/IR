High energy gamma-rays in coincidence with low energy yrast gamma-rays have
been measured from 113Sb, at excitation energies of 109 and 122 MeV, formed by
bombarding 20Ne on 93Nb at projectile energies of 145 and 160 MeV respectively
to study the role of angular momentum (J) and temperature (T) over Giant Dipole
Resonance (GDR) width. The maximum populated angular momenta for fusion were
67hbar and 73hbar respectively for the above-mentioned beam energies. The high
energy photons were detected using a Large Area Modular BaF2 Detector Array
(LAMBDA) along with a 24-element multiplicity filter. After pre-equilibrium
corrections, the excitation energy E* was averaged over the decay steps of the
compound nucleus (CN). The average values of temperature, angular momentum, CN
mass etc. have been calculated by the statistical model code CASCADE. Using
those average values, results show the systematic increase of GDR width with T
which is consistent with Kusnezov parametrization and the Thermal Shape
Fluctuation Model. The rise of GDR width with temperature also supports the
assumptions of adiabatic coupling in the Thermal Shape Fluctuation Model. But
the GDR widths and corresponding reduced plots with J are not consistent with
the theoretical model at high spins.
