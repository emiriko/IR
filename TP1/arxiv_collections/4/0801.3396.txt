If F is an automorphism of the spectral unit ball, we show that, in a
neighborhood of any cyclic (i.e. non-derogatory) matrix of the ball, the map F
can be written as conjugation by a holomorphically varying non singular matrix.
This provides a shorter proof of a theorem of J. Rostand, with a slightly
stronger result.
