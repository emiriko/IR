We present a detailed experimental investigation on polarization-isotropic
and polarization-anisotropic holographic scattering in lithium niobate crystal
doped with iron when recording parasitic gratings with an ordinary polarized
pump beam. The kinetics of both types of scattering during the whole process of
recording is studied. Holographic scattering is presented as a simple technique
to monitor the energy transfer between beams of different polarization.
Moreover, the spectral and the angular dependence of the transmitted intensity
of the crystal during the reconstruction of the auto-generated parasitic
gratings are measured.
