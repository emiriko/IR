A microstructured array of over 1200 electrodes on a substrate has been
configured to generate an array of local minima of electric field strength with
a periodicity of $120 \mu$m about $25 \mu$m above the substrate. By applying
sinusoidally varying potentials to the electrodes, these minima can be made to
move smoothly along the array. Polar molecules in low field seeking quantum
states can be trapped in these traveling potential wells. This is
experimentally demonstrated by transporting metastable CO molecules in 30 mK
deep wells that move at constant velocities above the substrate.
