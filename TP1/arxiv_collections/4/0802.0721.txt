Polarized Raman scattering measurements have been performed on Na0.5CoO2
single crystal from 8 to 305 K. Both the A1g and E1g phonon modes show a
softening below Tc1 ~ 83 K. Additionally, the A1g phonon mode, which is
forbidden in the scattering geometry of cross polarization for the triangular
CoO2 layers, appears below Tc1. In contrast, the metal-insulator transition at
Tc2 ~ 46 K has only secondary effect on the Raman spectra. The phonon softening
and the ``forbidden'' Raman intensity follow closely magnetic order parameter
and the gap function at the Fermi surface, indicating that the distortion of
CoO6 octahedra at Tc1, instead of the Na ordering at ~350 K, is the relevant
structural component of the 83 K phase transition.
