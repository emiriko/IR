The evolution of single-particle energies with varying isospin asymmetry in
the shell model is an important issue when predicting changes in the shell
structure for exotic nuclei. In many cases pseudospin partner levels, that are
almost degenerate in energy for stable nuclei, are relevant in extracting the
size of the shell gaps. A breaking of the pseudospin symmetry can affect the
size of these gaps and change the magic numbers accordingly. The strength of
the pseudospin splitting is expected to depend in particular on
isovector-dependent and tensor contributions to the effective nuclear
interaction. A description employing supersymmetric quantum mechanics allows to
derive a pseudospin symmetry breaking potential that is regular in contrast to
the pseudospin-orbit potential in the conventional relativistic treatment. The
derived perturbation potential provides a measure to quantify the symmetry
breaking and it can be employed to improve mean-field calculations in order to
better reproduce the experimentally observed shell evolution. General
potentials with exact pseudospin symmetry are obtained that can be used in
relativistic mean-field Hamiltonians.
