Password-based authentication schemes are the most widely used techniques for
remote user authentication. Many static ID-based remote user authentication
schemes both with and without smart cards have been proposed. Most of the
schemes do not allow the users to choose and change their passwords, and
maintain a verifier table to verify the validity of the user login. In this
paper we present a dynamic ID-based remote user authentication scheme using
smart cards. Our scheme allows the users to choose and change their passwords
freely, and do not maintain any verifier table. The scheme is secure against
ID-theft, and can resist the reply attacks, forgery attacks, guessing attacks,
insider attacks and stolen verifier attacks.
