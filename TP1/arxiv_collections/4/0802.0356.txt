We predict various detectable mechanical responses to the presence of local
DNA defects which are defined as short DNA segments exhibiting mechanical
properties obviously different from the 50 nm persistence length based
semiflexible polymer model. The defects discussed are kinks and flexible hinges
either permanently fixed on DNA or thermally excited. Their effects on
extension shift, the effective persistence length, the end-to-end distance
distribution, and the cyclization probability are computed using a
transfer-matrix method. Our predictions will be useful in future experimental
designs to study DNA nicks or mismatch base pairs, mechanics of specific DNA
sequences, and specific DNA-protein interaction using magnetic tweezer,
fluorescence resonance energy transfer or plasmon resonance technique, and the
traditional biochemistry cyclization probability measurements.
