The dynamics of the electron impact multiphoton ionization of a hydrogen atom
in the presence of an intense laser field has been studied theoretically, with
a view to comparing (qualitatively) the results with the recent kinematically
complete experiments of Horr et al [ Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 94, 153201, (2005)
] for the He target. Significant laser modifications are noted in the present
doubly (DDCS) and the fully differential cross sections (TDCS). For most of the
explored kinematics (chosen in accordance with the experiment), the present
binary peak intensity of the laser-assisted TDCS is significantly enhanced with
respect to the field free ones, in agreement with the experiment but in
contradiction with the existing first order theories. Importance of the
multiphoton effects are also studied.
