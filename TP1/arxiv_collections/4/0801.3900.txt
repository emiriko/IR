We theoretically investigate the interaction between a single molecule and a
metallic nanoparticle. We develop a general quantum mechanical description for
the calculation of the enhancement of radiative and non-radiative decay
channels for a molecule situated in the nearfield regime of the metallic
nanoparticle. Using a boundary element method approach, we compute the
scattering rates for several nanoparticle shapes. We also introduce an
eigenmode expansion and quantization scheme for the surface plasmons, which
allows us to analyze the scattering processes in simple physical terms. An
intuitive explanation is given for the large quantum yield of quasi one- and
two-dimensional nanostructures. Finally, we briefly discuss resonant Foerster
energy transfer in presence of metallic nanoparticles.
