Quantum Mechanics, almost 80 years after its arrival, is a well established
and experimentally not falsified theory. It has predicted and explained a whole
series of natural phenomena of a very delicate nature. But its interpretation
has not gained universal acceptance. Many scientists have considered the
conceptual framework of quantum theory to be unsatisfactory. The very
foundations of Quantum Mechanics is a matter that needs to be resolved in order
to achieve and gain a deep physical understanding of the underlying physical
procedures that constitute our world.
