The many-body Green's function theory with the random-phase approximation is
applied to the study of easy-plane spin-1/2 ferromagnets in an in-plane
magnetic field. We demonstrate that the usual procedure, in which only the
three Green's functions $<< S_i^\mu;S_j^->>$ ($\mu=+,-,z$) are used, yields
unreasonable results in this case. Then the problem is discussed in more detail
by considering all combinations of Green's functions. We can derive one more
equation, which cannot be obtained by using only the set of the above three
Green's functions, and point out that the two equations contradict each other
if one demands that the identities of the spin operators are exactly satisfied.
We discuss the cause of the contradiction and attempt to improve the method in
a self consistent way. In our procedure, the effect of the anisotropy can be
appropriately taken into account, and the results are in good agreement with
the quantum Monte Carlo calculations.
