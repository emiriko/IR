Contact of a fluid with a solid or an elastic wall is investigated. The wall
exerts molecular forces on the fluid which is locally strongly nonhomogeneous.
The problem is approached with a fluid energy of the second gradient form and a
wall surface energy depending on the value of the fluid density at the contact.
>From the virtual work principle are obtained limit conditions taking into
account the fluid density, its normal derivative to the wall and the curvature
of the surface
