Thermoelectric power, S(T) of the Mg1-xAlxB2 system has been measured for x =
0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0. XRD, resistivity and magnetization
measurements are also presented. It has been found that the thermoelectric
power is positive for x = 0.4 and is negative for x = 0.6 over the entire
temperature range studied up to 300 K. The thermoelectric power of x = 0.4
samples vanishes discontinuously below a certain temperature, implying
existence of superconductivity. In general, the magnitude of the thermoelectric
power increases with temperature up to a certain temperature, and then it
starts to decrease towards zero base line. In order to explain the observed
behavior of the thermoelectric power, we have used a model in which both
diffusion and phonon drag processes are combined by using a phenomenological
interpolation between the low and high temperature behaviors of the
thermoelectric power. The considered model provides an excellent fit to the
observed data. It is further found that Al doping enhances the Debye
temperature.
