We use the Relational Blockworld (RBW) interpretation of quantum mechanics to
resolve the foundational problems therein. As predicted by Smolin, the
resolution of these problems is not independent of the problem of unification
and the nature of time. Specifically, RBW requires a theory fundamental to
quantum physics in which one must explicitly construct dynamical/diachronic
entities (objects obtained via trans-temporal identification) from 'relations'.
We use discrete graph theory to propose heuristically the nature of this
underlying theory, which is based on a self-consistency criterion for the
mutual construct of dynamical/diachronic entities, space and time whence a
spatiotemporally discrete action fundamental to the path integral approach to
quantum and classical physics. The proposed unification scheme suggests a novel
approach to quantum gravity.
