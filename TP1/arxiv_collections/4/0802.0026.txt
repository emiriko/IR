I discuss the basic elements of the process that will lead to the discovery
of possible new phenomena at the LHC. We review the status of the tools
available to model the Standard Model backgrounds, and the role that such tools
can play in the discovery phase, and in the exploration of the features and
parameters of such new phenomena.
