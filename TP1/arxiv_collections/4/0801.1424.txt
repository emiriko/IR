In this paper we employ two distinct approaches - all-electron \textit{ab
initio} method and the spherical jellium background model- within time
dependent density functional theory to calculate the long range dipole-dipole
dispersion coefficient (van der Waals coefficient) $C_{6}$ of sodium atom
clusters containing even number of atoms ranging from 2 to 20 atoms. The
dispersion coefficients are obtained via Casimir-Polder relation. All the
calculations are carried out with local density approximation for
exchange-correlation energy functional. These two sets of results are compared
to assess the accuracy of jellium based results and to ascertain the effect of
detail ionic structure of the clusters on the van der Waals coefficient.
