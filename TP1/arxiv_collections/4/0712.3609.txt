Extended Everett's Concept (EEC) recently developed by the author to explain
the phenomenon of consciousness is considered. A mathematical model is proposed
for the principal feature of consciousness assumed in EEC, namely its ability
(in the state of sleep, trance or meditation, when the explicit consciousness
is disabled) to obtain information from all alternative classical realities
(Everett's worlds) and select the favorable realities. To represent this
ability, a mathematical operation called postcorrection is introduced, which
corrects the present state to guarantee certain characteristics of the future
state. Evolution of living matter is thus determined by goals (first of all by
the goal of survival) as well as by causes. The resulting theory, in a way
symmetrical in time direction, follows from a sort of antropic principle.
Possible criteria for postcorrection and corresponding phenomena in the sphere
of life are classified. Both individual and collective criteria of survival are
considered as well as the criteria providing certain quality of life and those
which are irrelevant to the life quality. The phenomena of free will and direct
sighting of truth (e.g. scientific insight) are explained in these terms. The
problem of artificial intellect and the role of brain look differently in the
framework of this theory. Automats may perform intellectual operations, but not
postcorrection, therefore artificial intellect but not an artificial life can
be created. The brain serves as an interface between the body and
consciousness, but the most profound level of consciousness is not a function
of brain.
