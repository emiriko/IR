An experiment is described that empirically distinguishes the previously
proposed q-rules governing the collapse of a wave function, and contrasts it
with the conventional idea of a collapse as well as the current leading theory
of collapse advanced by Ghirardi and Pearle. Keywords: foundation theory,
measurement, qRules, state reduction, wave collapse.
