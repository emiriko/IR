We show that the ambiguity for the Chern-Simons-like term induced from
quantum correction in the extended QED should have nothing to do with the
approximation on the exact fermionic propagator, contradictory to the claim in
Ref.[19]. Further, we investigate the induced Chern-Simons-like term using the
original 't Hooft-Veltman dimensional regularization and reproduce the result
obtained by gauge symmetry analysis. This fact demonstrates that the origin of
the ambiguity should lie in different choices on regularization schemes.
