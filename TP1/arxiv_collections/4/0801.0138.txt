The differential cross sections for low-energy muonic hydrogen atom
scattering in solid molecular H$_2$, D$_2$ and T$_2$ targets under low pressure
have been calculated for various temperatures. The polycrystalline fcc and hcp
structure of the solid hydrogenic targets are considered. The Bragg and phonon
scattering processes are described using the Debye model of a solid. The
calculated cross sections are used for Monte Carlo simulations of the muonic
atom slowing down in these targets. They have been successfully applied for a
description of the production of the muonic atom beams in the multilayer
hydrogenic crystals.
