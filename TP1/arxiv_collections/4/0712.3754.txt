An ensemble with random n-body interactions is investigated in the presence
of symmetries. A striking emergence of regularities in spectra, ground state
spins and isospins is discovered in both odd and even-particle systems. Various
types of correlations from pairing to spectral sequences and correlations
across different masses are explored. A search for interpretation is presented.
