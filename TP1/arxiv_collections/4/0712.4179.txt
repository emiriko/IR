A single-photon avalanche detector (SPAD) for high-speed quantum-key
generation has successfully been developed. It has the highest photon detection
repetition frequency and the lowest dark count rate in the world, as a
board-mountable sub-system. The SPAD consists of an ultra-small dual-avalanche
photodiode (APD) module and a novel discriminator. The APD module design is
consistent with cooling capability and high-frequency characteristics. The new
module has a 3 GHz bandwidth enabling 1 GHz gate-pulse repetition. The
bandwidth is extended 15-fold relative to the most wideband peltier cooled APD
module. The discriminator has a self-training mechanism to compensate charge
pulse. Dark count rare of the SPAD is reduced 1/10th relative to the lowest
dark count single photon detector. The SPAD allows 3.2-fold multiplying the
quantum key generation rate in theoretical estimation.
