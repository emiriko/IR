We present and analyze a quantum key distribution protocol based on sending
entangled N-qubit states instead of single-qubit ones as in the trail-blazing
scheme by Bennett and Brassard (BB84). Since the qubits are sent individually,
an eavesdropper is limited to accessing them one by one. In an intercept-resend
attack, this fundamental restriction allows one to make the eavesdropper's
information on the transmitted key vanish if even one of the qubits is not
intercepted. The implied upper bound 1/(2N) for Eve's information is further
shown not to be the lowest since in the case N = 2, the information can be
reduced to less than 30% of that in BB84. In general, the protocol is at least
as secure as BB84.
