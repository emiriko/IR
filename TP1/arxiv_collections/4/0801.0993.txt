In this paper, we investigate operator product expansion for thermal
correlation function of the two scalar currents. Due to breakdown of Lorentz
invariance at finite temperature, more operators of the same dimension appear
in the operator product expansion than at zero temperature. We calculated
Wilson coefficients in the short distance expansion and obtain operator product
expansion for thermal correlation function in terms of quark condensate, gluon
condensate, quark energy density and gluon energy density.
