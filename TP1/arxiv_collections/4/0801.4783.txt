We studied the temperature stability of the endohedral fullerene molecule,
N@C60, inside single-wall carbon nanotubes using electron spin resonance
spectroscopy. We found that the nitrogen escapes at higher temperatures in the
encapsulated material as compared to its pristine, crystalline form. The
temperature dependent spin-lattice relaxation time, T_1, of the encapsulated
molecule is significantly shorter than that of the crystalline material, which
is explained by the interaction of the nitrogen spin with the conduction
electrons of the nanotubes.
