An embedding of the group $\Diff(S^{1})$ of orientation preserving
diffeomorphims of the unit circle $S^1$ into an infinite-dimensional symplectic
group, $\Sp(\infty)$, is studied. The authors prove that this embedding is not
surjective. A Brownian motion is constructed on $\Sp(\infty)$. This study is
motivated by recent work of H. Airault, S. Fang and P. Malliavin.
