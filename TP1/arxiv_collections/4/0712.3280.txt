Quantum dissipation induces a critical destruction of a Kondo screened state,
which is of interest in the contexts of quantum critical heavy fermion metals
and magnetic nanostructures. The sub-ohmic Bose-Fermi Kondo model provides a
setting to study this effect. We find that this many-body problem is exactly
solvable when the spectrum of the dissipative bosonic bath, J(\omega), is
singular, corresponding to J(\tau)=const.. We determine the local spin
correlation functions, showing that the singular LONGITUDINAL fluctuations of
the bosonic bath dominate over the transverse ones. Our results provide
evidence that the local quantum critical solution, derived within the extended
dynamical mean field approach to the Kondo lattice model, has a zero residual
entropy.
