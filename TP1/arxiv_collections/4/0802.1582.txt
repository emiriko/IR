The geometric frustration of the spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg model on the
triangulated Kagome (triangles-in-triangles) lattice is investigated within the
framework of an exact analytical method based on the generalized star-triangle
mapping transformation. Ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams are
obtained along with other exact results for the partition function, Helmholtz
free energy, internal energy, entropy, and specific heat, by establishing a
precise mapping relationship to the corresponding spin-1/2 Ising model on the
Kagome lattice. It is shown that the residual entropy of the disordered spin
liquid phase is for the quantum Ising-Heisenberg model significantly lower than
for its semi-classical Ising limit (S_0/N_T k_B = 0.2806 and 0.4752,
respectively), which implies that quantum fluctuations partially lift a
macroscopic degeneracy of the ground-state manifold in the frustrated regime.
The investigated model system has an obvious relevance to a series of polymeric
coordination compounds Cu_9X_2(cpa)_6 (X=F, Cl, Br and cpa=carboxypentonic
acid) for which we made a theoretical prediction about the temperature
dependence of zero-field specific heat.
