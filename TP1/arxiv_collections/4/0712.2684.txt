In this work, an ensemble of economic interacting agents is considered. The
agents are arranged in a linear array where only local couplings are allowed.
The deterministic dynamics of each agent is given by a map. This map is
expressed by two factors. The first one is a linear term that models the
expansion of the agent's economy and that is controlled by the {\it growth
capacity parameter}. The second one is an inhibition exponential term that is
regulated by the {\it local environmental pressure}. Depending on the parameter
setting, the system can display Pareto or Boltzmann-Gibbs behavior in the
asymptotic dynamical regime. The regions of parameter space where the system
exhibits one of these two statistical behaviors are delimited. Other properties
of the system, such as the mean wealth, the standard deviation and the Gini
coefficient, are also calculated.
