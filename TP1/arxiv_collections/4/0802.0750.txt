The paper attempts to convince that the orthodox interpretation of quantum
mechanics does not contradict philosophical realism by throwing light onto
certain properties of quantum systems that seem to have escaped attention as
yet. The exposition starts with the philosophical notions of realism. Then, the
quantum mechanics as it is usually taught is demoted to a mere part of the
theory called phenomenology of observations, and the common impression about
its contradiction to realism is explained. The main idea of the paper, the
physical notion of intrinsic properties, is introduced and many examples
thereof are given. It replaces the irritating dichotomy of quantum and
classical worlds by a much softer difference between intrinsic and extrinsic
properties, which concern equally microscopic and macroscopic systems. Finally,
the classicality and the quantum measurement are analyzed and found to present
some still unsolved problems. A possible way of dealing with the
Schr\"{o}dinger cat is suggested that is based on the intrinsic properties. A
simple quantum model of one classical property illustrates how our philosophy
may work.
