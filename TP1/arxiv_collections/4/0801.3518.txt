The Schr\"{o}dinger equation in $D$-dimensions for the Manning-Rosen
potential with the centrifugal term is solved approximately to obtain bound
states eigensolutions (eigenvalues and eigenfunctions). The
Nikiforov-Uvarov(NU) method is used in the calculations. We present numerical
calculations of energy eigenvalues to two- and four-dimensional systems for
arbitrary quantum numbers $n$ and $l$ with three different values of the
potential parameter $\alpha .$ It is shown that because of the interdimensional
degeneracy of eigenvalues, we can also reproduce eigenvalues of a upper/lower
dimensional sytem from the well-known eigenvalues of a lower/upper dimensional
system by means of the transformation $(n,l,D)\to (n,l\pm 1,D\mp 2)$. This
solution reduces to the Hulth\'{e}n potential case.
