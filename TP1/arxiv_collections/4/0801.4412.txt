We propose a definition of asymptotically plane wave spacetimes in vacuum
gravity in terms of the asymptotic falloff of the metric, and discuss the
relation to previously constructed exact solutions. We construct a well-behaved
action principle for such spacetimes, using the formalism developed by Mann and
Marolf. We show that this action is finite on-shell and that the variational
principle is well-defined for solutions of vacuum gravity satisfying our
asymptotically plane wave falloff conditions.
