It is shown that quantum coherence is conserved in a principal system in the
case that the system is coupled to a fast dissipating environment
[arXiv:0709.0562]. The phenomenon is called the quantum wipe effect. Here, this
effect is reviewed and the analytical proof for a model system consisting of a
one-qubit system coupled to a fast dissipating environment is extended to an
environment at a thermal equilibrium.
