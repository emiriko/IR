In this paper, we study the regularities of solutions of nonlinear stochastic
partial differential equations in the framework of Hilbert scales. Then we
apply our general result to several typical nonlinear SPDEs such as stochastic
Burgers and Ginzburg-Landau's equations on the real line, stochastic 2D
Navier-Stokes equations in the whole space and a stochastic tamed 3D
Navier-Stokes equation in the whole space, and obtain the existence of their
respectively smooth solutions.
