The Large Hadron Collider at CERN will provide Pb-Pb collisions at energies
up to $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.5 TeV. We speculate on global observables, i.e. the
charged particle density at mid-rapidity, chemical freeze-out conditions and
collective parameters for transverse radial an elliptic flow. Finally, we
present an idea how to address the important issue of thermalization by
measuring the correlated production of heavy-quark hadrons.
