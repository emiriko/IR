We are developing a wildland fire model based on semi-empirical relations
that estimate the rate of spread of a surface fire and post-frontal heat
release, coupled with WRF, the Weather Research and Forecasting atmospheric
model. A level set method identifies the fire front. Data are assimilated using
both amplitude and position corrections using a morphing ensemble Kalman
filter. We will use thermal images of a fire for observations that will be
compared to synthetic image based on the model state.
