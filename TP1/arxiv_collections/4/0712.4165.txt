A recent paper by T. Dauxois entitled "Non-Gaussian distributions under
scrutiny" is submitted to scrutiny. Several comments on its content are made,
which constitute, at the same time, a brief state-of-the-art review of
nonextensive statistical mechanics, a current generalization of the
Boltzmann-Gibbs theory. Some inadvertences and misleading sentences are pointed
out as well.
