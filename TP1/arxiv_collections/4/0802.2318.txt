We present sets of equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter including
hyperons using an SU_f(3) extended relativistic mean field (RMF) model with a
wide coverage of density, temperature, and charge fraction for numerical
simulations of core collapse supernovae. Coupling constants of Sigma and Xi
hyperons with the sigma meson are determined to fit the hyperon potential
depths in nuclear matter, U_Sigma(rho_0) ~ +30 MeV and U_Xi(rho_0) ~ -15 MeV,
which are suggested from recent analyses of hyperon production reactions. At
low densities, the EOS of uniform matter is connected with the EOS by Shen et
al., in which formation of finite nuclei is included in the Thomas-Fermi
approximation. In the present EOS, the maximum mass of neutron stars decreases
from 2.17 M_sun (Ne mu) to 1.63 M_sun (NYe mu) when hyperons are included. In a
spherical, adiabatic collapse of a 15$M_\odot$ star by the hydrodynamics
without neutrino transfer, hyperon effects are found to be small, since the
temperature and density do not reach the region of hyperon mixture, where the
hyperon fraction is above 1 % (T > 40 MeV or rho_B > 0.4 fm^{-3}).
