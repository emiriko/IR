We report on the magnetic properties of the layered perovskite PbVO(3). The
results of magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements as well as
band structure calculations consistently suggest that the S=1/2 square lattice
of vanadium atoms in PbVO(3) is strongly frustrated due to
next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions. The ratio of
next-nearest-neighbor (J(2)) to nearest-neighbor (J(1)) exchange integrals is
estimated to be J(2)/J(1)\approx 0.2-0.4. Thus, PbVO(3) is within or close to
the critical region of the J(1)-J(2) frustrated square lattice. Supporting
this, no sign of long-range magnetic ordering was found down to 1.8 K.
