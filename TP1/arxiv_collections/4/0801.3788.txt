Systems of polynomial equations over an algebraically-closed field K can be
used to concisely model many combinatorial problems. In this way, a
combinatorial problem is feasible (e.g., a graph is 3-colorable, hamiltonian,
etc.) if and only if a related system of polynomial equations has a solution
over K. In this paper, we investigate an algorithm aimed at proving
combinatorial infeasibility based on the observed low degree of Hilbert's
Nullstellensatz certificates for polynomial systems arising in combinatorics
and on large-scale linear-algebra computations over K. We report on experiments
based on the problem of proving the non-3-colorability of graphs. We
successfully solved graph problem instances having thousands of nodes and tens
of thousands of edges.
