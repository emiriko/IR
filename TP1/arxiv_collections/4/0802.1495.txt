We prove a generalisation of Elkies' theorem to nonunimodular definite forms
(and lattices). Combined with inequalities of Froyshov and of Ozsvath and
Szabo, this gives a simple test of whether a rational homology 3-sphere may
bound a definite four-manifold. As an example we show that small positive
surgeries on torus knots do not bound negative-definite four-manifolds.
