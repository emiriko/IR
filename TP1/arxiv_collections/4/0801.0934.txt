It has been revealed by mean-field theories and computer simulations that the
nature of the collapse transition of a polymer is influenced by its bending
stiffness $\epsilon_{\rm b}$. In two dimensions, a recent analytical work
demonstrated that the collapse transition of a partially directed lattice
polymer is always first-order as long as $\epsilon_{\rm b}$ is positive
  [H. Zhou {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 97}, 158302 (2006)]. Here we
employ Monte Carlo simulation to investigate systematically the effect of
bending stiffness on the static properties of a 2D lattice polymer. The
system's phase-diagram at zero force is obtained. Depending on $\epsilon_{\rm
b}$ and the temperature $T$, the polymer can be in one of three phases:
crystal, disordered globule, or swollen coil. The crystal-globule transition is
discontinuous, the globule-coil transition is continuous. At moderate or high
values of $\epsilon_{\rm b}$ the intermediate globular phase disappears and the
polymer has only a discontinuous crystal-coil transition. When an external
force is applied, the force-induced collapse transition will either be
continuous or discontinuous, depending on whether the polymer is originally in
the globular or the crystal phase at zero force. The simulation results also
demonstrate an interesting scaling behavior of the polymer at the force-induced
globule-coil transition.
