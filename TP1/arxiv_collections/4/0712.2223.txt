We show how to protect a stream of quantum information from decoherence
induced by a noisy quantum communication channel. We exploit preshared
entanglement and a convolutional coding structure to develop a theory of
entanglement-assisted quantum convolutional coding. Our construction produces a
Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) entanglement-assisted quantum convolutional code
from two arbitrary classical binary convolutional codes. The rate and
error-correcting properties of the classical convolutional codes directly
determine the corresponding properties of the resulting entanglement-assisted
quantum convolutional code. We explain how to encode our CSS
entanglement-assisted quantum convolutional codes starting from a stream of
information qubits, ancilla qubits, and shared entangled bits.
