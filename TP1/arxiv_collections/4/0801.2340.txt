The theory for Bose-Einstein correlations in case of neutral gauge bosons in
$pp$ collisions at high energies is presented. Based on quantum field theory at
finite temperature the two-particle Bose-Einstein correlations of neutral gauge
bosons are carried out for the first time. As a result, the important
parameters of the correlation functions can be obtained for the $Z^{0}Z^{0}$
pairs. The correlations of two bosons in 4-momentum space presented in this
paper offer useful and instructive complimentary viewpoints to theoretical and
experimental works in multiparticle femtoscopy and interferometry measurements
at hadron colliders.
