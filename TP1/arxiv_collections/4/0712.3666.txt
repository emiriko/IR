We describe a method of extending Bell inequalities from $n$ to $n+1$ parties
and formulate sufficient conditions for our method to produce tight
inequalities from tight inequalities. The method is non trivial in the sense
that the inequalities produced by it, when applied to entangled quantum states
may be violated stronger than the original inequalities. In other words, the
method is capable of generating inequalities which are more powerfull
indicators of non-classical correlations than the original inequalities.
