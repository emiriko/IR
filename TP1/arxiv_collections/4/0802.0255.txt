In order to address some fundamental questions in neutrino physics a wide,
future programme of neutrino oscillation experiments is currently under
discussion. Among those, long baseline experiments will play a crucial role in
providing information on the value of theta13, the type of neutrino mass
ordering and on the value of the CP-violating phase delta, which enters in
3-neutrino oscillations. Here, we consider a beta-beam setup with an
intermediate Lorentz factor gamma=450 and a baseline of 1050 km. This could be
achieved in Europe with a beta-beam sourced at CERN to a detector located at
the Boulby mine in the United Kingdom. We analyse the physics potential of this
setup in detail and study two different exposures (1 x 10^{21} and 5 x 10^{21}
ions-kton-years). In both cases, we find that the type of neutrino mass
hierarchy could be determined at 99% CL, for all values of delta, for sin^2(2
theta13) > 0.03. In the high-exposure scenario, we find that the value of the
CP-violating phase delta could be measured with a 99% CL error of ~20 deg if
sin^2 (2 theta13) > 10^{-3}, with some sensitivity down to values of sin^2(2
theta13) ~ 10^{-4}. The ability to determine the octant of theta23 is also
studied, and good prospects are found for the high-statistics scenario.
