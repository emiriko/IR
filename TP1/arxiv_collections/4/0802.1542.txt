We study the effect of non-Markovian reservoirs on the heat conduction
properties of short to intermediate size molecular chains. Using classical
molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the distance dependence of the
heat current is determined not only by the molecular properties, rather it is
also critically influenced by the spectral properties of the heat baths for
both harmonic and anharmonic molecular chains. For highly correlated reservoirs
the current of an anharmonic chain may exceed the flux of the corresponding
harmonic system. Our numerical results are accompanied by a simple single-mode
heat conduction model that can capture the intricate distance dependence
obtained numerically.
