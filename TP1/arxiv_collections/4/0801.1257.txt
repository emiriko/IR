The Lindblad master equation for an arbitrary quadratic system of n fermions
is solved explicitly in terms of diagonalization of a 4n x 4n matrix, provided
that all Lindblad bath operators are linear in the fermionic variables. The
method is applied to the explicit construction of non-equilibrium steady states
and the calculation of asymptotic relaxation rates in the far from equilibrium
problem of heat and spin transport in a nearest neighbor Heisenberg XY spin 1/2
chain in a transverse magnetic field.
