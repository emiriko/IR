We construct models with a Kaluza-Klein (KK) parity in a five- dimensional
warped geometry, in an attempt to address the little hierarchy problem present
in setups with bulk Standard Model fields. The lightest KK particle (LKP) is
stable and can play the role of dark matter. We consider the possibilities of
gluing two identical slices of 5D AdS in either the UV (IR-UV-IR model) or the
IR region (UV-IR-UV model) and discuss the model-building issues as well as
phenomenological properties in both cases. In particular, we find that the
UV-IR-UV model is not gravitationally stable and that additional mechanisms
might be required in the IR-UV-IR model in order to address flavor issues.
Collider signals of the warped KK parity are different from either the
conventional warped extra dimension without KK parity, in which the new
particles are not necessarily pair-produced, or the KK parity in flat universal
extra dimensions, where each KK level is nearly degenerate in mass. Dark matter
and collider properties of a TeV mass KK Z gauge boson as the LKP are
discussed.
