This is a comment on the recent paper by G. S. Adkins and J. McDonnell
``Orbital precession due to central-force perturbations'' published in Phys.
Rev. D75 (2007), 082001 [arXiv:gr-qc/0702015]. We show that the main result of
this paper, the formula for the precession of Keplerian orbits induced by
central-force perturbations, can be obtained very simply by the use of
Hamilton's vector.
