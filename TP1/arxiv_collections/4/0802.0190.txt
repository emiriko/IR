An automated and robust method for adiabatic population transfer and the
preparation of an arbitrary quantum superposition state in atomic system using
the oscillating dark states (ODS) is presented. Quantum state of a three-level
$\Lambda$ configuration atomic system oscillates periodically between two
ground levels, when two pairs of classical detuning laser fields driving the
system into the ODS under evolving adiabatic conditions. The decoherence of the
ODS evolution is greatly suppressed, and the oscillation is very stable,
therefore adiabatic population transfer and the preparation of an arbitrary
quantum superposition state of atomic system can be completed accurately and
conveniently.
