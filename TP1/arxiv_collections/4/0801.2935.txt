The Landau levels of cold atomic gases in non-Abelian gauge fields are
analyzed. In particular we identify effects on the energy spectrum and density
distribution which are purely due to the non-Abelian character of the fields.
We investigate in detail non-Abelian generalizations of both the Landau and the
symmetric gauge. Finally, we discuss how these non-Abelian Landau and symmetric
gauges may be generated by means of realistically feasible lasers in a tripod
scheme.
