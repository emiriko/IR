We study the excitation energy spectrum in the S=1/2 ferromagnetic Ising spin
chain with the easy axis z in a magnetic field h={h_x,0,h_z}. According to Wu
and McCoy's scenario of weak confinement, the fermionic spinon excitations
(kinks), being free at h_z = 0 in the ordered phase, are coupled into bosonic
bound states at arbitrary small h_z. We calculate the energy spectrum of such
excitations in the leading order in small h_z, using different perturbative
methods developed for the similar problem in the Ising field theory.
