We report results of direct measurements of velocity profiles in a
microchannel with hydrophobic and hydrophilic walls, using a new high precision
method of double-focus spacial fluorescence cross-correlation under a confocal
microscope. In the vicinity of both walls the measured velocity profiles do not
turn to zero by giving a plateau of constant velocity. This apparent slip is
proven to be due to a Taylor dispersion, an augmented by shear diffusion of
nanotracers in the direction of flow. Comparing the velocity profiles near the
hydrophobic and hydrophilic walls for various conditions shows that there is a
true slip length due to hydrophobicity. This length, of the order of several
tens of nanometers, is independent on electrolyte concentration and shear rate.
