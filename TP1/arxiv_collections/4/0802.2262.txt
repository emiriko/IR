We study the massless scalar, Dirac and electro-magnetic fields propagating
on a 4D-brane, which is embedded in higher dimensional Gauss-Bonnet space-time.
We calculate, in time-domain, the fundamental quasi-normal modes of a
spherically symmetric black hole for such fields. We observe also a universal
behavior, independent on a field and value of the Gauss-Bonnet parameter, at
asymptotically late time.
