We continue the program of constructing, within the Effective-One-Body (EOB)
approach, high-accuracy analytic waveforms describing the signal emitted by
inspiralling and coalescing black hole binaries. Here, we compare a recently
derived, resummed 3 PN-accurate EOB quadrupolar waveform to the results of a
numerical simulation of the inspiral and merger of an equal-mass black hole
binary. We find a remarkable agreement, both in phase and in amplitude, with a
maximal dephasing which can be reduced below $\pm 0.005$ gravitational-wave
(GW) cycles over 12 GW cycles corresponding to the end of the inspiral, the
plunge, the merger and the beginning of the ringdown. This level of agreement
is shown for two different values of the effective 4 PN parameter a_5, and for
corresponding, appropriately "flexed" values of the radiation-reaction
resummation parameter v_pole. In addition, our resummed EOB amplitude agrees to
better than the 1% level with the numerical-relativity one up to the late
inspiral. These results, together with other recent work on the
EOB-numerical-relativity comparison, confirm the ability of the EOB formalism
to faithfully capture the general relativistic waveforms.
