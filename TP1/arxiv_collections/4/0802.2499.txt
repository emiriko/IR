Azimuthal asymmetries in exclusive electroproduction of real photons are
measured for the first time with respect to transverse target polarisation,
providing new constraints on Generalized Parton Distributions. From the same
data set on a hydrogen target, new results for the beam-charge asymmetry are
also extracted with better precision than those previously reported. By
comparing model calculations with measured asymmetries attributed to the
interference between the deeply virtual Compton scattering and Bethe-Heitler
processes, a model-dependent constraint is obtained on the total angular
momenta carried by up and down quarks in the nucleon.
