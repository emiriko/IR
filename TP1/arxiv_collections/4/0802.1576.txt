We consider the issue of statistics for identical particles or fields in
kappa-deformed spaces, where the system admits a symmetry group G. We obtain
the twisted flip operator compatible with the action of the symmetry group,
which is relevant for describing particle statistics in presence of the
noncommutativity. It is shown that for a special class of realizations, the
twisted flip operator is independent of the ordering prescription.
