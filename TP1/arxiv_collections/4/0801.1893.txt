A qualitative representation of what is called 'microstates' is constructed
quite independently from the mathematical formalism of fundamental Quantum
Mechanics, by taking into accont exclusively the constraints imposed by (a) the
cognitive situation in which a human being places himself if he decides to
construct knowledge concerning microstates; (b) the general requirements of
human conceptualisation. The result, called infra quantum mechanics, offers a
semantic structure of reference that will permit to develop a unified coherent
treatment of all the interpretation problems raised by the formalism of
fundamental Quantum Mechanics.
