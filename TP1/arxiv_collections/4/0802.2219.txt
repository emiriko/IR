An electronic Mach Zehnder interferometer is used in the integer quantum hall
regime at filling factor 2, to study the dephasing of the interferences. This
is found to be induced by the electrical noise existing in the edge states
capacitively coupled to each others. Electrical shot noise created in one
channel leads to phase randomization in the other, which destroys the
interference pattern. These findings are extended to the dephasing induced by
thermal noise instead of shot noise: it explains the underlying mechanism
responsible for the finite temperature coherence time $\tau_\phi(T)$ of the
edge states at filling factor 2, measured in a recent experiment. Finally, we
present here a theory of the dephasing based on Gaussian noise, which is found
in excellent agreement with our experimental results.
