Polymers with both soluble and insoluble blocks typically self-assemble into
micelles, aggregates of a finite number of polymers where the soluble blocks
shield the insoluble ones from contact with the solvent. Upon increasing
concentration, these micelles often form gels that exhibit crystalline order in
many systems. In this paper, we present a study of both the dynamics and the
equilibrium properties of micellar crystals of triblock polymers using
molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that equilibration of single
micelle degrees of freedom and crystal formation occurs by polymer transfer
between micelles, a process that is described by transition state theory. Near
the disorder (or melting) transition, bcc lattices are favored for all
triblocks studied. Lattices with fcc ordering are also found, but only at lower
kinetic temperatures and for triblocks with short hydrophilic blocks. Our
results lead to a number of theoretical considerations and suggest a range of
implications to experimental systems with a particular emphasis on Pluronic
polymers.
