Labels and tags are accompanying us in almost each moment of our life and
everywhere we are going, in the form of electronic keys or money, or simply as
labels on products we are buying in shops and markets. The label diffusion,
rapidly increasing for logistic reasons in the actual global market, carries
huge amount of information but it is demanding security and anti-fraud systems.
The first crucial point, for the consumer and producer safety, is to ensure the
authenticity of the labelled products with systems against counterfeiting and
piracy. Recent anti-fraud techniques are based on a sophisticated use of
physical effects, from holograms till magnetic resonance or tunnel transitions
between atomic sublevels. In this paper we will discuss labels and anti-fraud
technologies as a new and very promising research field for applied physics.
