PHANTOM is a tree level Monte Carlo for six parton final states at
proton--proton, proton--antiproton and electron--positron collider at
O(alpha_ew^6) and O(alpha_ew^4*alpha_s^2) including possible interferences
between the two sets of diagrams. This comprehends all purely electroweak
contribution as well as all contributions with one virtual or two external
gluons. It can generate unweighted events for any set of processes and it is
interfaced to parton shower and hadronization packages via the last Les Houches
Accord protocol. It can be used to analyze the physics of boson boson
scattering, Higgs boson production in boson boson fusion, t-tbar and three
boson production.
