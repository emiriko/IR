Antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling in dilute magnetic semiconductor
superlattices could result in the realisation of large magnetoresistance
effects analogous to the giant magnetoresistance seen in metallic multilayer
structures. In this paper we use a mean-field theory of carrier induced
ferromagnetism to explore the multidimensional parameter space available in
(Ga,Mn)As based superlattice systems. Based on these investigations we examine
the feasibility of creating a superlattice that exhibits antiferromagnetic
coupling and suggest potentially viable recipes.
