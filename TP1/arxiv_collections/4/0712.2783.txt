We present a theoretical study on the orbital magnetism in multilayer
graphenes within the effective mass approximation. The Hamiltonian and thus
susceptibility can be decomposed into contributions from sub-systems equivalent
to monolayer or bilayer graphene. The monolayer-type subband exists only in odd
layers and exhibits a delta-function susceptibility at $E_F=0$. The
bilayer-type subband appearing in every layer number gives a singular structure
in the vicinity of $E_F=0$ due to the trigonal warping as well as a logarithmic
tail away from $E_F=0$. The integral of the susceptibility over energy is
approximately given only by the layer number.
