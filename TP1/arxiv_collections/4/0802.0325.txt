In the framework of the little Higgs models and the three-site Higgsless
model, we discuss the contributions of the new charged gauge boson $W'$ to the
process $eq\to\nu q'$ and the possibility of detecting $W'$ via this process in
future high energy linear $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider $(ILC)$ and $ep$ collider
$(THERA)$ experiments. Our numerical results show that the process $eq\to\nu
q'$ is rather sensitive to the coupling $W'ff'$ and one can use this process to
distinguish different new physics models in future $ILC$ and $THERA$
experiments.
