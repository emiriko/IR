This study gives the development of a new technique for analyzing images of
Cryogenic sprays, to estimate the drop-size distribution. It has a sound
mathematical basis, in the form of Mathematical Morphology, and we have tried
to build up a formulation for a granulometry, starting from the elementary
operations of Dilation and Erosion. An axiomatic foundation for granulometry
has also been discussed. We have taken an actual LN2 spray photograph for
analysis, to illustrate the use of Morphological operations, culminating in a
granulometry.
