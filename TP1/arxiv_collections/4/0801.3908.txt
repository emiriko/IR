This paper shows how authority files can be encoded for the Semantic Web with
the Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS). In particular the application
of SKOS for encoding the structure, management, and utilization of country
codes as defined in ISO 3166 is demonstrated. The proposed encoding gives a use
case for SKOS that includes features that have only been discussed little so
far, such as multiple notations, nested concept schemes, changes by versioning.
