The standard model of Mn doping in GaAs is subjected to a coherent potential
approximation (CPA) treatment. Transport coefficients are evaluated within the
linear response Kubo formalism. Both normal (NHE) and anomalous contributions
(AHE) to the Hall effect are examined. We use a simple model density of states
to describe the undoped valence band. The CPA bandstructure evolves into a spin
split band caused by the $p-d$ exchange scattering with Mn dopants. This gives
rise to a strong magnetoresistance, which decreases sharply with temperature.
The temperature ($T$) dependence of the resistance is due to spin disorder
scattering (increasing with $T$), CPA bandstructure renormalization and charged
impurity scattering (decreasing with $T$). The calculated transport
coefficients are discussed in relation to experiment, with a view of assessing
the overall trends and deciding whether the model describes the right physics.
This does indeed appear to be case, bearing in mind that the hopping limit
needs to be treated separately, as it cannot be described within the band CPA.
