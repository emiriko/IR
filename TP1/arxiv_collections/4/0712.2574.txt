In this talk, I discuss recent progress in the development of simulation
algorithms that do not rely on any concept of quantum theory but are
nevertheless capable of reproducing the averages computed from quantum theory
through an event-by-event simulation. The simulation approach is illustrated by
applications to single-photon Mach-Zehnder interferometer experiments and
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments with photons.
