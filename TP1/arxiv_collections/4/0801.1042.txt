Critical current density Jc in polycrystalline or granular superconducting
material is known to be hysteretic with applied field H due to the focusing of
field within the boundary between adjacent grains. This is of concern in the
so-called coated conductors wherein superconducting film is grown on a
granular, but textured surface of a metal substrate. While previous work has
mainly been on Jc determined using induced or magnetization currents, the
present work utilizes transport current via an applied potential in strip
geometry. It is observed that the effect is not as pronounced using transport
current, probably due to a large difference in criterion voltage between the
two types of measurements. However, when the films are narrowed by patterning
into 200-, 100-, or 80-micron, the hysteresis is clearly seen, because of the
forcing of percolation across higher-angle grain boundaries. This effect is
compared for films grown on ion-beam-assisted-deposited (IBAD) YSZ substrate
and those grown on rolling-assisted-biaxially-textures substrates (RABiTS)
which have grains that are about ten times larger. The hysteresis is more
pronounced for the latter, which is more likely to have a weak grain boundary
spanning the width of the microbridge. This is also of concern to applications
in which coated conductors will be striated in order to reduce of AC losses.
