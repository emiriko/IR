We discuss the neutrino mixing, using the texture 0 mass matrices, which work
very well for the quarks. The solar mixing angle is directly linked to the mass
ratio of the first two neutrinos. The neutrino masses are hierarchical, but the
mass ratios turn out to be much smaller than for quarks. The atmospheric mixing
angle is 38$^{\circ}$. The CP violation for leptons should be much smaller than
for quarks.
