The Cudaca system composed of isolated Cu2+ S=1/2 tetrahedra with
antiferromagnetic exchange should exhibit properties of a frustrated quantum
spin system. ab initio density functional theory calculations for electronic
structure and molecular dynamics computations suggest a complex interplay
between magnetic exchange, electron delocalization and molecular vibrations.
Yet, extensive experimental characterization of Cudaca by means of synchrotron
x-ray diffraction, magnetization, specific heat and inelastic neutron
scattering reveal that properties of the real material can be only partly
explained by proposed theoretical models as the low temperature properties seem
to be governed by a manifold of molecular configurations coexisting at high
temperatures.
