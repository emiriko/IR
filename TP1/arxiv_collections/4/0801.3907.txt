We present a study of triple Higgs boson (3H) production at the International
Linear Collider (ILC) within the general Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). We
compute the production cross-sections at the leading-order for the 3H final
states and find values up to sigma ~ 0.1 pb. This result represents a large
enhancement with respect to the corresponding MSSM cross-sections, which stay
typically at the level of sigma ~ 10^(-6) pb or less. Furthermore, since the 3H
cross-sections in the general 2HDM can be of the order of the double Higgs
production cross-sections, such 3H processes could be a competitive (if not the
dominant) mechanism for Higgs boson production at the ILC. In practice, these
3H events could be identified through the tagging of 6 heavy-quark jet final
states and, in this case, they would provide strong evidence of an extended
Higgs boson sector -- likely of non-supersymmetric nature.
