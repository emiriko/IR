We study the algebra of conformal endomorphisms $\Cend^{G,G}_n$ of a finitely
generated free module $M_n$ over the coordinate Hopf algebra $H$ of a linear
algebraic group $G$. It is shown that a conformal subalgebra of $\Cend_n$
acting irreducibly on $M_n$ generates an essential left ideal of
$\Cend^{G,G}_n$ if enriched with operators of multiplication on elements of
$H$. In particular, we describe such subalgebras for the case when $G$ is
finite.
