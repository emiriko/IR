We prove a limit theorem for quantum stochastic differential equations with
unbounded coefficients which extends the Trotter-Kato theorem for contraction
semigroups. From this theorem, general results on the convergence of
approximations and singular perturbations are obtained. The results are
illustrated in several examples of physical interest.
