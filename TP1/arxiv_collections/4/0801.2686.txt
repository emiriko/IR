We note that, though nonanticommutative deformations of Minkowski
supersymmetric theories do not respect the reality condition and seem to lead
to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians H, the latter belong to the class of
crypto-Hermitian (or quasi-Hermitian) Hamiltonians having attracted recently a
considerable attention.
  They can be made manifestly Hermitian via the similarity transformation H ->
e^R H e^{-R} with a properly chosen R. The deformed model enjoys the same
supersymmetry algebra as the undeformed one though it is difficult in some
cases to write explicit expressions for a half of supercharges. The deformed
SQM models make perfect sense. It is not clear whether it is also the case for
NAC Minkowski field theories -- the conventionally defined S--matrix is not
unitary there.
