Using a combination of theory and computer simulations, we study the
translocation of an RNA molecule, pulled through a solid-state nanopore by an
optical tweezer, as a method to determine its secondary structure. The
resolution with which the elements of the secondary structure can be determined
is limited by thermal fluctuations. We present a detailed study of these
thermal fluctuations, including the frequency spectrum, and show that these
rule out single-nucleotide resolution under the experimental conditions which
we simulated. Two possible ways to improve this resolution are strong
stretching of the RNA with a back-pulling voltage across the membrane, and
stiffening of the translocated part of the RNA by biochemical means.
