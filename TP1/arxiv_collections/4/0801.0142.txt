Starting from the model of continuous time random walk, we focus our interest
on random walks in which the probability distributions of the waiting times and
jumps have fat tails characterized by power laws with exponent between 0 and 1
for the waiting times, between 0 and 2 for the jumps. By stating the relevant
lemmata (of Tauber type) for the distribution functions we need not distinguish
between continuous and discrete space and time. We will see that, by a
well-scaled passage to the diffusion limit, generalized diffusion processes,
fractional in time as well as in space, are obtained. The corresponding
equation of evolution is a linear partial pseudo-differential equation with
fractional derivatives in time and in space, the orders being equal to the
above exponents.
  Such processes are well approximated and visualized by simulation via various
types of random walks. For their explicit solutions there are available
integral representations that allow to investigate their detailed structure.
