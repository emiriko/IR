We examine the dynamics of biological nanomotors within a simple model of a
rotor having three ion-binding sites. It is shown that in the presence of an
external dc electric field in the plane of the rotor, the loading of the ion
from the positive side of a membrane (rotor charging) provides a torque leading
to the motor rotation. We derive equations for the proton populations of the
sites and solve these equations numerically jointly with the Langevin-type
equation for the rotor angle. Using parameters for biological systems, we
demonstrate that the sequential loading and unloading of the sites lead to the
unidirectional rotation of the motor. The previously unexplained phenomenon of
fast direction-switching in the rotation of a bacterial flagellar motor can
also be understood within our model.
