The radial motion of photons emitted near the horizon of a black hole that
evaporates at a steady rate is examined. The space-time of the black hole is
generated using non-orthogonal coordinates. It is shown that some photons that
are initially drawn towards the singularity can escape falling into the
horizon. The behaviors of various outgoing and ingoing photons are clearly
demonstrated through the use of a Penrose diagram.
