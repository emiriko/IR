By injecting negative ions in superfluid 4He in the zero-temperature limit (T
< 0.5 K), we generated tangles of quantized vortex line with negligible
large-scale flow. For this quantum regime of superfluid turbulence, the vortex
line length L was found to decay at late time t as L proportional to t^{-1};
the prefactor being independent of the initial value of L. The corresponding
effective kinematic viscosity is 0.1 kappa, where kappa is the circulation
quantum. At T > 0.7 K, a jet of ions generates quasi-classical tangles
identical to those produced by mechanical means.
