The surface roughness of a recently exhumed strikeslip fault plane has been
measured by three independent 3D portable laser scanners. Digital elevation
models of several fault surface areas, from 1 m2 to 600 m2, have been measured
at a resolution ranging from 5 mm to 80 mm. Out of plane height fluctuations
are described by non-Gaussian distribution with exponential long range tails.
Statistical scaling analyses show that the striated fault surface exhibits
self-affine scaling invariance with a small but significant directional
morphological anisotropy that can be described by two scaling roughness
exponents, H1 = 0.7 in the direction of slip and H2 = 0.8 perpendicular to the
direction of slip.
