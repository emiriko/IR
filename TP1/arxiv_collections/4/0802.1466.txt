Variation of the geometrical and electronic properties of the gold materials
in different dimensions has been investigated by $ab$
  $initio$ method, taking into account the spin-orbit (SO) interaction. It is
found that SO effects in different dimensional Au materials depend greatly on
fundamental symmetry and dimensionality. For single walled gold nanotubes
(SWGNTs), SO interaction decreases significantly the conducting channel number
of achiral SWGNT (4, 0), and leads to spin splitting at Fermi level of chiral
SWGNT, indicating that quasi-1D SWGNT can be a good candidate for the
spin-electron devices. Furthermore, our results suggest that cage cluster might
be synthesizable experimentally by taking gold tube structure as parent
material.
