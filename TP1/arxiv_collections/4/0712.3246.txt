We discuss how to extract information about the cosmological constant from
the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, considered as an eigenvalue of a Sturm-Liouville
problem. A generalization to a f(R)theory is taken under examination. The
equation is approximated to one loop with the help of a variational approach
with Gaussian trial wave functionals. We use a zeta function regularization to
handle with divergences. A renormalization procedure is introduced to remove
the infinities together with a renormalization group equation.
