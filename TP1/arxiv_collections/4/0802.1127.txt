We report the fabrication and performance of the first C-band
directly-written monolithic waveguide-laser. The waveguide-laser device was
created in an Erbium and Ytterbium doped phosphate glass host and consisted of
an optical waveguide that included a distributed feedback Bragg grating
structure. The femtosecond laser direct-write technique was used to create both
the waveguide and the waveguide-Bragg grating simultaneously and in a single
processing step. The waveguide-laser was optically pumped at approximately 980
nm and lased at 1537nm with a bandwidth of less than 4 pm.
