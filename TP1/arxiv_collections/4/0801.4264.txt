The objective of this work is to provide a general introduction into the
symmetry analysis of the rachet effect using a simple, non-interacting
one-particle dynamics. Despite its simplicity, this model contains all the
basic aspects of classical and quantum ratchet dynamics, and may be used also
as a starting point of incorporating atom-atom interactions.
