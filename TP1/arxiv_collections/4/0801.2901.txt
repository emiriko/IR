This is a continuation of a previous study of quantum vertex algebras of
Zamolodchikov-Faddeev type. In this paper, we focus our attention on the
special case associated to diagonal unitary rational quantum Yang-Baxter
operators. We prove that the associated weak quantum vertex algebras, if not
zero, are irreducible quantum vertex algebras with a normal basis in a certain
sense.
