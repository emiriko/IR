This paper will deal with the modeling-problem of combining thermal
subsystems (e.g. a semiconductor module or package with a cooling radiator)
making use of reduced models. The subsystem models consist of a set of
Foster-type thermal equivalent circuits, which are only behavioral models. A
fast al-gorithm is presented for transforming the Foster-type circuits in
Cauer-circuits which have physical behavior and therefore allow for the
construction of the thermal model of the complete system. Then the set of
Cauer-circuits for the complete system is transformed back into Foster-circuits
to give a simple mathematical representation and applicability. The
transfor-mation algorithms are derived in concise form by use of recur-sive
relations. The method is exemplified by modeling and measurements on a single
chip IGBT package mounted on a closed water cooled radiator. The thermal
impedance of the complete system is constructed from the impedances of the
sub-systems, IGBT-package and radiator, and also the impedance of the package
can be inferred from the measured impedance of the complete system.
