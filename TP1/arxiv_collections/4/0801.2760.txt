We present a numerical study of the evolution dynamics of ``optical rogue
waves'', statistically-rare extreme red-shifted soliton pulses arising from
supercontinuum generation in photonic crystal fiber [D. R. Solli et al. Nature
Vol. 450, 1054-1058 (2007)]. Our specific aim is to use nonlinear Schrodinger
equation simulations to identify ways in which the rogue wave dynamics can be
actively controlled, and we demonstrate that rogue wave generation can be
enhanced by an order of magnitude through a small modulation across the input
pulse envelope and effectively suppressed through the use of a sliding
frequency filter.
