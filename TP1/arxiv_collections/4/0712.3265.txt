We present the fortran code SusyBSG version 1.1, which computes the branching
ratio for the decay B -> Xs gamma in the MSSM with Minimal Flavor Violation.
The computation takes into account all the available NLO contributions,
including the complete supersymmetric QCD corrections to the Wilson
coefficients of the magnetic and chromomagnetic operators.
