We compare the asymptotic grows of the number of rational points on modular
varieties of D-elliptic sheaves over finite fields to the grows of their Betti
numbers as the degree of the level tends to infinity. This is a generalization
to higher dimensions of a well-known result for modular curves. As a
consequence of the main result, we also produce a new asymptotically optimal
sequence of curves.
