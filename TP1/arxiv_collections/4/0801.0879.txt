The purpose of this note is to report predictions of the binding energy of
the $\Lambda$ hyperon in nuclear matter using the latest version of the Juelich
nucleon-nucleon meson-exchange potential. Results from a conventional Brueckner
calculation are compared with previously reported values. A calculation
including Dirac effects on the $\Lambda$ single-particle potential is also
presented. Issues encountered in Dirac calculations with nucleon-hyperon
potentials are discussed.
