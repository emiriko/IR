We suggest an extension of the standard concept of statistical ensembles.
Namely, we introduce a class of ensembles with extensive quantities fluctuating
according to an externally given distribution. As an example the influence of
energy fluctuations on multiplicity fluctuations in limited segments of
momentum space for a classical ultra-relativistic gas is considered.
