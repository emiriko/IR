The initial value problem for the conservation law $\partial_t
u+(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}u+\nabla \cdot f(u)=0$ is studied for $\alpha\in (1,2)$
and under natural polynomial growth conditions imposed on the nonlinearity. We
find the asymptotic expansion as $|x|\to \infty$ of solutions to this equation
corresponding to initial conditions, decaying sufficiently fast at infinity.
