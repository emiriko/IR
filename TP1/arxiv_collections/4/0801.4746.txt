In this paper we suggest a typed compositional seman-tics for nominal
compounds of the form [Adj Noun] that models adjectives as higher-order
polymorphic functions, and where types are assumed to represent concepts in an
ontology that reflects our commonsense view of the world and the way we talk
about it in or-dinary language. In addition to [Adj Noun] compounds our
proposal seems also to suggest a plausible explana-tion for well known
adjective ordering restrictions.
