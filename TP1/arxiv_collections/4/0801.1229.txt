We obtain a new expression for the partition function of the 8VSOS model with
domain wall boundary conditions, which we consider to be the natural extension
of the Izergin-Korepin formula for the six-vertex model. As applications, we
find dynamical (in the sense of the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation)
generalizations of the enumeration and 2-enumeration of alternating sign
matrices. The dynamical enumeration has a nice interpretation in terms of
three-colourings of the square lattice.
