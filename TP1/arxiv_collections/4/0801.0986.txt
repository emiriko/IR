In order to gain advanced understanding of the kinetics and dynamics of C, N,
and O reacting with a solid surface, it is necessary to consider the reaction
from the perspectives of bond formation, bond dissociation, bond relaxation,
bond vibration, and the associated charge redistribution and polarization and
the energetic response of the involved atoms and valence electrons. The
sp-orbital hybridization is found necessary for these concerned reactions
associated with strongly anisotropic bonding and valence identities and the
localized energy states of bonding pairs, nonbonding lone pairs, and the lone
pair induced antibonding dipoles, as well as the hydrogen bond like and C-H
bond like states, which could unify the observations using atomistic
microscopy, crystallography, electronic spectroscopy, vibronic spectroscopy,
and thermal desorption spectroscopy and provide guidelines for materials
design.
