A form of Jastrow factor is introduced for use in quantum Monte Carlo
simulations of finite and periodic systems. Test data are presented for atoms,
molecules, and solids, including both all-electron and pseudopotential atoms.
We demonstrate that our Jastrow factor is able to retrieve a large fraction of
the correlation energy.
