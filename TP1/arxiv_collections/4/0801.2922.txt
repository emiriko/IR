Selective and large polarization of current injected into semiconductor (SC)
is predicted in Ferromagnet (FM)/Quantum Dot (QD)/SC system by varying the gate
voltage above the Kondo temperature. In addition, spin-dependent Kondo effect
is also revealed below Kondo temperature. It is found that Kondo resonances for
up spin state is suppressed with increasing of the polarization P of the FM
lead. While the down one is enhanced. The Kondo peak for up spin is disappear
at P=1.
