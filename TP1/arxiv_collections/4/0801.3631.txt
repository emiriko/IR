We study the effect of Anderson localization on the expansion of a
Bose-Einstein condensate, released from a harmonic trap, in a 3D random
potential. We use scaling arguments and the self-consistent theory of
localization to show that the long-time behavior of the condensate density is
controlled by a single parameter equal to the ratio of the mobility edge and
the chemical potential of the condensate. We find that the two critical
exponents of the localization transition determine the evolution of the
condensate density in time and space.
