We study the effect of anomalous Wtb couplings on the B -> Xs gamma branching
ratio. The considered couplings are introduced as parts of gauge-invariant
dimension-six operators that are built out of the Standard Model fields only.
One-loop contributions from the charged-current vertices are assumed to be of
the same order as the tree-level flavour-changing neutral current ones. Bounds
on the corresponding Wilson coefficients are derived.
