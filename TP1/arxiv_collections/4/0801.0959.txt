Equilibrium aspects of molecular recognition of rigid biomolecules are
investigated using coarse-grained lattice models. The analysis is carried out
in two stages. First an ensemble of probe molecules is designed with respect to
the target biomolecule. The recognition ability of the probe ensemble is then
investigated by calculating the free energy of association. The influence of
cooperative and anti-cooperative effects accompanying the association of the
target and probe molecules is studied. Numerical findings are presented and
compared to analytical results which can be obtained in the limit of dominating
cooperativity and in the mean-field formulation of the models.
