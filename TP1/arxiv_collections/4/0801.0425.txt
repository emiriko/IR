The single largest background to future numubar to nuebar (numu to nue)
oscillation searches is neutral current pi0 production. MiniBooNE, which began
taking antineutrino data in January 2006, has the world's largest sample of
pi0's produced by antineutrinos in the 1 GeV energy range. These neutral pions
are primarily produced through the delta resonance but can also be created
through "coherent production." The latter process is the coherent sum of
glancing scatters of (anti)neutrinos off a neutron or proton, in which the
nucleus is kept intact but a pi0 is created. Current analysis of NC pi0
production in the MiniBooNE antineutrino data will be discussed.
