This review presents flavour related issues in the production and decays of
heavy states at LHC, both from the experimental side and from the theoretical
side. We review top quark physics and discuss flavour aspects of several
extensions of the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry, little Higgs model or
models with extra dimensions. This includes discovery aspects as well as
measurement of several properties of these heavy states. We also present public
available computational tools related to this topic.
