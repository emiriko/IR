We present numerical results for the spin and thermal conductivity of
one-dimensional (1D) quantum spin systems. We contrast the properties of
integrable models such as the spin-1/2 XXZ chain against nonintegrable ones
such as frustrated and dimerized chains. The thermal conductivity of the XXZ
chain is ballistic at finite temperatures, while in the nonintegrable models,
this quantity is argued to vanish. For the case of frustrated and dimerized
chains, we discuss the frequency dependence of the transport coefficients.
Finally, we give an overview over related theoretical work on intrinsic and
extrinsic scattering mechanisms of quasi-1D spin systems.
