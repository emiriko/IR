This paper describes the first measurement of b-quark fragmentation fractions
into bottom hadrons in Run II of the Tevatron Collider at Fermilab. The result
is based on a 360 pb-1 sample of data collected with the CDF II detector in
p-pbar collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV. Semileptonic decays of B0, B+, and B_s
mesons, as well as Lambda_b baryons, are reconstructed. For an effective bottom
hadron p_T threshold of 7 GeV/c, the fragmentation fractions are measured to be
f_u/f_d=1.054 +/- 0.018 (stat) +0.025-0.045(sys) +/- 0.058 (Br),
f_s/(f_u+f_d)=0.160 +/- 0.005 (stat) +0.011-0.010 (sys) +0.057-0.034 (Br), and
f_{Lambda_b}/(f_u+f_d)=0.281\pm0.012 (stat) +0.058-0.056 (sys) +0.128-0.086
(Br), where the uncertainty (Br) is due to uncertainties on measured branching
ratios. The value of f_s/(f_u+f_d) agrees within one standard deviation with
previous CDF measurements and the world average of this quantity, which is
dominated by LEP measurements. However, the ratio f_{Lambda_b}/(f_u+f_d) is
approximately twice the value previously measured at LEP. The approximately 2
sigma discrepancy is examined in terms of kinematic differences between the two
production environments.
