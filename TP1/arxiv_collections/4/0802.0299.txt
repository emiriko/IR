Motivated by recent experiments on ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$, we study the
inhomogeneous Knight shifts (local susceptibilities) of spin 1/2 Kagome
antiferromagnet in the presence of nonmagnetic impurities. Using high
temperature series expansion, we calculate the local susceptibility and its
histogram down to about T=0.4J. At low temperatures, we explore a Dirac spin
liquid proposal and calculate the local susceptibility in the mean field and
beyond mean field using Gutzwiller projection, finding the overall picture to
be consistent with the NMR experiments.
