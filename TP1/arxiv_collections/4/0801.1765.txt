We present release 1.3 of the ALPS (Algorithms and Libraries for Physics
Simulations) project, an international open source software project to develop
libraries and application programs for the simulation of strongly correlated
quantum lattice models such as quantum magnets, lattice bosons, and strongly
correlated fermion systems. Development is centered on common XML and binary
data formats, on libraries to simplify and speed up code development, and on
full-featured simulation programs. The programs enable non-experts to start
carrying out numerical simulations by providing basic implementations of the
important algorithms for quantum lattice models: classical and quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC) using non-local updates, extended ensemble simulations, exact and
full diagonalization (ED), as well as the density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG). Changes in the new release include a DMRG program for interacting
models, support for translation symmetries in the diagonalization programs, the
ability to define custom measurement operators, and support for inhomogeneous
systems, such as lattice models with traps. The software is available from our
web server at http://alps.comp-phys.org/ .
