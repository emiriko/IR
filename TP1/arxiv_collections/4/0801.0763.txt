The volume dependence of the ground-state energy of n identical bosons with
short-range interactions in a periodic spatial volume with sides of length L is
calculated at order L^{-7} in the large volume expansion. This result will
enable a refined determination of the pi^+ pi^+ pi^+ interaction from lattice
QCD calculations.
