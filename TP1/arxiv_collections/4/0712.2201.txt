This paper introduces noncommutative analogs of monomial symmetric functions
and fundamental noncommutative symmetric functions. The expansion of ribbon
Schur functions in both of these basis is nonnegative. With these functions at
hand, one can derive a noncommutative Cauchy identity as well as study a
noncommutative scalar product implied by Cauchy identity. This scalar product
seems be the noncommutative analog of Hall scalar product in the commutative
theory.
