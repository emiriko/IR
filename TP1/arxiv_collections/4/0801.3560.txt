A simple trading model based on pair pattern strategy space with holding
periods is proposed. Power-law behaviors are observed for the return variance
$\sigma^2$, the price impact $H$ and the predictability $K$ for both models
with linear and square root impact functions. The sum of the traders' wealth
displays a positive value for the model with square root price impact function,
and a qualitative explanation is given based on the observation of the
conditional excess demand $<A|u>$. An evolutionary trading model is further
proposed, and the elimination mechanism effectively changes the behavior of the
traders highly performed in the model without evolution. The trading model with
other types of traders, e.g., traders with the MG's strategies and producers,
are also carefully studied.
