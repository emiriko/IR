The kinetic energy distribution as a function of mass of final fragments (m)
from low energy fission of $^{234}U$, measured with the Lohengrin spectrometer
by Belhafaf et al. presents a peak around m=108 and another around m = 122. The
authors attribute the first peak to the evaporation of a large number of
neutrons around the corresponding mass number; and the second peak to the
distribution of the primary fragment kinetic energy. Nevertheless, the
theoretical calculations related to primary distribution made by Faust et al.
do not result in a peak around m = 122. In order to clarify this apparent
controversy, we have made a numerical experiment in which the masses and the
kinetic energy of final fragments are calculated, assuming an initial
distribution of the kinetic energy without peaks on the standard deviation as
function of fragment mass. As a result we obtain a pronounced peak on the
standard deviation of the kinetic energy distribution around m = 109, a
depletion from m = 121 to m = 129, and an small peak around m = 122, which is
not as big as the measured by Belhafaf et al. Our simulation also reproduces
the experimental results on the yield of the final mass, the average number of
emitted neutrons as a function of the provisional mass (calculated from the
values of the final kinetic energy of the complementary fragments) and the
average value of fragment kinetic energy as a function of the final mass.
