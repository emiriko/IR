In this manuscript we analyse the behaviour of the probability density
function of the sum of $N$ deterministic variables generated from the triangle
map of Casati-Prosen. For the case in which the map is both ergodic and mixing
the resulting probability density function quickly concurs with the Normal
distribution. When these properties are modified the resulting probability
density functions are described by power-laws. Moreover, contrarily to what it
would be expected, as the number of added variables $N$ increases the distance
to Gaussian distribution increases. This behaviour goes against standard
central limit theorem. By extrapolation of our finite size results we preview
that in the limit of $N$ going to infinity the distribution has the same
asymptotic decay as a Lorenztian (or a $q=2$-Gaussian).
