A microscopic framework of nuclear energy density functionals is reviewed,
which establishes a direct relation between low-energy QCD and nuclear
structure, synthesizing effective field theory methods and principles of
density functional theory. Guided by two closely related features of QCD in the
low-energy limit: a) in-medium changes of vacuum condensates, and b)
spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry; a relativistic energy density
functional is developed and applied in studies of ground-state properties of
spherical and deformed nuclei.
