Generalized Super-Cherenkov Radiations (SCR), as well as their SCR-signatures
are investigated. Two general SCR-coherence conditions are found as two natural
extremes of the same spontaneous particles decays in (dielectric, nuclear or
hadronic) media. The main results on the experimental test of the
super-coherence conditions, obtained by using the experimental data from BNL,
are presented. The interpretation of the observed anomalous Cherenkov rings as
experimental evidence for the HE-component of the SCR is discussed.
