We consider a superfluid state in a two-component gas of fermionic atoms with
equal densities and unequal masses in the BCS limit. We develop a perturbation
theory along the lines proposed by Gorkov and Melik-Barkhudarov and find that
for a large difference in the masses of heavy ($M$) and light ($m$) atoms one
has to take into account both the second-order and third-order contributions.
The result for the critical temperature and order parameter is then quite
different from the prediction of the simple BCS approach. Moreover, the small
parameter of the theory turns out to be $(p_{F}|a|)/\hbar)\sqrt{M/m}\ll1$,
where $p_{F}$ is the Fermi momentum, and $a$ the scattering length. Thus, for a
large mass ratio $M/m$ the conventional perturbation theory requires
significantly smaller Fermi momenta (densities) or scattering lengths than in
the case of $M\sim m$, where the small parameter is $(p_{F}|a|)/\hbar)\ll1$. We
show that 3-body scattering resonances appearing at a large mass ratio due to
the presence of 3-body bound Efimov states do not influence the result, which
in this sense becomes universal.
