The dynamics of homogeneous Robertson--Walker cosmological models with a
self-interacting scalar field source is examined here in full generality,
requiring only the scalar field potential to be bounded from below and
divergent when the field diverges. In this way we are able to give a unified
treatment of all the already studied cases - such as positive potentials which
exhibit asymptotically polynomial or exponential behaviors - together with its
extension to a much wider set of physically sensible potentials. Since the set
includes potentials with negative inferior bound, we are able to give, in
particular, the analysis of the asymptotically anti De Sitter states for such
cosmologies.
