We propose a search for the newly discovered tetraquark candidate Z(4430) in
photoproduction. Based on the Belle results we show that if Z(4430) is a
genuine resonance, its significantly large coupling to $\psi^\prime\pi$ will
cause it to stand out above the background in $\gamma p\to Z^+(4430) n\to
\psi^\prime \pi^+ n$. We consider the dependence of the cross section for the
quantum numbers ($J^{P}=1^{-}$, $1^{+}$ or $0^{-}$).
