We propose a simple physical model which describes dephasing in the
electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer at filling factor 2. This model explains
very recent experimental results, such as the unusual lobe-type structure in
the visibility of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations, phase rigidity, and the asymmetry
of the visibility as a function of transparencies of quantum point contacts.
According to our model, dephasing in the interferometer originates from strong
Coulomb interaction at the edge of two-dimensional electron gas. The long-range
character of the interaction leads to a separation of the spectrum of edge
excitations on slow and fast mode. These modes are excited by electron
tunneling and carry away the phase information. The new energy scale associated
with the slow mode determines the temperature dependence of the visibility and
the period of its oscillations as a function of voltage bias. Moreover, the
variation of the lobe structure from one experiment to another is explained by
specific charging effects, which are different in all experiments. We propose
to use a strongly asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer with one arm being
much shorter than the other for the spectroscopy of quantum Hall edge states.
