We propose a feasible scheme to realize a spin network via a coupled cavity
array with the appropriate arrangement of external multi-driving lasers. It is
demonstrated that the linear photon-like dispersion is achievable and this
property opens up the possibility of realizing the pre-engineered spin network
which is beneficial to quantum information processing.
