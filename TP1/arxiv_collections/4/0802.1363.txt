The Seiberg-Witten family of elliptic curves defines a Jacobian rational
elliptic surface $\Z$ over $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^1$. We show that for the
$\bar{\partial}$-operator along the fiber the logarithm of the regularized
determinant $-1/2 \log \det' (\bar\partial^* \bar\partial)$ satisfies the
anomaly equation of the one-loop topological string amplitude derived in
Kodaira-Spencer theory. We also show that not only the determinant line bundle
with the Quillen metric but also the $\bar{\partial}$-operator itself extends
across the nodal fibers of $\mathrm{Z}$. The extension introduces current
contributions to the curvature of the determinant line bundle at the points
where the fibration develops nodal fibers. The global anomaly of the
determinant line bundle then determines the signature of $\mathrm{Z}$ which
equals minus the number of hypermultiplets.
