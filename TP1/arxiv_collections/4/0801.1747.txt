In this paper we have considered the problem of parametric sound generation
in an acoustic resonator flled with a fluid, taking explicitely into account
the influence of the nonlinearly generated second harmonic. A simple model is
presented, and its stationary solutions obtained. The main feature of these
solutions is the appearance of bistable states of the fundamental field
resulting from the coupling to the second harmonic. An experimental setup was
designed to check the predictions of the theory. The results are consistent
with the predicted values for the mode amplitudes and parametric thresholds. At
higher driving values a self-modulation of the amplitudes is observed. We
identify this phenomenon with a secondary instability previously reported in
the frame of the theoretical model.
