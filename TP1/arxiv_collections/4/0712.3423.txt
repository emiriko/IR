We introduce a calculus for tuplices, which are expressions that generalize
matrices and vectors. Tuplices have an underlying data type for quantities that
are taken from a zero-totalized field. We start with the core tuplix calculus
CTC for entries and tests, which are combined using conjunctive composition. We
define a standard model and prove that CTC is relatively complete with respect
to it. The core calculus is extended with operators for choice, information
hiding, scalar multiplication, clearing and encapsulation. We provide two
examples of applications; one on incremental financial budgeting, and one on
modular financial budget design.
