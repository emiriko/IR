The method of functional integral bosonization is extended to examine the
transmission properties of semi-infinite nanowires. In particular, it is shown
that edge states will arise at the end point of the dimerized semi-infinite
spin-chain and by combining the method of image and the bosonization technique,
the system can be properly bosonized. Based on the bosonized action and a
renormalization group analysis, it is shown that unlike scattering due to
single bulk impurity in the nanowire, the scattering potential remains relevant
even for slightly attractive potential due to the interaction between the edge
state and its image. When the strength of potential goes beyond a critical
strength, the tip of the semi-infinite nanowire may become insulating.
