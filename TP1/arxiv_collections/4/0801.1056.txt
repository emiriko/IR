We present a new technique of VLSI chip-level thermal analysis. We extend a
newly developed method of solving two dimensional Laplace equations to thermal
analysis of four adjacent materials on a mother board. We implement our
technique in C and compare its performance to that of a commercial CAD tool.
Our experimental results show that our program runs 5.8 and 8.9 times faster
while keeping smaller residuals by 5 and 1 order of magnitude, respectively.
