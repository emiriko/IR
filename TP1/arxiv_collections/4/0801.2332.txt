We present powder inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the S=1
dimerized antiferromagnet Ba$_3$Mn$_2$O$_8$. The $T=1.4$ K magnetic spectrum
exhibits a spin-gap of $\Delta \approx 1.0$ meV and a dispersive spectrum with
a bandwidth of approximately 1.5 meV. Comparison to coupled dimer models
describe the dispersion and scattering intensity accurately and determine the
exchange constants in Ba$_3$Mn$_2$O$_8$. The wave vector dependent scattering
intensity confirms the proposed S=1 dimer bond. Temperature dependent
measurements of the magnetic excitations indicate the presence of both
singlet-triplet and thermally activated triplet-quintet excitations.
