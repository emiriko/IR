On the micro- and nanoscale, classical hydrodynamic boundary conditions such
as the no-slip condition no longer apply. Instead, the flow profiles exhibit
``slip`` at the surface, which is characterized by a finite slip length
(partial slip). We present a new, systematic way of implementing partial-slip
boundary conditions with arbitrary slip length in coarse-grained computer
simulations. The main idea is to represent the complex microscopic interface
structure by a spatially varying effective viscous force. An analytical
equation for the resulting slip length can be derived for planar and for curved
surfaces. The comparison with computer simulations of a DPD (dissipative
particle dynamics) fluid shows that this expression is valid from full-slip to
no-slip.
