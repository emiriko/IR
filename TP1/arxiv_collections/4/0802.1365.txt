A computationally simple way to accommodate 'basins' of trapping sites in
standard kinetic Monte Carlo simulations is presented. By assuming the system
is effectively equilibrated in the basin, the residence time (time spent in the
basin before escape) and the probabilities for transition to states outside the
basin may be calculated. This is demonstrated for point defect diffusion over a
periodic grid of sites containing a complex basin.
