Let f be a transcendental meromorphic function. Suppose that the finite part
of the postsingular set of f is bounded, that f has no recurrent critical
points or wandering domains, and that the degree of pre-poles of f is uniformly
bounded. Then we show that f supports no invariant line fields on its Julia
set.
  We prove this by generalizing two results about rational functions to the
transcendental setting: a theorem of Mane about the branching of iterated
preimages of disks, and a theorem of McMullen regarding absence of invariant
line fields for "measurably transitive" functions. Both our theorems extend
results previously obtained by Graczyk, Kotus and Swiatek.
