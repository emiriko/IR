In this present work we consider a falling body through the air under the
influence of gravity. In particular, we consider the experimental data based
upon the free fall of six men in the atmosphere of the earth. In order to
describe this process we employ a nonlocal dissipative force. We show that our
description, by using an exponential memory kernel, can fit the experimental
data as well as that of a local dissipative force.
