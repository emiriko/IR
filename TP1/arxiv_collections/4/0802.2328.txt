We report measurements of the cross-section and a complete set of
polarization transfer coefficients for the ${}^{3}{\rm He}(p,n)$ reaction at a
bombarding energy $T_p$ = 346 MeV and a reaction angle $\theta_{\rm lab}$ =
$0^{\circ}$.
  The data are compared with the corresponding free nucleon-nucleon values on
the basis of the predominance of quasi-elastic scattering processes.
  Significant discrepancies have been observed in the polarization transfer
$D_{LL}(0^{\circ})$, which are presumably the result of the three-proton $T$ =
3/2 resonance.
  The spin--parity of the resonance is estimated to be $1/2^-$, and the
distribution is consistent with previous results obtained for the same reaction
at $T_p$ = 48.8 MeV.
