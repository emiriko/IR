Quantum trajectory theory is the best mathematical set up to model continual
observations of a quantum system and feedback based on the observed output.
Inside this framework, we study how to enhance the squeezing of the
fluorescence light emitted by a two-level atom, stimulated by a coherent
monochromatic laser. In the presence of a Wiseman-Milburn feedback scheme,
based on the homodyne detection of a fraction of the emitted light, we analyze
the squeezing dependence on the various control parameters.
