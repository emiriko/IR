We report on dilepton measurements for central Pb on Au collisions at the top
CERN SPS energy with the upgraded CERES experiment. The dilepton mass spectrum
of 2000 data with improved mass resolution shows an enhancement over the
expectation from hadron decays that is well described by a model including a
strong broadening of the $\rho$ spectral function. The measured excess yield
excludes the dropping mass scenario.
  We also report on the $\phi$ meson measured simultaneously both in the
$K^+K^-$ and in the dilepton decay channel for the first time in high energy
heavy-ion collisions. An excellent agreement is found between the rapidity
densities and the shape of the measured tranverse momentum spectrum. The data
rule out a possible enhancement of the $\phi$ yield in the leptonic over
hadronic channel by a factor larger than 1.6 at 95% CL. CERES results are in
agreement with NA49 results.
