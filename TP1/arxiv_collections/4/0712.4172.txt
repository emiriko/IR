The impact of extreme events across the globe is extraordinary which
continues to handicap the advancement of the struggling developing societies
and threatens most of the industrialized countries in the globe. Various fields
of Information and Communication Technology have widely been used for efficient
disaster management; but only to a limited extent though, there is a tremendous
potential for increasing efficiency and effectiveness in coping with disasters
with the utilization of emerging wireless network technologies. Early warning,
response to the particular situation and proper recovery are among the main
focuses of an efficient disaster management system today. Considering these
aspects, in this paper we propose a framework for developing an efficient
Disaster Management Communications and Information System (DMCIS) which is
basically benefited by the exploitation of the emerging wireless network
technologies combined with other networking and data processing technologies.
