The orbital magnetization and its effects on the two-dimensional kagom\'{e}
lattice with spin anisotropies included in the general Hund's coupling region
have been theoretically studied. The results show that the strength of the
Hund's coupling, as well as the spin chirality, contributes to the orbital
magnetization $\mathcal{M}$. Upon varying both these parameters, it is found
that the two parts of $\mathcal{M}$, i.e., the conventional part
$\mathbf{M}_{c}$ and the Berry-phase correction part $\mathbf{M}_{\Omega}$,
oppose each other. The anomalous Nernst conductivity is also calculated and a
peak-valley structure as a function of the electron Fermi energy is obtained.
