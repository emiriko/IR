Surface plasmon-polaritons have recently attracted renewed interest in the
scientific community for their potential in sub-wavelength optics, light
generation and non-destructive sensing. Given that they cannot be directly
excited by freely propagating light due to their intrinsical binding to the
metal surface, the light-plasmon coupling efficiency becomes of crucial
importance for the success of any plasmonic device. Here we present a
comprehensive study on the modulation (enhancement or suppression) of such
coupling efficiency by means of one-dimensional surface corrugation. Our
approach is based on simple wave interference and enables us to make
quantitative predictions which have been experimentally confirmed at both the
near infra-red and telecom ranges.
