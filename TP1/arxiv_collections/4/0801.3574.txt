We theoretically investigate the joint photodetection probabilities of the
biexciton-exciton cascade in single semiconductor quantum dots and analytically
derive the density matrix and the Bell's inequalities of the entangled state.
Our model includes different mechanisms that may spoil or even destroy
entanglement such as dephasing, energy splitting of the relay excitonic states
and incoherent population exchange between these relay levels. We explicitly
relate the fidelity of entanglement to the dynamics of these processes and
derive a threshold for violation of Bell's inequalities. Applied to standard
InAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum dots, our model indicates that spontaneous
emission enhancement of the excitonic states by cavity effects increases the
fidelity of entanglement to a value allowing for violation of Bell's
inequalities.
