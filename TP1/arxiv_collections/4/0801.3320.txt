We study the behavior of cold atoms trapped in optical double well potentials
in presence of noise, either generated by an external environment or by the
trap itself. We show that quite in general the noise can induce a current
between the two wells even when tunneling between the two wells is highly
suppressed (Mott insulator phase). An engineered environment could provide a
test ground for the behavior of such a current.
