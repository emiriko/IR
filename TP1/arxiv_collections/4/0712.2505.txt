Let G be a cyclic group of order 3, 5 or 7, and X=E(n) be the relatively
minimal elliptic surface with rational base. In this paper, we prove that under
certain conditions on n, there exists a locally linear G-action on X which is
nonsmoothable with respect to infinitely many smooth structures on X. This
extends the main result of our previous paper.
