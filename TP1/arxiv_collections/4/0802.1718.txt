We present a systematic group space scan of discrete Abelian flavor
symmetries for lepton mass models that produce nearly tribimaximal lepton
mixing. In our models, small neutrino masses are generated by the type-I seesaw
mechanism. The lepton mass matrices emerge from higher-dimension operators via
the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism and are predicted as powers of a single
expansion parameter \epsilon that is of the order of the Cabibbo angle
\theta_C\simeq 0.2. We focus on solutions that can give close to tribimaximal
lepton mixing with a very small reactor angle \theta_{13}\approx 0 and find
several thousand explicit such models that provide an excellent fit to current
neutrino data. The models are rather general in the sense that large leptonic
mixings can come from the charged leptons and/or neutrinos. Moreover, in the
neutrino sector, both left- and right-handed neutrinos can mix maximally. We
also find a new relation \theta_{13}\lesssim\epsilon^3 for the reactor angle
and a new sum rule \theta_{23}\approx\pi/4+\epsilon/\sqrt{2} for the
atmospheric angle, allowing the models to be tested in future neutrino
oscillation experiments.
