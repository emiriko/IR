Probing the anomalous nanoscale intermixing using molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations in Pt/Ti bilayer we reveal the superdiffusive nature of interfacial
atomic transport. It is shown that the Pt atoms undergo anomalous atomic
transport across the anisotropic interface of Pt/Ti with suprisingly high rates
which can be characterized as L\'evy flights. L\'evy flight is not a unique
phenomenon in nature, however, no such events have been reported yet for bulk
interdiffusion. In particular, the low-energy (0.5 keV) ion-sputtering induced
transient enhanced intermixing has been studied by MD simulations. Ab initio
density functional calculations have been used to check and reparametrize the
employed heteronuclear interatomic potential. The L\'evy-intermixing behavior
explains the high diffusity tail in the concentration profile obtained by Auger
electron spectroscopy depth profiling (AES-DP) analysis in Pt/Ti bilayer
(reported in ref.: P. S\"ule, {\em et al.}, J. Appl. Phys., {\bf 101}, 043502
(2007)).
