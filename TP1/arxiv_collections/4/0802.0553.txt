The possible importance of oxide formation for the catalytic activity of
transition metals in heterogenous oxidation catalysis has evoked a lively
discussion over the recent years. On the more noble transition metals (like Pd,
Pt or Ag) the low stability of the common bulk oxides suggests primarily
sub-nanometer thin oxide films, so-called surface oxides, as potential
candidates that may be stabilized under gas phase conditions representative of
technological oxidation catalysis. We address this issue for the Pd(100) model
catalyst surface with first-principles kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations
that assess the stability of the well-characterized (sqrt{5} x sqrt{5})R27
surface oxide during steady-state CO oxidation. Our results show that at
ambient pressure conditions the surface oxide is stabilized at the surface up
to CO:O2 partial pressure ratios just around the catalytically most relevant
stoichiometric feeds (p(CO):p(O2) = 2:1). The precise value depends sensitively
on temperature, so that both local pressure and temperature fluctuations may
induce a continuous formation and decomposition of oxidic phases during
steady-state operation under ambient stoichiometric conditions.
