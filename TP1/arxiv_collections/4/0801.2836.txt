Casimir effect in the planar setting is described using the boundary state
formalism, for general partially reflecting boundaries. It is expressed in
terms of the low-energy degrees of freedom, which provides a large distance
expansion valid for general interacting field theories provided there is a
non-vanishing mass gap. The expansion is written in terms of the scattering
amplitudes, and needs no ultraviolet renormalization. We also discuss the case
when the quantum field has a nontrivial vacuum configuration.
