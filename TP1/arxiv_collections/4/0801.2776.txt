We prove some general results on the T-equivariant K-theory K_T(G/P) of the
flag variety G/P, where G is a semisimple complex algebraic group, P is a
parabolic subgroup and T$ is a maximal torus contained in P.
  In particular, we make a conjecture about a positivity phenomenon in K_T(G/P)
for the product of two basis elements written in terms of the basis of K_T(G/P)
given by the dual of the structure sheaf (of Schubert varieties) basis. (For
the full flag variety G/B, this dual basis is closely related to the basis
given by Kostant-Kumar.)
  This conjecture is parallel to (but different from) the conjecture of
Griffeth-Ram for the structure constants of the product in the structure sheaf
basis. We give explicit expressions for the product in the T-equivariant
K-theory of projective spaces in terms of these bases. In particular, we
establish our conjecture and the conjecture of Griffeth-Ram in this case.
