The optical response of the two-band superconductor MgB$_2$ has been studied
in the 0.7-4 THz range on films with very low impurity level. The effect of the
high-energy $\sigma$-gap is observed in the ratio $R_S/R_N$ between the normal
and superconducting state reflectance, while in a neutron irradiated film with
a slightly higher impurity level mainly the effect of the $\pi$-gap is evident
as reported in previous experiments. At terahertz frequencies, the
electrodynamic of MgB$_2$ can be well described by the two-band parallel
conductivity model and is dominated by the $\pi$-bands when the impurity level
is only slightly higher than that of an ultra-clean sample.
