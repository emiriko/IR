We consider a two-dimensional (d=2) kagom\'e lattice gas model with
attractive three-particle interactions around each triangular face of the
kagom\'e lattice. Exact solutions are obtained for multiparticle correlations
along the liquid and vapor branches of the coexistence curve and at
criticality. The correlation solutions are also determined along the
continuation of the curvilinear diameter of the coexistence region into the
disordered fluid region. The method generates a linear algebraic system of
correlation identities with coefficients dependent only upon the interaction
parameter. Using a priori knowledge of pertinent solutions for the density and
elementary triplet correlation, one finds a closed and linearly independent set
of correlation identities defined upon a spatially compact nine-site cluster of
the kagom\'e lattice. Resulting exact solution curves of the correlations are
plotted and discussed as functions of the temperature, and are compared with
corresponding results in a traditional kagom\'e lattice gas having
nearest-neighbor pair interactions. An example of application for the
multiparticle correlations is demonstrated in cavitation theory.
