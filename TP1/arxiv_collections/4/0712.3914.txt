The one dimensional anisotropic Kondo-necklace model has been studied by
several methods. It is shown that a mean field approach fails to gain the
correct phase diagram for the Ising type anisotropy. We then applied the spin
wave theory which is justified for the anisotropic case. We have derived the
phase diagram between the antiferromagnetic long range order and the Kondo
singlet phases. We have found that the exchange interaction (J) between the
itinerant spins and local ones enhances the quantum fluctuations around the
classical long range antiferromagnetic order and finally destroy the ordered
phase at the critical value, J_c. Moreover, our results show that the onset of
anisotropy in the XY term of the itinerant interactions develops the
antiferromagnetic order for J<J_c. This is in agreement with the qualitative
feature which we expect from the symmetry of the anisotropic XY interaction. We
have justified our results by the numerical Lanczos method where the structure
factor at the antiferromagnetic wave vector diverges as the size of system goes
to infinity.
