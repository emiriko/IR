The Penrose-Fife system for phase transitions is addressed. Dirichlet
boundary conditions for the temperature are assumed. Existence of global and
exponential attractors is proved. Differently from preceding contributions,
here the energy balance equation is both singular at 0 and degenerate at
infinity. For this reason, the dissipativity of the associated dynamical
process is not trivial and has to be proved rather carefully.
