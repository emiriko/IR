We consider a relativistic effective field theory of vector boson whose
vacuum exhibits spontaneous breaking of Lorentz invariance. We argue that a
simple model of this type, considered recently by Kraus and Tomboulis, is
obstructed from having a consistent ultraviolet completion according to the
diagnostic recently suggested by Adams, Arkani-Hamed, Dubovsky, Nicolis, and
Rattazzi.
