In this paper we show that the optimal exercise boundary / free boundary of
the American put option pricing problem for jump diffusions is continuously
differentiable (except at the maturity). This differentiability result has been
established by Yang et al. (European Journal of Applied Mathematics,
17(1):95-127, 2006) in the case where the condition $r\geq q+ \lambda
\int_{\R_+} (e^z-1) \nu(dz)$ is satisfied. We extend the result to the case
where the condition fails using a unified approach that treats both cases
simultaneously. We also show that the boundary is infinitely differentiable
under a regularity assumption on the jump distribution.
