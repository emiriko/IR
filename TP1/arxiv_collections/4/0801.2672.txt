We present a detailed ARPES investigation of the RTe3 family, which sets this
system as an ideal "textbook" example for the formation of a nesting driven
Charge Density Wave (CDW). This family indeed exhibits the full range of
phenomena that can be associated to CDW instabilities, from the opening of
large gaps on the best nested parts of Fermi Surface (FS) (up to 0.4eV), to the
existence of residual metallic pockets. ARPES is the best suited technique to
characterize these features, thanks to its unique ability to resolve the
electronic structure in k-space. An additional advantage of RTe3 is that the
band structure can be very accurately described by a simple 2D tight-binding
(TB) model, which allows one to understand and easily reproduce many
characteristics of the CDW. In this paper, we first establish the main features
of the electronic structure, by comparing our ARPES measurements with Linear
Muffin-Tin Orbital band calculations. We use this to define the validity and
limits of the TB model. We then present a complete description of the CDW
properties and, for the first time, of their strong evolution as a function of
R. Using simple models, we are able to reproduce perfectly the evolution of
gaps in k-space, the evolution of the CDW wave vector with R and the shape of
the residual metallic pockets. Finally, we give an estimation of the CDW
interaction parameters and find that the change in the electronic density of
states n(Ef), due to lattice expansion when different R ions are inserted, has
the correct order of magnitude to explain the evolution of the CDW properties.
