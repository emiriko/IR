Phase matching has been studied for the Grover algorithm as a way of
enhancing the efficiency of the quantum search. Recently Li and Li found that a
particular form of phase matching yields, with a single Grover operation, a
success probability greater than 25/27 for finding the equal-amplitude
superposition of marked states when the fraction of the marked states stored in
a database state is greater than 1/3. Although this single operation eliminates
the oscillations of the success probability that occur with multiple Grover
operations, the latter oscillations reappear with multiple iterations of Li and
Li's phase matching. In this paper we introduce a multi-phase matching subject
to a certain matching rule by which we can obtain a multiple Grover operation
that with only a few iterations yields a success probability that is almost
constant and unity over a wide range of the fraction of marked items. As an
example we show that a multi-phase operation with six iterations yields a
success probability between 99.8% and 100% for a fraction of marked states of
1/10 or larger.
