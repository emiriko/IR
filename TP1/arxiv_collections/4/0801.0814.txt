The decay $\tau\to \pi\pi\pi\nu$ is analysed using different methods to
account for the resonance structure, which is usually ascribed to the a1. One
scenario is based on the recently developed techniques to generate axial-vector
resonances dynamically, whereas in a second calculation the a1 is introduced as
an explicit resonance. We investigate the influence of different assumptions on
the result. In the molecule scenario the spectral function is described
surprisingly well by adjusting only one free parameter. This result can be
systematically improved by adding higher order corrections to the iterated
Weinberg-Tomozawa interaction. Treating the a1 as an explicit resonance on the
other hand leads to peculiar properties.
