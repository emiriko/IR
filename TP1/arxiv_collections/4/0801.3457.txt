The interaction of a quantized field with three-level atoms in $\Lambda$
configuration inside a two-mode cavity is analyzed in the small noise
approximation. The atoms are in a two-photon detuning with respect to the
carriers of the field. We calculate the stationary quadrature noise spectrum of
the field outside the cavity in the case where the input probe field is a
squeezed state and the input pump field is a coherent state. The mean value of
the field is unaltered in all the analysis: the atoms shows electromagnetically
induced transparency (EIT). The effect of the atoms' base level decoherence in
the cavity output field is also studied. It is found that the output field is
very sensitive to two-photon detuning.
