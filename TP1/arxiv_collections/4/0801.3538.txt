We have produced a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) on an atom chip using only
superconducting wires in a cryogenic environment. We observe the onset of
condensation for 10^4 atoms at a temperature of 100 nK. This result opens the
way for studies of atom losses and decoherence in a BEC interacting with a
superconducting surface. Studies of dipole-blockade with long-lived Rydberg
atoms in a small and dense atomic sample are underway.
