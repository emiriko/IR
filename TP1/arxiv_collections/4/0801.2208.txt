We study the localization properties of the eigenstates in the Kronig-Penney
model with weak compositional and structural disorder. The main result is an
expression for the localization length that is valid for any kind of self- and
inter-correlations of the two types of disorder. We show that the interplay
between compositional and structural disorder can result in anomalous
localization.
