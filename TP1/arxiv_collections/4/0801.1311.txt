A recent generalization of the Central Limit Theorem consistent with
nonextensive statistical mechanics has been recently achieved through a
generalized Fourier transform, noted $q$-Fourier transform. A representation
formula for the inverse $q$-Fourier transform is here obtained in the class of
functions $\mathcal{G}=\bigcup_{1\le q<3}\mathcal{G}_q,$ where
$\mathcal{G}_{q}=\{f = a e_{q}^{-\beta x2}, \, a>0, \, \beta>0 \}$. This
constitutes a first step towards a general representation of the inverse
$q$-Fourier operation, which would enable interesting physical and other
applications.
