We present NLO QCD results for W/Z gauge boson production with bottom quark
pairs at the Tevatron including full bottom-quark mass effects. We study the
impact of QCD corrections on both total cross-section and invariant mass
distribution of the bottom-quark pair. Including NLO QCD corrections greatly
reduces the dependence of the tree-level cross-section on the renormalization
and factorization scales. We also compare our calculation to a calculation that
considers massless bottom quarks and find that the bottom-quark mass effects
amount to about 8-10% of the total NLO QCD cross-section and can impact the
shape of the bottom-quark pair invariant mass distribution, in particular in
the low invariant mass region.
