Elastic and inelastic properties of weakly bound s- and p-wave molecules of
fermionic atoms that collide with a third atom are investigated. Analysis of
calculated collisional properties of s-wave dimers of fermions in different
spin states permit us to compare and highlight the physical mechanisms that
determine the stability of s-wave and p-wave molecules. In contrast to s-wave
molecules, the collisional properties of p-wave molecules are found to be
largely insensitive to variations of the p-wave scattering length and that
these collisions will usually result in short molecular lifetimes. We also
discuss the importance of this result for both theories and experiments
involving degenerate Fermi gases.
