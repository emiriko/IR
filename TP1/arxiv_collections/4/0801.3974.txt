Let A be the category of modules over a complex, finite-dimensional algebra.
We show that the space of stability conditions on A parametrises an
isomonodromic family of irregular connections on P^1 with values in the Hall
algebra of A. The residues of these connections are given by the holomorphic
generating function for counting invariants in A constructed by D. Joyce.
