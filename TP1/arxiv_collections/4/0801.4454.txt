We study the sudden expansion of strongly correlated fermions in a
one-dimensional lattice, utilizing the time-dependent density-matrix
renormalization group method. Our focus is on the behavior of experimental
observables such as the density, the momentum distribution function, and the
density and spin structure factors. As our main result, we show that
correlations in the transient regime can be accurately described by equilibrium
reference systems. In addition, we find that the expansion from a Mott
insulator produces distinctive peaks in the momentum distribution function at
|k| ~ pi/2, accompanied by the onset of power-law correlations.
