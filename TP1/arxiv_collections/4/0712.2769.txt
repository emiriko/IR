The Einstein-Friedmann Universe as whole quantum object can be treated as
bosonic string mass groundstate, called a tachyon, having negative mass square
and a speed more than the speed of light. I present a brief review of results
obtained from this point of view called Many-Particle Quantum Gravity approach
- the monodromy problem in the Fock space, thermodynamics of the Universe, and
the extremal tachyon mass model.
