Single layers of carbon dubbed "graphenes", from which graphite is built,
have attracted broad interest in the scientific community because of recent
exciting experimental results. Graphene is interesting from a fundamental
research perspective, as well as for potential technological applications.
Here, we provide a brief overview of recent developments in this field,
focusing especially on the electronic properties of graphite. Experimental
evidence indicates that high-quality graphite is a multi-layer system with
nearly decoupled 2D graphene planes. Based on experimental observations, we
anticipate that thin graphite samples and not single layers will be the most
promising candidates for graphene-based electronics.
