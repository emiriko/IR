We define an almost--cosymplectic--contact structure which generalizes
cosymplectic and contact structures of an odd dimensional manifold.
Analogously, we define an almost--coPoisson--Jacobi structure which generalizes
a Jacobi structure. Moreover, we study relations between these structures and
analyse the associated algebras of functions. As examples of the above
structures, we present geometrical dynamical structures of the phase space of a
general relativistic particle, regarded as the 1st jet space of motions in a
spacetime. We describe geometric conditions by which a metric and a connection
of the phase space yield cosymplectic and dual coPoisson structures, in case of
a spacetime with absolute time (a Galilei spacetime), or
almost--cosymplectic--contact and dual almost--coPoisson--Jacobi structures, in
case of a spacetime without absolute time (an Einstein spacetime).
