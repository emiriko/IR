In this talk I review three fatal flaws of the DGP braneworld model, which
has been put forward as a possible model for late time acceleration without a
cosmological constant: Ghosts, Cosmological Crashes, and Instability of the 5D
vacuum. The talk is based on work in collaboration with Charmousis, Kaloper,
Myers and Padilla.
