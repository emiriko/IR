Let G be a semi-simple non-compact Lie group with unitary lowest/highest
weight representations. We consider explicitly the relation between three types
of representations of G: positive energy (unitary lowest
weight)representations, (holomorphic) discrete series representations and
non-unitary finite-dimensional irreps. We consider mainly the conformal groups
SO(n,2) treating in full detail the cases n=1,3,4.
