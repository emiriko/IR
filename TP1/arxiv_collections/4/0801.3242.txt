Various parameters of a trapped collection of cold and ultracold atoms can be
determined non--destructively by measuring the phase shift of an off--resonant
probe beam, caused by the state dependent index of refraction of the atoms. The
dispersive light--atom interaction, however, gives rise to a differential light
shift (AC Stark shift) between the atomic states which, for a nonuniform probe
intensity distribution, causes an inhomogeneous dephasing between the atoms. In
this paper, we investigate the effects of this inhomogeneous light shift in
non--destructive measurement schemes. We interpret our experimental data on
dispersively probed Rabi oscillations and Ramsey fringes in terms of a simple
light shift model which is shown to describe the observed behavior well.
Furthermore, we show that by using spin echo techniques, the inhomogeneous
phase shift distribution between the two clock levels can be reversed.
