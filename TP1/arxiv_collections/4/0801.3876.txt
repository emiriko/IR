We propose and study a local map capable of describing the full variety of
dynamical states, ranging from regular to chaotic, obtained when a nematic
liquid crystal is subjected to a steady shear flow. The map is formulated in
terms of a quaternion parametrization of rotations of the local frame described
by the axes of the nematic director, subdirector and the joint normal to these,
with two additional scalars describing the strength of ordering. Our model
yields kayaking, wagging, tumbling, aligned and coexistence states, in
agreement with previous formulations based on coupled ordinary differential
equations. Such a map can serve as a building block for the construction of
lattice models of the complex spatio-temporal states predicted for sheared
nematics.
