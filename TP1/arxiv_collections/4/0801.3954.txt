The stability of multi-electron bubbles in liquid helium is investigated
theoretically. We find that multi-electron bubbles are unstable against fission
whenever the pressure is positive. It is shown that for moving bubbles the
Bernoulli effect can result in a range of pressures over which the bubbles are
stable.
