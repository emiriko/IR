We briefly discuss the implications of recent AUGER results for patterns of
Lorentz symmetry violation (LSV), assuming that the existence of the
Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff is definitely confirmed. The mass composition of
the highest-energy cosmic-ray spectrum is a crucial issue. In any case, the new
data allow in principle to exclude a significant range of LSV models but leave
open several important possibilities : a weaker Lorentz breaking, a fundamental
scale beyond the Planck scale, scenarios with threshold effects... It may even
happen that spontaneous decays due to LSV fake the GZK cutoff. Space
experiments appear to be needed to further test special relativity. We also
comment on the consequences of AUGER data for superbradyons. If such particles
are present in the Universe, they may provide new forms of dark matter and dark
energy.
