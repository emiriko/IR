We show that the long distance charge density oscillations in a metal induced
by a weakly coupled spin-1/2 magnetic impurity exhibiting the Kondo effect are
given, at zero temperature, by a universal function F(r/xi_K) where r is the
distance from the impurity and xi_K, the Kondo screening cloud size =v_F/T_K,
where v_F is the Fermi velocity and T_K is the Kondo temperature. F is given by
a Fourier-like transform of the T-matrix. Analytic expressions for F(r/xi_K)
are derived in both limits r much less than xi_K and r much greater than xi_K
and F is calculated for all r/xi_K using numerical methods.
