We investigate the decay of particles with the quantum numbers of the gluino.
Besides SUSY, such particles may be present in models where the Higgs and top
are composite. We find that such 'composite' gluinos have decay signatures
similar to those of gluinos in 'more minimal' SUSY type models. Though it is in
principle possible to distinguish the two scenarios, we find that it will be a
challenging task at the LHC. This puts into question the common lore that a
gluino is an obvious 'smoking-gun' signature of SUSY.
